At yesterday's meeting of the Czech-Moravian Chamber of  Trade  Unions (CMKOS), labor representatives decided that they would  not sign the proposal for the General Agreement, calling it a  basically political declaration which did not guarantee the  fulfillment of unions' demands.    The General Agreement concerns work conditions and  relationships, wage issues, business conditions, employment, and  social policy, and is the basic instrument for maintaining  social peace.    The trade unions disagree with the cessation of unions'  presence in public service, demand regulation of higher  collective agreements, reject wage regulation (in force since  January 1993), and demand that a way be found for handing over  the tripartite positions to the parliament.    The ministers refused the union representatives' attitude as  "being of the sort which tries to force the government to solve  several things which do not relate to the General Agreement at  all," Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said.    "The nature of the possible union organizations in state  institutions must be rather different," Kocarnik said on the  presence of unions in public service.    "We categorically disagree with union representatives on  wage  regulation," said Kocarnik, adding that in his view the existing  wage regulation did not prevent the prosperous enterprises from  increasing wages.</p>

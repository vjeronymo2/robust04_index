			<p>Language: <F P=105>Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video from the "Special News </F> Program on the Second Session of the Eighth NPC": "Report on the  Implementation of the State Budget for 1993 and the Draft State  Budget for 1994" -- identified by caption -- delivered by  Finance Minister Liu Zhongli to the second session of the Eighth  National People's Congress (NPC) on 11 March]    [Text] Liu Zhongli's report is divided into three parts:  1. The Implementation of the State Budget for 1993; 2. The Draft  State Budget for 1994; and 3. Deepen the Fiscal and Taxation  Reform, Relentlessly Increase Revenues and Cut Back  Expenditures, and Strive to Fulfill the 1994 State Budget.  <H5>  1. The Implementation of the State Budget for 1993 </H5>   Total state revenues in 1993 came to 511.482 billion yuan --  including 69.384 billion yuan income received from domestic and  foreign debts -- covering 113.1 percent of the budget, a 23.2  percent increase over the previous year. Total state  expenditures amounted to 531.982 billion yuan -- including  33.735 billion yuan spent to pay for the principle and interest  of domestic and foreign debts -- equaled 112.5 percent of the  budget, a 21.2 percent increase over the 1992 figure. This  resulted in a deficit of 20.5 billion yuan, which was not in  excess of the budgeted figure.    Based on the double-entry system, revenues in the regular  budget totalled 407.391 billion yuan, or 119.3 percent of the  budgeted figure; and construction budget revenues -- not  including income from domestic and foreign debts -- totaled  107.264 billion yuan, or 122.5 percent of the budgeted figure.    The implementation of the 1993 state budget. Both revenues  and expenditures exceeded the budgeted figures by a fairly large  margin. According to our preliminary analysis, the  overfulfillment of revenues by a large margin was mainly due to  three factors: First, the national economy's sustained, rapid  growth caused an increase in revenues accordingly. The rapid  growth of the national economy and the commodity's circulation  expansion brought about the overfulfillment of revenues of main  tax categories closely related to economic growth. Revenues  from the product tax, value-added tax, and business tax alone  were 49.5 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Second,  measures to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and  control yielded positive results and led to a marked drop in  revenue losses. According to State General Administration of  Taxation statistics, efforts to screen tax reductions and  exemptions and to collect tax payments in arrears for the  previous years brought about a 30 billion yuan increase. Third,  in 1994, the central authorities decided to implement the fiscal  tax assignment system, under which the central government will  reimburse local governments a certain amount of tax revenues  based on their 1993 figures. This new system aroused the local  governments' enthusiasm for revenue collection, and they took a  number of measures to strictly collect taxes, manage revenues,  and prevent tax evasion. As a result, revenues increased by a  large margin in the fourth quarter. However, some local  governments, to inflate the base figure for the central  government's reimbursement, resorted to illegitimate means and  fraud by collecting taxes before the due date. We have urged  local governments to examine and correct themselves, and we will  organize forces to verify and handle cases in accordance with  the State Council's requirements.    As far as increased expenditures were concerned,  expenditures  related to economic growth increased by a bigger margin.  Expenditures needed for the development of various undertakings  also increased by a larger margin. Of these increases, expenses  on cultural, educational, science, and health undertakings were  10.816 billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Expenses on  education alone were 6.463 billion yuan more than the budgeted  figure. Expenses on urban maintenance and construction was 3.86  billion yuan more than the budgeted figure. Spending for wage  adjustment of workers and staff of administrative institutions  and units was budgeted at 4 billion yuan. In the course of  implementation, however, because the margin of wage adjustment  was higher than the originally estimated figure, in addition to  an increase of personnel and changes in jobs and grades  throughout the year, the actual spending was almost double the  budgeted figure. Generally speaking, the implementation of the  1993 budget was good.    Special mention should be made of the fact that although  treasury bond sales were sluggish for some time last year, party  committees and governments at all levels, as well as relevant  departments, attached great importance and lent enthusiastic  support to such sales. Financial departments at all levels also  devoted massive manpower to providing services aimed at  promoting sales, thereby ensuring completion of the task of  issuing treasury bonds. This was of vital importance to the  fulfillment of last year's budgetary tasks.  <H5>  II. The Draft State Budget for 1994 </H5>   The guiding principles for planning the state budget for  1994  are: Fully implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC National  Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee; ensuring smooth progress in financial, taxation, and  other major economic reforms; continuing to tighten and improve  macroeconomic regulation and control; actively building up  financial sources; paying attention to improving enterprises'  efficiency; ensuring that increases in financial revenue would  match economic development; upholding the principle of acting  within one's means; readjusting the revenue structure;  appropriately increasing input in such key sectors as  agriculture, education, science and technology, and  infrastructure; maintaining needed increases in funds for  national defense, public security, and judicial departments;  strictly controlling ordinary fixed assets investments and  nonproductive expenditures; and promoting sustained, rapid, and  healthy development in the national economy, as well as overall  social progress.    We have made initial plans for the 1994 budget in accordance  with the guiding principles for budgetary planning and the  changes in budget requirements. Excluding revenues from the  repayment of domestic and foreign debts, total state revenues  are set at 475.99 billion yuan, a 7.7 percent increase over the  previous year and calculated on similar terms. Excluding  expenses used to repay domestic and foreign debts, total state  expenditures are set at 542.914 billion yuan, a 15 percent  increase over the previous year and calculated on similar terms.  The difference between revenues and expenditures is 66.919  billion yuan [as heard]. An 7.7 percent increase over the  previous year is planned for financial revenues in 1994; the  percentage increase is not high. Calculated on comparable  terms, this year's financial revenues will only increase 14.4  percent over the previous year. The current revenue plan,  therefore, is positive because it is based on a full  consideration of factors leading to increased revenues, such as  rapid economic development and improved management.    The draft state budget compiled according to the dual budget  system follows:    Revenues in the regular budget total 448.911 billion yuan, a  9.9 percent increase over the previous year. Revenues in the  construction budget total 83.149 billion yuan, a decrease of  22.5 percent from the figure fulfilled in the previous year. In  the draft state budget for 1994, revenues in the central budget  are set at 332.91 billion yuan, a 3.8 percent increase over the  previous year.    The central budget compiled according to the dual budget  system follows:    Revenues in the regular budget total 325.923 billion yuan, a  6 percent increase over the previous year. Revenues in the  central construction budget total 22.243 billion yuan, a 44.3  percent decrease from the previous year.    To facilitate examination by fellow deputies, I would like  to  expound policy-related issues in compiling the draft state  budget:    The question of debts in 1994. Domestic and foreign debts  for 1994 are set at 129.245 billion yuan, a 39.361 billion yuan  increase. The total debt volume accounts for 3.8 percent of the  year's gross domestic product, a slight increase over the  previous year.    The question of promoting rural economic development in an  all-around way. Expenditures for aiding agricultural production  and for paying various agriculture-related operational charges  in this year's state budget total 37.8 billion yuan, a 17.4  percent increase over the actual expenses in the previous year.  Including other budgetary items used as agricultural expenses,  the state's planned financial input in agriculture totals 52.3  billion yuan, a 7 billion yuan increase over the previous year.    On the issue of further successfully running large and  medium-sized state enterprises. This year's reform of the  fiscal and taxation systems will focus on transforming  mechanisms to seek unity of the taxation system for all  enterprises. It will play a positive role in invigorating state  enterprises' stamina for development and competitiveness.  Meanwhile, our reform of the taxation system will scrap the  regulatory tax for state enterprises and exempt them from  payment of funds for construction of key energy and transport  projects and for state budget regulating funds, thereby  increasing their financial strength by over 14 billion yuan.    The issue of increasing investment in the focal points of  science, technology, and education. This year's budget for  culture, education, science, and public health expenses is more  than last year by 17 billion plus, or 18 percent.  <H3>  III. Deepen the Fiscal and Taxation Reform, Relentlessly  Increase Revenues and Cut Back Expenditures, and Strive to  Fulfill the 1994 State Budget </H3>   Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute the  overall situation for the work of the whole party and the whole  nation. Ensuring the smooth progress of reform of the fiscal  and taxation systems and fulfilling the state budget for 1994  are of crucial importance for the fiscal and taxation work to  subordinate themselves to and serve the overall situation. We  must successfully carry out the work in a down-to-earth manner  to ensure that the anticipated results are achieved from reform  of the fiscal and taxation systems. The main substance of this  year's fiscal and taxation reform include reforming the current  local fiscal contractual responsibility system to implement a  tax assignment system on the basis of a rational division of  power between central and local authorities, reforming the  taxation system to establish an indirect tax system based mainly  on the value-added tax, unifying enterprises' income tax and  personal income tax while reforming state enterprises' profits  distribution system, and improving and strengthening  macroeconomic regulation and control to promote sustained,  rapid, and healthy economic development. The central government  must bring the issuance of bonds under control in accordance  with the amount of debts approved by the state; local  governments must adhere to the principle -- keep expenditures  within the limits of income and maintain a balance between  revenue and expenditure -- in making its budget, and are not  allowed to make budgets that incur deficits. We must take  advantage of the favorable opportunity offered by fiscal and  taxation reform to improve revenues. We must improve the  methods for the issuance of state treasury bonds to ensure  fulfillment of the issuance tasks. As the amount of state  treasury bonds to be issued this year is very large, it will  have a direct bearing on the results of fiscal and taxation  reform and on balance between revenue and expenditure.  Financial departments at all levels must closely coordinate with  the bank to ensure that priority is given to the issuance of  state treasury bonds under the centralized leadership of local  party committees and governments. Financial and banking  departments at all levels must accumulate experiences, actively  explore methods for the issuance of state treasury bonds under  the conditions of a market economy, bring the total amount of  expenditures under control, and guarantee the expenditures for  key projects during the issuance of state treasury bonds. When  making arrangements for financial expenditures, they must adhere  to the principle of doing what one is capable of, ensure  adequate funds for key projects, and curb expenditures for  ordinary ones. This year, in addition to continuing to increase  input into agriculture, education, and science and technology  sectors and into infrastructure projects, in addition to  guaranteeing the necessary increase in outlays for national  defense, judicial, procuratorial, and public security  departments, we must give priority to the expenditures for  payment of wages and for state grain reserves. It is strictly  forbidden to transfer wages for staff and workers to carry out  new projects. Construction of projects arranged with financial  funds by areas that delay payment of wages to staff and workers  shall be resolutely postponed or stopped. Institutions that  delay payment of wages to staff and workers are not permitted to  purchase small cars or other expensive, luxurious consumer  goods. Financial departments at all levels must attach a high  degree of importance to the issue.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Decline at Hambro Insurance Hambro Insurance Services Group yesterday blamed low levels of insurance claims for the continued poor performance of its loss adjusting subsidiary and a decline in group profits. Mr Nicholas Page, managing director, said: 'The volume of claims has declined and I am hoping that it has bottomed out. Pressure on volumes translates into pressure on fees, particularly in the UK.' The shares closed down 9p at 105p yesterday, 24 per cent lower than the placing price of 138p when the group was floated in June last year. It reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.05m (Pounds 3.25m) on turnover up 20 per cent to Pounds 40.2m (Pounds 33.4m) in the six months to September 30. Cunningham, the loss adjusting division, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 432,000 (Pounds 372,000 profits). Earnings per share fell to 2.94p (3.05p) but the interim dividend is again 1.85p. The company yesterday announced a joint venture with Morden &amp; Helwig of the US to create a worldwide loss adjusting and claims management network, called Cunningham Lindsey International.</p>

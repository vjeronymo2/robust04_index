			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN SHOW PROMOTERS FEAR STATE BULLETIN MAY SHOOT DOWN SALES  </P> <P> Angry California gun show promoters are fearful that their  multimillion-dollar-per-year industry will be crippled by a state attorney  general's office bulletin issued to law enforcement agencies last month that  declares it illegal in most cases to sell handguns at the weekend events. But  so far, the bulletin seems to have had little effect on the sale of such  weapons.  </P> <P> If the law, as interpreted by the attorney general, were strictly enforced it  would be a severe blow to the shows at which handgun sales make up a major part  of the business. But in the six weeks since the July 3 advisory was issued to  police chiefs and sheriffs throughout the state, handguns continued to be sold  at the shows, and apparently only one police agency has even warned gun dealers  that the law will be enforced in the future. Some local law enforcement  agencies were unaware of the bulletin and some appeared to be uncertain about  what is expected of them when queried by The Times.  </P> <P> The attorney general's office bulletin does not cite any new laws in  controlling handgun sales. Instead, it interprets several provisions in the  state Penal Code, some of which have gone unenforced at gun shows. One clause,  the attorney general said, prohibits state licensed handgun dealers from  conducting business at the events.  </P> <P> Currently, licensed as well as unlicensed vendors conduct handgun transactions  at the shows.  </P> <P> The bulletin also states that unlicensed handgun vendors must use a licensed  dealer to process the sale of a handgun -- which includes a criminal record  check -- unless the buyer is personally known to the vendor. It also points out  that vendors, licensed and unlicensed, must observe a 15-day waiting period  even when selling handguns to personal acquaintances.  </P> <P> If licensed dealers are excluded from the shows, the unlicensed vendors would  have no one to legally process handgun sales at the events.  </P> <P> Thus, enforcement of the law, as interpreted by the attorney general's office,  would prohibit virtually all handgun sales at the weekend events, leaving only  rifles and shotguns to be sold legally. The bulletin does not affect antique  weapons.  </P> <P> The purchase of a rifle or shotgun does not require a 15-day wait or a buyer's  criminal records check under state law, but a bill by Assemblyman Lloyd G.  Connelly (D-Sacramento) now under consideration in the Legislature would put  sales of such weapons under the same restrictions as handguns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Affect on Gun Shows  </P> <P> If passed, the law also would affect gun shows by allowing licensed gun dealers  to act as brokers for sales by unlicensed vendors, but only within the  jurisdiction in which they are licensed. In the meantime, gun show promoters  maintain that Democratic Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp is using the bulletin  as a tool in his campaign for governor. But an official in Van de Kamp's office  pointed out the bulletin was issued without any fanfare or even a press  release. The gun show operators insist that handgun vendors at the events are  breaking no laws and that licensed gun dealers are acting only as "agents," not  as dealers, making arrangements for sales but not actually delivering the  weapons at the shows.  </P> <P> And the shows will go on, vowed Richard DeChambeau, executive director of the  Gun Owners of California, a militantly pro-gun organization retained by the  promoters of the events to represent them in their opposition to the attorney  general's bulletin.  </P> <P> "They are going to conduct business as usual in a lawful manner," DeChambeau  said.  </P> <P> But even the Gun Owners of California's legal counsel, Kent DeChambeau --  Richard DeChambeau's father -- is not certain what is lawful when it comes to  selling handguns.  </P> <P> The provision in the law prohibiting licensed handgun dealers from conducting  business at gun shows appears clear enough:  </P> <P> "The business shall be carried on only in the building designated in the  license."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Act as 'Agents'  </P> <P> Kent DeChambeau insisted, however, that this restriction does not prevent  licensed dealers from going to gun shows as "agents" rather than dealers and  brokering sales for non-licensed vendors at gun shows, arranging for criminal  record checks and for the delivery of handguns after the required 15-day wait.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, DeChambeau at first said it would be unlawful for  unlicensed dealers to arrange for the sales of their own handguns by accepting  deposits and filling out application forms, but shortly afterward he changed  his mind, saying that a dealer somehow might be able to act as his own agent  without breaking the law.  </P> <P> DeChambeau does agree, however, that the law requires everyone, dealer and  non-dealer alike, to wait 15 days before delivering a handgun to a buyer.  </P> <P> "Are guys walking out with a handgun in their hand?" DeChambeau asked. "They're  not supposed to be. . . . "  </P> <P> Some law enforcement officials complain that handguns frequently are sold on  the spot, without a 15-day wait or a criminal records check, at the largely  unregulated gun shows, and a Times reporter earlier this year was able to buy  handguns cash and carry at gun shows all over the state. The law enforcement  officials contend that the shows provide a marketplace for stolen weapons and a  source of firearms for gun smugglers, drug dealers, gang members and other  criminals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Only One Agency Acts  </P> <P> Still, promoters say that only one police agency has taken any action  whatsoever in response to the attorney general's bulletin.  </P> <P> San Bernardino police distributed copies of the bulletin as a warning at a gun  show in that city on Aug. 6 but took no other action despite the open sale of  handguns at the event.  </P> <P> "The next gun show we'll probably be down there enforcing what the law says,"  said Capt. Larry Richards. "Nobody told them to quit operating (immediately).  We were putting them on notice."  </P> <P> In Pomona, where police are noted for closer than ordinary scrutiny of gun  shows, Chief Richard Tefank said the bulletin on handgun sales will be referred  to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office for guidance before the  next Pomona gun show in November.  </P> <P> In Fresno and Pasadena, where gun shows were held in mid and late July, police  said they were unaware of the bulletin.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, in a statement approved by  Undersheriff Robert Edmonds, declared that the attorney general's bulletin will  have no effect on its policing of gun shows.  </P> <P> "The information bulletin," said the statement issued by Deputy Richard  Dinsmoor, "will not change the Sheriff's Department's approach to law  enforcement at gun shows. The bulletin basically provides a summary of  California laws that are already in effect. . . . "  </P> <P> Dinsmoor said the department polices gun shows primarily by responding to  complaints.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department is responsible for law enforcement in Palmdale, where  a gun show was held last weekend, but deputies did not attend the event,  Dinsmoor said.  </P> <P> Not only were handguns on sale at the Palmdale show, but vendors were offering  the weapons cash-and-carry, no waiting, no records check.  </P></p>

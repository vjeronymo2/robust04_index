A member of the TEC Management Committee, Mr. Mac Maharaj,  said there was concern about the way in which Home Affair  Minister Danie Schutte had granted temporary licenses to 15  radio stations. He proposed that the TEC authorize the  management committee to create a substructure to advise it on a  process of short-listing applicants to the Independent  Broadcasting Authority.</p>

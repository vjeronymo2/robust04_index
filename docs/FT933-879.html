			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due SEARS, the retail group, which includes chains such as Olympus, Wallis, Miss Selfridge and Warehouse, as well as the Selfridges department store, is expected tomorrow to announce a return to interim profits of about Pounds 30m, after exceptional costs relating to the closure of ter Meulen Post, the Dutch mail order business. That compares with losses of Pounds 8.8m, although the figure included an exceptional charge of Pounds 32.5m for the reorganisation costs of British Shoe Corporation and a Pounds 5.3m loss on discontinued businesses. Analysts are looking for a strong recovery from British Shoe, but the performance of the rest of the group is expected to be patchy. Dorling Kindersley, the publisher of illustrated reference books floated last October, is expected to report annual profits of about Pounds 9.5m tomorrow. Analysts downgraded to that level in March when the group warned that trading conditions for children's books had become more competitive in the US. The City will want to hear how that is working out, plus any progress on multi-media, the futuristic combination of images, words and music on CD technology, which has made DK such a glamour stock. Redland, the construction materials group, reports its interim results on Thursday and is expected to lift pre-tax profits to about the Pounds 100m mark, against Pounds 88.5m last time. Behind the increase will lie reductions in the cost base and the German operations, where success is continuing apace. Forte, the hotels and restaurants group, also reports interim profits on Thursday, with expectations of pre-tax profits of between Pounds 42m and Pounds 45m. News of the progress of the London hotels will be closely noted. Further word is awaited on progress in selling the Harvester business. Worries about a rights issue continue, but the balance of City opinion is that it is unlikely.</p>

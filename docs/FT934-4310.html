			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / 'I can't believe I would sign all those benefits away': The controversy about personal pensions advice A primary school teacher who persuaded a life insurance company to buy her out of a personal pension and back into an employer's scheme at a cost of Pounds 21,000 is one of about 500,000 similar cases to be investigated by securities regulators. Through the efforts of her union, the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Mrs Jennifer Brown, 33, persuaded Abbey Life, the life insurance company which had persuaded her out of her scheme and into a personal pension, to buy her back in. Mrs Brown, from Dudley in the West Midlands, transferred out of the teachers' pension scheme four years ago. She said: 'When you sit down in the cold light of day and think about it, you wonder why you did it.' 'I can't believe I would sign all those benefits away without even investigating it,' she added. Securities regulators are preparing to investigate the cases of up to 500,000 people like Mrs Brown, who transferred out of employers' pension schemes into personal pension plans. They estimate that as much as Pounds 7bn has come out of employers' schemes into private plans. An initial review of files has shown that in too many cases agents failed to obtain enough information. Mrs Brown's action cost Abbey Life about Pounds 21,000, enough to repay both the transfer value of her contributions when she left the scheme with eight years of service and to compensate for the four years when she was a personal pension holder. Mr Peter Hood of the Teachers Superannuation Scheme said nearly 27,000 teachers had transferred to a personal pension or had opted not to join the scheme at the start of their employment. The teachers' scheme offers fully-indexed retirement benefits and death in service benefits of up to 18 months salary. Also, their employer contributes an additional 8 per cent of their salary for the 6 per cent of gross salary contributed by each teacher. Mr Hood said: 'We face the difficulty that the salesman is there and can influence the teacher. They can cast aspersions on our scheme.' By the time the scheme has tried to explain to members what they are giving up, they have already been talked into a personal pension by a seasoned sales agent. Because personal pensions are rarely bolstered by a contribution from the employer, offer no survivors' benefits in the event of death and do not offer indexed benefits on retirement it is difficult for them ever to be as attractive as an employer's scheme. But Mr Stewart Ritchie, director of pensions at Scottish Equitable, a leading private pensions provider, said individuals did not necessarily make decisions based on numbers. Nevertheless Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life insurance industry, last year issued guidance to sales agents telling them that there were almost no circumstances in which it was best advice to switch from an employer's scheme to a personal pension.</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Economics Notebook: The burden of Germany's reserve currency status During the post-war decades, as West Germany recovered its economic and financial strength, the Bundesbank withstood use of the D-Mark as a reserve currency. The monetary conservatives at the Bundesbank's helm believed an overhang of foreign-held D-Marks would be a dangerous burden, liable to depress the currency at times of political or economic tension. The aversion of people like Mr Otmar Emminger, Bundesbank president in 1977-79, was strengthened by observation of the painful dismantling of sterling's reserve currency role in the 1960s and 1970s. Then at the beginning of the 1980s Germans discovered that widespread reserve use of the D-Mark was impossible to prevent and could bring benefits. The D-Mark's international status grew during the 1980s in line with its fundamental strength. Now German economic performance is being dented by the effects of reunification. Germany's inflation rate is the sixth highest of Europe's 18 industrialised economies. Its current account has tipped into the red and the deficit is expected to persist, at least into 1994. As a result of the deterioration in parts of the German economy, some of the disadvantages of reserve currency status feared by Mr Emminger are coming to the fore. Nervousness about whether foreign D-Mark investors will maintain their holdings provide one reason why the D-Mark may be relatively weak in coming months. The D-Mark has fallen against the dollar since Governor Bill Clinton's US election victory in November. This reflected foreign exchanges' belief that Mr Clinton will preside over a US recovery. The D-Mark/dollar move repeats the pattern of the previous two US presidential elections (see chart). This time the effect could be more permanent. Much attention focused last week on the Bundesbank's cut in interest rates, when it lowered its money market rate by just 0.15 percentage points. The Bundesbank's decision to leave discount and Lombard rates unchanged was primarily due to concern about inflationary pressures caused by the German budget deficit. But the Bundesbank's caution may also reflect worries that faster credit easing would expose the D-Mark to greater risk of further decline against the dollar. Up to now, the D-Mark's international status has been a source of strength. According to the Bundesbank's figures for end-1991, official D-Mark assets amount to about DM230bn (Pounds 91bn), 18 per cent of world currency reserves. Foreigners' holdings of the German currency are well over DM1,000bn. Since unification in October 1990, the D-Mark's reserve currency status has proved a considerable benefit. Germany has claimed the traditional reserve currency privilege: it has paid its bills in its own currency, without repercussions on the exchange rate. At the end of last year, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, acknowledged the advantages of the D-Mark's international use. But he also made clear that, given the volume of D-Marks held abroad, Germany would face risks if foreigners ever feared that Germany was departing from sound money principles. The scale of these potential pitfalls is illustrated by Bundesbank figures for Germany's overall foreign assets and liabilities. Germany expanded its net foreign assets from DM373bn at end-1988 to a peak DM564bn in June 1991. The onset of current account deficits reduced the net asset position by DM54bn during the 12 months to June 1992. Overall, Germany's international financial position remains strong. But it will be undermined unless Germany reverses the swing to current account deficit. And this might make foreign D-Mark investors prone to sell their holdings. Mr Schlesinger has not forgotten the forebodings of Mr Emminger. In coming months, Mr Schlesinger will not make much explicit reference to the holders of the DM1,000bn worth of D-Mark assets abroad. But they will be at the forefront of his mind. And he will do his best to ensure they do not move back into the dollar.</p>

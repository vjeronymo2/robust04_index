			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Finance and Investment (15): Popularity of MBAs wavers - Business schools, are their courses worth it? One of the toughest puzzles facing a business school student is whether it is worth taking the course in the first place. The answer may well be no, many have suggested; unfortunately the skills to work that out may be acquired too late to shape the student's decision. The popularity of the MBA qualification soared in the US, UK and continental Europe in the second half of the 1980s. But in the past few years, prospective students and employers have increasingly questioned whether an MBA is worth acquiring. Schools report that growth in applications in the past three years has slowed sharply, or in some cases fallen, although the range of types of courses and starting dates prevents precise comparison of figures. The change in attitude has occurred partly because the theories of corporate strategy promoted by many of the schools, such as globalisation, have themselves come under scrutiny. At the same time, businesses have taken a closer look at whether it is worth their while hiring outside management consultants. Consultants have traditionally been among the keenest sponsors of students - paying the course fees of selected staff members - and among the keenest recruiters of business school graduates. European business schools now suggest that the increasing pressures on consultancy groups' margins have undermined their willingness to back students. But much of the criticism of the courses has been prompted by their cost. The classic two-year full-time MBA course in a US business school can easily run to Dollars 100,000, taking loss of salary into account. In an analysis of US courses published this summer, Professor Ronald Yeaple, from the US's University of Rochester business school, argues that unless students attended one of the top two dozen schools, the investment would probably not pay off. That is because recession has diminished the immediate returns on the investment, while increasing the risk of surrendering a salaried job. According to Roger McCormick of the UK's Association of MBAs (AMBA), 'salary enhancement for doing an MBA has fallen'. Instead of expecting to double their salaries on leaving business school, MBAs should think in terms of better long-term prospects for promotion, he says. In response to those concerns, many business schools have moved fast to offer a wider range of courses. In particular, they offer more courses which will allow someone to keep paid employment. According to Mr McCormick 'the image of the job-hopping MBA, if it ever was true, has subsided'. Precise UK figures are hard to establish, but AMBA reckons that in the 1993-4 academic year full-time MBAs make up a third of the 9,800 new places and part-time MBAs 31 per cent. The balance - 36 per cent - is made up by the increasingly popular 'distance learning', where students are sent books and other materials by the school, and send back their completed work. These courses, which can take up to seven years to complete, 'have assumed extraordinary prominence', AMBA says. At the same time as this evolution in the courses' structure, the range of subjects offered has broadened. To reflect the growing complexity of business life, schools have added more advanced lessons in corporate finance and accountancy, as well as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Topics such as leadership and communication skills, for example, have also become popular, as have ethics, environment and business ethics. That broadening, however, has given schools a new problem: how to maintain depth and academic rigour, while covering all the topics students expect to learn. The solution many have adopted is to allow students to specialise, picking their own portfolio of subjects. But employers sifting through job applications now fear that it may become harder to know what expertise is implied by the MBA qualification. However, the increased flexibility of courses has allowed a wider range of students to apply for MBAs, schools in many countries suggest. The heavy representation from financial services and management consultancy, which was marked in the 1980s, has diminished, many report. In the UK, interest from those sectors is concentrated in London and southern England. Increasingly, however, schools are receiving applications from the public services; many from the National Health Service and, occasionally, some from the police force. By broadening their appeal, and finding ways of reducing the cost to students of taking these courses, business schools may well have found a way of stemming the threats to their appeal. They may also persuade students that the qualification represents a good return on investment. But it is not just students who have become averse to risk; the recession, and unhappy experiences with acquisitions in the 1980s, have made many company executives cautious about expansion. The business schools may then also have to make changes to some of the theories of corporate strategy taught in their courses to sustain the long-term demand for their graduates' services.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Hunan Clarifies Case of Assault on </F> Christian"]    [Text] It was recently reported that a new Christian  follower named Zheng Musheng died after he was arrested, beaten,  and denied medical treatment by officers of the Public Security  Bureau in Hunan recently. This reporter interviewed officers  with the relevant department and learned that the report was  inconsistent with the facts and was totally fabricated.    Over the past few years, Zheng Musheng, a peasant from  Dongkou County, Hunan Province, has swindled people, stirred up  trouble among the masses, and seriously disturbed public order  by spreading rumors and fallacies such as that "an enormous  calamity will befall the world in 1999, so it is sensible to eat  as much as one can and to be idle without bothering about  construction." In addition, he treated patients in  superstitious ways and caused one person's death and several  people's conditions to worsen.    On 1 January he was detained by the local public security  organ according to the law. During the detention, he was beaten  and seriously injured by 13 prison inmates including Long  Shunsheng, Huang Mingyong, and others for his "refusal to listen  to their advice and to make the place clean." When the prison  guards found him wounded, he was immediately sent to a hospital,  but died after all rescue measures proved ineffectual. After  the public security organ fully ascertained that Long Shunsheng,  Huang Mingyong, and others had beaten Zheng Musheng to death, it  arrested the assailants according to law and made the proper  arrangements for Zheng's funeral. The relevant department has  also taken action against the person responsible for the prison  and reinforced its personnel.</p>

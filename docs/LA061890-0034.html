			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LEBANON;  </P> <P> ABU NIDAL FACTIONS BATTLE; 4 KILLED  </P> <P> Rival factions of the guerrilla group led by terrorist Abu Nidal battled with  machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades in southern Lebanon, killing at  least four people and wounding 15, police said. The outbreak was the bloodiest  between the two factions since a mutiny within Abu Nidal's Revolutionary  Council of Fatah three years ago. The new fighting erupted in the Rashidiyeh  refugee camp, south of Beirut, and continued until fighters loyal to Yasser  Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization  intervened.  </P></p>

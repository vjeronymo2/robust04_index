			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Motor insurance discounts boosted Direct Line, the tele-phone-based motor and home insurer, is raising the competitive pressure in the motor insurance industry by increasing the maximum no-claims discount it offers to the safest drivers, Bethan Hutton writes. Direct Line has until now given drivers with a five-year claim-free record a 65 per cent discount on standard rates. The industry norm is a 60 per cent to 65 per cent discount. Direct Line will now offer a 70 per cent discount to drivers aged over 50 who qualify for the existing maximum. Government figures show that drivers over 50 accounted for 35 per cent of the driving population in 1992, but were involved in less than 20 per cent of accidents. The change should benefit about a quarter of Direct Line's 1.6m customers, but the company's main aim is to raise its share of the 5.6m people who form the target market of over-50s with full no-claims bonuses. Competition for this sector is intense. Rival insurer Norwich Union said Direct Line's move was only a different approach to the same conditions which led Norwich to introduce a special policy for the over-50s.</p>

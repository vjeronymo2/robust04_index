			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Why Belfast-style precautions may be adopted in City: Richard Evans on a local authority's rapid response to the threat of bombs BANKERS and the business community have given a largely favourable response to a proposal by the Corporation of London - the local authority for the City - to bar non-essential traffic from the core of the City as an anti-terrorist measure. The plan, the most radical element in a security package now being drafted, is still at the blueprint stage and will be subject to public consultation later this month. If accepted, it could be in operation by the end of the year. Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy and resources committee, said yesterday that two large terrorist bombs in 14 months had not undermined the City as Europe's leading financial centre. But companies had to be reassured. 'Pedestrianisation would help security significantly in that it would restrict vehicle access to key areas. We take the threat of terrorism seriously, and we have a clear message from a group of foreign banks that if we did not act, the consequences could be severe,' Mr Cassidy said. Corporation officials led by Sir Francis McWilliams, the Lord Mayor, have held meetings with more than 400 City institutions and companies to discuss improved security. Most have supported a vehicle ban, although some have argued it would create too much disruption and would give too great a propaganda coup to the IRA. Mr Cassidy argued that, as more than 90 per cent of City workers commuted by train and walked to offices, there was a lot of support for a car ban, provided that public transport could be improved. Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the London Stock Exchange, has given pedestrianisation qualified backing, provided access for vehicles could be maintained for normal business purposes. The restrictions planned by the corporation are likely to apply only to a few hundred square yards at the heart of the City, covering the area around the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange, Mansion House and the NatWest Tower, although some bankers want them to cover the whole of the square mile. Access would be limited to buses, taxis and a few specially licensed vehicles, but temporary licences could be granted for anyone giving a good reason for driving through the City. Any vehicles without a licence would be stopped at one of about six check points. The corporation began its detailed examination of security after the Bishopsgate bomb in April, which was placed in an abandoned tipper truck. A year ago 100lbs of explosives packed into a car wrecked the Baltic Exchange. Both bombs caused millions of pounds of damage. Anti-terrorist measures already in hand are the removal of all litter bins in the City until they can be made bombproof, the recruitment of 57 extra police to step up patrols, and an increase in the number of police surveillance cameras. However, it is the prospect of a City traffic ban that is certain to create the most controversy, particularly in surrounding areas that may have to cope with increased traffic congestion. The Association of London Authorities said it was concerned at the impact a traffic ban in the City would have on other parts of London, particularly neighbouring boroughs such as Camden, Islington, Tower Hamlets and Hackney. 'It needs to be done on a London-wide basis and after consultation,' an ALA official said. Mr Cassidy said there would be widespread consultation before any scheme was introduced, and details were being fed into computers over the next week to see what the traffic impact might be on surrounding areas. Tighter security measures of the type being considered by the corporation have been applied for years in Belfast, but in the past year three big bombs have struck the Ulster capital's business centre. However, London's position as a major international financial centre is putting heavy pressure on the authorities and police to devise a policy based on deterrence a deterrent rather than containment. A third big bomb attack could make some foreign companies think about relocating elsewhere in Europe.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Cowie buys 3% of Henlys T COWIE, the motor trader pursuing an aggressive bid for rival Henlys Group, yesterday went into the market to buy shares in its target. Its brokers were bidding for shares at 73p and appear to have picked up 1.1m  -3 per cent of Henlys capital. Under takeover rules Cowie is allowed to buy up to 10 per cent without making a full cash offer. Cowie's share price closed at 120p, up 1p, putting a value of 84p per share on its 7-for-10 share offer, valuing Henlys at Pounds 31.8m. The partial cash offer of one share plus 40p cash for two Henlys shares values them at 80p apiece and the company at Pounds 30.3m. Henlys shares fell to 62p before Cowie started buying, and closed at 65p, down 2p on the day. The bid is due to close next Tuesday, but with a bank holiday on Monday, shareholders are expected to decide on the bid this week. The stock market price suggests that a majority will decide not to accept the bid. Cowie has sent Henlys' shareholders a document summarising its case. It emphasised the improvement in income and capital value shareholders would get if they accepted. Henlys summarised its case in a document sent to shareholders last week. Mr David Matthews, former chairman and chief executive of Henlys who left the group last November, is pledging his 7 per cent shareholding to Cowie. Mr Matthews is keen to buy Henlys coach and bus business. He said he would merge it with another UK bus manufacturer and rationalise the business. However, some of Henlys institutional shareholders have indicated that they will not accept the offer.</p>

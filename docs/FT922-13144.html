			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Letter: Terms for rescheduling Sir, Is there not a risk that Barclays and the other creditors of Olympia &amp; York and Heron may allow a close professional relationship to sweeten the terms of the debt reschedulings, leading to a further squeeze on the banks' other customers, both borrowers and lenders? Since presumably there is no automatic right to reschedule, it will be in the long-term interests of those customers if the banks demand, in addition, some participation in the equity or assets of those companies, even to the point of foreclosure, which in itself could leave a salutary lesson for the next property boom.

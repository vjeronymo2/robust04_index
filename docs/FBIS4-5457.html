			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand rejects a charge that it helped Khmer  Rouge leaders to escape.    The Thai Government has issued an explanation denying a  report that said Thailand helped the Khmer Rouge leaders to  escape. The Thai Government, however, does not think the  accusation was made by the Cambodian leaders, but rather views  it as a misinterpretation by news agencies.    Relations between Thailand and Cambodia have been smooth and  growing closer. Both countries understand and accept each  other's stand concerning its foreign policy. Thailand,  especially, has a clear-cut policy of recognition to the elected  government of Cambodia, and noninterference in Cambodia's  internal affairs. It has abstained from giving support to the  Khmer Rouge. This policy has been emphasized by the Thai  Government to the Cambodian Government on several occasions.  The report accusing Thailand of helping the Khmer Rouge leaders  to escape was utterly inaccurate. The distortion of facts might  come from misunderstanding or misinterpretation by news  agencies. It could also be possible that some news agencies  wanted to destroy the good relations existing between Thailand  and Cambodia.    Thailand does not want to see the close relations it has  with  Cambodia destroyed by just an error of news agencies that  occurred regularly and, sometimes, inadvertently. For the sake  of mutual understanding and to safeguard the good relations  existing between the two countries, should there be any doubts  about Thailand, the Cambodian Government is hereby requested to  directly address Thailand through diplomatic channels. There is  no need to go through a third country since Thailand and  Cambodia have several proper channels for contact.</p>

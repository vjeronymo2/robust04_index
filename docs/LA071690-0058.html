			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VICTIM, PREVIOUSLY HIT, FIGURED ODDS WERE IN HIS FAVOR  </P> <P> Matthew Edward Nordbrock had been struck by lightning once before. And as he  sprinted for shelter from a gathering storm at the top of Mt. Whitney, he told  his roommate and hiking companion, James Swift, that he wouldn't be jolted  again.  </P> <P> Yet inside a stone cabin near the Eastern Sierra summit, it was the  bespectacled Nordbrock -- among more than a dozen huddled hikers -- who was  fatally injured by the lightning bolt that struck shortly after 5:30 p.m.  Saturday.  </P> <P> "Jim (Swift) said the floor crackled and people felt their legs get numb," said  Nordbrock's mother, Evelyn, a tax preparer in Tucson.  </P> <P> "Then everybody jumped up and were screaming, and they realized that Matt and  another person were knocked down. The other person was revived right away, and  they did CPR on Matt for four hours," she said Sunday.  </P> <P> Her son's metal-framed glasses were blamed for contributing to his death.  </P> <P> "The doctor told us they thought the lightning probably had the worst effect on  Matt because he was wearing metal-rimmed glasses," she said.  </P> <P> Metal-rimmed glasses were a factor in the earlier lightning strike, too, his  mother recalled.  </P> <P> More than a decade ago, he and his younger brother and two other boys were in a  rowboat on a lake in Arizona's White Mountains when lightning struck during a  sudden storm. "Matt was temporarily stunned," his mother said, "but one of the  other boys was pretty badly hurt. . . . That boy was wearing metal-rimmed  glasses, too."  </P> <P> Relatives and friends alike mourned the death of Nordbrock.  </P> <P> A senior credit analyst who had just won a promotion at the Earle M. Jorgensen  Co. in Lynwood, Nordbrock was remembered as a powerful athlete, a health  enthusiast and a gregarious man who attracted friends like a magnet.  </P> <P> "I'm bummed out," said a shaken Joseph Cotti, 22, another roommate who would  have been on the fateful trip if he hadn't had to work Saturday. "This kind of  thing is something you can't really plan for. They were just a bunch of guys  who went up there to have a good time and enjoy the wilderness."  </P> <P> Cotti's girlfriend, Alice Brancali, 22, her blue eyes brimming with tears,  added: "We keep hoping it's a nightmare and we're going to wake up and Matt  will be OK."  </P> <P> Cotti said he was drawn into the University of Arizona graduate's orbit by a  newspaper ad for a room to rent two years ago. They, in turn, hooked up with  Swift, another University of Arizona alumnus. In short order, their circles of  friends converged. Besides sharing fishing trips, cycling excursions and other  athletic activities, on Sundays they often attended church together and  followed up with a barbecue.  </P> <P> The roommates were big fans of country-pop artist Jimmy Buffett, and friends  from all over converged in Orange County for the singer's show last month.  </P> <P> Cotti said he last saw Nordbrock and the 24-year-old Swift as they piled into a  Honda Accord hatchback Friday evening with buddies Kent Kroener and Steven  Hellman, both engineers living in Huntington Beach and experienced hikers.  </P> <P> "They were fighting over who got what seat," Cotti recalled.  </P> <P> Armed with Jimmy Buffett tapes, the foursome headed for the High Sierra about 7  p.m. According to Swift, who telephoned Cotti early Sunday morning with the  news of Nordbrock's death, the group broke camp at about 10 or 11 a.m. Saturday  and headed for the 14,494-foot peak.  </P> <P> It was nearly 5:30 p.m., Swift told Cotti and Evelyn Nordbrock, when they  reached the top and the storm blew in. Kroener and Hellman, both 23, went to  find shelter.  </P> <P> "They were at the very top (of Mt. Whitney), and they felt quivers or burning  from the rocks near them, and Matt said, 'Hey, we've got to get out of here,' "  Evelyn Nordbrock said Swift told her.  </P> <P> Apparently confident that the odds were in his favor, Nordbrock reportedly told  Swift, "I've been hit by lightning before, so I won't get struck."  </P> <P> The pair then ran downhill and were waved into the stone cabin by Kroener and  Hellman.  </P> <P> Swift, who was released from the hospital with first- and second-degree burns,  was driving to Huntington Beach with Kroener and Hellman late Sunday and could  not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Nordbrock is survived by his parents, Evelyn and Neil, brothers Mark, 28, and  Daniel, 22, and by a half sister, Kim Beller, 34, of Greenwood, Neb.  </P> <P> Evelyn Nordbrock said she and her husband were trying, through the American  Consulate in Madrid, to get word of the tragedy to their eldest son, a law  student who is spending the summer in Spain.  </P> <P> The funeral will be held in Tucson, but arrangements had not been set late  Sunday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Huntington Beach, tearful acquaintances sorted through mementos  of their lost friend and made plans to fly to Tucson.  </P> <P> "Matt's gone, but there are all these people who care about him. He was just  very, very loved by everybody," Brancali said.  </P></p>

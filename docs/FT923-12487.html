			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: MGN shares dive as trading resumes THE SHARES of Mirror Group Newspapers slumped to 50p yesterday when trading resumed after a seven-month suspension with no sign of 'dawn raids' by potential future owners. When the shares were suspended in December, just before the start of the revelations of the serious losses that both the newspaper group and its pension funds had suffered, the price had crept back to 125p - the flotation price. Trading volumes in the shares were low yesterday with most shareholders deciding to hold on in the hope of better things in future. The price moved up to 54p before slipping back to 52 3/4 p at the close. With most of the financial uncertainties about the popular newspaper group out in the open the main block on the share price, at least in the short term, could be that 54 per cent of the company is effectively controlled by the banks. Neither the banks nor the administrator, Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, have given any clear indication on when they plan to sell. The low share price is a further indication that the banks may have to wait to get their money back and that a sale is more likely next year than this. Mr Talbot is administrator to the private Maxwell companies that held a majority stake in MGN, whose major titles include the Daily Mirror, the Sunday Mirror, The People, the Scottish Daily Record and the Sunday Mail. The Maxwell shares are pledged as collateral for bank loans. MGN had pre-tax profits on ordinary activities of Pounds 50.9m last year. The company is likely to be markedly more profitable in two years after a Pounds 70m investment in its Scottish printing operations is complete. New colour presses are already stored in Glasgow but Mr Robert Maxwell refused to authorise the money needed to install them. Mr Vic Horwood, chief executive of MGN, said on Thursday that the plans for the modernisation would have to be reviewed. Because of the delays he did not expect the new plant to come on stream until June 1994. At the moment the Sunday Mail is turning away advertising because the existing presses can only print 48-page papers. Sir Robert Clark, chairman of MGN, has made it clear he will stay on as chairman as long as he is wanted, although additional non-executive directors are expected to be appointed.</p>

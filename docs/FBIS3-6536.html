			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- A senior leader of the  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) expressed resolve on Friday to  demolish the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa.    "I suspect the coalition government is already virtually  divided," LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told a news  conference. "As our President (Yohei) Kono says, the coalition  government's role is finished."    He said the LDP, ousted from government last summer after 38  years of unbroken rule, will take a get-tough stance against the  coalition in order to win back power.    Mori said the LDP is setting up a special panel within the  party on Friday to probe the premier's receipt of money from a  scandal- tainted parcel delivery firm, which Hosokawa called a  loan he has since repaid.    As a condition for opening Diet debate on the fiscal 1994  state budget, the LDP has demanded that Hosokawa produce proof  to support his claim that he returned the 100 million yen he  received from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. in 1982.    The premier has said he has already released all documents  in  connection with his loan from the now-defunct company that was  at the center of the 1992-1993 money, mob and politics scandal.    Earlier Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  told a news conference that the government hopes Diet discussion  on the budget will start as early as possible.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Disney's rude awakening It was appropriate that Euro Disney staged its annual meeting in its rodeo hall, given that the restructuring proposals threaten to trample ordinary shareholders underfoot. The agreement conjured up between the banks and Walt Disney promises a massive dilution of shareholders' interests. The FFr6bn rights issue, supported by Walt Disney and underwritten by a syndicate of banks, will probably be priced around the FFr10 par value of the shares. Combined with related leasing deals, this implies that the number of shares in issue will rise from 170m to closer to 800m on a fully diluted basis. After rising 8 per cent in the morning, the shares closed 7 per cent lower as that reality dawned. At least Walt Disney and the banks now seem fully committed to making the park work. By forgiving 18 months of interest charges and deferring all principal payments for three years, the banks have bought Euro Disney plenty of breathing space. Euro Disney should eventually be able to service its remaining FFr10bn debt with little difficulty. The question is whether any upside exists when Euro Disney re-emerges from its temporary financial fantasyland. It is tempting to believe the new shares may hold some speculative appeal when the French economy recovers. But as has always been the case, Walt Disney's shares must offer a better bet for those convinced that Euro Disney will flourish. Walt Disney has waived its lucrative royalties and management fees for five years but they will be re-applied in time. And if Euro Disney proves a wild success, Walt Disney's magical incentive fees will be transformed into gold.</p>

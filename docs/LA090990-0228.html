			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MOST POPULAR HOUSING CHOICE OF AMERICAN'S ELDERLY;  </P> <P> STAYING PUT  </P> <P> When Hortense Tingstad's husband died of Alzheimer's disease in 1982, she  thought that most of her life's major decisions were behind her.  </P> <P> She had accepted the task of caring for a husband who often didn't recognize  her after his condition was diagnosed as the memory-killing illness several  years earlier.  </P> <P> But when he finally tried to choke her to death in a fit of dementia, she made  the painful decision to move him from their Mid-Wilshire home of 40 years to a  hospital, where he could get more professional treatment.  </P> <P> After Edward Tingstad was buried, though, Hortense was faced with yet another  difficult decision: Where would she spend the rest of her life?  </P> <P> A convalescent home was out. Even now, at 81, she's in fine shape. She pondered  moving to a resort-type development chock-full of golf courses and the like,  but soon rejected that notion because she "didn't want to hang around with a  bunch of old people."  </P> <P> She still occasionally thinks of moving to a condominium, but doesn't like the  thought of giving up her own yard and some of her privacy. An apartment is  definitely out of the question: After being a homeowner for nearly half a  century, she's not about to go back to renting.  </P> <P> "So I've just stayed put," said Tingstad, a chipper, energetic woman who only  recently mothballed her racy 1964 Porsche and started driving a sedan.  </P> <P> "I love this old house, and it's so full of happy memories. I might just stay  here until I turn 100."  </P> <P> Tingstad's story illustrates some of the many housing choices open to the  nation's 41 million people aged 60 or older, about three-quarters of whom are  retired.  </P> <P> Exactly where to live when we get older is a question all of us must face  sooner or later. If you have already retired, or expect to leave the work force  soon, it's a decision you need to be thinking about now.  </P> <P> But even if you're middle-aged, a little planning today could let you live out  your retirement years more comfortably than you would if you waited until the  last minute.  </P> <P> Even if you don't want to think about where you'll live several years from now,  you may have to address the elderly housing issue if you have parents who are  in their 50s, 60s, 70s or 80s.  </P> <P> In fact, experts say older people should seek the input of their children when  </P> <P> they're making their housing decisions and that the kids should volunteer to  become involved.  </P> <P> "Whether you move or stay put, the choice you make will affect the entire  family," said Leah Dobkin, a housing specialist with the American Assn. of  Retired Persons in Washington.  </P> <P> "It's ultimately your decision, but bringing the kids in on the conversation  can be a real help."  </P> <P> Never before have older people had so many housing options. Hundreds of  communities for so-called "active adults" have sprung up around the country,  with golf courses, pools and classes on everything from sewing to woodworking.  </P> <P> Other new developments cater to older people who want smaller homes, but don't  want all the recreational amenities offered at Sun City-type projects.  </P> <P> "Congregate-care" facilities are geared toward older people who are generally  healthy, but want a little help with cooking and housekeeping chores.  </P> <P> And then there are nursing homes and convalescent hospitals, where residents  have access to around-the-clock medical supervision.  </P> <P> Even people who decide to stay in their present homes now have a range of  choices.  </P> <P> For example, you could bring in a roommate to supplement your income and  provide companionship. Or, if you need in-home medical attention, you can hire  one of the 8,000 agencies that provide various types of nursing care and  therapy.  </P> <P> If you're one of the 2 million or so Californians who have lots of equity and  the home is nearly paid off, you might even consider a "reverse mortgage" -- an  offbeat type of loan that can provide you with monthly stipends that don't have  to be immediately repaid.  </P> <P> But with all these options come some hard choices.  </P> <P> No matter where you spend the rest of your life, you'll have to ask yourself  some tough financial and lifestyle questions. The answers will help determine  not just where you live, but how happy you'll be with your decision.  </P> <P> "Go slow, and think everything out first," said Stan Ross, co-managing partner  of the real estate consulting and accounting firm of Kenneth Leventhal &amp;  Co.  </P> <P> "If you're deciding where you're going to live for the rest of your life, you  can't afford to make a mistake."  </P> <P> Lawyers, accountants, financial and estate planners can provide valuable  advice. So can the local chapter of the American Assn. of Retired Persons,  which has a plethora of free and low-cost publications about housing  alternatives for older people.  </P> <P> Your physical condition will play a key role in your housing decision.  </P> <P> If you're relatively healthy and mobile, there shouldn't be any problem with  staying in your current home.  </P> <P> Several studies have shown that between 75% and 85% of people over 60 would  like to spend the rest of their lives where they are now, so long as they  remain healthy and can continue making their housing payments and keeping the  place up without much trouble.  </P> <P> In fact, even if you're a bit frail or are handicapped, you might be able to  stay in your longtime home by making some alterations.  </P> <P> "You can install 'grab bars' in the bathroom and other parts of the house for  more support, or install automatic stair lifts so you don't have to walk up  stairs," said Jon Pynoos, a professor of gerontology at USC's Andrus  Gerontology Center.  </P> <P> "You can add more lighting so you can see better around the house, or even  rearrange your floor plan so you only live on one floor or spend most of your  time in one particular portion of the home."  </P> <P> New products designed to help older people stay in their home with as much  comfort as possible are being developed every month.  </P> <P> For example, Canada-based Granberg Superior Systems recently unveiled a  "movable" kitchen and bathroom for wheelchair-bound people: Cabinets, sinks and  everything else can be automatically lowered or raised with the touch of a  button.  </P> <P> If you need nearly constant medical attention or your health is deteriorating,  you may want to consider moving to a nursing home or continuing-care facility.  About 3 million Americans live in 25,000 of these projects nationwide. They  typically offer on-site medical care as well as meals and help with household  chores.  </P> <P> There are psychological considerations too.  </P> <P> "If you move away from your neighborhood, you usually leave behind lots of  friends and family members," said Dobkin, the AARP housing specialist. "Or you  might not want to move if your house holds fond memories of a late spouse or  your kids.  </P> <P> "A lot depends on how motivated you are to create new memories instead of just  keeping the old ones. If you're not ready to meet new people and adjust to a  new neighborhood, you're probably better off staying where you are now."  </P> <P> If you decide to stay put, you'll still have plenty of decisions to make.  </P> <P> For example, if you're widowed or otherwise single, you might consider bringing  in a roommate.  </P> <P> "They could pay you rent to supplement your income, or they could do  housekeeping or other chores in lieu of rent," said Janet Witkin of Alternative  Living for the Aged, a nonprofit group that runs a roommate-matching service  and builds co-op housing for older people.  </P> <P> "Also, a roommate can give you companionship -- and you can't put a price tag  on that, especially if you've been living alone."  </P> <P> There are no firm estimates on the number of elderly people who live with a  roommate. But Witkin's group alone has matched up more than 3,100 Angelenos  over the past decade.  </P> <P> There are, of course, some drawbacks to sharing your home with someone else.  Your privacy will likely be reduced, and there's a chance that the rent paid by  your housemate may make you ineligible to receive other benefits, such as food  stamps.  </P> <P> A few cities even have zoning ordinances that put limitations on shared-housing  arrangements.  </P> <P> Perhaps more important, you simply might not get along with your roommate --  and that can cause serious problems.  </P> <P> "You don't want to spend the rest of your days arguing with somebody, or go  through the trauma of getting rid of a roommate who makes you feel  uncomfortable in your own home," said Jacqueline Leavitt, an associate  professor and expert on elderly housing in the UCLA School of Architecture and  Urban Planning.  </P> <P> "That's all the more reason why you should get to know your (potential)  roommate before you ask her to move in, and all the more reason why you should  have a place in your home when you want to get away from it all. If you don't  have any privacy, you'll go mad."  </P> <P> The free roommate-matching programs operated by Alternative Living for the Aged  and some other seniors' groups try to minimize potential problems by linking-up  people with the same characteristics.  </P> <P> They ask potential partners a variety of questions -- from whether they smoke  to how late they stay up -- in an attempt to ensure compatibility.  </P> <P> If finances will be tight in your retirement years or you simply want to live  better, you can turn some of your built-up equity into cash by refinancing, or  by taking out a home-equity loan or conventional second mortgage.  </P> <P> The problem, though, is that you may have trouble paying the money back.  </P> <P> "Remember, your income is probably going to be much lower because you won't be  bringing home a weekly paycheck," said San Francisco-based financial planner  Lawrence A. Krause.  </P> <P> "The last thing you need in your retirement years is to fall behind on your  mortgage payments and lose your house through foreclosure."  </P> <P> Krause discourages many of his older clients from borrowing against their  equity. "If they're strapped for cash, I suggest that they consider selling and  moving to a smaller home, or to move to a less-expensive area."  </P> <P> If you don't like the thought of moving but want to supplement your retirement  income, you can consider taking out a reverse mortgage. About 1,000 of these  loans have been made in California and 5,000 have been made nationwide -- more  than twice the number that had been originated just two years ago.  </P> <P> A reverse mortgage is basically a home loan that works backwards. Instead of  getting one lump sum that must be repaid in monthly installments, the loan is  advanced in monthly increments.  </P> <P> Depending on which type of reverse mortgage you select, the money won't have to  be paid back until the term of the loan expires or you finally sell the home.  If you die, the money is repaid by your estate.  </P> <P> "People take out reverse mortgages for any number of reasons," said William J.  Texido, whose San Francisco-based Providential Home Income Plan is one of  California's biggest reverse-mortgage lenders.  </P> <P> "Some do it to supplement their monthly income and live a little better, and  others do it to pay medical bills or meet other expenses.  </P> <P> "And some folks just do it to have fun," Texido said. "We've got one couple  that signed up for our program, and they use the money to rent an apartment in  Paris for six months out of the year."  </P> <P> Of course, reverse mortgages aren't for everyone. Some companies charge high  interest rates on the loans or demand to share in a portion of the property's  future appreciation.  </P> <P> People who want to leave as much as they can to their heirs also typically  avoid reverse mortgages because they don't want profits from the eventual sale  of the home to be reduced by the loan pay-back.  </P> <P> A cheaper way to tap your equity is to enter a sale/lease-back transaction.  </P> <P> In a typical sale/lease-back, you would sell your home to your grown child or  even a private investor and simultaneously sign a lease to stay in your house  for as long as you wish.  </P> <P> As in a typical sale, the buyer would make a down payment and get a bank loan  to finance the rest of the purchase.  </P> <P> You would get to keep all the sale proceeds and might be eligible for the  one-time exclusion that lets you pocket up to $125,000 of your profits  tax-free. You would also have the psychological satisfaction of knowing that  you can stay in the home for as long as you like.  </P> <P> Your child, meantime, can collect monthly rental payments from you and take tax  deductions that all landlords enjoy. And, of course, he'll also get the home  when you move out or die. A sale/lease-back involves some important tax and  legal issues, so you'll want to confer with a knowledgeable attorney and  accountant before you enter one.  </P> <P> The National Center for Home Equity Conversion provides a guide to  sale/lease-backs and a model agreement you can use to fashion your own  contract: It's available for $35 from the nonprofit group's headquarters at 110  E. Main Street, Madison, Wis. 53703  </P> <P> Whether you stay put or move on, don't put yourself under too much pressure.  </P> <P> "Unless you've got pressing medical problems or financial troubles, there's  really no reason to rush your decision," said USC's Pynoos. "So go slow --  remember, there's always tomorrow."  </P> <P> Times research librarian Nona Yates contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEARN MORE ABOUT HOUSING OPTIONS  </P> <P> There are many agencies that can help you sift through your housing options and  address other issues concerning retirement.

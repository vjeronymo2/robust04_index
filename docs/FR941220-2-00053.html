The following Phlx member/participant organizations would be exempt from the examinations fee: (1) Inactive organizations; (2) organizations that operate from the Exchange's trading floors; (3) organizations for any month where they incur transaction or clearing fees charged directly to them by the Exchange or by its registered clearing subsidiary, provided that the fees exceed the examinations fee for that month; <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and (4) organizations affiliated with an organization exempt from this fee due to the second or third category. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The $1,000 threshold is required in order for a firm to be exempt from the examinations fee. For example, a firm with $600 in transaction fees for a month is required to pay the full amount of the $1,000 examinations fee. See letter from Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, PHLX, to Glen Barrentine, Branch Chief, SEC, dated December 12, 1994 (``Letter''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Affiliated firms, which are exempt if affiliated with an exempt organization, are permitted to aggregate their respective transaction fees to meet the $1,000 threshold,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  each firm is not required to meet a separate threshold. See Letter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Affiliation includes an organization that is a wholly owned subsidiary of, as well as an organization controlled by or under common control with, an ``exempt'' member or participant organization. An inactive organization is one which had no securities-related transaction revenue, as determined by semi-annual FOCUS reports, as long as the organization continues to have no revenue each month. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  In order to compensate for the extensive staff time and costs associated with examining off-floor firms who are not active participants in Phlx markets, the Exchange is proposing to amend its fee schedule by adopting a $1,000 per month examination fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A FOCUS report, Securities and Exchange Commission Form X&hyph;17A&hyph;5, Financial and Operational Combined Uniform Single Report, is required by SEC Rule 17a&hyph;5 and Phlx Rule 703(c)(i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commission Rule 15b2&hyph;2(b) requires that broker-dealers designated to a self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') be examined for compliance with applicable financial responsibility rules within six months of registration with the Commission. In addition, the examining SRO must conduct an examination within 12 months of Commission registration to review compliance with all other Commission rules. Thereafter, examinations are conducted on a periodic basis. In accordance with Commission rules, the Phlx administers an examinations program conducting reviews of organizations for which the Exchange is the DEA. The examinations focus on an organization's compliance with applicable financial and record keeping requirements, including net capital, books and record maintenance, Regulation T and financial reporting, of the Phlx as well as the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

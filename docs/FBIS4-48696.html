			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Chimoio by correspondent Jose Manuel Pio] </F>   [Text] A group of demobilized government troops staged a  demonstration along the main streets of the city of Chimoio in  Manica Province today, demanding payment of pensions in arrears.  The group then left for the provincial government building,  along the main avenue of the city, 25 de Setembro.    Our reporting team says the names of some former guerrillas  of the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] do not appear on  the pension lists received from Maputo. A source from the  Provincial Finance Directorate also told our reporting team that  there are some irregularities in some lists which show some  demobilized soldiers with a longer period of service earning  less than those who served for lesser period.</p>

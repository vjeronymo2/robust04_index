			<p>CSO     [Text] By cutting more than 15 percent of the revenues and  expenditures recommended by the government, the Majles has  approved the 1373 [21 March 1994- 20 March 1995] budget bill.  Most of the government's current and general expenses have been  reduced compared to the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994].  The defense budget was the only section whose increase the  Majles did not oppose, increasing it by $850 million to $1.4  billion while decreasing food subsidies from $1.2 billion to  $800 million.    The first effect of the approved budget came before the  beginning of the new year. The "Railroad of the Islamic  Republic" increased by 30 to 50 percent ticket prices for  various passenger trains during the New Year's holidays on the  pretext of the "cutoff in government aid and subsidies." Then in  the first days of the new year it announced that the new ticket  prices would be permanent.</p>

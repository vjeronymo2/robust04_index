			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Managers say recession still on SENIOR managers believe that Britain's recession is not over, an Institute of Management survey says today. It indicates that most managers do not believe the recession will end next year. 'This is a disturbing survey,' Mr Roger Young, institute director-general, said yesterday. 'It shows that managers have not registered recovery despite the government's claims.' As many as three out of four managers in the survey of 600 said they did not believe the recession would end in 1994 while only 3 per cent said it would be over by December this year. Sixty per cent added that they thought Britain would dip into further recession during the course of next year. While 60 per cent of the sample said they had cut jobs, 41 per cent added they were giving top priority to keeping down the number of workers they employed. Senior managers laid the blame for Britain's continuing economic troubles on government policy while on in three blamed the banks, 14 per cent the European Community and 4 per cent the unions. Meanwhile, Unison, the public service union, said yesterday that its latest Jobwatch survey suggested that as many as 20,000 jobs were at risk in the health service and local government. 'All the signs are that the government's much-vaunted myth of recovery has evaporated into thin air,' said Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary. A sharp decline in exports caused almost entirely by the downturn in continental Europe has been offset by improving home markets, says a survey of the third quarter of the year by the nine north-west England chambers of commerce, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. The chambers warn, however, that any recovery is 'still quite delicate' and next month's Budget must support it by avoiding 'any measures which might put further economic improvement at risk'. The fragility of the upturn is shown by the fact that only about 20 per cent of companies are working at full capacity, the survey of 641 companies says. The proportion of those working at three-quarters capacity improved, but only from 74 per cent to 76 per cent. With so much capacity to spare, the bulk of companies have little appetite for investment, although there has been a steady upward trend in the last four quarters from a low base. The balance of manufacturing investment - the difference between companies increasing and those decreasing spending - was 22 per cent compared with 8 per cent a year ago. Trends in recruitment showed a slow but steady pick-up in manufacturing in the third quarter. Although the balance figure of manufacturers recruiting more staff was only 11 per cent, it is the third positive figure in a row after nine quarters of net labour-shedding between 1990 and the beginning of this year. Recruitment in the service sector produced a positive balance figure of 18 per cent from 11 per cent in the first and second quarters and 4 per cent in the last quarter of 1992. Optimism is increasing among companies in southern England, but their counterparts in the north and Midlands are less hopeful, a survey released today says. Sixty per cent of companies in the south expect sales to increase over the next three months compared with 53 per cent in the Midlands and 49 per cent in the north, according to an Enterprise Barometer survey released by 3i, the venture capital group.</p>

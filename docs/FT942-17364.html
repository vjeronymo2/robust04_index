			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / International Company News: General Mills steps up price war General Mills, the US foods group, said yesterday it was slashing the price of its cereals, signalling an escalation of the price war with its main rival, Kellogg. The company, which claims a 29 per cent share of the Dollars 8.7bn a year cereal market, said it would cut the price of its largest cereal brands by an average 11 per cent, with effect from May 2. The move, which the company said will reduce its earnings by between five and 10 cents a share in the current quarter, signals the company's intention of reversing a 5 per cent slide in cereal sales in its second quarter. At the same time, the company said it was reducing its use of coupons and other promotional discounts, leading to estimated savings of Dollars 175m a year. The move reflects a trend among US consumer product companies to establish lower prices for their products and at the same time abolish the generous discounts used to attract buyers. Mr Steve Sanger, president of General Mills, said the practice had become 'more and more inefficient for manufacturers and retailers, and burdensome for consumers'. The company said that it did not expect the moves to have any impact on its market share, and that they would have 'a positive profit impact' in the fiscal year beginning in June.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Ministry </F> of Defense of the Democratic Republic of Yemen"; place and date  not given]    [Text] The forces of the ruling military regime in Sanaa  have been continuing since yesterday morning [words indistinct]  and continued their artillery and rocket attacks [words  indistinct] and residential quarters in the city of Aden [words  indistinct].    Yesterday the ruling military regime of Sanaa initiated  battles around Aden by means of its (?brutal) forces and used  all kinds of destructive weapons. However, our Armed Forces and  the masses of our people were lying in wait for the brutal  enemy. They engaged the enemy with rare courage and legendary  steadfastness and inflicted on the invading and aggressive  forces crushing blows.    They prevented the advance of the enemy forces and inflicted  on them the following losses: the destruction of 25 tanks; 12  manned military vehicles, as well as other weaponry and  equipment. They seized seven tanks. The enemy also suffered  hundreds of dead and wounded.    One of those taken prisoner by our forces said that the  commanders of the destructive war against our people told them  that the first commander of a tank who manages to enter Aden  will be appointed governor of Aden. He also said other things  which we do not need to talk about now.    This morning the forces of the ruling military regime in  Sanaa resumed their aggressive operations and their repeated  attempts at attacks. The battles are still continuing. The  morale of our forces is high and their confidence in victory is  unlimited. God is great.</p>

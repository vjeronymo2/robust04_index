			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (4) - A formidable choice of goods / Shopping / This consumer's paradise seems to be approaching saturation point and over-capacity as an ever-increasing number of new shopping centres open their doors If you have the money to pay for it, you can get anything in Dubai and if you can't afford an original there are always some very good copies to be found. The choice of goods is formidable and even the most ardent, dedicated shopper would be hard pressed to cover all the retailing areas and the souks in a week of intense consumerism. Even if this were accomplished, another centre would open in the interim. Hub is probably the most over-used term in Dubai - employed to describe the emirate's role in everything from trade and travel to commerce and sport. But for shopping it is an appropriate word in the context of the Gulf region. Although Dubai's facilities are not yet on the scale of Singapore's dedicated centres, the choice there is vast and prices are low. But saturation point appears to be nearing as far as the local market is concerned with over-capacity looming as ever more centres open their doors with a fanfare of publicity. A large watch distributor estimated that the existing shops contained three watches for every man, woman and child in Dubai, many of whom already own several. This is apart from the designer copies and cheap digital watches which find their way into the souks and shops in the Indian districts. As for clothes, a comparable figure may well be the contents of five walk-in wardrobes per person. Electrical goods move through Dubai at great speed and all the latest models of leading brands are available at very competitive prices. Shoppers should not be deterred by the appearance or size of electronics shops. Dealers rarely have the time or inclination to display goods properly because they sell so fast. The electronics souk near the Ambassador Hotel comprises a host of small shops selling everything from a mini-calculator to a hi-fi set, but it is advisable to check whether the warranties are international. Jumbo Electronics, National Electronics and Eros Electronics are known locally for their TVs, videos and compact discs. Cassette tapes (Thomsun Originals) are widely available and cost a mere Dh6 while compact discs retail for Dh60. Dubai's boutiques offer designer and international brand names at reasonable prices compared to the fashion houses of Europe. Al Maktoum Street and the Satwa area have many clothes shops for men and women, as do all the main shopping centres and hotels. Designer copies, many of them of quite high quality and well-executed, can be found in the Karama district. A fake 'Chanel' T-shirt at Dh30 is one third the price of an original, while the price differentials on luggage is even greater - an entire fake 'Gucci' suitcase and travel set can be bought for less than the cost of an original Gucci hold-all. Many of the new shopping malls are eerily empty during the day with only a few uncomfortable-looking shoppers in the marble-clad halls. The evenings - traditional shopping hours in Arab countries - are busier. However, the majority of people are in the coffee shops, pizza restaurants and ice-cream parlours because the shopping centres serve as meeting places and venues for family outings. Recognising this, the Galleria complex next to the Hyatt Regency hotel has built its shopping area around an ice rink. Residents acknowledge they are spoiled for choice and variously attribute the lack of shoppers to a variety of factors. 'Everyone is too busy working to shop,' says one businessman while his wife bemoans the tendency for shopping centres to open with too much publicity and only a few units. The Bur Juman centre has only 30 per cent of its units open for retailing one month after opening, while the Wafi centre near the airport recently secured Salam stores to bring its occupancy up to 85 per cent - 16 months after its launch. Developers and property managers are unperturbed by the apparent lack of customers. The marketing manager of a large property management agency says: 'We have no Canary Wharf here - all the developments are paid for, there is no borrowed money on the construction side.' Such optimism also prevails at the of the Dubai Commerce and Tourism Promotion Board. Mr Lawrence Mills, the board's chief executive, shrugs off questions about the proliferation of shopping centres. 'It is up to individuals where they put their money,' he says. 'Now everyone wants to build shopping centres, but if the mood and the market change, those buildings could become hotels, apartments, offices or whatever. . . Dubai is very adaptable.' The developers continue to 'adapt' - last month Lamcy, the largest department store in the United Arab Emirates, opened its doors. Somewhat exaggerating its merits with a claim to contain 'the world and more in a single store,' the Dh25m complex contains 66 departments, dominated by Dubai's largest electronics department, spread over 18,000 square feet. Many of the centres are impressively laid out and well-designed but somewhat antiseptic and impersonal. Shops display 'fixed prices' signs to notify would-be customers that there will be no discounts or haggling. This is also the practice in the main shopping areas, although there is an informal 'last price' system whereby shopkeepers will climb down from the price shown on the tag. If a shopper has the time and energy, prices can be beaten down by five-10 per cent, often through persistence over several days. Arab antiques and curios such as worry beads, soapstone figures, silver boxes and pearling knives used by divers can be found in Al Nasr square and the shopping arcades of hotels, but the prices are quite steep. Inlaid rosewood boxes from Pakistan and brass camels or coffee pots are around 30 per cent more expensive than the same items in Sharjah's beautiful souk a 20-minute drive away. It is well worth the effort to visit the upstairs galleries of the impressive building on the neighbouring emirate's Corniche. Saddle bags, incense burners, rugs, carpets, muzzle-loading guns and almost any 'Arabian' or 'Oriental' treasures are jammed into small, dusty shops which have a distinctly Arab feel. The time-pressed businessman who cannot trail around all the malls and centres still cannot avoid the shops - every large hotel has an impressive arcade selling everything from razor blades to designer ball gowns. Shopping is unavoidable in Dubai - even if you try to leave without having set foot in a single retail establishment the Dubai Duty Free in the airport beckons. The complex has more than 20 shops and is the largest single duty-free operation in the world. There is even a Duty Free for arriving passengers. Considering all the temptations, it is hardly surprising that Emirates airline makes more money on excess baggage than it does at the duty free shop. In contrast to the often echoing emptiness of the shopping centres, Dubai's souks (markets) are bustling, lively and noisy. In the wholesale market, running parallel to the Creek on the Deira side, large suitcases full of cash are opened in shop doorways and row upon row of clothing changes hands. Narrow streets are jammed with vehicles and people, while goods spill onto the pavement and cluttered shop windows are obscured by external hanging displays. However, the souks are not Arab bazaars such as those in the Maghreb, Damascus, Cairo or Yemen. Customers are more likely to encounter an Indian proprietor and will not find the sweet glass of tea, haggling and the livestock associated with an 'Arab' souk. In essence, the souks are shops, not stalls, and they are open for business rather than a chat over sludgy beverages. Even haggling is perfunctory: carefully-cultivated clicks of the tongue and heavenward glances, feigned disinterest or theatrical horror are all but wasted. Negotiation is the operative word and discounts, sometimes sizeable, can be secured but seldom haggled. Dubai's main souk area comprises seven alleys of assorted shops - predominantly hardware, household items and clothes. Located near the main abra (water taxi) station, it adjoins the spice souk and a short distance away is the gold market. A far cry from the 'dark caves' described by Wilfred Thesiger, the British explorer, in 1948, the souk nevertheless retains its own character despite being surrounded by extensive building and development in recent years. Mostly cheap and cheerful though the wares are, it is unlikely the casual visitor would wish to purchase brightly-coloured foam mattresses or cauldron-like cooking pots. But some of the side streets house more interesting shops where curios and Arab artefacts such as hubble-bubble pipes, veils and falconry accoutrements can be found. Asense of Dubai's history is evoked in the nearby spice souk. Sacks of cardamom, saffron, coffee and rose petals are stacked in a covered alleyway while the small shops are bursting with jars, bowls and bags of assorted aromatic spices. The smell pervades the area and lingers in the air long after closing time. Evocative of times past, the spice souk has a heady atmosphere. Earthenware incense lamps hang from the ceiling while chillis, dried nuts, apricots, cumin, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, green and yellow peppers and henna crowd the shelves in confectionery jars, buckets, jars and other receptacles. A short walk away from the spice market lies the gold souk. Its rows of intricate jewellery and lines of orderly shops offer soothing respite after a walk through the spice market. It feels almost self-indulgent just to gaze upon the myriad adornments filling the windows and display cabinets. The Dh800,000 construction of a parking area, wood-covered walkway and paved pedestrian area through the souk are underway and thankfully have begun to restore a semblance of its original character - just before it risked becoming a gold shopping mall. All the jewellery is sold by weight and priced according to carat. The difference is a mere 1 per cent tax which makes it a decidedly attractive buy. There is an additional charge of Dh4-Dh15 per gramme for smithed work - either done by hand in India and shipped to Dubai or machined locally - with the price depending on the work involved. Most merchants also deal in precious stones and pearls, for which Dubai was once famous although for many years the latter have been mainly cultivated and from Japan. You can be assured that, if you are told that a stone is a diamond it will not turn out to be cut glass. The shops in the souk are closely monitored and trade descriptions are checked.</p>

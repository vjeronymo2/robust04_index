			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Special Report on Clocks, Watches and Jewellery: Gems glow amid the gloom - Antique Jewellery / Private buyers can still find bargains  -if they look beyond the hype DEALERS ALL over the world are still the strongest buyers of jewels and gems at auction, but one of the most distinctive characteristics of the antique jewellery market is the increasing number of private buyers in the salerooms. Period jewellery has been one of the most stable and steadily growing areas of the decorative arts in the last ten years. As the art market crumbled, jewels continued to glow in the economic gloom, thanks in part to these 'privates' who head regularly for the auction action in search of value for money and the opportunity to buy at 'trade' prices. The auction houses have encouraged this trend by organising big sales and producing more informative and temptingly glossy catalogues, with confidence-inspiring essays, footnotes and provenances. But, some might say, where does good background information end and saleroom hype begin? Since quality, authenticity and strong style count more than ever - whether rich Renaissance, designer Deco or even soulful Sixties - it is more important for customers to understand what they are buying, to distinguish the very best from the ordinary, to take expert advice and not to be blinded by hype. In the long run, the best 'bargains' are usually those fine and rare items that cost a substantial amount of money. However, 'cult' or 'personality' sales of pieces once owned by, say, the Duchess of Windsor, Elton John or Diana Dors can add an inflated premium to goods which may not be able to sustain their high prices second time around on the market. Limited supplies of the right goods have also kept prices buoyant, and at the same time connoisseurs have become more knowledgeable and discriminating. Contrary to general belief, newly impoverished owners are not selling their treasures; they sell run-of-the-mill goods to pay the bills. When the best examples make it on to the counter or into the shop window; they are snapped up by the trade. Salerooms attract a lot of the fine jewels on the market. They also provide excitement, entertainment and the ideal place to see, handle and learn about jewellery. However, dealers will still pay good prices, in or out of the salerooms, for desirable merchandise. That elusive bargain is now more than likely to be lurking on London's Bond Street. In spite of recent adverse publicity, period diamond jewels are the best sellers, but the price has to be right and the quality and style good. Eighteenth century diamond jewellery is still somewhat undervalued, although in March at Sotheby's sale of 'Jewels for the Collector' a simple but stunning pair of 18th century drop earrings, thought in the trade to be worth around Pounds 15,000, fetched Pounds 52,100 as two private buyers battled it out. So much for trade prices. Here wearability and fashion content come into play. Decorative, stylish earrings of all ages are much sought-after; chokers are back in style again, bows always sell well. At Sotheby's, again in March, fashion-followers plumped for 1970s style rainbow bead necklaces. Last October, the success of the Charsky collection of antique jewellery at Christie's highlighted not only the eagerness for fresh goods but also the unbeatable, wearable charm and craftsmanship of early 19th century sentimental jewellery, layered with symbols and motifs, intricately worked in coloured gold and shy gemstones. Last December Sandra Cronan of Burlington Arcade held a successful exhibition of cufflinks, desirable because of their style and usefulness and, because of their small size, relatively reasonable prices. Tiaras, however beautiful, have to be versatile and earn their keep as necklaces too, to realise strong prices. Even among High Victorian gold and gemset jewellery interesting earrings are hard to find and easy to sell. They are also subject to reproduction. Signatures still count for a great deal, from the 19th century revivalists, such as Giuliano and Castellani, especially rare today, through the ever-popular Cartier and Tiffany to 1950s stars such as Sterle, Verdura, Schlumberger. Bulgari is synonymous with quality and chic and even pieces from the 1960s and 1970s have cachet. But since Christie's Geneva specialist Cartier sale last May (to be repeated this May) there are signs that buyers are carefully distinguishing between good and average examples of any one maker and no longer simply buying a name. Overall, it is a realistic and selective market, with anything rare, fine and historically important and stylish selling at strong prices whether at the Pounds 500 or Pounds 50,000 level. Less spectacular jewels, if pretty and fashionable, sell at just the right price. This sorting out could be one of the benefits of the recession, for as David Callaghan, of Hancocks London, says: 'When the recession ends, what we are worried about is average things fetching inflated prices.'</p>

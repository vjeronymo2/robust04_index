			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE HEARS FINAL ARGUMENTS IN MURDER TRIAL  </P> <P> "Murder -- Whatdunit."  </P> <P> "The Perfect Crime."  </P> <P> "The Anarchist's Cookbook."  </P> <P> "The Joy of Cold Revenge" and "The Revenge Book."  </P> <P> Why would someone have those books, books detailing how to kill without getting  caught, unless they were going to murder someone, prosecutor Larry Burns argued  during closing statements Thursday in the murder trial of David Scott Harrison.  </P> <P> Harrison is accused of first-degree murder in the Feb. 17, 1988, killing of his  ex-wife, Anne Jenkins, one month after she and her new husband, Gary Jenkins,  won $727,000 in the California Lottery.  </P> <P> "Our society rewards success," Burns said. "But there is one form of success  for which this society has no reward . . . for the one who kills their victim  and leaves no physical evidence."  </P> <P> "That is the reward that David Harrison is seeking in this case for his success  in murdering Anne Jenkins and leaving no evidence of his crime at the scene,"  said Burns, who concedes he has no evidence placing Harrison at the scene.  </P> <P> But defense attorney Alan May, in beginning his closing argument, accused Burns  of playing "a shell game" with testimony.  </P> <P> May also argued that Burns was trying to turn from the presumption of innocence  to "guilty until proven innocent."  </P> <P> "Mr. Burns is saying, '(Harrison) is trying to get away with the perfect crime  and that's why we have no (direct) evidence. If you find him not guilty, you  are rewarding him for the crime, so assume him guilty,' " May told the judge,  who is deciding the non-jury trial. "But that's not the law."  </P> <P> The defense will finish its closing arguments today, and Judge David B. Moon is  expected to deliver a verdict immediately afterward.  </P> <P> In Burns' closing, he detailed the stormy relationship between Jenkins and  Harrison since their 1982 divorce: Constant court battles over custody of their  two children and alimony, Harrison's bombing of the van belonging to Gary  Jenkins' first wife, and Harrison's constant harassment of Jenkins, her husband  and her father.  </P> <P> "He indeed had a motive to kill Anne Jenkins on the day she was killed . . .  and he alone had such a motive," Burns said, as Harrison sat, his head on his  hand, eyes closed. "In this case, the motive was overwhelming . . . and that  motive was (at its) pinnacle on the day she was killed."  </P> <P> Burns said Harrison's actions between the time of their divorce and the killing  demonstrated an escalation of violence against Jenkins and her family, and he  maintained the surge followed the books on violence that Harrison owned.  </P> <P> "It starts with petty, sophomoric pranks, and it escalates to more severe  things, to bombings," Burns said.  </P> <P> Burns depicted the slightly built Harrison as "someone fascinated with murder,"  "an inveterate liar" and having "an insatiable desire . . . to punish Anne  Jenkins . . . to beat down his wife."  </P> <P> "The usual motives have been ruled out," Burns said, noting that there was no  sign of burglary, robbery or sexual assault. "There is no explanation for this  crime. If not David Harrison, pray tell, who did this?"  </P> <P> Harrison had the means to kill, too, Burns contended, pointing out the  collection of how-to books on committing crimes that Harrison tried to hide  three days before the killing took place.  </P> <P> Burns accused Harrison of trying to commit "The Immaculate Murder," a chapter  in one of the books.  </P> <P> "But he bungled it. He made aspirations to the perfect crime, but he made  mistakes," Burns said. "He talked too much afterwards. He thought he was  committing the perfect crime, but he failed."  </P> <P> Burns pointed out that three days before the killing Harrison had told a good  friend to "watch the news, something big is going to happen."  </P> <P> "That is the most salient piece of evidence in this case, aside from the bag  (of books on murder)," Burns said. "What was he predicting? What was going to  happen?"  </P> <P> "It's all consistent. The seeds that were sown four, five years ago came to  fruition in February of 1988."  </P> <P> In May's closing, however, he argued that by that time, the things that made  Harrison hate Jenkins, the custody and alimony battles, had been resolved and  Harrison had nothing to gain through the murder.  </P> <P> "Why not just take the kids and run?" May said. "He may have wanted to kill her  at some point. He may have talked about it at some point. But what did he have  to gain?"  </P> <P> "At the time of the killing, he probably had less motive for killing than he  had in five years."  </P> <P> May also said that motives for Jenkins' murder could be attached to several  people.  </P></p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Amnesty says women tortured in Tunisia HUNDREDS of women have been detained, harassed and intimidated in Tunisia over the past two years, according to a report published today by the London-based human rights organisation, Amnesty International, writes Francis Ghiles. The report also says that 'scores (of women) were tortured, ill-treated, beaten and sexually abused and threatened with rape in the ministry of the interior and police stations where torture and ill-treatment of men detainees had become routine.' Initially, women were targeted by the Tunisian security forces because they were relatives of the now-banned Al Nahda (Renaissance) movement. However, the report adds that 'since the middle of 1992, women activists and the wives of activists of the Parti Communiste des Ouvriers Tunisiens have been subjected to the same pattern of human rights violations.' Amnesty fears that as long as the Tunisian government 'refuses to recognise the widespread nature of these violations, including the fact that torture and ill-treatment are systematic, then these violations will continue and the circle of repression will widen further.'</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / PIA plan attacked by Pru chief MR MICK Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, Britain's largest life insurer, said the company would be an 'unwilling' participant in a proposed new self-regulating body if a current blueprint it was considering is adopted. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, said that a report commissioned by the board of the proposed new Personal Investment Authority and carried out by Sir Brian Jenkins far exceeded the remit of a self-regulating body. Speaking at the Financial Times Conference on Retail Regulation, Mr Newmarch renewed his call for direct statutory regulation of the financial services industry and abolition of the self-regulating framework. He urged the adoption of a structure similar to that used to regulate Britain's building societies, saying that regulators needed certain powers now prohibited to them such as the ability to ban the sale of inherently flawed products. After the conference, Mr Newmarch said he doubted that the new PIA would come to fruition and that the Prudential would not participate unless the majority of industry participants joined on a voluntary basis. Separately, Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, told the conference he had established a joint working party on disclosure with Fimbra and Lautro, the two self-regulating bodies for retail financial services. The working party will consider, among other things, recommendations from the Office of Fair Trading on disclosure as well as a proposal from an SIB consultant, Mr Tim Miller, to help consumers better understand the costs of the products they buy. Mr Large said it had become evident that the disclosure regime for life insurance products proposed by the SIB last year did not go far enough in meeting consumers' desire for more information. 'But simply calling for more information is not the answer,' he said. Mr Large added that he did not intend to approve the PIA as a self-regulating body unless it met the tough new standards in raising investor protection he set out in a letter to the PIA board earlier this year.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown joins Scottish pressure for Rosyth inquiry MR GORDON BROWN, the shadow chancellor, joined Scottish industrial lobbyists yesterday in urging an inquiry into allegations of Ministry of Defence bias against the Rosyth naval dockyard in favour of Devonport. His demand follows reports that the Scottish yard was poorly advised by the MoD on refurbishment so as to prejudice its chances in a crucial battle with Devonport over warship and nuclear sub-marine refitting contracts. With a decision on the contracts imminent, campaigners for Rosyth - Scotland's largest single employer - are lobbying parliament today prior to a series of protests and demonstrations in Scotland. They say that failure to win the submarine contract would cost the Scottish economy 18,000 jobs and up to Pounds 10bn. Yesterday, Mr Brown demanded an inquiry into the bias allegations within the MoD alongside independent investigations by the defence and Scottish select committees of the Commons. Labour MPs are also questioning the links between Mr George Allin, a leading MoD civil servant in charge of the refitting department, and Brown and Root, the US engineering company that holds a 30 per cent stake in Devonport's management company. The MoD has pointed out that while Mr Allin worked on secondment for the US company, he had also worked at the Rosyth dockyard for three years in the early 1980s. An initial contract expected to lead to a Pounds 100m computer order for the British Army has been awarded to a consortium led by Bull Information Systems, UK subsidiary of Groupe Bull of France, David White writes. Bull won the Pounds 1m trials contract against two other consortia, one led by Hewlett-Packard and including British Telecommunications, the other headed by the computer services company EDS-Scicon. The Unicom system will provide the Army with an integrated computer network for the administration of personnel, training, pay, catering, stores and equipment.</p>

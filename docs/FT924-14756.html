			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Observer: Forecasting nostalgia Certain recent events have put rather a damper on today's celebrations of the second anniversary of the UK joining the European exchange rate mechanism. But it is good to know that, even though Britain is no longer a member of the club, life in the Treasury still goes on as if nothing had happened. Take for instance one of its leading economists, Rod Whittaker, who over the past year has been working to build ERM membership into the Treasury's computerised economic model which is an essential tool in forecasting. The mere fact that Britain has now left, with no immediate prospect of rejoining, has not been enough to put him off his stride. Indeed, a paper from the indefatigable Whittaker on his not-quite finished project - entitled 'Simulating Economic Policy Within the ERM' - is to be presented at a conference in London on December 1. Who knows, if only he had finished his work on the model before Black Wednesday, we might now be celebrating today's anniversary instead of ignoring it.</p>

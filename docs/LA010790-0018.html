			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM THE SOIL -- AND SOUL -- OF AMERICA;  </P> <P> AWASH IN A SEA OF FAITH THE CHRISTIANIZATION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, 1550-1865  BY JON BUTLER (HARVARD PRESS: $19.90; 347 PP.);  </P> <P> THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF AMERICAN CHRISTIANITY BY NATHAN O. HATCH (YALE  UNIVERSITY PRESS: $25; 312 PP.; 0-300-4470-4)  </P> <P> St. Paul, an astute observer of things religious, pointed out to the skeptical  Athenians that they were "in every way . . . a very religious people."  Professors Jon Butler and Nathan O. Hatch, impressively astute in their studies  of religion in America, offer fresh insights and substantial documentation  regarding the pervasive religiosity of the American people. While they  concentrate on earlier periods in American history and deal primarily with  Protestant Christianity, they do shed new light on the overall picture and on  the American religious scene today.  </P> <P> As with the religious beliefs and practices of the Athenians, those of the  American people are, as these studies substantiate, bewilderingly complex. As  something of a foil in his story of the complex process of the Christianization  of Americans, Butler includes informative treatments of magic, the occult and  similar "heterodox" phenomena. Hatch focuses much of his attention on different  individuals such as Francis Asbury, the pioneering Methodist bishop; Joseph  Smith, the Mormon prophet; Richard Allen, the founder of the African Methodist  Episcopal Church, and Alexander Campbell, leading figure in the shaping of the  Christian or Disciples of Christ movement.  </P> <P> Fresh insights? Hatch devotes attention to such significant phenomena as the  development of American gospel music, an important story that is generally  slighted among scholars. And Butler attends to "the religious landscape" -- the  changing architectural manifestations of religion in America -- another area  largely overlooked in studies of religion in America.  </P> <P> What is most refreshing about these works, then, is that they eschew the more  typical way of dealing with religion in America in terms of elites and  organizations, and concentrate instead on the religious beliefs and practices  of the people. Theirs is a story of the laicization of religion, religion in  and as populist movements, religion sprung from the American soil and soul.  </P> <P> Hence, Butler, e.g., takes on the generally accepted view of the primacy of the  Puritans and the dominating influence of the "so-called Great Awakening" of the  1740s in the larger story of religion in America. Similarly, Hatch sees the  Second Great Awakening, the usual designation for an outburst of Evangelical  revivals in the early years of the new republic, as being more divisive than  unifying, more identified with what Alexis de Tocqueville, French observer of  American democracy in the early 1830s, called the "seething mobility" of people  and ideas than with any singleness of purpose or character. These American  migrants -- "adventurers," Tocqueville called them -- were "impatient of any  yoke, greedy for wealth, and often outcasts . . . . There is nothing of  tradition, family feeling or example to restrain them."  </P> <P> The most common religious feature among these emerging Americans was their  desire to begin anew, to build their own religion or to find that religion  which, stripped of nonessentials, consisted of nothing more or less than the  straight line to the supernatural and to salvation.  </P> <P> That route typically involved not only thinking for oneself but experiencing of  oneself. And above all, it required relying on and interpreting for oneself  that rock-bottom source, the Bible. "I have endeavored to read the Scriptures  as though no one had read them before me," asserted Alexander Campbell. (A  common claim of those active in the Christian movement of the early 19th  Century was: "Where the New Testament speaks, we speak; where the New Testament  is silent, we are silent.")  </P> <P> Paradoxically, this reliance on self produced not only the rich variety of  expressions that one might expect but also some highly disciplined and even  centralized and authoritarian movements.  </P> <P> Butler stresses "the role of authority and coercion in advancing Christianity  in America." Hatch points out that while his book is "about popular religion  (it) focuses, ironically, upon elites" -- i.e., "upon those persons who rose to  leadership positions in a wide range of popular American churches and religious  movements."  </P> <P> These leaders were not of the elite in a class or social sense; they were of  the people. Individuals of considerable native abilities who were remarkably  attuned to popular sentiment, they had the capacity to mobilize that sentiment  into powerful popular movements that became lasting organizations: Baptist,  Methodist, Christian, African Methodist, Mormon and others.  </P> <P> Tocqueville noted in amazement of such American religious leaders that "where I  expect to find a priest I find a politician." These were not "organization men"  in a narrow sense. They understood their parish, as John Wesley understood his,  to include the whole world. Religion was for them a public as well as a private  matter.  </P> <P> The popular Baptist leader, John Leland, after a prominent public career in  support of religious liberty and in opposition to slavery in Virginia, returned  in 1791 to New England, where he served two terms in the Massachusetts  Legislature. A generation later, Peter Cartwright, famed Methodist  circuit-rider, served two terms in the Illinois Legislature and, in 1846, ran  for U.S. Congress. (He was defeated by none other than Abraham Lincoln.) In  1844, Joseph Smith sought to become President of the United States. (He was  martyred before the election.)  </P> <P> Political ambition and activity is not a new phenomenon among American  religious leaders. Indeed, there are echoes of these early Evangelical types  among the popular preachers, the televangelists, and the clerical candidates  for public office in our time.  </P> <P> Possibly the most significant aspect of the rise of Christianity as a popular  movement was the emergence of Afro-American Christianity. Butler traces the  roots of this striking phenomenon to what he calls "the African spiritual  holocaust," brought on by the brutal uprooting that characterized the slave  system. Into the resulting spiritual vacuum poured the balm purveyed by the  most popular of the Christian movements following the American Revolution --  the Methodist and the Baptist.  </P> <P> Both were, in that period, strongly anti-slavery, and both freely approached  blacks, as they did whites, with their popular message and the means for  conveying that message. However, as Butler points out, these movements  exhibited "a fundamental paradox within Evangelical Protestantism: its  egalitarian character and its racism."  </P> <P> Hence, while blacks were attracted to the Evangelical message, they rejected  the organizational medium and, where possible, established their own. The  result was an emerging Afro-American Christianity similar to white American  Evangelical Christianity and yet clearly distinctive. Within the Afro-American  community, the church became the most significant institution and the preacher  the most powerful figure. As W. E. B. DuBois observed in his description of  black religion at the end of the 19th Century, the preacher was "the most  unique personality developed by the Negro on American soil. A leader, a  politician, an orator, a 'boss,' an intriguer, an idealist -- all these he is,  and ever too, the center of a group of men, now twenty, now a thousand in  number."  </P> <P> These volumes might be faulted for the fact that there is little about women in  them and even less about Roman Catholicism. Relying on the 1833 memoirs of  Nancy Towle, a young New Hampshire schoolteacher who became "a relentless  preacher on the move," Hatch notes that women preachers appeared among  Christians, Freewill Baptists, Universalists and Methodists. Women were not  allowed leadership roles in the denominations that emerged from these  movements. Yet women later capitalized on the impulses and techniques that  emerged in the popular religious movement of the early republic.  </P> <P> Something would appear to be missing in volumes that carry titles such as these  do but largely ignore the Roman Catholic community. There were democratizing  trends within that community in the early 19th Century. And by 1865, the  terminal date of Butler's volume, the Roman Catholic Church had become the  largest single Christian denomination in America.  </P> <P> This oversight may be explained by the authors' focus on laicization and  popularization. Despite the fact that lay people did play an increasing role in  local church affairs, no shortcut to the ordained priesthood opened within  Roman Catholicism. That office remained under the control of the bishop and  continued to require systematic training over a relatively long period of time.  As a result, there was a scarcity of priests and many were recruited from  Europe.  </P> <P> Despite these lacunae, these volumes are timely and valuable. They provide  salutary reminders that the story of religion in America is not one of decline  and stagnation but one of ferment and fertility.  </P></p>

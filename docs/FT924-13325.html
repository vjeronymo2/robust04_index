			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Luanda fireball A big military ammunition depot explodes yesterday near the international airport in the north-east of the city, adding to tensions in Angola after the 16-year civil war, Reuter reports. Three soldiers of the former rebel movement Unita have been blamed for causing the blast by firing shells at the depot, according to Angolan radio. Meanwhile, Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita leader, is expected to fly to Luanda today for talks with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos aimed at averting renewed civil war. South Africa has made an aircraft available to fly Mr Savimbi from his stronghold of Huambo. Mr Savimbi said final results of last month's elections showed Mr dos Santos got less than 50 per cent of the votes and a run-off ballot would be held between the two men. He renewed his accusation that there was fraud in the elections.</p>

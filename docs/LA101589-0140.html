			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO. 3 COLORADO BREEZES, 52-17;  </P> <P> KEY PLAYER: ERIC BIENIEMY OF BISHOP AMAT HIGH, COLORADO'S LEADING RUSHER,  SUFFERS A BROKEN RIGHT LEG.  </P> <P> Colorado was almost perfect Saturday.  </P> <P> The third-ranked Buffaloes had the ball 10 times in their Big Eight Conference  game against Iowa State and scored on eight of those possessions in blowing  past the Cyclones, 52-17.  </P> <P> Led by quarterback Darian Hagan, who ran for two touchdowns and passed for two  others, Colorado scored on all seven of its first-half possessions in building  a 45-10 lead and also scored the only time it had the ball in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> "Imagine seeing that team and knowing there's two more like it," said Iowa  State Coach Jim Walden, whose team plays Nebraska and Oklahoma the next two  weeks. "I wish I was in the Big Ten.  </P> <P> "That's a good team, a really good team. You saw the best football team in the  country today. Those are full-grown men out there, and they've got a lot of  them and they're fast."  </P> <P> It might have been a costly victory, however, because Colorado's leading  rusher, Eric Bieniemy from Bishop Amat High School in La Puente, broke a bone  in his lower right leg in the first half. Colorado trainers did not know how  long Bieniemy will be out.  </P> <P> Colorado, 6-0 overall and 2-0 in the Big Eight, did not have to punt and didn't  have any turnovers. The Buffaloes gave the ball up once on downs and allowed  the clock to run out the last time their offense was on the field.  </P> <P> All of Colorado's first-half scoring drives lasted less than four minutes, the  longest taking 3:42 and the shortest 37 seconds. Hagan ran and passed for 269  of Colorado's 422 total yards in the first half, then sat out the second half.  </P> <P> "I'm not worried about his stamina," Colorado Coach Bill McCartney said. "He  gets plenty of plays in practice. It strengthens the team to be able to  substitute at quarterback and every position.  </P> <P> "Our second units are getting stronger and I know that's what we need going  into the end of the season."  </P> <P> Colorado set school records with its 45 points in the first half and 35 in the  second quarter. The old records for points in a half and quarter were 41 and 27  in a 55-7 victory over Northwestern in 1978.  </P> <P> "Obviously, we're pleased with the win, especially after the way the game  started," McCartney said. "You have to give Iowa State credit. They had a  masterful game plan. They do a good job with the players they have."  </P> <P> Iowa State (3-3, 1-1) was tied with Colorado, 10-10, early in the second  period. But Colorado had two touchdown drives that took less than 3 1/2  minutes, then capitalized on two interceptions and a fumble to break the game  open.  </P></p>

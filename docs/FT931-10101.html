			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Globex system gains approval for Japan trade GLOBEX, the Chicago-based electronic derivatives trading system, has received formal approval to begin trading in Japan. This will help the system fulfil its initial objective to be a round-the-clock vehicle for futures trading. The lack of terminals in Japan has hampered Globex since its launch last summer, according to Mr Leo Melamed, chairman. The system was designed to allow traders to pass their derivatives 'book' around the globe, around the clock. Japan's absence interrupted the flow of that trading, leaving a gap in the Asian time zone, Mr Melamed said. Globex volume has been averaging just 3,000 contracts a day and negotiations to add non-US futures exchanges to the system have lagged. Globex is jointly owned by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and Reuters Holdings. So far about 80 per cent of the around 200 active Globex terminals are installed in the US, with the remainder in London and Paris. Globex officials said 28 terminals will be installed in the offices of CME and CBOT member firms in Tokyo, and that trading on those terminals should begin soon. They said additional terminals would be activated in Hong Kong during March, and in Geneva later this spring. Notional principal amount of foreign currency and interest rate swaps exceeded Dollars 1,470bn in the six months ended June, 1992, up 44 per cent, according to the International Swap Dealers Association. However, despite the overall gain, foreign currency swap volume declined. Interest rate swaps accounted for Dollars 1,320bn (up 53 per cent) and currency swaps Dollars 156bn (down 7 per cent), ISDA said.</p>

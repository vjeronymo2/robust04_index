			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Cages 'cause extreme suffering' to battery hens Battery cages cause extreme suffering to egg-laying hens, a government adviser on animal health has found after a wide-ranging review of scientific evidence. Mr Mike Baxter, director of Brunel University's Design Centre, concluded that hens suffer in a number of ways by not being able to perform natural functions in very small cages. His report, published today, is likely to add to pressure on the government to restrict battery farming. Groups such as the animal welfare society the RSPCA have long campaigned for battery farming to be banned. About 85 per cent - or 40m - of Britain's egg-laying hens are kept in battery cages. Last month the Commons agriculture committee in a report on the poultry industry concluded that a ban on battery cages would not be a realistic propo-sition. The committee said: 'Non-cage systems have their own welfare drawbacks and any wholesale switch to alternative systems would not necessarily enhance the overall welfare of laying hens.' The government says it is pushing Brussels to review European Union rules on battery hens. New regulations come into force in January, increasing the amount of space each hen must have from 450 sq cm to 600 sq cm. The egg industry has said that the costs of any further changes in the regulations would be too great a burden. Mr Baxter, who sits on the government's Farm Animal Welfare Council, says in his report in The Veterinary Record that hens are unable to perform natural nesting functions in a wire mesh cage. There is nowhere for them to perch, they cannot indulge in dust-bathing or foraging and their bones are weakened by lack of movement. The Farm Animal Welfare Council was set up by the government in 1979 as an independent body to advise on legislation. The council has not yet made any official recommendations on battery hens.</p>

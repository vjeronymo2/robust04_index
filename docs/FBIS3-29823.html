Students of the people's schools, kindergartens, and nursery  schools and their parents, who received gifts of love, cried,  because they were greatly touched by the party's benevolence of  showing care equally to the students in remote islands, as well  as to the students on the land.    Upholding the great leader's [suryong] noble intent of  getting the greatest happiness in loving and caring for the  future generation -- flower of the class, flower of the nation,  and flower of mankind -- and under our party's benevolence of  showing all love and consideration for the future of fatherland  and revolution, helicopters have delivered gifts to  approximately 80 islands a year for 10 years in February.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il established, without  sparing money, a school on an island where only one or two  children live, who should go to the people's school; sent modern  transport ships there; and provided a helicopter in winter when  the ship cannot operate. This proud reality is not only the  great appearance created by the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il's human-loving politics, but also a clear demonstration  of the superiority of the socialism of our country centered on  the popular masses.</p>

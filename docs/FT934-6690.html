			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Arafat leaves aid council Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, has withdrawn as regular chairman of the economic council he set up to channel foreign development aid to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, PLO officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Tunis. Palestinian economic experts and some potential donors had criticised the original structure of the council, saying it had too many politicians and not enough experts. Mr Arafat will now chair only an advisory council which will meet about twice a year to set strategy. The economic council, the Economic Council for Development and Con-struction, is now divided into two institutions - the advisory council chaired by Mr Arafat and a board of governors to run day-to-day affairs.</p>

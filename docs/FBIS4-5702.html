			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Feelings of reverence  for the great leader President Kim Il-song are growing deeper  among the South Korean people on the occasion of his birthday.    A professor surnamed Choe at Seoul National University told  his colleagues that his feelings of attachment to President Kim  Il-song grow more intense whenever the significant April 15  comes.    He said:    "Reverence for President Kim Il-song is a cherished  unanimous  feeling not only of our intellectuals but of other strata of  people.    "He is a peerless patriot and the benevolent sun of our  nation who has heralded the epoch of our nation's cause of  independence and takes a warm care of our people.    "It is an obligation of our nation, therefore, to celebrate  the 15th of April as the greatest auspicious holiday of the  nation and deeply respect him."    An old man residing in Seoul said to his family:    "The birth of General Kim Il-song marked the beginning of  the rebirth of the lost three thousand-ri homeland and our  nation has since come to shed bright rays in the east with  eternal vitality as a dignified nation.    "His birth was not only a great auspicious event for our  nation but an honour of mankind."    A designer surnamed Kim in Chongro district, Seoul, told his  colleagues:    "The general is, indeed, a legendary hero of the  anti-Japanese war and the benefactor of the national rebirth who  saved our country from the national ruin.    "Since we have the general, our country will surely be  reunified, and the day will surely come when our people will  live under his administration."</p>

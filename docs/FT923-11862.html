			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Arts: Montreal Jazz Festival IT would be difficult to imagine a more successful festival on any level than this year's Montreal international jazz festival. Held earlier this month, it not only attracted street crowds estimated at 1.3m, but it also showed how a musical form that originated with black performers in the southern US has gone on to influence a variety of styles. The festival was a tribute to the diversity of jazz, ranging from the blues and boogie riffs of John Lee Hooker, the soaring tenor sax of Sonny Rollins and the guitar wizardry of Al Dimeola, to the Sinatra-like vocals and arrangements of John Pizzarelli and the piano of Oliver Jones and Paul Bley. It also stretched musical boundaries, to include hard rock (the Jeff Healey band) and world beat (King Sunny Ade). There were indoor performances at the Place des Arts, the concert hall where Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra traditionally hold court, while several streets in the centre were closed to accommodate massive crowds at free evening concerts. Festival founders Andre Menard and Alain Simard deserve much of the credit for laying on such a musical outpouring in Montreal, a city which had a rich jazz and blues history in the 40s and 50s. The performances themselves testified to the organisers' ability to attract some of the top artists from across the jazz spectrum. Montreal jazz audiences are noted for their sophistication, so the musicians enjoy the venue as a place where they can reach the true aficionado. Heading the festival was the much-heralded appearance of John Lee Hooker, marking a stop on what the black boogie master has described 'as my last tour'. At the age of 74, Hooker's guitar work has slowed to a brief series of nasty riffs, but his voice has not deserted him. Stepping on stage in dark sunglasses and a Thirties-style hat, Hooker sang and played a number of classic tunes. Most remarkable was a version of 'Crawling Kingsnake' that revived memories of the ageing bluesman's powerful legacy. 'There's not a lot of us left,' said Hooker, acknowledging that most of the great performers of his era - John Coltrane and Thelonius Monk, for example - have been dead for many years. Hooker's set was preceded by a lively session from Charles Brown, a marvellous piano player who has laboured largely in obscurity over the years. Although he is only four years younger than Hooker, Brown's piano playing was impressively animated and his singing just as outstanding. Brown and his four-piece band tore through a series of blues, jazz and boogie selections that left the audience, almost all of whom had come to hear Hooker, begging for more. Not as inspired however was the concert given by Branford Marsalis (brother of the much-deified Wynton), which had none of the energy and rapport with the crowd that the much older Brown and Hooker were able to generate. Without question, Marsalis is a virtuoso saxophonist, yet his Montreal session lacked the electricity his reputation might have suggested. This jazzman was simply too cool. One of the great discoveries of the festival was John Pizzarelli, who played nightly at the Club Soda, a 300-seat venue whose intimate surroundings perfectly suited the ebullient lounge-lizard charisma of Pizzarelli. The 32-year-old American performed with the effortless grace of a Sinatra and moved through classic tunes such as 'My Baby Just Cares for Me', 'My Blue Heaven', and 'The More I See You', with such poise that one felt thrown back to an earlier era of big bands, bobby-soxers, and the crooners of yesterday. Pizzarelli's shows were sold out continuously through the festival, and local reviewers were wildly enthusiastic about his musical grace and abundant charm. His father was Bucky Pizzarelli, a noted guitarist who played with Benny Goodman and whose living-room guests often included Joe Pass, Zoot Sims, and Les Paul. 'I grew up with Forties music in the house, so it just became a part of me,' said the younger Pizzarelli. Other highlights of the festival included the magnificent improvisational sets of Montreal-born pianist Paul Bley, George Benson's smooth guitar set, and a hellish session from Sonny Rollins, generally acknowledged as the finest tenor sax player of his generation. Rollins' eerie intensity enthralled the sold-out hall, many of whose spectators had waited to hear Rollins again, three years after his last performance at the festival. It takes a musician of Rollins' rare genius to show that music can reach new levels of mood and meaning when played with such hypnotic touch. Every festival needs an artist of this dimension, and the Montreal event, as on every other count, did not disappoint.</p>

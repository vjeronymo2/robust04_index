			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Personal View: Taxing the skilled to cut unemployment 'If there were a miracle cure, it would not have gone unnoticed.' True enough, Mr Delors. The problem is getting the patients to take the pills. Unemployment is a complex disease, and the Group of Seven ministers at next week's jobs summit should recognise that the cure involves three sorts of treatment. Two can be temporary: a dose of reflation; and some physiotherapy to help the jobless back into work. But the third treatment, to reduce the huge structural component of unemployment, is like insulin: we will have to go on taking it for a long time. Regarding the diagnosis of the structural unemployment problem, there is now widespread consensus on three basic points: The main cause is a fall in demand for unskilled labour, relative to skilled labour, in conjunction with labour market institutions that put a floor under unskilled wages. Removing this floor would not solve the problem, just change its form (from European-style open unemployment into American-style working poverty or withdrawal into crime). Better education and training, to reduce the supply of unskilled labour, is a vital part of the solution, but will only work slowly - over decades, not years. So what else is to be done in the meantime? The answer for Europe is to find ways of boosting relative demand for unskilled workers without reducing their wages. Government job creation schemes could help. But making taxes on employment strongly progressive would have a larger effect. In other words, we should make the employer's national insurance (or, on the continent, social security) contribution a steeply rising percentage of the employee's wage. The effect of a progressive payroll tax is to widen the gap between the cost of employing skilled and unskilled workers, and hence to increase the relative profitability of less skill-intensive products and processes. The tax thus simulates the demand-side effects of the wider wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers which have enabled employment to rise more rapidly in the US, while permitting the gap between the wages received by skilled and unskilled workers to remain limited by European notions of fairness. Progressive payroll taxes are not new. Prompted by Richard Layard of the London School of Economics, the UK in 1985 reduced employer's NI contribution rates for the lowest-paid workers, and the last budget further cut these reduced rates - which apply to the bottom quarter of all full-time employees. The recent EU white paper urges the same approach for other EU countries, in eight of which payroll taxes are now regressive. The white paper also wants more subsidies for unskilled employment. The problem with tax reductions and subsidies for low-paid workers is how to finance them, though part of the cost is recouped by reduced outlays on unemployment benefits. An attractive, symmetrical solution is to increase the rates of tax on higher-paid workers. As well as balancing the books, raising taxes on skilled labour amplifies the desired increase in relative demand for unskilled labour. Collecting higher taxes on skilled workers is also much simpler administratively than subsidising unskilled workers. An obvious objection is that we should not discourage skilled employment at a time when Europe needs to upgrade its industrial skills to meet international competition. This concern is largely misplaced - with an appropriate amount of reflation (to absorb the formerly unemployed) a progressive payroll tax would not reduce the absolute numbers of skilled workers employed, even though the ratio of skilled to unskilled workers would fall (as with all other ways of reducing unskilled unemployment). There is, however, a more subtle and more valid objection, which is that anything that cuts unemployment among unskilled workers while maintaining their wages will reduce incentives to acquire skills and thus undermine efforts to improve education and training. This disincentive may be mild, since skill acquisition is the outcome of chance as much as choice and the chances of children getting a decent education are reduced if their parents are unemployed. But it probably exists. The issue is whether the benefits of lower unemployment outweigh the costs of lower incentives to acquire skills. Most Europeans would say yes. The progressive payroll tax is not a free prescription, but it is worth paying for.

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Bank offers money transfer service TIPA-NET, a low-cost method of transferring money between European countries, is being introduced by Co-operative Bank in the UK and a number of other European co-operative banks. The service comes in response to calls from Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community competition commissioner, and the European Commission for cheaper and easier methods of cross-border payment. Customers will pay Pounds 5 per transaction to have funds sent to France, Belgium, Germany, and Italy within four to seven working days. Canada is also included in the service which guarantees customers that currency conversions will be made at reasonable rates. Business customers will be able to transfer money through Tipa-Net at negotiated bulk rates well below the Pounds 5 charge. Co-operative Bank said yesterday that it expected the service to be used by insurance and pension companies, mail order businesses and publishers. Mr Gordon Younger, executive director of Co-operative Bank, said: 'From now on, everyone will know exactly how long it will take to make a cross-border payment and there will be one up-front payment of Pounds 5.' Co-operative Bank says that before introducing the service it experimented by sending payments of Pounds 100 from the seven largest UK clearing banks to accounts in Paris and Brussels. Charges made in the UK on the transfer to Paris ranged from Pounds 23.34, made by NatWest, to Pounds 5 from TSB and Pounds 8 from the Bank of Scotland, with most banks charging between Pounds 11 and Pounds 16.</p>

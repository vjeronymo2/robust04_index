			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Automagic returns to the black AUTOMAGIC Holdings, the shoe repairing and key cutting retail chain, returned to the black for the 28 weeks to January 9 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 76,000, against a loss of Pounds 436,000. The profit was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 91,000 (Pounds 55,000) relating to losses arising from the disposal of leasehold premises. Last year the USM-quoted company closed its dry cleaning factories, although it has yet to dispose of the premises, and closed a number of branches, the relevant leases being assigned during the period. Mr Mike Strom, chairman, said the first half performance was encouraging and although he did not necessarily expect the same contribution in the second half, the group continued to trade profitably and he remained optimistic for the outcome of the year as a whole. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 6.38m (Pounds 6.47m) but operating losses of Pounds 228,000 were replaced by profits of Pounds 273,000. Earnings per share were 0.9p against losses of 7p.</p>

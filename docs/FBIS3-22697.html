Presenting his ministry's  budget to Parliament yesterday, Mr. Temane said in the future  the country's health services might not be able to maintain  standards, as more and more resources get swallowed up by  AIDS-related services. He said alternative programs like  home-based care are being developed, but prevention remains the  best solution.

Between 30 and 40 patients  suffering from bloody diarrhea are being treated at the  Changalane Health Post. Nurse Helena Bila says the epidemic is  spreading because the people are using water from the Changalane  River without boiling it. (Maputo Radio Mozambique Network in  Portuguese 1030 GMT 14 Mar 94)    Dysentery -- A total of 25 people have died of dysentery in  Gaza Province over the past two months. Medical superintendent  Dr. Mario Marine said more than 6,500 cases of dysentery were  registered during the same period. Chokwe District was the most  affected with about 2,000 cases. Dr. Mario Marine said the  disease is mostly caused by bad hygiene and the consumption of  unclean water.

Dr. Hans Nel, district  surgeon for Gobabis, reports: "It is approximately the highest  prevalence rate of tuberculosis right now in the world. When we  started this study there were only 18 cases that we knew of that  were positive for tuberculosis. At the end of one year's study  and follow-up study there were 385 cases, which meant that there  was quite a large percentage of positive cases identified." "It  can pose a threat to the elimination of the Bushmen as a whole,  especially the fact that they are a small group in a community,  grouped together in a certain area in Namibia." (Johannesburg  Channel Africa Radio in English 1100 GMT 17 Mar 94)    Meningitis -- Josef Mothina writes that "mass immunisation  against the worst outbreak of meningitis in Namibia in 10 years  is to start this week. So far at least 150 cases of the killer  disease have been reported countrywide.

At the Tuberculosis Beyond 2000  conference in Pretoria on 14 March, Medical Research Council  spokesman Dr. Karin Weyer said "in the U.S., HIV infection had  been associated with outbreaks of multidrug-resistant TB. This  was cause for concern for SA, as the incidence of HIV was  increasing. However, while nearly all multidrug-resistant TB  patients in the U.S. were HIV positive, in SA the proportion was  only about 3 percent. Local estimates of multidrug-resistant TB  were low." (Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 15 Mar 94 p 2)  <H5>  Zimbabwe </H5>   AIDS -- The cumulative number of AIDS cases is estimated to  rise to more than 130,000 by the end of this year, according to  the National AIDS Coordination Program.

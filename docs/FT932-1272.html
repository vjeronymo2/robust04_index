			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Charter Consolidated buys its independence for Pounds 236m CHARTER Consolidated, the UK industrial group, has finally achieved its long-held goal of gaining independence from Anglo American Corporation, the South African mining group. It will obtain this through buying out the 36 per cent stake held by Minorco, Anglo American's Luxembourg-based investment company. Minorco is selling the stake for a loan note worth Pounds 235.5m, equivalent to 622p per share, a 1.9 per cent discount to Tuesday's mid-market price. Charter Consolidated shares closed 14p higher at 648p. Charter was able to fund the purchase from the Pounds 342m proceeds of its sale in February of a 38.3 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, which is also part of the 'family' of companies perceived to be influenced or controlled by Anglo American. Mr Jeff Herbert, Charter's managing director, said Charter's development as an international industrial group would be improved if there were no dominant shareholder. 'These proposals will truly establish Charter as an independent, industrial company which we will grow through acquisition and disciplined management. It is a logical step, following the sale of our stake in Johnson Matthey, and it will enhance earnings,' he said. After buying out Minorco, Charter, which yesterday reported an 11 per cent increase in annual operating profits to Pounds 31.3m, will have net cash of about Pounds 200m. The remaining Charter Consolidated shareholders will be issued with new shares, on a one-for-one basis, in a new holding company, Charter plc, which will listed in London and Johannesburg. Charter Consolidated said the change would benefit earnings per share both in the current year and the longer term. Shareholders in the new company would have proportionately increased interests in the group's existing businesses. About 14 per cent of Charter's shares would be owned by South Africans after the relisting. Mr Herbert was confident they would continue to support the stock, because Charter would offer the only 'rand hedge' stock on the Johannesburg exchange which was independent of other South African groups.

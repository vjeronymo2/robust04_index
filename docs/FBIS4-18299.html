			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Terminal Plight"] </F>   [Text] John Major's political fortunes have been  consistently in the doldrums since the general election two  years ago, his future as Tory leader constantly a matter for  speculation. The writing has been on the wall for the prime  minister for so long that it would be easy to dismiss the latest  crisis as just another setback. But the events of the past week  are not merely more of the same. The prime minister's stock has  plunged to such a low that the question which now dominates  discussion among senior Tories is no longer if Mr Major will be  forced to resign, but when. It is not just his enemies on the  right who believe he will have to go; the solid centre of the  Tory party is rapidly coming to the same conclusion. Even those  he can still count as friends and allies admit as much in  private, whatever their protestations of loyalty in public. It  is, of course, impossible to predict the manner and exact timing  of his demise. But that he will go seems now to be as likely as  anything can be in the uncertain world of politics, and probably  before the year is out.    Mr Major has been written off before, though his position  has  never been as dire as it is now. His remarkable resilience in  adversity and his steely determination to claw his way back from  hopeless positions may yet confound his critics. But we now  know enough about Mr Major's strengths and weaknesses to make  two safe conclusions: he and those around him are incapable of  mounting a credible strategy for a sustained recovery in his  political fortunes; and, even when things are looking up a bit  for him, he has the unerring knack of digging a hole for himself  and jumping into it. Taken together, they suggest his plight is  terminal.    Mr Major has made repeated attempts to relaunch himself,  usually through set-piece speeches to the Tory faithful; none  has got beyond the starting blocks, partly because rousing  speeches are not his forte. More fundamentally, he cannot bring  himself to draw a line under past mistakes and start again.  This has been seen above all in the crucial area of economic  policy. The chance to go for economic growth and jobs after  White Wednesday, the defining disaster of his administration  from which he has never really recovered when the pound was  ignominiously ejected from the European exchange-rate mechanism  (ERM), has been largely botched because Mr Major could not bring  himself to admit that his previous economic strategy was in  ruins and it was time for a fresh start. The price of his  desire to depict consistency and business as usual, when all  around him was erumbling, has been a stuttering, half-hearted  recovery which has left voters in a mood too curmudgeonly, after  a long, painful recession, to give the government any credit for  what economic growth there has been.    Mr Major's inability to shake off his past mistakes is  compounded by his facility for making new ones. When this  newspaper wrote that if he saw a banana skin on the other side  of the street he would cross over to slip on it, his supporters  said that was harsh and exaggerated. After the debacle over  European voting rights last week, when Mr Major created a drama  and then turned it into a crisis, all to no purpose, nobody can  now doubt its essential accuracy. But it was only the latest in  an impressive track record of finding banana skins to slip on  that a more astute politician would have easily avoided: from  pit closures to Europe to back-to- basics to the ERM to  promising tax cuts then imposing the biggest tax hike in British  history, Mr Major's habit has been to stake out untenable  positions, then retreat from them, leaving chaos and disillusion  in his wake. It is an unedifying, sometimes ludicrous, sight.  There are enough senior Tories concluding that it cannot  continue to make his days numbered.    A fair number of Tory MPs still believe their party would be  signing a suicide note if it changed leaders in mid-term for the  second time in four years. They have a point. The election of  a new leader would not necessarily transform the political scene  overnight. There would be no sudden revival of Tory fortunes in  the opinion polls, of the sort that occurred when Margaret  Thatcher was deposed. But a majority of Tory MPs, especially  those in marginal seats facing political oblivion, are coming  round to the view that changing horses might be the lesser of  two evils. A new leader would at least give them a fighting  chance of holding on to their seats, when at present they have  none.    The contest for the next Tory leader is, in effect, already  under way. It will not reach its climax before midsummer at the  earliest. Nobody wants to succeed Mr Major this side of the  local and European elections in May and June. Of course, his  prospects would be transformed if the Tories were to do  unexpectedly well; on present evidence that is the least likely  outcome. Mr Major must brace himself for renewed calls for his  departure in the wake of Tory electoral disasters. He insists  he will not be driven out, no matter how bad the results. He  could hardly say otherwise. But if he does dig in he faces a  challenge from a stalking horse which he would win, but probably  so humiliatingly that he would be a lame-duck leader. It might  not come to that: by late summer/early autumn, the weight of  party opinion urging him to go could prove irresistible. Mr  Major says the "men in suits" will not force him. But Richard  Nixon thought he could hang on, even though Watergate had  crippled his presidency, until a crucial meeting with Barry  Goldwater forced him to conclude the game was up. We do not yet  know the name of the British Tory Goldwater; but as the year  goes on there is likely to be no shortage of volunteers. The  emergence of Michael Heseltine as clear frontrunner to succeed  Mr Major in our poll of 100 Tory MPs is nothing short of  remarkable, though it was anticipated in this column several  weeks ago. His only problem is of peaking too soon. He has to  continue to look and sound prime ministerial without appearing  disloyal to his present boss. He is astute enough to walk that  tightrope. On Europe, where the right distrust him most, he has  to sound increasingly Gaullist: pro-European but a staunch  defender of Britain's national interests. He would capture more  of the right if he made it clear at some stage that Michael  Portillo would be chancellor in a Heseltine administration.    When Mr Heseltine mulled over his challenge to Mrs Thatcher  in 1990 he used to say that, when it came to the Tory  leadership, he had only one bullet in his gun; if he missed he  would never get another chance. Well, he did miss and he was  wrong. As much to his surprise as anybody's, it turns out there  is another bullet in the chamber.</p>

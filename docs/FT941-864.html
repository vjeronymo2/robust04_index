			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Details of UAL deal with unions due today United Airlines will today release details of the wage and work rule concessions that the company's employee unions accepted on Friday night when they signed the final documents on a Dollars 5bn labour-led buy-out of the airline. UAL's management and machinists' and pilots' unions signed the deal - which creates the largest employee-owned company in the US - after 10 days of tense negotiations. The talks had been going on since March 15, when the first deadline on concluding the buy-out passed without an agreement because at the last minute the machinists' union had balked at some of the terms of the deal. At the time, machinists were said to have been unhappy that management and non-contract employees were not accepting their fair share of concessions, and that UAL planned after the buy-out to offer newly hired non-union employees lower wages and benefits. Management and machinists, however, ironed out their differences on Friday, allowing the buy-out to go ahead. Under the broad terms of the deal, the two unions have agreed to Dollars 5bn worth of wage and work rule concessions over the next six years in exchange for 53 per cent of UAL's stock. The union representing the airline's 17,500 flight attendants was not involved in the buy-out negotiations because it refused to accept the concessions offered by management. UAL's shareholders, who will vote on whether to accept the buy-out this summer, will receive Dollars 750m in cash in the deal, which will come from the airline's current cash holdings of Dollars 1.8bn.</p>

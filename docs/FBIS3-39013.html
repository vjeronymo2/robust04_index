The DPA correspondent had reported that he had  learned this in the Slovak capital of Bratislava, where Defense  Minister Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) is currently  visiting the Slovak Army. Through lack of money the Bundeswehr  can reportedly by no means be kept at the level of 370,000 men;  it must be reduced to about 200,000 army soldiers, about 80,000  air force soldiers, and 20,000 navy members.    Since at the security conference in Munich on the weekend  Ruehe had also announced a reduction of the Bundeswehr and  cutbacks in Bundeswehr planning, in terms of both structure and  bases, this DPA report was received with considerable attention  by government circles. Reportedly, the future of the Bundeswehr  will soon be the topic of a talk between the chancellor and his  defense minister. In Munich Kohl had stated that the size of  the Bundeswehr will be somewhere close to 370,000 men.</p>

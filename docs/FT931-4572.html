			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: GE's Tungsram posts third consecutive annual loss TUNGSRAM, the Hungarian light bulb group in which General Electric of the US has a 75 per cent stake, plunged to a Ft9bn (Dollars 104m) loss in 1992 and will remain unprofitable this year. This is the third consecutive loss for the group, and the biggest in Hungarian corporate history. It represents a 70 per cent increase on the loss for the previous 12 months. GE acknowledges the need for a further injection of capital on top of the Dollars 350m it has invested in the venture. The injection would cover accumulated losses, provide cash for operations and cut debt. Losses in the past two years total Ft14.3bn, using international accounting standards. General Electric might be obliged to buy out the minority shareholding of Hungarian Credit Bank. The state-owned bank is unhappy with the partnership and needs resources to cope with its own financial difficulties. But the US company said yesterday speculation on a buy-out was premature. Mr Charles Pieper, chief executive officer of Tungsram and GE Lighting Europe, blamed the deficit on growing borrowings, a write-off of inherited Russian trade debts and restructuring costs. Tungsram announced a further 900 redundancies out of its shrunken workforce of 10,200. General Electric paid Dollars 150m for an initial 50 per cent of previously state-owned Tungsram in 1990, creating the first sizeable western joint venture in eastern Europe and a symbol for the region's economic opening. Tungsram was regarded as a rare Hungarian industrial jewel, possessing corporate pride and about 6 per cent of the western European light bulb market Tungsram has doubled forint sales in western Europe since 1989. GE has also secured dramatic improvements in productivity in Hungary and has capitalised on the quality of local research workers. But Tungsram has not been insulated from eastern Europe's economic crisis. To bear down on inflation, the Budapest government has maintained exchange and interest rates which are painfully high for exporters such as Tungsram. Sales in the former communist countries have fallen 90 per cent with the collapse of the Comecon bloc.</p>

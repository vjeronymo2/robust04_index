			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: Family Bliss hits West End - Malcolm Rutherford reviews a new production of Hay Fever NOEL Coward's Bliss family is worth revisiting every five years or so. However well you may think you have remembered them, there will be always something that you have forgotten. Despite their internal quarrels, Mr, Mrs, Master and Miss Bliss are the only happy family in a game where the rest of the cards do not fit. They are remarkably pleased with themselves and the only real argument between the children is whether this makes them normal or abnormal. The Blisses do not change much with time. For regular visitors the chief attraction is the subtle difference in the way they play their parts. In Alan Strachan's new production of Hay Fever at the Albery Theatre, the family is in pretty good form but the guests are allowed to run them close. Maria Aitken plays Judith, the actress-mother whose heart has never really left the stage. Her best moment is when she effortlessly kicks off her wellington boots without sitting down or using her hands. Her weakest is when, in a curiously subdued scene, she sings in French at the piano. For the rest, she does all that Coward could have asked: an actress who commands attention playing an actress who tends to ham. If this part went wrong, the play would fall. Ms Aitken never lets it do that. She gets the balance between Judith as wife and mother, and Judith as actress, exactly right. Note the malicious glee with which she reads in the theatre column of a Sunday newspaper that 'Mary Saunders has got another failure'. The trouble with the play is that Judith is so much the dominant character in the family that the rest of the Blisses are overshadowed. In this production they accept their subsidiary role with perfect discipline, which is presumably what the director intended. Where Strachan scores is how he draws in the visitors. Anyone who saw the production of Coward's Private Lives with Joan Collins as Amanda a couple of years ago will recall how much Sara Crowe made out of playing the silly girl, Sibyl. Here Ms Crowe does it again as the flapper, Jackie Coryton. Possibly she is in danger of being type-cast, but she plays the role of the dumb blonde to perfection. In the end, all four visitors come together in a symmetry of their own, united in their desire to get out of the Bliss household as soon as Sunday trains permit. Some of their best moments come not in Coward's lines, but in his situations and the facial expressions they permit. Watch them eating haddock for breakfast. See the blood rising in Richard Garnett's face when he succumbs to hiccoughs and is made to hold his breath for a count of over 30. Hay Fever has some splendidly laconic lines as well. When Garnett, the athletic young man playing Sandy Tyrell, tells Judith, his would-be conquest, that he is boxing again in two weeks' time, she responds sweetly: 'I must come to your first night.' Coward's fascination with place names comes out in a wonderfully halting conversation between the flapper and the visiting diplomatist (Christopher Godwin) as they wait for the Blisses to receive them. 'Italy's awfully nice, isn't it?' 'Oh yes, charming.' And 'Dear little place, Dieppe'. The set as well as the costumes are designed by Anthony Powell. He allows the closest physical contact to take place on the central sofa, but leaves plenty of room for estrangement. More overtly sexual scenes, such as kissing, occur off-stage, in the library or the garden. In retrospect, it is astonishing how much Coward managed to convey about sexual attraction without being explicit. In short, the Blisses are worth another visit. If you have not been to see them before, go at once in case they do not come back, for I have just the slightest suspicion that their charms may be beginning to fade. Albery Theatre.

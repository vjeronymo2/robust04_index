			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MASTERS NATIONAL CYCLING;  </P> <P> OREGON WOMAN FINALLY CAPTURES HER GOLD  </P> <P> After pocketing five medals (three silver and two bronze) since the start of  the Masters National Cycling Championships a week ago, Janice Gaines of  Portland, Ore., finally won her first gold medal Friday at the Velodrome in the  women's 30-34 10-kilometer points race, an event in which she had never  competed.  </P> <P> Gaines also earned the award for best all-around rider on the track.  </P> <P> "I talked to Betsy King (multi-national champion from Gainesville, Fla.) before  the start, and she was talking about positioning and strategy," Gaines said. "I  just wanted to stay upright. I had practiced it (racing on the track) so I'd be  safe and so riders around me would be safe. After I went for the first sprint I  thought I'd go for it. I wanted to get a (national champion) jersey really  bad."  </P> <P> In a points race, cyclists sprint every fifth lap and are awarded points  according to their positioning. In the women's race, which was 30 laps around  the track, points were doubled at the 15th lap and again on the final lap.  </P> <P> "It was going so fast I didn't know who was around me or who was getting the  points," Gaines said. "I was determined to do well, to gut it out when I was  hurting near the end. In every race I ride, I always continue to push hard and  control the race from the front."  </P> <P> Local riders Tani Barbour of Vista and Tracy Evans of La Mesa placed second and  fourth, respectively.  </P> <P> In the men's 45-49 20-kilometer points race, Jim Montgomery of Herndon, Va.,  successfully defended his title, followed closely by Victor Copeland of Rancho  Santa Fe.  </P> <P> "My strategy was to initially take it easy then, when I saw the field tiring, I  was going to come from behind and dive down the track and break away," Copeland  said. "When it came down to the last lap, Dan Wulbert (of Cardiff) said  something about me going ahead. Then Jim attacked and he jumped ahead. I'd  liked to have won, but I don't mind losing to (Montgomery)."  </P> <P> In the men's 55-over 10-kilometer race, Larry Reade of Buffalo, N.Y., lapped  the field to easily capture the national title. The race was stopped midway  through to clear a cyclist who had slipped off his bike and had to be taken off  the track. Reade said this definitely had an effect on the concentration of the  cyclists.  </P> <P> "I didn't know what was going to happen. They (the officials) wanted us to move  to the side of the track. I was standing up there shaking," Reade said. "There  was too much time to cool down."  </P></p>

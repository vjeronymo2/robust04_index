			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Government Rests Case: Federal prosecutors rested their case in the  Princeton-Newport securities racketeering trial after playing a tape of a  former Drexel Burnham Lambert trader telling a Princeton-Newport Partners LP  executive after an alleged illegal deal: "Welcome to the world of being a  sleaze." Also, defense lawyers declined to cross-examine Drexel Chief Executive  Frederick H. Joseph for fear of introducing into evidence potentially damaging  information about Drexel's $650-million plea bargain with the government. Five  partners in the defunct Princeton-Newport brokerage and ex-Drexel trader Bruce  Lee Newberg are on trial.  </P></p>

			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television Elizabeth R attracted almost 18m viewers when first screened earlier this year. With the Royal Family scarcely off the front pages since there should be another bumper audience for this wry look at the business of Queenship. The scenes of the happy home life at Balmoral will be intently scrutinised. (ITV 8.00). Death and the Compass, in BBC2's ScreenPlay slot at 9.30, is an adaptation of a short story by Jorge Luis Borges. It is set, of course, in a Latin American military dictatorship and stars Peter Boyle as the oddball investigator of a series of murders. Anthony Holden is a journalist who became a professional poker player good enough to win through to the World Championships in Las Vegas and on BBC2 at 11.15 he takes us to the event which attracts the best players as well as the bizarre characters who devote their lives to this mesmerising contest. Soul singer James Brown always receives laudatory television coverage, perhaps because of his age, (well into his sixties), perhaps because his performance is much copied by younger black artists. Expect the same old footage of his stage show, gold cape and all (Channel 4, 11.05).</p>

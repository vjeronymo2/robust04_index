			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo to pay SmithKline Beecham for use of drug GLAXO and SmithKline Beecham have settled a patents dispute over Zofran, one of Glaxo's fastest growing drugs. Glaxo has agreed to pay a royalty to SmithKline Beecham for the use of Zofran in its treatments for all forms of nausea and vomiting. Neither company would give the size of the royalty, but both said it was likely to be a single percentage figure of sales which were Pounds 163m for the last six months of 1992. 'This is a very good deal for SmithKline Beecham. The royalties will fall straight through to the bottom line,' said Mr Jonathan de Pass, analyst at BZW. SmithKline Beecham has recently been issued European patents for the use of a class of drugs called 5HT3-antagonists - of which Zofran is a member - for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer therapy. The agreement is particularly good for SmithKline Beecham because it covers all types of nausea, including post-operative nausea. Glaxo's patents for Zofran are not affected. Meanwhile, Glaxo yesterday sought to play down the significance of a trial suggesting that two cheap generic drugs in combination were more effective than Zofran. The trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggested patients on the two drugs, metoclopramide and dexamethasone, had significantly less nausea and vomiting during the first 24 hours than those on Zofran. Glaxo said the study was in patients receiving weak chemotherapy and up to 50 per cent of patients would not experience nausea anyway. Mr James Culverwell, analyst at Hoare Govett, said all customers were looking at the cost-effectiveness of drugs. The trial suggested the two drugs might be used in preference to Zofran where weak chemotherapy was involved. Glaxo's shares closed 8p higher at 562p.</p>

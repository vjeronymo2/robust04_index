			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- A symposium of men of  the press was held here Thursday to mark the 20th anniversary of  the publication of the May 7, 1974, work of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il.    In the work Comrade Kim Chong-il defined our party's media  as  a powerful ideological weapon conducive to modelling the whole  of society on the chuche idea and gave a comprehensive  exposition of its basic mission and tasks and ways for their  fulfilment.    He gave perfect answers to all the questions arising in the  building of the media including those of adopting the principle  of chuche as the keystone, conducting one's activities strictly  under the guidance of the party Central Committee and "selecting  the right seed" and conducting a speed campaign.    The speakers said that the work of Comrade Kim Chong-il is  an  immortal grand program which clearly indicates the features of  the socialist press, the function and role which it should play  in compliance with the requirements of modelling the whole of  society on the chuche idea, and shows the road of serving for  the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of the leader  which is succeeded through generations, being the first in  history to put the building of the socialist media on the basis  of the revolutionary outlook on the leader.    It is immortal feat of our party that our media is making  true contributions to the accomplishment of the cause of  socialism and registering great achievements in revolutionizing  newspapers, news services and publications to meet the  requirements of the developing revolution in a new, higher  stage, the speakers stressed.</p>

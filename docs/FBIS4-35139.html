			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] During a news conference, Finance Minister Julio  Sosa did not rule out the possibility of nationalizing banks.  After presenting to Congress the draft budget for 1995 totaling  over 2 trillion bolivars, in which the average price of  petroleum was fixed at $12 per barrel and the bolivar was fixed  at 180 per dollar, Sosa said that it will be necessary to ask  Congress to pass a law on public credit to cover social  programs. Sosa also said that the bonds announced by President  Rafael Caldera for transportation and nourishment will have to  be increased. Nevertheless, Minister Sosa did not say how many  more bonds would have to be issued.    [Begin Sosa recording] The cabinet would have to approve  this. [words indistinct] very satisfactory, however I do not  want to announce this before the cabinet has taken this into  account and given its approval. If this is dealt with tomorrow  by the cabinet, the labor minister and I will be very happy to  make the announcement. [end recording]    The finance minister also referred to the suspension of  constitutional guarantees, ruling out that this decision was  made to avoid public order disturbances.    [Begin Sosa recording] [words indistinct] taken for those  reasons. I think that measure was implemented because there must  be a very careful and extensive study conducted of the financial  system. Our laws on banking and other financial institutions  have a number of limitations that could hamper any action on the  financial system that may be necessary. That is the true reason  behind the suspension of guarantees. [end recording]    Nevertheless, and despite the insistence of the media to  learn what the exchange rate will be fixed at, Minister Sosa  said it was not his duty but that of the Venezuelan Central Bank  to provide this information [words indistinct] designated a  technical commission for that purpose. To conclude, the finance  minister announced that the government will remain vigilant of  the possibility of a food supply shortage, so that in fact this  does not occur.</p>

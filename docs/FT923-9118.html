			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Manweb's canteen meeting cuts costs MANWEB, the electricity supply company serving Merseyside, west Cheshire and north Wales, yesterday cut the costs of its annual meeting by holding it in the staff canteen at its headquarters in Chester. The Pounds 250,000 bill is a 37.5 per cent saving on the Pounds 400,000 for last year's event, held in a large marquee on Chester racecourse. Displaced staff were provided with 'airline' meals to eat at their desks. And there should be further economies, as Mr Bryan Weston, chairman, explained to complaining shareholders. An Pounds 85,000 tailor-made, lean-to tent, clipped to the side of the building to provide a reception area, should be re-usable for about 10 years and could possibly be hired out. About 750 people attended last year, nevertheless the company was worried there might not be room for reporters, so decided not to invite any. This year it countered suggestions that this was a bar on the press - following niggling questions last year on the chairman's salary - by letting in any who turned up, provided they agreed to sacrifice their seat to a shareholder if required. With only 437 shareholders present, in a canteen which holds 1,000, this proved unnecessary. The chairman and male directors demonstrated their 'coats off' commitment by conducting the meeting in their shirtsleeves. Mr Weston, was soon challenged on his 37 per cent increase in pay and perks to Pounds 214,000 last year. This was described as 'obscene' and 'a crime' in the present economic climate but was vigorously defended by Mr Eryl Morris, a member of Courtaulds' main board, who is also a non-executive director of Manweb and chairman of its remuneration committee. After a bilingual greeting of 'Bora da and good morning' to emphasise Manweb's role in supplying most of the world's Welsh speakers with electricity, Mr Morris said earnings per share had risen by 71 per cent, so the directors had earned their bonuses. Salary increases had enabled Manweb to recruit two new top-class executive directors, he added, but the rises had been a one-off adjustment. The directors were getting only 5.5 per cent, the same as the staff, this year. He did not reveal whether they would be eating airline lunches yesterday.</p>

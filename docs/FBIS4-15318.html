			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [GOLOS ARMENII report: "Dzhilavyan Has Not Been Arrested"] </F>   [Text] The editors have received a statement from Moscow  issued by the press secretariat of the International Armenian  Assembly [IAA], which reads as follows:    "On 30 March ERKIR published a report that IAA President  Serzh Dzhilavyan had been arrested.    "Serzh Dzhilavyan has not been arrested. This morning, 31  March, press service staff members talked to Serzh Dzhilavyan,  who was at home at the address published by ERKIR--4  Michurinskiy Avenue, where Serzh Dzhilavyan allegedly had been  arrested.    "Moreover, on 30 March Serzh Dzhilavyan held a press  conference in which he made the following statement: `As is  known, I have handed over to Moscow law enforcement authorities  the terrorists who, on assignment from the Republic of Armenia  MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], were supposed to assassinate  me last fall. Law enforcement officers of various rank and from  different services spent almost the entire night in my home,  questioning the suspects and examining their weapons.    "`The suspects were taken away, but the weapons for some  reason were left behind, despite my subsequent numerous  reminders and insistence that the weapons be removed.    "`Now there is no doubt that the Moscow law enforcement  organs' "forgetfulness" was deliberate at the prompting of the  Armenian MVD. The weapons were needed in order to organize  another provocation against me--to accuse me of illegal  possession of weapons. However, this time, again, it did not  work.    "`I am not so naive as to not understand the purpose of  these  provocations. It is the hand of official Yerevan that has  reached me in Moscow.    "`Being an entrepreneur and with preferences leaning toward  charitable activities, I have tried to stay away from politics.  I believe, however, that I can no longer remain passive. I  declare that I consider myself from now on in political  opposition to the current Armenian authorities and intend to run  in the presidential elections in the Republic of Armenia.'"</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tajikistan has sent an official note to Afghanistan  demanding that the recent incidents on the Tajik-Afghan border  be investigated and the responsible be punished, a highly placed  official in the Tajik Foreign Ministry, Zafar Saydov, said at a  briefing in Dushanbe on Friday.    Saydov told journalists about the artillery shooting against  the Russian border post in the Khatlon Region from Afghan  territory on April 7. Moreover, he added that a Russian armored  carrier had been blown up by an anti-tank mine. A border  officer had been killed.    Saydov said he had reliable information proving that these  actions had been planned before hand and had been carried out  from Afghan territory. Over the first three months of this year  several facilities, including the Russian border defenses have  been subjected to fire from Afghan territory over forty times.  Casualties and significant material damage have been reported.    The Tajik Foreign Ministry's note demanded that appropriate  strict measures be used against illegal Tajik armed units acting  on Afghan territory in order to halt their activities, Saydov  stressed.</p>

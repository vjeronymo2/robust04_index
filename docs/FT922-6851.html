			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / CBI calls for series of interest rate cuts THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday called on the government to pursue small but regular reductions in interest rates. It suggested they might soon be capable of falling below those of Germany. The CBI said further cuts in the cost of money would be possible without prejudicing the UK's position in the exchange rate mechanism if Britain's improved performance on inflation continued. The organisation emphasised the need for caution but said interest rates could be cut in the short term by as little as a quarter of 1 percentage point to 'test the water' in foreign exchange markets. Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic and finance policy committee, told the organisation's governing council that continued cuts in interest rates were the most important step towards encouraging the economic recovery that appeared likely in the rest of the year. Sir David said the CBI wanted to see sterling join the narrow bands of the ERM, but there was no immediate pressure to do so, given the progress made in cutting interest rates and the prospective improvement in UK competitiveness in Europe. Sir David emphasised that headline inflation in the UK was already below that of Germany, where it was on a rising trend. He stressed that a change of perception would be needed to establish the view that UK interest rates could be below those of Germany. There was, he added, some evidence that that was already taking place, but it could be easily jeopardised by 'too hasty an approach to interest rate reductions'. Sir Michael Angus, who retired as chairman of Unilever two weeks ago, was yesterday elected president of the CBI for the next two years, succeeding Sir Brian Corby.</p>

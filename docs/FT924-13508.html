			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Letter: Sympathetic stance pledged on exercise of new VAT rules Sir, May I make two points on the article by Charles Batchelor (Management: The Growing Business) and your related editorial, 'VAT headache', (October 13) about the VAT changes being introduced as a result of the Single European Market. First, although the Single Market will remove a massive amount of paperwork and bureaucracy at the frontiers, the new VAT and other arrangements will represent a big change for businesses. This is why we have invested heavily in consulting companies and providing them with information, and we are very anxious to continue to do so. Our regular publication, Single Market Report, is issued to 70,000 companies and we have organised or attended numerous seminars with businesses. In addition, most companies which will be required to provide detailed returns have already been visited by our local VAT staff to explain the new arrangements to them. All of them will be seen well before the end of the year. My staff in our local offices have also been working closely with local Chambers of Commerce, and similar organisations for over a year to get these messages across. We wish to help British businesses prepare for 1993 as much as we possibly can. If any of your readers feel that their business is likely to be affected and has not so far been approached, I urge them to contact their local VAT office as a matter of urgency. Each of our regions has a trained single market liaison officer who will be glad to advise. Second, I should like to stress that we shall take an understanding view of problems and mistakes on returns in the early stages of the new regimes. As the paymaster-general said during the debate on the Finance Bill in June, 'in considering whether to impose any . . . penalty, Customs and Excise will take a sympathetic view of sincere errors made as a result of misunderstanding the new provisions for the first year of this operation'. I confirm that emphatically. Brian Unwin, chairman, HM Customs and Excise, New King's Beam House, 22 Upper Ground, London SE1 9PJ</p>

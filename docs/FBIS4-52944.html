			<p>BFN     [Text] Under the headline "National and Revolutionary  Traditions Always Serve as a Spiritual Driving Force in the  Cause of National Renovation," an editorial in today's NHAN DAN  reads in part:    The various activities organized to commemorate the 40th  anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu victory are just winding down,  but the memory of the Dien Bien Phu victory and other heroic  victories in the cause of national liberation and unification  will continue to be held forever in the hearts of millions of  our compatriots and countless friends worldwide.    Led by the party, our country is entering a new stage of its  national history in which we will have to carry out national  industrialization and modernization under the conditions and  circumstances Vietnam is now facing. Given Vietnam's choice of  approach -- and with the wisdom, creativity, and self-reliance  of the Vietnamese people -- we are determined to prevail in our  renovation process and national development and keep pace with  our friends across the five continents while retaining our own  identity.    Lying ahead are not only new opportunities but also  countless  difficulties and challenges requiring every person, every  collective and locality, and the entire country to show the  determination to surge forward by continuing to develop their  tradition of persistently struggling toward the goal of building  a prosperous people, a powerful country, and an equitable and  civilized society. In this way we will be worthy of the  sacrifices of preceding generations.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Saudi Arabia--a </F> Danger-Generating Center in the Persian Gulf"]    [Text] The news organizations affiliated with Saudi Arabia  have once again postponed any decision to improve relations with  Iran and to resolve differences between Abu Dhabi and Iran.  These organizations, which are mostly under the influence of  Zionist groups, have once again propounded the perpetual claims  of the United States and the Zionist regime based on Iran's  military presence in the strategic regions of the Persian Gulf.  These claims have been made repeatedly by Western and Zionist  circles.    Despite such claims, Iran has always been in favor of an  amicable settlement of its differences with its southern  neighbors, including the United Arab Emirates.  Goodneighborliness, assistance in adopting a regional policy,  and the elimination of the danger of domination by foreigners  are integral and strategic parts of Iran's policy, which is  being misconstrued by the United States as a lessening of its  vital interests.    In addition to these claims, what contributes to major  dangers in the Persian Gulf is the presence of deep-rooted  territorial disputes among the regional Arab countries, which  stem from their thirst for power, affiliation with arrogant  powers of the world, and the influence of these arrogant powers.  Conspicuous examples are Iraq's attack on Iran and later on  Kuwait. The Persian Gulf region has been transformed into a  potential center of tension because of Saudi Arabia's extensive  dependence on the anti-Islamic and antipopular policies of the  United States.    It is under these circumstances that Saudi Arabia has  embarked on expanding these baseless claims and exacerbating the  territorial claims that are exactly what the enemies of the  region and Islam want.    According to political experts, countries that strive to  preserve flash points and expand baseless territorial claims are  most certainly acting against their own interests. The  proliferation of artificial crises in the sensitive region of  the Persian Gulf is the long-term strategy of the greater  powers, the United States in particular, who wants to  consolidate its position on this basis. By implementing this  divisive strategy, the West has managed to transform a  potentially dangerous union of these countries--which would be  opposed to Western interests--into a subtle hostility against  one another.    By creating doubts and apprehension among the regional  countries, the United States is seeking the necessary pretexts  for its greater presence and more overt interference, which is  against the interests of countries in the region. This has been  made possible by the servile Saudi rulers, who are now accusing  Iran to justify their own actions. It is by realizing this  tangible fact that Iran should adopt a strategic policy to  expose these suspicious and dangerous moves and should refrain  from needlessly pandering to the power- seeking Saudi rulers.  Unfortunately, we have not developed a clear course of action  regarding Saudi Arabia's political, discord-generating moves and  this has resulted in making the Saudi rulers more audacious and  arrogant than ever before.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Yule Catto slips to Pounds 20.5m IN 1990, a year of significant change, Yule Catto, the plantations, chemicals and building products company, reported pre-tax profits down by almost Pounds 1m to Pounds 20.51m. However, the Essex-based company still managed to improve earnings per share, from 13.9p to 14.2p, for the tenth year in succession. Mr Allister McLeish, finance director, said that the earnings performance was helped by the sale of the Malaysian plantations, profits of which had been subject to a high tax rate and a 35 per cent minority interest. The shares improved 10p to close at 143p. Lord Catto, chairman, said the sale, plus four acquisitions during the year completed the company's move from its traditional activities in tropical agriculture to an industrial company with a well balanced portfolio. There was a turnround for speciality chemicals towards the end of the year with margins partially restored and many operations enjoying good demand from new overseas customers. However, there was a depressed market for consumer chemicals. Building products produced good organic growth helped by acquisitions. Unilock Holdings, bought in August, had been integrated into the division. Lower harvests and commodity prices reduced the contribution from the agriculture and land division. At the end of October agreement was reached to sell its stake in Yule Catto Plantations for Pounds 16.5m cash. Gearing increased over the 12 months from 25 per cent to 81 per cent largely as a result of writing off acquisition goodwill of Pounds 19.5m. Turnover improved to Pounds 253.66m (Pounds 251m). A proposed final dividend of 2.7p makes a total for the year of 4.7p (4.5p).</p>

"I told the deputy premier that the current system of  minority education in Slovakia is in any case more advanced than  that it should give cause for introducing alternative education,  which would mean a step backward," the ambassador told MTI.    Since the plan gave rise to protest from ethnic Hungarians  in  Slovakia, the ambassador suggested to Andel that the Slovak  authorities should consult with minority leaders before  introducing alternative education. Both sides agreed on the  need for revising and prolonging bilateral agreements on  cultural and educational cooperation.    The ambassador asked the Slovak politician to decide where  the Hungarian Cultural Centre in Bratislava should find its  final home, an issue which he stressed has remained unresolved  for eleven years through no fault of the Hungarian side. The  Hungarian cultural mission opened in 1989, and has been  operating in a temporary building for three years. Andel  promised to examine the issue and come forward with a proposal  in a month.    The ambassador also raised the still unsettled issue of  teachers' training in Nitra, pointing out that Slovakia's  failure to launch a department of national and ethnic cultures  gives reason for justified anxiety. The deputy premier promised  that after considering the issue the Slovak Government will find  a reassuring solution.</p>

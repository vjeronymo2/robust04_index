			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / People: Glaxo appoints Niedel as research and development director Glaxo has appointed James Niedel, 50, as its new director of research and development in the wake of the departure of Franz Humer to Swiss rival Roche. Niedel, below, an American, is currently director of the Glaxo Research Institute in North Carolina and a senior vice-president of Glaxo Inc, the company's US subsidiary. Niedel joined Glaxo in 1988 from Duke University, North Carolina, where he was professor of medicine. He will report directly to Sir Richard Sykes, Glaxo's chief executive and former director of research and development. Other appointments follow from Niedel's promotion. Terence Eaves, development director of Glaxo Research and Development Ltd UK replaces Niedel in the US. Goran Ando moves from group development director and has been 'assigned special duties reporting to Sir Richard Sykes'. Ando is replaced by James Palmer, currently Glaxo's chief medical officer in the US and senior vice-president, medical operations. Humer was also in charge of commercial strategy, and a replacement in that function has yet to be made by Glaxo.</p>

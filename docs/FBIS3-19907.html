Like the two Southeast  Asian states, North Korea is suspected of developing nuclear  weapons of its own -- or at least of being able to. Pyongyang  denies this, but it permits inspectors of the Vienna  International Atomic Energy Agency to enter the country and  obstructs them in the fulfillment of their tasks. The  governments of Pakistan and India do not even permit such  checks. However, they are at least more predictable than the  government of North Korea.    Nobody -- not even the South Korean, Japanese, or U.S.  agents  who have worn themselves out with the Northeast Asian country  for years -- can really say who is pulling what strings in the  regime of aging great leader Kim Il-song and his son Kim  Chong-il. The nuclear inspectors from Vienna were only able to  state that it cannot be ruled out that North Korea is working on  nuclear arms. The intelligence services claim that the country  also has or is developing booster rockets. It is known that the  isolated country with a seriously damaged economy gets oil and  foodstuffs from China and exchanges arms for oil with Iran.    None of that is new and it does not amount to a current  crisis. What is new is that Bill Clinton's administration has  now "lost patience," and that it is now believed in Washington  that one has to defend the credibility of U.S. foreign policies,  whose declared aim is to free the world from the nuclear threat.  Let us assume that it is not a diversion, and that the Clinton  Administration is not looking, in a reflex action, for a chance  to divert the public's attention from domestic policy problems  -- Whitewater -- while, at the same time, repairing the foreign  policy mistake in China. Let us also assume that not only the  pacification of the officers in the Pentagon and the U.S.  armament industry, who find it difficult to get rid of their  Patriot missiles elsewhere, is at issue. What threats can be  used against a regime like that of North Korea? An economic  embargo? That is to say, that the Korean community in Japan  must not send any money and goods to North Korea? That Iraq,  Iran, or China must not deliver any more oil? What is the use  of threats that cannot be translated into reality? Whatever  induced the U.S. Administration to advocate sanctions, the  result will not reduce the danger in the region. What is more,  it must be feared that the forces in the north and south of the  Korean peninsula who tend to be prepared for dialogue will be  silenced and that the hardliners on both sides will win. Then  there might really be a crisis.</p>

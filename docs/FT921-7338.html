			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / US tougher on Israeli call for Dollars 10bn credit US OPPOSITION is building to Israel's request for up to Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.7bn) of loan guarantees, George Graham reports from Washington. Several key members of Congress have warned they will oppose the loan guarantees, which Israel has sought to help finance the cost of absorbing 1m new immigrants from the former Soviet Union, unless Israel freezes its settlements activity in the occupied West Bank and Gaza zones. 'It is essential Israel understands US taxpayers will be in no mood to support these guarantees under any conditions,' said Congressman David Obey, chairman of the House of Representatives appropriations sub-committee. Mr James Baker, secretary of state, will not agree to the request unless Israel accepts a freeze on new settlements. Mr Baker discussed the loan guarantees with Israeli Ambassador Zalman Shoval yesterday for the third time in a month. He also discussed the issue with Senator Patrick Leahy, head of the Senate appropriations sub-committee on foreign operations. Senator Leahy has proposed granting the loan guarantees at a rate of Dollars 2bn a year, but clawing back the amounts Israel spends on settlements in the occupied territories. Israel has conceded some curb will be needed on settlement activity, but the two sides have so far not agreed on how many homes are already being built. Senator Robert Byrd, Senate appropriations committee chairman, has voiced scepticism over the guarantees, warning that Israeli assurances that the US money would not be spent on settlements were meaningless, since they would free other money for that purpose. 'Receiving written assurances as to how the money will be spent, without any accompanying change in Israeli settlement policy, is an exercise in building a paper dam.' He based his comments on a General Accounting Office report, which said Israel would probably be able to repay the loans, even if it failed to fulfil promised economic reforms.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] In a plenary session of Congress, Mexican deputies  and senators formally opened a special period of sessions in  which the president's initiative to grant amnesty for violent  actions in the Mexican state of Chiapas will be the only topic  of discussion.    First, the Chamber of Deputies opened its session and  elected  by majority (Juan Antonio Memidip), PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] deputy for the state of Veracruz, as  president of the special session. Before this, the Permanent  Commission of Congress met briefly to receive the report from  the commission of deputies and senators who traveled to Chiapas  to study the conflict. Basically, the report, which was read by  PRI Senator Victor Manuel Tinoco, indicates that the legislative  commission learned about all of the demands of the people of  Chiapas. They proposed that Congress continue to contribute to  resolving the conflict and that all political parties draft a  legislative agenda offering solutions.    The Joint Government and Constitutional Affairs and Justice  Commission of the Chamber of Deputies met tonight to receive  proposals from all political parties on the draft amnesty bill.  This will permit them to draft a resolution that will be  presented to the plenum on Thursday.    The proposals are varied and include:    1. The PAN [National Action Party] asked that those believed  responsible for kidnapping and amassing weapons not receive the  benefits of the amnesty. It also asked that the amnesty bill be  publicized not only though the official newspaper but also  through edicts in all places, both in Spanish and all dialects  spoken in the region.    2. The Cardenist Front demanded that the amnesty not be  limited to offenses committed after 1 January 1994, because  several offenses were committed in late 1993.    3. The PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution], in addition  to demanding that constitutional reforms be passed to offer  integral solutions to the problems of the Indians of Chiapas,  asked that first negotiations be held, problems be resolved, and  then amnesty be offered.    4. The Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution proposed  that no Mexican or foreign mercenaries be given amnesty.    5. The PPS [Popular Socialist Party] demanded that  fundamental solutions be found to the Chiapas conflict, because  an amesty law alone will not resolve anything.    All political parties agreed that terms for surrendering  weapons must be eased and time must be permitted for  negotiations.    Upon beginning its analysis of the draft amnesty bill, one  of  the first changes made by the Government and Justice Commission  was to extend the deadline for crimes that qualify for a pardon  from 16 to 20 January 1994.    The resolution on the draft amnesty bill will be ready  Thursday morning, and if no changes are introduced, it will be  immediately discussed at the plenum of the Chamber of Deputies.</p>

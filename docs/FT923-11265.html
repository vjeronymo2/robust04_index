			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Protection for professionals NAMES AT Lloyd's of London insurance market are not the only people who stay awake at night worrying about unlimited liability. Increasingly lawyers, solicitors, accountants, architects and other professionals who are liable for all the losses their companies make have cause for concern. Professionals are coming under fire from their clients when things go wrong. Housebuyers who lose out through over-optimistic surveys, hospital patients who suffer from doctors' mistakes, and shareholders whose companies go under because of sloppy accounting - all are much more likely to turn to the law for redress. And, following the well-established North American trend, courts are more prone to hand out big awards to compensate for losses due to professional negligence. Broker Alexander Howden and insurance company Sun Alliance International have now launched a product which could help to relieve some of the stress. The product is called the Catastrophic Asset Protection Scheme (CAPS). In essence, it is an insurance policy which protects family assets against the risk of being called on to meet the costs of a successful professional negligence claim. CAPS is based on the legal premise that a spouse has an insurable interest in the family home. According to Peter Hornsby, of Alexander Howden: 'The policy is bought by the spouse and they must pay the premium because the policy has nothing to do with the partner.' It is also designed to supplement the professional indemnity (or PI) insurance which offers a limited amount of protection against some of the cost of legal awards. Hornsby says more people are feeling nervous about claims exceeding the limits of their PI policies. Premiums depend on the level of PI insurance in place and the value of the assets being protected. The spouse of a solicitor with professional indemnity cover of Pounds 10m would pay Pounds 125 to cover assets of Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 270 to cover assets of Pounds 1m. But if the PI limit is only Pounds 1m, then the premium rises to Pounds 250 for the Pounds 100,000 of cover.</p>

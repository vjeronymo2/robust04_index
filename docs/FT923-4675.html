			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Industrial orders down in Germany THE rising value of the D-Mark hit German industry's export order books in July, the economics ministry said yesterday. Incoming orders from foreign customers, already depressed by recession, fell a real 2.5 per cent in July, compared to June. Combined with a 0.5 per cent rise in domestic demand, this produced an overall fall of 0.5 per cent in new orders at manufacturing and mining companies. A comparison of developments in June and July, measured against the previous two months and considered more reliable, showed total orders down 2 per cent. Compared with the equivalent period last year, the reduction was 4.5 per cent in volume and 3.5 per cent in value. Capital goods manufacturers have been especially hard hit by slowing investment at home and abroad. Their June/July orders were 7.4 per cent lower in volume and 5.2 per cent down in value, compared with a year earlier. Underlining the strains in the industry, MAN Gutehoffnungshutte, a plant and engineering subsidiary in the MAN group, yesterday announced plans to cut 420 jobs. Krupp Stahl, one of Germany's leading steel-makers, announced a plunge into the red in the first half of this year. After profits of DM44m (Pounds 15.7m) in the first six months of 1991, it reported a loss of DM32m. Krupp loss, page 10</p>

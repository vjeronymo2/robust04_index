			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Health secretary to consult TUC on NHS funding MRS Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, has asked the TUC health services committee to give its views on National Health Service funding as the government's annual public expenditure review gets under way. The TUC believes that a meeting between the committee and Mrs Bottomley planned for November has been brought forward to the week after next because she wants to hear union views before meeting the Treasury.</p>

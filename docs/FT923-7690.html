			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Pressures that threaten to breach the Chinese Wall - Why independent advice from analysts is being questioned INVESTORS PAID Pounds 1bn in commissions to their City stockbrokers last year. Judging by the row that broke out at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew this week, they may not be getting very good value for their money. Mr Terry Smith, Phillips &amp; Drew's head of research, was suspended after a row with his employers which throws a spotlight on the independence of analysts in investment banks. Compared to many analysts, Mr Smith has always been relatively outspoken and has never been afraid to criticise the companies he researched. At BZW, he caused severe embarrassment to the management of Barclays five years ago by saying that the bank's shares were over-valued. The cause of the latest dispute is a book Mr Smith was preparing for publication which highlights the accounting techniques used by UK companies to boost the level of profits they disclose or minimise the level of borrowings shown in the balance sheet. Phillips &amp; Drew became embarrassed by reports about the book which appeared in the Mail on Sunday newspaper and Accountancy Age, the magazine, last month. These articles highlighted Grand Metropolitan, the drinks and leisure group, as using more of the accounting techniques than any other company - though there was no implication that GrandMet was doing anything improper. Nonetheless, Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of GrandMet, which is a banking client of UBS, was so annoyed that he complained to Mr Rudi Mueller, chairman of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and head of UBS's UK operations. Mr Smith says there was a separate complaint from Sir Colin Marshall, who is a non-executive director of GrandMet. Sir Colin is also chief executive of British Airways, to which Phillips &amp; Drew is joint stockbroker. British Airways yesterday refused to comment on the incident. Phillips &amp; Drew insists that Mr Smith's suspension 'was purely for misconduct on procedural grounds. It has nothing to do with anything else.' This unholy row has done little to restore investors' confidence in the quality of research published by full-service investment banks. Analysts are supposed to be insulated by so-called Chinese Walls from influence from other parts of a bank. But as Mr Smith said: 'The Chinese Wall fell on me'. There have been rumbles before that outspoken analysts have been called to heel. Last summer Mr Derek Terrington, a media analyst, left Phillips &amp; Drew to join Kleinwort Benson after the late Mr Robert Maxwell complained of a circular which told investors not to invest in Mirror Group Newspapers. And BZW withdrew a proposed research note after companies including Fisons, Cable and Wireless and British Airways, complained of inaccuracies and misrepresentation. Conflicts of interest are nothing new for analysts. They are under constant pressure to encourage investors to buy or sell shares - the only way they can generate their commissions. Also, they can be subjected to fierce assault from companies they criticise. One analyst who had a run-in this year with a company in the FT-SE 100 index recalls: 'It was a nightmare. They put more and more pressure on you. Thank goodness my firm stood by me.' The analyst, who says he is afraid of retaliation from the company if he is named, says the company threatened to sue him for libel; hinted that it would cut off contact, depriving him of the information needed to do his job; and tried to persuade senior executives of his firm to disown him. Even before the Big Bang of 1986, firms offered advice both to companies, as their corporate brokers, and to investors who bought their shares. As a result, much of the research published by companies' own brokers is automatically disregarded by investors. Two things, however, have intensified the pressure - and made the quality of research more questionable. One is the creation of all-purpose investment banks, multiplying the potential for conflicts of interest. The other is the squeeze on profits in the City, which has made independence a very expensive luxury indeed. Research departments account for one of the biggest costs of an industry which is still carrying overheads more suited to the heady days of the 1980s bull markets than the bearish 1990s. The average level of trading each day by investors - and hence the commissions earned by brokers - declined by around 40 per cent between 1987 and 1990. One result is that analysts are being made to earn their keep by advising investment banks' corporate clients. That raises doubts about their impartiality when they come to advise investors on those companies. Another result is that analysts, being a cost rather than a source of income, are not expected to rock the boat. All investment banks argue that their research departments are totally free to steer their own course, and that it would be extreme folly to try to interfere with their judgments. But in straightened times, such high-minded thoughts can often be forgotten.</p>

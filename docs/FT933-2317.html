			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Polish Elections: Poland's old guard lures rural voters POLAND, whose successful free-market reforms are the toast of the western financial community, was projected to give the largest number of votes in yesterday's election to left-wing parties, writes Anne Applebaum in Naklo. To understand why, it helps to visit Naklo, a provincial town of 15,000 people in western Poland. In Naklo - which has an old market square, a single cinema, a museum which displays memorabilia from the last war and not much else - the advantages of communism's demise seem scarce. Few people here care much about the freedom to travel or the freedom of the press, which have enhanced life for residents of larger cities. 'Ach, there are so many newspapers to choose from,' said a man queueing at a news stand yesterday. The disadvantages, however, are clear. A series of regional financial scandals have created much resentment; the word 'thieves' has been scrawled on election posters of free-market parties. Like other towns of comparable size, Naklo's economy depends on small, state-owned agricultural enterprises, including a sugar factory and several meat packing plants. Whereas larger state enterprises in more important centres attracted government sympathy and foreign investment, cuts in agricultural subsidies and increased imports have forced many of these small companies to dismiss workers in the name of efficiency. Now, 23 per cent of Naklo's inhabitants are unemployed. Yet even those who have managed to find new jobs seem to resent making the effort. In small towns people dislike change, even when it appears to have left them better off. 'I am voting for the old communists because the brick factory I used to work in was ruined by privatisation,' said one Naklo man, whose grocery shop did not exist four years ago. Down the street, in a shop selling imitation Teflon frying pans and plastic cutlery, the proprietor said he would vote for the Polish Peasant's party (PSL), formerly allied to the Communist party, because his nine-acre farm had been put out of business by the economic reforms. 'The Peasant's party will give bigger credits to farmers, and then I can go back to farming.' None of those questioned believed the former communists and their allies represented a new form of social democracy. 'I am voting for the former communists because they represent the old nomenklatura, and I am a member of the old nomenklatura,' said one policeman. Those who support economic reform at the national level have done a poor job of marshalling support in the town. Although the former communists still have a local cell, few of the other political parties have local activists; although Warsaw newspapers have changed ownership in recent years, the regional press remains in the hands of former communists. So while the former communists represent a clear, familiar option to the inhabitants of the town, the many parties which descend from the former dissident movement represent a confusing cornucopia of ideas, ideals and leaders. In Naklo, the tiny group of anti-communist intellectuals, once united by their membership of Solidarity, are now divided and disoriented. Thus Mr Janusz Wybranski, a former Solidarity leader, is standing for parliament on the ticket of the Centre Alliance, a descendant of Solidarity's right wing, because he believes his Christian democratic ideals are closest to the old movement. But Mr Janusz Chrzaszcz, a local art collector who suffers from Chekhovian frustration at the absence of intelligent conversation in the town, said he supported the Democratic Union, a party linked with former dissidents which he sees as the party for intellectuals. His wife, meanwhile, chose the Labour Union, the left wing of the old Solidarity movement, because she believes in higher pensions for old people. Even priests, once the most effective opponents of communism in Poland, can no longer offer clear advice. On election day the local church was overflowing. At the end of mass, those standing at the back strained to hear the priest's electoral advice. 'There are many people running for Poland's parliament who oppose our national traditions and faith, people who are anti-religious and anti-church,' he said. 'Please keep this in mind as you vote.' While that could be construed as advice to vote against the former communists, it could also be interpreted as opposition to those former dissidents who support abortion rights and oppose religion in schools. Perhaps that explains why church-goers walking towards the polling booths professed support for no less than six different parties. But the habits of communism are still strong; many of Naklo's inhabitants were not voting at all. Sitting at a local bar one young man said he did not care to go to the polling booths. 'I am unemployed so I am not interested in politics,' he said. 'In any case, I don't see what politics have to do with Naklo.' Anne Applebaum is foreign editor of The Spectator</p>

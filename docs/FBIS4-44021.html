			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marie-Pierre Subtil: "Increasing Criticism </F> Leveled at Planned French Intervention in Rwanda"]    [Excerpt] The planned French intervention in Rwanda is  being subjected to increasing criticism, often severe, from  Africa, Europe, and the United Nations, whose Security Council  was still examining Paris's proposal on Tuesday, 22 June. In  France itself, objections have been raised from within the  government majority. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], speaking  of "aggression," on Tuesday stated that it would oppose French  troops "by all possible means." On the same day, the  Organization for African Unity (OAU) refused to support the  French initiative, which is also opposed by a number of  humanitarian organizations.    In Rwanda, Africa, and Europe, the reactions to the French  initiative are such that its very principle is now in doubt.  Pierre Messmer declared angrily: "This operation is badly  planned, ineffective, and dangerous." In the opinion of the  former prime minister, an old hand in African affairs, "the  chances of success are low and the risks are considerable."  This opinion is shared by many in the French military, the  partners initially sounded out by France -- who politely  declined Paris's invitation -- and even the Africans. Events  have taken such a turn that on Tuesday, 21 June, [Prime  Minister] Edouard Balladur announced that the initial aims would  be revised downward, and he placed five conditions on French  troops being sent to the Rwandan border. In particular, there  was no question of going into "the heart of Rwanda," nor of  intervening without the support of contingents from other  countries. However, Paris still is still not making the  agreement of the RPF a precondition.    France is ready to intervene even though one of the two  warring factions, the RPF, has assured that it will consider any  French soldier to be its enemy. This is precisely the flaw in  the operation. [Italian Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi  pointed this out to Edouard Balladur in a telephone conversation  on Tuesday, stating that his country was prepared to supply 400  men (250 for the special forces and 150 for logistics), but only  on condition that the United Nations gave the operation its  go-ahead (the same condition that applies for France) and that  the agreement of the belligerents was obtained.    Paris's initial idea was to supply some impetus to solving  the crisis by triggering an international operation.    Now the operation being planned is practically unilateral.  For the time being, with the exception of Senegal, none of the  hoped-for partners has made a firm commitment to send in troops.  Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino on Tuesday confirmed  that intervention by "one or two white countries would be viewed  as an act of recolonization." The Italians are ready to  participate in an international humanitarian operation, but not  in "the action that the French would want to take, alone or with  us." He added that this would constitute "a major factor for  conflict."    Such reticence does not stop the French Foreign Ministry  from  believing that Italy or other countries will still participate.  [passage omitted] The ministry does not believe that France is  alone against the world, rushing into an operation that is  destined to fail. [passage omitted]</p>

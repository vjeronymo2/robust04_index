			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Ramus shares suspended SHARES OF Ramus Holdings, the manufacturer of ceramic tiles, kitchens and bedroom furniture, were suspended yesterday at 51p at the company's request pending clarification of its financial position. Directors said results for the year to end-June would be considerably worse than expected, and would give rise to a substantial loss. The company was at an advanced stage of discussions which could lead to a substantial capital subscription. A further announcement, together with publication of the results, would be made as soon as possible, they added.</p>

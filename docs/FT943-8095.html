			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Mexican Elections: A candidate who will win by losing Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential candidate of the centre-right National Action party, has been the surprise element in Mexico's election campaign. Written off by many at the beginning of the race, he found his victory in May's television debate of the three main candidates changed his fortunes overnight, turning him into a serious challenger for the presidency. Even if, as the polls indicate, Mr Fernandez fails to win the election, the PAN is likely to emerge from the campaign considerably stronger than when it went in. It is almost certain to increase its current tally of 79 deputies out of a total of 500, and to pick up between 24 and 30 senators in the expanded 128-member chamber. It currently holds only one out of 64. Mr Fernandez has nevertheless been strongly criticised for not capitalising further on his debate victory. After closing the gap with Mr Zedillo in some opinion polls in late May, he halted his campaign during the World Cup over late June and early July, and lost much of the support he had gained. 'Diego lost the opportunity of a lifetime' says Mr Vicente Licona, head of the Indemec/Louis Harris polling company 'There is a great mystery over what really happened.' While some Mexicans speculate that Mr Fernandez was afraid of winning, or had even reached a deal with the PRI to lose, advisers insist the candidate was simply receiving important dignitaries, resting before the final leg of the race, and preparing for another debate (which never materialised). Even if Mr Fernandez had been more aggressive in July, it is questionable whether he could have maintained his post-debate momentum. The PAN is still a party of the urban middle class, and has little representation in rural areas or in the south. Even in the cities there is considerable fear of a change in government. Mr Licona reckons Mr Fernandez began to lose much of his support when electors feared he might actually win. Whatever the election outcome, Mr Fernandez and his party are sure to play a key part in events after the poll. If they accept a PRI victory, the legitimacy of the result will be greatly enhanced in the eyes of many Mexicans - especially if, as the polls indicate, Mr Fernandez relegates Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the left-wing Party of Democratic Revolution into a poor third place. Given Mr Fernandez's past record of reaching agreements with the PRI, many reckon he will happily accept a PRI victory that is not marred by too many voting irregularities. Mr Zedillo, it is widely if not particularly authoritatively suggested, will then invite a member of the PAN to join his cabinet as a sign of gratitude.</p>

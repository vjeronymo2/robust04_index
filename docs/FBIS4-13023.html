			<p>BFN     [Text] The security forces have detained two Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] leaders from the Gaza Strip --  Nidal Ruhani and Ghassan al-Siyam -- and fifteen activists from  'Izz-al-Din al- Qassam, the military arm of Hamas.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that in an operation in  the al-Shati' refugee camp and Gaza city, which lasted several  days and nights, the security forces detained Nidal Ruhani and  Ghassan al-Siyam, and 15 more Hamas members were detained in the  course of the two men's interrogation. Following a search of  their homes, large sums of money, documents, and other materiel  were seized, and it was learned that they were key elements in  the Hamas operations against the security forces in the Strip.    Brigadier General Doron Almog, the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] commander in the Gaza Strip, commended the Shin Bet  personnel and the other security forces for the capture of the  Hamas members.</p>

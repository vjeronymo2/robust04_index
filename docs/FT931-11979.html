			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Wiggins losses down to Pounds 359,000 WIGGINS GROUP, the property developer, made inroads into its losses in the six months ended September 30 1992, cutting them from Pounds 1.76m to Pounds 359,000. Turnover was down to Pounds 1.25m (Pounds 5.22m). Net interest payable was more than halved at Pounds 369,000 and this time there were no exceptionals, against Pounds 752,000. Below the line there was an extraordinary Pounds 453,000 charge relating to the non-consolidation of Allison Group placed in receivership last June. Losses per share fell to 2.3p (11.1p). Since the half year negotiations have been concluded for the sale of the South Western House Building subsidiary, which will lead to a decrease in the deficiency of net assets of some Pounds 3m.</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo The Japanese government bond market has been a victim of the recent sell-off in global bond markets, prompted by fears of rising inflation due to economic recovery, but a closer look at the economic data suggests declines in Tokyo may be overdone. The worst seems to be over for the Japanese economy. The tankan, the quarterly survey of business confidence, released two weeks ago indicated the first upturn in sentiment for five years, while first-quarter GDP grew by an annualised 3.9 per cent, the best in three years. However, while the economy has stopped deteriorating, statistics suggest that a recovery and inflationary pressures will be weak. Considering the theoretic equilibrium of long-term rates should be around economic growth, the bond market seems to be overshooting at current levels, says Mr Jim Vestal at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Evidence of slow growth may be provided by this week's industrial production figures for May, which are expected to fall, while consumer prices for June are likely to reveal low inflationary pressure. Mr Vestal points out that while government bonds are not a long-term buy, current levels are not justified by the underlying economic condition and predicts the benchmark will fall below 4 per cent during the next two months.</p>

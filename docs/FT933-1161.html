			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Economic union for 10 Soviet republics TEN OF the 15 former Soviet republics yesterday signed a treaty of economic union after nearly two years of trying to manage on their own economically as independent states. Although merely a framework, to be implemented only if republics agree on the details, it marks a drastic sobering up to reality for fledgling countries which had previously placed their political sovereignty above all else. A striking illustration of this was Azerbaijan's accession yesterday to both the commonwealth and the economic union treaty. The 10 signatories, from Belarus in the west to Kazakhstan in the east, agreed to 'gradually build a common economic space on the basis of market relations' via: the gradual reduction and eventual abolition of all customs tariffs and other internal trade barriers; equal legal status for one anothers' companies, to encourage jointly-owned companies (this would in part enable other republics to pay Russia for energy supplies with stakes in their industrial enterprises); a payments union, or multi-currency clearing system to be run through an Inter-State Bank. This would eventually be transformed into a currency union under which republics would allow their currencies to float against the rouble within agreed limits. Those signatories which retain the rouble would have fiscal and monetary policy determined by Russia. War-torn Georgia sent an observer to the Moscow summit, while the three Baltic states have avoided anything to do with the Commonwealth. Turkmenistan did not sign, after other members questioned its request to be exempt from key points of the treaty. Ukraine joined as an associate member pending full approval from its parliament. The treaty's most immediate benefit is political, giving Russian President Boris Yeltsin an important show of recognition from Russia's neighbours as he struggles to dissolve a parliament which has deposed him. Many other republics have been driven to the treaty primarily through their inability to finance energy imports from Russia, and see it as a means to obtain financial help. The knock-on effects of the insolvency of a country like Belarus have included a ban by the authorities on even private Belarussian businessmen from transferring money to Russia. Although he said yesterday's agreement would help further integration among six republics which have already undertaken to keep the rouble as their common currency, Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Russian central bank, warned that the economic union could not be built overnight. Russia has decided to issue Rbs1,000bn in bonds backed by 100 tonnes of gold, Commonwealth television said, Reuter reports from Moscow. It said Russia produced 150 tonnes of gold a year and had reserves of 330 tonnes. It did not say when the bonds would be issued and gave no details of the interest rate or maturity.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Letter: Corporate mission statement is more than redundant Sir, The corporate world has been hoodwinked by the idea of the corporate mission statement (Management: 'Men with a mission - more companies are putting corporate values into words', May 10). Everyone has one - the same one] It goes something like: 'To be the best provider of (insert product/service) in the (insert business) industry.' Such statements are meaningless: everybody wants to be the best. Andrew Campbell (Letters, June 29) considers them redundant. I would go further. At best, they are totally useless, at worst they are an insult to everyone's intelligence. Stephen Simpson, Ripples, Palmers Lane, Burghfield Common, Reading, Berks RG7 3DU</p>

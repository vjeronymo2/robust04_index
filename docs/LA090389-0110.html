			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COFFEE IS THESE TASTERS' CUP OF TEA;  </P> <P> PROFESSIONAL GRADERS DECIDE THE FATE OF IMPORTED BEANS  </P> <P> In a small corner room at the World Trade Center, an elite group of people with  gifted taste buds, speedy slurps and an appreciation of caffeine gather for a  special mission: to decide the fate of billions of beans.  </P> <P> Equipped with cups, silver spittoons and freshly roasted brew that would shame  any doughnut shop, the tasters judge whether coffee grown in 46 countries meets  the standards of the New York Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange.  </P> <P> It's a job that has become more important because of the suspension of coffee  export limits this summer, which resulted in a flood of beans pouring into the  United States, the world's biggest coffee market.  </P> <P> Rejection could mean huge losses for importers and brokers, particularly now  that producers can't rely on the agreement to sell their coffee beans and  therefore must compete on quality.  </P> <P> Though the rejected coffee isn't discarded, it may sit longer in a warehouse,  could be sold at a discount or end up as a roasted blend or generic-brand  instant, the coffee equivalent of an old horse sent to the glue factory.  </P> <P> On this particular day, about $2 million worth of coffee -- or nearly 2.5  million pounds -- is at stake. But there were periods in the past two years  when all was quiet in what's known in coffee parlance as "the grading room."  </P> <P> "There was absolutely nothing going on for four to five months, nothing, zero,"  says Glenn Garnes, grading room assistant at the exchange where coffee, sugar  and cocoa contracts are traded.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bypassed Exchange  </P> <P> Coffee sold quickly in those days because of export quotas set by the  International Coffee Organization, the cartel of producers that artificially  determined prices through limiting the supply.  </P> <P> Tight supplies and high demand meant that a lot of coffee bypassed the exchange  and went directly to brokers or roasters.  </P> <P> With more beans to judge these days the tasters must slurp more mouthfuls of  coffee. Since they're paid by the number of bags tested, their take has  increased to about $630 for nearly two hours' work, which amounts to more than  $12 a slurp. During normal periods they earn about $200.  </P> <P> On July 4, the ICO temporarily suspended export ceilings that had kept  wholesale prices at between $1.20 and $1.40 a pound. U.S. roasters had  criticized the quotas for limiting access to quality coffee.  </P> <P> With coffee pouring into the United States, prices have tumbled nearly 40% and  made it a buyers' market.  </P> <P> Further depressing prices is the normal slow summer roasting period, a  long-term decline in U.S. coffee consumption and efforts by producers to empty  warehouses before the new harvest starting in September.  </P> <P> "If the market is already at these levels in anticipation of new crops what  will happen when the new crop actually comes?," says Bert Ruiz, industry  analyst with the New York brokerage firm Balfour Maclaine Corp.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prices Dropping  </P> <P> Retail prices also have fallen. Two of the biggest roasters, General Foods  Corp. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which have about 65% of the U.S. coffee  market, announced big price cuts Aug. 7.  </P> <P> General Foods, which markets Maxwell House and Sanka coffees, said it dropped  the average price it charges retailers 23 cents a pound for ground roasted  coffee. Procter &amp; Gamble, marketer of Folgers, lowered its price by 20  cents to about $2.50 a pound.  </P> <P> There's not much talking in the grading room as the testers judge the coffee  first by color and grade, or purity. Working in teams of three, they sort  through pans of small green coffee beans for imperfections -- brown, black,  rotten or faded beans.  </P> <P> Dirt and other impurities count against the batch. Every five bad beans, or one  black bean, equals one imperfection. Fifteen imperfections disqualifies the  entire lot.  </P> <P> Color also is important because as coffee ages it loses moisture and fades,  says taster Steve Colten, quality control manager for J. Aron &amp; Co. coffee  importers. Colten and the 26 other graders, including two women recently added  to the erstwhile male group, leave jobs or other activities to grade coffee.  </P> <P> Each pan, representing one 37,500-pound lot, is numbered so that the testers  know only the country of origin.  </P> <P> "We work blind so nothing biases our opinion," says Bill Griffin, former senior  buyer for Nestle Foods Corp.  </P> <P> Knowing the country is important because shades of color differ as do acidity  and flavor, tasters say. Coffees with earthy, fermented characteristics  passable for one country's coffees wouldn't be for another.  </P> <P> A tantalizing aroma fills the room as the beans are thrown into old-fashioned  roasters for browning over an open flame. The beans are then ground and steeped  in boiling water in preparation for tasting, the ultimate proving ground.  </P> <P> With a loud slurp Ray Schlegelmilch sucks in a spoonful of brew, twirls it  around his tongue and spits into a silver spittoon near his feet. Quickly  adjusting the swivel-top table, he brings the next cup into position, breaks  through the film of grounds atop the liquid, scoops another mouthful and  repeats the ritual. In a matter of seconds, he has tasted 21 cups.  </P> <P> Body, the right twinge of acidity and a good "bouquet" or aroma are important.  But tasters look for "negative rather than positive characteristics," says  Justin Colten, a former executive with J. Aron, who believes that coffee  tasting is "a very unique art."  </P> <P> Anything "off odor," -- a dirty or musty smell -- or that tastes too acidic,  leathery, fermented, medicinal or earthy is rejected.  </P> <P> This day, a Mexican coffee that has already passed color and grade tests is  rejected on taste. Garnes calls the importer, who requests a second opinion.  Three more tasters are asked to judge the brew. It passes on second tasting.  </P> <P> The testers, all current or retired coffee-industry executives, are purists  about coffee outside the grading room, too. Some are so choosy that they won't  buy coffee already roasted, much less ground. Several buy raw beans and roast  them at home.  </P> <P> "Anyone in the coffee business is very picky about their coffee," says Steve  Colten.  </P> <P> As for the latest fad -- flavored coffee, which is marinated in liquid  flavorings ranging from cinnamon to coconut -- the tasters turn up their noses.  </P> <P> "It's adulterated," says one.  </P> <P> "No one grows cinnamon-nut flavored coffee," says another. "If you get a good  cup of coffee, you don't need flavorings. You don't even need cream or sugar."  </P></p>

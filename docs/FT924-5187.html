			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Paris (12): From noodles to rice dishes - Ethnic eating / The adventurous gourmet can find a bewildering variety of national cuisines - from the numerous Japanese sushi bars to Thai and Chinese establishments IF you wander along rue Sainte-Anne at the back of the Bibliotheque National in the heart of Paris you could be forgiven for thinking that you were in downtown Tokyo. Rue Sainte-Anne is the centre of the Japanese community in Paris. The traditional bistros and tabac-bars which once filled the street, and the tiny side streets around it, have been chased away by noodle and sushi bars with brightly coloured neon signs glowing above their doors. There are so many Japanese eateries to choose from on rue Sainte-Anne that the sheer variety is bewildering. Most places are not really suitable for formal business lunches or dinners, but they do make a cheap and tasty alternative to the rich foie gras and compotier de boeuf of the classic Parisian restaurants. Higuma, on rue Sainte-Anne itself, is one of the liveliest and least expensive noodle bars. Matsuri Sushi on nearby rue Richelieu dishes up traditional noodles from a rotating counter. If you do like Japanese food, but would prefer to eat somewhere smarter, Kinugawa, a few blocks away on rue Mont Thabor, is ideal. Kinugawa, which sports one Michelin star, is one of the best, if not the best, Japanese restaurants in Europe and is kitted out exactly like chic modern restaurants in Tokyo or Osaka, with its electronic doors and pale wooden interior. The real Kinugawa devotees, such as Kenzo, the Japanese fashion designer who lives in Paris and owns Isse, the rue Sainte-Anne sushi house, eat at the kitchen bar. But as well as the usual tables, Kinuagawa also has small rooms set aside from the main restaurant upstairs for larger, and more discreet, rendezvous. Kinugawa is, predictably, much more expensive than the cheerful bars along rue Sainte-Anne. Whereas it is hard to spend more than FFr200 for a meal for two at the Higuma noodle bar, dinner for two at Kinugawa will cost around FFr900, with beer or sake. Japanese food is not the only ethnic cuisine in Paris. The city is famous for its North African restaurants, particularly its cous-cous houses. There are cous-cous houses, of wildly varying quality, in most parts of Paris, although the Belleville area is a good source of cheap Arabic food with some well-established places, such as Mansouria on rue Faidherbe, which specialises in Moroccan cuisine. Timgad, one rue Brunel in the 17th arrondissement is one of the very few North African restaurants to have been graced with a Michelin star. The restaurant on the top floor of the Institut du Monde Arabe is also worth a visit for its mix of Moroccan and European food and the wonderful view across the Seine on to the right bank. Belleville is also packed with Chinese restaurants, often huge dim sum canteens, as well as places specialising in Vietnamese and Thai cuisine. There is another sprinkling of cheap Chinese and Asian restaurants in the 13th arrondissement south of Austerlitz railway station. The hitch is that neither Belleville, nor the 13th, are particularly salubrious areas and are certainly not safe at night if you are alone. If you are keen to try Asian cuisine while in Paris, but want to go somewhere smarter, and safer, it is probably best to stick to the places in the centre such as Tong Yen on rue Jean Mermoz off the Champs-Elysees where you can choose from Chinese, Thai or Vietnamese dishes.</p>

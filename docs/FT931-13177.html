			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Risk and Reward: Traditional split in derivatives is less clear-cut THE traditional split between the two sides of the derivatives business  - the exchange-traded and over-the-counter markets - is becoming less clear-cut. Broadly, when derivative instruments are standardised and traded in heavy bulk, they are listed on futures exchanges, which offer greater transparency and reduce credit risk. But products which are tailor-made to suit specific requirements are traded over-the-counter, directly between counterparties. In Europe, the two sides are generally seen as complimentary. Frequently, the same banks which are active in the OTC market are often exchange members. Since they use the exchanges to offset risk undertaken in writing OTC business, the argument goes, the growth of the OTC market fuels volume on the exchange. 'It can be argued that short-term interest rate futures are competitors to the over-the-counter FRA (forward-rate agreement) market. But when we launch a new contract, it does not take FRA volume away,' according to Mr Roger Barton, head of product development at Liffe. In the US, the futures exchanges have adopted a more competitive stance towards the OTC market, partly a result of their history of turf battles. There is logic behind attempts to win business from the OTC market. For example, the largest component of the Dollars 4,000bn swaps market is dollar interest-rate swaps. These are heavily traded using standardised documentation, and no longer require specialist knowledge. Yet the Chicago Board of Trade's three and five-year swap futures, launched in 1991, proved a flop. One explanation is that the banks involved in the swaps market have an interest in trading over-the-counter, since the additional transparency provided by exchanges could cause bid/offer spreads to narrow. Another possibility is that the development of the swaps market was facilitated by the existence of exchange-traded products for hedging, such as the Eurodollar contract, which can now be traded out to five years, so that a separate swap futures contract was just not needed. In any case, the division between liquid, standardised markets and structured products is an over-simplification of the exchange/OTC split. The foreign exchange market is the most obvious anomaly: the most actively traded market in the world is barely traded on stock exchanges. However, counterparty risk in the foreign exchange market is of very short duration. Clearly, the need for exchange-traded contracts is greater when an exchange would provide a substantial reduction in credit risk. If credit risk is, as some traders believe, the key element, there is a strong argument for shifting at least some business on to exchanges. The decline in the credit-worthiness of banks and securities houses has made it increasingly difficult for some of them to do business, as demonstrated by the current spate of US firms attempting to set up separately capitalised, highly rated derivatives units. The CBOT is preparing to take advantage of such credit concerns by offering a so-called Hybrid Instrument Transaction System later this year, which will comprise a range of standardised products to be traded on a screen-based system, as well as clearing facilities. Other exchanges, notably the Chicago Board Options Exchange, are also becoming more ambitious in the complexity of the products they offer.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REPORT ASSAILS CONDITIONS AT STATE PRISON FOR WOMEN;  </P> <P> CORRECTIONS: DRUG DEALING BY INMATES AND STAFF, FRIGHTFUL MEDICAL CARE, SEXUAL  ABUSE AND CROWDING ARE AMONG PROBLEMS CITED BY LEGISLATIVE PANEL.  </P> <P> The California Institution for Women, the most overcrowded prison in the state,  has been plagued by poor medical care, drug trafficking and charges of sexual  assaults by inmates as well as staff members, according to a legislative  committee report on prison conditions.  </P> <P> Although improvements were noted at the Frontera correctional facility, the  preliminary report released this week called the prison the worst in the state  for drug abuse and detailed a host of problems ranging from security breakdowns  to mistreatment of pregnant inmates.  </P> <P> The report stated that one pregnant prisoner who was bleeding heavily could not  get help for at least eight hours. She later delivered prematurely and was not  notified for two weeks that her child had died, according to the report.  </P> <P> Investigators said another prisoner suffered a miscarriage and was told by  infirmary staff to store her dead fetus in a tissue box in her cell before  reporting back with it the next day.  </P> <P> The report by the Joint Legislative Committee on Prison Construction and  Operation, chaired by state Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), is the result of  an investigation into inmate complaints, allegations by the warden and news  stories about prison conditions.  </P> <P> The scathing document describes the women's facility as the state prison with  "the worst reputation for drug trafficking" and mentions that a high-ranking  correctional officer might be involved.  </P> <P> No details about the officer or the type of wrongdoing were disclosed, and the  report only made general reference to allegations of sexual abuse and  harassment by inmates and members of the prison staff.  </P> <P> In the commissary, state investigators noted filthy conditions, chronic  cockroach infestation, dangerous conditions and constant complaints from  inmates about spoiled food.  </P> <P> "There have been some changes out there," said Robert E. Holmes, chief  consultant to the legislative committee. "But I think there hasn't been an  appreciable drop in complaints about sexual abuse, harassment and drug dealing  by staff and inmates."  </P> <P> Officials of the state Department of Corrections say the California Institution  for Women, with 2,100 inmates, is the most overcrowded prison in the state. The  facility, off California 71 in San Bernardino County, was built for 926  prisoners in 1952.  </P> <P> In responding to the report, Prison Supt. Susan E. Poole said Tuesday, "My  intent is to investigate anything that appears improper or illegal. My  reputation is that I am a fair and conscientious person. I intend to keep it  that way."  </P> <P> Poole primarily blamed the prison's problems on severe overcrowding that has  made it a struggle just to make sure there are enough beds for the inmates.  </P> <P> Despite its criticism, the report described Poole as a "a caring person" and  said that conditions had improved since she took over the prison. But the  findings stated that Poole might not always be fully informed about prison  conditions.  </P> <P> The release of the committee's report coincides with the recent escape and  capture of Jeanette Lynn Hughes, 36, formerly of Huntington Beach, who was  serving a 25-year-to-life sentence at the women's prison for murdering her  husband. Hughes is fighting her extradition from El Paso, where she was  captured last week with Cindy Marie Coglietti, a prison guard accused of  helping her escape.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Ted Johnson and Jim Carlton contributed to this story.  </P></p>

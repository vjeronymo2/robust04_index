			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW FIRST STYLE DRAWS THE AYES OF TEXAS  </P> <P> For George and Barbara Bush, the honeymoon is definitely on. At inaugural  festivities that continued into the early hours of Sunday morning, the First  Couple's down-to-earth warmth and spontaneity continued to be the hot topic.  </P> <P> In one of the social highlights of the inaugural weekend, more than 5,500  people packed the Washington Hilton Crystal Ballroom on Saturday night for the  Texas State Society's "Black Tie and Boots" ball, an event where the men also  wore furs, the women also wore hats and boots, and they danced like they really  meant it.  </P> <P> What continued to be noticeably different from the Reagan inaugural parties was  the lowered-profile of the Hollywood crowd. That large contingency that swept  through town back then received the royal treatment. This time, they were  there, but in smaller numbers and less-starring roles. But the place went wild  when the new President and First Lady and their oldest son, George, arrived.  </P> <P> To a chorus of wolf whistles, Bush showed the crowd his cowboy boots, which  each had a map of Texas on it.  </P> <P> "I'll show you my boots. I don't want Ann Richards to think I'm not a Texan,"  said Bush, referring to the Democratic convention's keynote speaker, Texas  State Treasurer Richards, and the general campaign rhetoric that frequently  painted the then-vice president as a "tourist from Kennebunkport." The Texas  party crowd howled its delight.  </P> <P> He then spotted someone he knew in the enormous crowd and pointed at him,  barking: "There's Rocky Carroll from Houston, the man who made these boots!"  </P> <P> It was more of the same from a man who began his historical inaugural address  with, among his first words, "Hey, Danny!" -- an ad-lib salute to the Ways and  Means Committee chairman, Illinois Democrat Dan Rostenkowski, whom he spotted  in the crowd. And a man who bounced out of his limousine during the inaugural  parade to walk and to wave at the crowd -- and then invite some of those  tourists in to tour the White House the next day. Throughout the long weekend,  Barbara Bush made just as big an impression as her husband, making fun of her  unglamorous, size-14 self in speeches and patting White House visitors on the  arm.  </P> <P> At the Texas ball, where yellow roses, Mexican food and Lone Star beer (drunk  straight from the bottle) were everywhere, Mrs. Bush scored another big hit. As  she was introduced, she drew cheers just as loud as her husband, as the men  waved their cowboy hats in the air.  </P> <P> "All day long at our house," she said, "people have been coming up and asking,  'How does the President like this? How does the President like that?' I said,  'I don't know!' Then I remembered, 'My gosh! It's George!' "  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush went on to tell the party crowd that she "worked awfully hard this  week to make you very, very proud of me. Next week I'm going back to being  Barbara Bush again." The statement brought clapping, cheering and several  shouts of "We love you, Barbara!"  </P> <P> For some people in the crowd, the unpretentious nature of the new First Lady  was nothing new.  </P> <P> "I've known Barbara Bush for many years, and I've always loved her," said Texas  Sen. Phil Gramm, who was a Democrat in some of those many years before he  switched to Republican in 1983. "As Americans get to know her, they'll feel the  same way I do."  </P> <P> Another prominent Texan in the crowd agreed.  </P> <P> "She's fantastic," said Roger Staubach, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback.  "You're seeing the substance and depth of a great mother and a great wife.  She's been successful at what she's done, and it's not been easy."  </P> <P> Staubach's wife, Marianne, who had boots on her feet and little silver boots  dangling from her ears, chimed in: "She's fabulous. She's really showing that  down-home, good American values like caring for your family come through and  pay off."  </P> <P> Gregg Petersmeyer, who will be George Bush's "thousand points of light man" in  the Administration, overseeing the volunteer effort, said he has liked Barbara  Bush since he met her 20 years ago, when he was a 19-year-old summer intern in  the Nixon White House.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Qualities Much Admired'  </P> <P> "I think she's going to be one of the most popular First Ladies in memory,"  said Petersmeyer, who was Bush's Colorado state chairman. "Her qualities are  much admired. She's direct, humorous, unassuming, unpretentious, but classy."  </P> <P> The praise for Mrs. Bush was just as thick at a party that preceded the Texas  ball, a reception at the Four Seasons Hotel given by a group of Houston  business executives in honor of incoming Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher  and his wife, Georgette.  </P> <P> "She has such a strong sense of self. And she's such a warm person that she  brings that out in everyone she meets," said Georgette Mosbacher, who garnered  quite a bit of attention over the weekend herself as Washington's great hope  for a new social star. "She has no pretentions about her -- she's a great role  model."  </P> <P> Added Secretary of State James Baker: "As she says, what you see is what you  get. I think that's what the public likes."  </P> <P> Mrs. Bush has gotten off to a much better start as First Lady than Nancy  Reagan, who was new to Washington and not well prepared for it. Whereas the  Reagans cruised into Washington crusading against government, the Bushes are  the ultimate Washington insiders who have lived here and worked in government  for many years. They know and love Washington, and Washington knows and loves  them -- an important first step in making a good impression.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Transfer of Warmth'  </P> <P> "Barbara has done a lot for George Bush," said John Vogt, a Washington lobbyist  attending the Four Seasons cocktail party with fiancee, Lisa Richards, an  Atlanta flight attendant. "In the last couple of weeks I've sensed this  transfer of warmth; people feel more warmly about George Bush, and I believe  Barbara has made a significant contribution to that transformation. People feel  warm about him because they feel warm about her."  </P> <P> Richards observed, "She likes her grandchildren more than fashion. Nancy Reagan  was like an ideal person."  </P> <P> Vogt agreed.  </P> <P> "So many people in American can identify with Barbara Bush -- she's a very real  person," Vogt said. "I think it's neat that a lot of people out there can see  something of themselves in her."  </P></p>

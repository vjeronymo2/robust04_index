			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOY AVIATOR'S FATHER COULD BE GROUNDED;  </P> <P> INVESTIGATION: GARY ALIENGENA MAY HAVE HIS PILOT'S LICENSE SUSPENDED FOR FOUR  MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE CRASH THAT INTERRUPTED HIS SON'S FRIENDSHIP FLIGHT AROUND  THE WORLD.  </P> <P> Gary Aliengena, father of boy aviator Tony Aliengena, faces a four-month  suspension of his pilot's license as the result of a crash that occurred while  he was at the controls during his son's round-the-world flight last year,  authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration proposed the suspension in January after  investigating events that preceded the July 1989 crash in Alaska, FAA  spokeswoman Elly Brekke said.  </P> <P> Brekke said she did not know the specific findings against Aliengena, but an  FAA investigator said shortly after the crash that the San Juan Capistrano man  had mistaken a 300-foot taxiway for a 2,700-foot runway and tried to take off  from it. The investigator also said that Aliengena had loaded the Cessna 210  Centurion with two more passengers than its six-person limit.  </P> <P> The FAA will now hold informal discussions in Los Angeles with Aliengena, who  has appealed the proposed suspension. After discussions with Aliengena, the FAA  will make a final decision, spokesman Paul Steucke said.  </P> <P> The FAA could have proposed a suspension of anywhere between 30 days and a  year, Brekke said.  </P> <P> Aliengena can make a final appeal to a National Transportation Safety judge.  </P> <P> Aliengena described the FAA investigation as "standard operating procedure."  </P> <P> "Every time any airplane taxies off a runway, there is an FAA investigation.  It's kind of like an IRS audit," Aliengena said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> However, Aliengena would not comment on the proposed suspension.  </P> <P> After the crash, Aliengena blamed the layout of the gravel runway and taxiway  for the mishap.  </P> <P> The crash occurred on the last leg of 11-year-old Tony Aliengena's seven-week,  22,000-mile Friendship Flight.  </P> <P> The eight people on board, including the rest of the Aliengena family and  observers, had just completed a three-day fishing trip in the small Alaskan  village of Golovin, a remote town on the western coast of the state. Gary  Aliengena took control of the plane at Golovin to give his son a rest and had  planned to head for Nome, which is 90 miles west.  </P> <P> The single-engine Cessna crashed after a gust of wind lifted the plane off the  taxiway, which the elder Aliengena was allegedly using as a runway.  </P></p>

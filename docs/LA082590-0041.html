			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES AT THE BOWL  </P> <P> On Aug. 17 a very positive production of "An Old Fashioned Night at the Movies"  was staged at the Hollywood Bowl. It was obviously fun for the sellout crowd to  share in the movie-and-live-show concept.  </P> <P> I feel forced to address the mean-spirited, "bah, humbug" attitude of Kevin  Thomas' review.  </P> <P> He dismisses the need for any live entertainment, and particularly zings the  Doc Severinsen Tonight Show Band. Our band sounded particularly good that night  and was anything but "off form," as suggested by Scrooge Thomas. His obvious  annoyance at the rather long program clogged his ear and his judgment canals.  </P> <P> We hope there will be more shows like it, and if Thomas stays away from musical  critiques, I promise not to write any movie reviews.  </P> <P> ED SHAUGHNESSY  </P> <P> Tonight Show Band, NBC  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a report today from the Russian Navy's  press center, command and staff training in administering  Russia's armed forces was carried out in keeping with an  operational training plan for the period of 21-22 June, under  the leadership of Russian President Boris Yeltsin, the supreme  commander in chief. During the training a strategic purpose  guided missile cruiser [raketnyy podvodnyy kreyser  strategicheskogo naznacheniya] of the Northern Fleet launched,  on the command of the commander in chief, a ballistic missile  from the waters of the Barents Sea to Kamchatka area. It is  reported that the missile head arrived at the predetermined  destination. The launching was carried out in an ordinary  manner.    Similar exercises also took place at the state missile  testing ground at Plesetsk. For the first time in the entire  history of the strategic purpose missile troops, journalists  observed the launching of the Topol SS-25 intercontinental  ballistic missile, which will become the basis of Russia's  strategic nuclear forces before the year 2005. It is the  purpose of the exercises to develop a system of monitoring and  tracking and to check the reliability of the military equipment.  The 45-tonne missile was launched towards a training target  situated on the Kamchatka peninsula. Its nuclear warhead  weighing practically a tonne is capable of striking the target  with an accuracy of a few meters.    The missile also works well for peaceful purposes. In the  autumn of this year the refitted Topol will put a  radio-technical satellite into near-Earth orbit. When the  missile has served its military term, the missile will launch a  satellite a second time. In the future this will allow Russia  to resolve two tasks simultaneously: in accordance with the  START-II treaty, to cut down nuclear armaments and to create a  launch vehicle for space satellites without enormous expense.  One only needs to add that today's exercises were absolutely  peaceful ones. The unarmed warhead, which struck the target  precisely, did not harm anyone.</p>

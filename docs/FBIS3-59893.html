After giving an analysis of international reaction to the  Ukrainian Supreme Soviet's resolution on START-1 and on the  Ukraine's commitments under the Lisbon Protocol, he said that "a  consensus against Kiev's denuclearization maneuverings" is  forming in the world. In his opinion, "Kiev should take  account" of the sharp reaction by European countries to the  Ukraine's intention of keeping the nuclear weapons that are on  its territory.</p>

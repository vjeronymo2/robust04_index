			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY NOT PLAY THE GAME INSTEAD OF PLACING BLAME?  </P> <P> In a recent story by Mark Heisler, he states Ben Wade is under the gun.  </P> <P> This is so typical of the Dodger front office pass-the-buck attitude. For  years, Al Campanis and Fred Claire traded away top talent for over-the-hill,  injured, overpriced players; the minor league department forgot to develop the  talent they had, and now they all blame the scouts. Just once, it would be  refreshing for Fred Claire to admit making a mistake instead of pushing the  blame elsewhere.  </P> <P> LOUIS NEWTON  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

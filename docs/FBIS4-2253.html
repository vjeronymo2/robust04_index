			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 7 (XINHUA) -- China and the United  States have no conflicts of fundamental interests and the  military contacts between them should be increased, said a  senior Chinese military leader here today.    Yet, owning to reasons on the U.S. side, the present  contacts  between the two armed services are quite limited, said Liu  Huaqing, vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission.    "We welcome more U.S. friends to visit our country," he told  former U.S. Defense Secretary Harold Brown here this afternoon.    Brown, who is advisor to the U.S. Centre for Strategic and  International Studies (CSIS), are [as received] here on a visit  as guest of the China Center for International Studies.    Some decade ago, Liu met with the then U.S. defense  secretary  here in Beijing.    "You made positive contributions to the friendship between  the two countries and the two militaries," Liu told Brown, while  voicing the hope that the current visit be helpful to the  development of Sino-U.S. ties.    There are only a few years left in the running up to the  21st  century, which, China hopes, would be one of peace and  development, Liu said.    Both China and the United States should contribute to the  realization of such a goal, Liu said.    Touching on the country's military, Liu noted that the  Chinese Armed Forces are responsible for the national  sovereignty, territorial integrity as well as the maintenance of  national security and stability. Its military strategy is  purely defensive, he added.    On the Korean nuclear issue, Liu reiterated that China hopes  to see a stable Korean Peninsula.    China is in favor of denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula  and it hopes the nuclear issue be settled through patient  dialogues between all the relevant parties. Imposing pressure  can only make things more complicated, he said.    During the meeting, Brown expressed the hope that the  U.S.-China ties be improved and the bilateral cooperation on  regional, international security and other areas be strengthened.    Also in the afternoon, Zhang Wannian, chief of the General  Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, met with Brown  and his party.</p>

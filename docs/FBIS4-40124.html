			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 24, June 6-12 </F> 94]    [Text] Since very painful and complicated negotiations in  Kiev (see UBN No. 23/1994) and significant concessions on the  part of Ukrgazprom, Russia's natural gas supplier, Gazprom, has  continued its extra supplies, which allows Ukraine to pool  enough natural gas to sustain Ukraine through the customarily  dreaded fall-winter period, without restricting domestic  consumption.    Under an earlier agreement Gazprom undertook to pipe 10  billion cu. m. [cubic meters] of natural gas to Ukrainian  underground storaging facilities located predominantly in West  Ukraine.    A part of the above amount will be redeemed by Ukraine,  though the bulk of natural gas stocks are supposed to secure  stability of Russian exports to other nations, whose gas  consumption will naturally grow in the fall-winter period.    Gazprom supplied 5,257.9 million cu. m. of natural gas  within  the 1-10 June period, which exceeded the target figure by 174.7  million.    Within the same period, Turkmenistan piped 601.9 million cu.  m. of natural gas to Ukraine, which also exceeded the agreed  amount, by 90.2 million cu. m.    Ukraine's aggregate natural gas consumption during the very  same period totalled 756.2 million cu. m., which allowed to save  450 million cu. m. of natural gas and increase Ukrgazprom's  underground-stored pool by 4,103.6 million cu. m.    If natural gas supply rates are maintained at their present  magnitude, Ukrgazprom will be able to pool the necessary 25 to  30 billion cu. m. reserve by the summer season's close.</p>

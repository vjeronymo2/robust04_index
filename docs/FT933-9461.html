			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Euro-constituency plans announced THE government yesterday announced the procedures it will use to redraw the electoral boundaries of England and Wales for next year's elections to the European parliament. The addition of an extra five constituencies in England, and one for Wales, which followed a deal at last year's Edinburgh summit to compensate for the addition of 18 new seats in eastern Germany, required extensive alterations to the electoral map. Public consultation will now be carried out very quickly. The Committee for England, appointed by Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, proposes to publish its provisional recommendations for European constituencies on September 22. Representations for or against these recommendations and counter-proposals will need to be submitted to the committee by October 22. These will then be deposited in each district council area by November 8, and any responses will have to be submitted by November 24. The government said: 'The timetable in the bill does not permit the committee to hold local inquiries. The timetable is tight because of the requirement in the bill to report 'as soon as practicable' and also because the next European parliamentary elections are to be held in June 1994.' However, the committee is confident that it can make final recommendations to the home secretary by Christmas. It added that it was 'aware that the tightness of the intended timetable outlined may cause problems for local authorities and other organisations. The timetable is unavoidable'. Some Conservatives have complained about the timetable and Labour has criticised the plans for not involving the independent Boundary Commission, which is responsible for setting constituencies for the UK parliament. Commission members will advise the committee. Under the rules, each European constituency must include two or more parliamentary constituencies, and no parliamentary constituency will be split between two European constituencies. The total electorate in each case will be as close as possible to an average figure of 512,851.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Pensions group calls for curbs on employers THE PENSIONS industry's trade association urged new restrictions yesterday on employers' operation of pension schemes and renewed its call for a compensation fund for pensioners. The National Association of Pension Funds set out at its autumn conference a detailed response to the independent inquiry set up by the government. The association proposed that court permission be required for a number of actions, including amending trust deeds, winding up pension schemes and making bulk transfers of members into and out of pension schemes. All those actions were taken by trustees of pension schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell, which have collapsed after the theft of more than Pounds 400m. In response to the most contentious issue under review, the association said there should be no restrictions on employers' ability to use surpluses for their sole benefit, provided the scheme had more than enough to provide members with all promised benefits. The association's submission said: 'The NAPF working party believes that if surpluses had always to be used in whole or in part for the benefit of scheme members, some employers might insist on a funding policy which aimed to avoid surpluses arising, or they would cease to operate final salary schemes. Neither of these outcomes would be in the interests of scheme members.' The association has proposed several conditions that employers would have to meet to preserve members' reasonable expectations. Employers would have to tell employees what increases they could expect to pensions in payment and whether employers were providing enough money to the scheme to fund those increases. It should be expected that employers would always leave some surplus in the scheme to cover a reasonable margin in the event of poor investment returns. With that information available, and measures to protect members' rights on wind-up, employees should be able to view their contributions as the purchase of an entitlement to a known set of benefits. The association urged that the composition of a board of trustees should strike a balance between the different interests, and members should have the right to appoint at least one trustee to each scheme. In a show of hands, the conference overwhelmingly signalled opposition to the associations's wide-ranging proposal for an industry-funded compensation scheme. The majority of those present favoured a more limited scheme offering compensation to pensioners only in cases of outright fraud. Mr Tom Ross, the NAPF vice-chairman elect and a partner at actuaries Clay and Partners, said the delegates were not necessarily representative of the membership.</p>

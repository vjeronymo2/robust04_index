			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian policemen manning a roadblock in the  northern part of the Gaza Strip fired shots at the tires of an  Israeli vehicle transporting Arab workers from Nisanit to the  Erez checkpoint. Nobody was hurt in the incident.    The Israeli contractor who drove the car told our  correspondent Nisim Qeynan that he did not stop at the  Palestinian roadblock because he wanted to be checked only at  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] roadblock. He claims that the  soldiers manning the IDF roadblock ordered him to return to the  Palestinian roadblock for inspection. The fire was directed at  his car as he was driving back toward that roadblock.</p>

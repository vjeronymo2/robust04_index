			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Exports strategy to be unveiled today MR RICHARD NEEDHAM, the trade minister, will today announce details of a national strategy for export promotion intended to boost Britain's share of international trade by Pounds 10bn a year and reverse the decline of capital exporters in the developing world. The plan, intended to quell complaints that the government lacks a clear strategy for economic recovery, aims to bring coherence to an existing array of national and local policies rather than outline new initiatives. It comes at a time of rising concern over Britain's export performance, which in spite of what amounts to a 13 per cent devaluation since Black Wednesday two months ago continues to lag behind the trend in imports. Exports in October were Pounds 9.1bn, a record for 1992, and up by 4.6 per cent on September - but more than matched by a 5 per cent rise in imports to Pounds 10.2bn. The 'Needham plan' to be outlined today will involve: Regeneration of exhibition facilities, starting with support for the 1995 'West Midlands Year of Celebration', based on Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre. Corralling leading exporters to 'godfather' smaller companies, showing them how to make headway in overseas markets. Using the Department of Trade and Industry's industrial competitiveness division to 'make sure the government knows what the rest of the world is doing'. Ensuring that adequate export credit cover is available to exporters 'with the maximum gearing from this and the Aid for Trade Provision to bring in behind capital goods exporters'. Boosting the 'one-stop shop' operations in the British regions as outlined by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, enabling exporters to deal with all procedures in one location. Mr Needham will acknowledge that 'big industry' exporters have lost ground in markets in the developing world, from almost Dollars 550m in 1986 (a 7 per cent share of total Dollars 7.8bn trade in capital goods) to Dollars 532m in 1990 (a 5 per cent share of Dollars 10.7bn). The government's aim - based on projections formulated by the Confederation of British Industry in March - is to boost Britain's share of international trade from 5.3 per cent in 1990 to 6.3 per cent by the turn of the century. That would add Pounds 10bn to exports at current prices and eliminate the country's visible trade deficit, the CBI said. Capital goods exporters have complained vehemently over the past year that the high cost of export credit insurance, and limits to cover in buoyant markets such as Hong Kong, China and Malaysia, have undermined their competitiveness in these markets. The government went part of the way to meeting complaints in its Autumn Statement two weeks ago when it announced a Pounds 700m increase in export credit cover available for such markets. But it has resisted pressure to cut premium rates, partly because of a conviction that the devaluation of sterling and cuts in interest rates will have provided exporters with the stimulus they need. 'This is not a strategy for the next fortnight,' Mr Needham said yesterday, 'It's a strategy that is to embed itself throughout the trading base of the UK, at a local level, within government, between departments of government, and in their relations with industry and overseas. To get the local infrastructure in place is going to take a bit of time.'</p>

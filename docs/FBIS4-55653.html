			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Klepac Took a Risk"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--"The extraordinary nature of this  period, in which the further orientation of independent Slovakia  is being decided, requires extraordinary decisions and deeds.  The formation of a Christian bloc in Slovak politics would  constitute such a deed. Unfortunately Jan Carnogursky [chairman  of the Christian Democratic Movement, KDH] proved unable to rise  above the feeling of having been personally hurt and to give  priority to a higher moral principle." This is stated in a  statement issued by the Christian Social Union [KSU] in response  to the KDH chairman's remark that the KSU should not run in the  parliamentary elections. KSU Chairman Jan Klepac informed  reporters about this statement yesterday. The KSU is of the  opinion that Slovakia, where 70 percent of the population  declares itself Christian, needs a strong Christian political  party. It would be a response to the formation of the left-wing  bloc and the ethnic Hungarian bloc, in which Hungarian  communists, Christians, and liberals managed to join forces.  The KSU chairman submitted this proposal to Jan Carnogursky  three weeks ago, even though he was taking the risk of arousing  the disagreement of some KSU members who have still not  forgotten that KDH deputies voted against the Declaration of  Sovereignty and the Slovak Constitution.    [Bratislava SME in Slovak on 17 May on page 3 carries a  250-word "dos"-signed report on the KSU briefing. The report  includes the following passage: "Jan Klepac assessed negatively  the fact that the KDH is offering places on its slate of  candidates to `cosmopolitans and exponents of Czechoslovakism.'  In his opinion, by opening up to atheism, the KDH is losing its  Christian character. The KSU chairman also reacted to reports  according to which the Slovak National Party Central Council  considers a coalition with the KSU possible only without its  chairman and deputy chairman. `Should this be the case, it would  be intolerable interference in the internal affairs of another  political entity,' the KSU chairman said."]</p>

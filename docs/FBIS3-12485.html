			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A spokesman for the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] has said 'Arafat and his team  should immediately call a halt to the bilateral and multilateral  negotiations. They should do this in response to our people's  desire and in view of the fact that the majority of the PLO  Executive Committee members have boycotted the Tunis meetings.  The following members have boycotted the Tunis meetings, either  because they have resigned, withdrawn, or frozen their  membership: Taysir Khalid, 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, Mahmud  Isma'il, 'Abdallah Hurani, Shafiq al-Hut, Mahmud Darwish,  Sulayman al-Najjab, Yasir 'Amr, and Jamal al-Surani.    The DFLP spokesman continued: Only eight members met in  Tunis. Three of them urged a halt to the negotiations. Thus, 12  out of 18 members are urging a halt to the negotiations. Only  five members support 'Arafat in responding to Clinton's  invitation to go to the negotiations in Washington.</p>

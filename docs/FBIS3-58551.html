			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Istanbul -- It has been learned that a month ago  Turkey sent 5,000 military personnel to Azerbaijan under the  supervision of the General Staff. Active combat elements as  well as military specialists were among the 5,000. It was  reported that the military personnel assigned by Turkey have  been distributed on the fronts. It was also learned that, in  tandem with the counterattack launched by the Azerbaijani Army,  three commando battalions of the Ground Forces have been  deployed on the borders with Armenia.    It is being reported that the Azerbaijani units have had  successful military operations over the last 10 days. It is  being claimed that the specialists and personnel sent from  Turkey had a role in the success of the Azerbaijani units on the  Fizulinskiy, Mardakertskiy, Goradiz, and Agdamskiy fronts.    When Geydar Aliyev first came to power in Azerbaijan, the  services of the Turkish personnel were discontinued, and  subsequently some of them had returned to Turkey. However, new  personnel were dispatched to Azerbaijan following the resolution  of differences with the Aliyev administration. It was claimed  at the time that most of the Special Warfare elements sent to  Azerbaijan to help the People's Front gain power were  pro-Turkes. When Aliyev came to power, Nationalist Action Party  leader Alparslan Turkes' control over Azerbaijan collapsed and  his son Tugrul Turkes had no other choice but to return to  Turkey.  <H5>  Baku Summit To Take Place 21-22 January </H5>   The Azerbaijani scientists and reporters organized a news  conference on the latest situation in Azerbaijan at the  Azerbaijani Consulate in Istanbul.

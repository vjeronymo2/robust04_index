			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' CHOICE: KING OF THE ROAD BY PAUL HEMPHILL (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $18.95;  296 PP.)  </P> <P> "More than anything, this novel is a labor of love, of the admiration of a son  for his father, which is probably not such a common thing these days. . . . But  the story also fulfills its original premise -- that of the Dylan Thomas poem  -- and it is uplifting to see the triumph of old Jake Hawkins, raging  successfully against 'the dying of the light.' " Winston Groom  </P></p>

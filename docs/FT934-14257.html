			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Rate cut not a prudent way of offsetting VAT rise Sir, The proposal that tax increases in the November Budget be offset by a base rate reduction is gaining wide acceptance. Its attractions may seem obvious, but there are drawbacks which have not, at least in public, received much attention. First the effect on prices. If the tax increase is by means of VAT, this affects the underlying rate of inflation; in contrast, an interest rate cut affects only the headline rate. Second, what of the effect on demand? A tax increase may reduce demand, and an interest rate reduction increase it. But do they do so with the same time lags? If not, carrying out the proposal could easily lead first to slowing the economy when it is weak, and then stimulating it when recovery is again under way. And third, the interest rate is used to control money growth. A cut in interest rates will make money growth higher than it would have been, in principle forever, until the cut is reversed. Output will be boosted first, but subsequent inflation will be increased. The fiscal change will have, at most, only a one-off effect on demand. Is it prudent to neglect the longer-run effects of monetary policy? It certainly has not been in the past.

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Further weakness in IBM drags Dow lower Wall Street US markets failed to draw strength from a better-than-expected third-quarter economic growth report, and by the close prices were mostly lower with IBM again dragging down the Dow Jones Industrial Average, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow finished 8.38 lower at 3,235.73, although off its trough for the day when the average had been down more than 20 points. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 closed up 0.32 at 418.48, while the Amex composite ended up 0.49 at 376.65 and the Nasdaq composite down 1.97 at 596.95. Turnover on the NYSE was busy at 210m shares. Investors ignored the week's most important economic data, the gross domestic product report for the third quarter which showed a 2.7 per cent rise in output between July and September. Although it was a bigger increase than analysts had expected, it failed to inspire confidence in the outlook for the economy, and most forecasters are still predicting a slower rate of growth in the final quarter of the year. The market was not helped by a big fall in the Conference Board's September index of consumer confidence, which dropped from 57.3 to 53.0 last month. Although the figures sparked a welcome rally in bond prices, the Treasury market's gains failed to lift sentiment in the equity market. Among individual stocks, IBM could not shake the sellers that have devastated the stock since the company announced disappointing quarterly earnings a week and a half ago. IBM fell another Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 65 3/4 , a new low for the year, in turnover of 3.2m shares. This latest drop was sparked by newspaper reports that suggested a bleak outlook for the computer mainframe market. Other big stocks were also hit by sellers. General Motors, which has yet to announce a successor to its ousted chairman, Mr Robert Stempel, fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 32 3/8 . Xerox plunged Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 76 after the company announced third quarter earnings of Dollars 135m and a Dollars 444m provision related to the restructuring of the group's Crum &amp; Forster unit. Xerox also warned that there may be a need for further provisions. Northern Telecom rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 36 1/2 in turnover of 1/2 m shares on news of third quarter net income of 46 cents a share, slightly lower than the 48 cents a share earned at the same stage last year. RJR Nabisco firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 1/4 in turnover of almost 3m shares after the company announced net income of 18 cents a share for the third quarter, up from 7 cents a share a year earlier. Canada TORONTO stocks ended higher in active trading, following Monday's defeat of a package of constitutional changes in a national referendum. According to preliminary data, the TSE 300 index rose 10.45 points, or 0.32 per cent, to close at 3,286.44. Advances led declines 322 to 225, volume of 38.2m shares was below Monday's 39.2m, and trading value rose to CDollars 395.6m from the previous CDollars 244m. Industrial products and banking were up 1.48 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively. Consumer products rose moderately, energy stocks were flat. Golds and mining decreased 1.90 per cent and 1.95 per cent, respectively. In all, eight of the 14 stock groups ended higher.</p>

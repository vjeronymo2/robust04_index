			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALABAMA'S 'DULL' AMPHITHEATRE SHOW  </P> <P> I would like to respond to your review of the Alabama concert at the Pacific  Amphitheatre ("Despite Fog, Strobes, Alabama Delivers Dull Show," by Jim  Washburn, April 10):  </P> <P> Perhaps you were unable to see distinctly or hear clearly the pure adulation  and excitement the audience displayed for Alabama.  </P> <P> Your comment about the songs they performed -- that they "sounded like little  more than commercials for a very weak beer" -- really reveals your ignorance to  the popularity of the group. This group was again voted in the People magazine  poll as "America's favorite group." Many of those songs went to No. 1 on the  country music charts. I highly doubt they would have achieved No. 1 status if  the songs had "forgettable melodies," as you stated.  </P> <P> Your comment about Randy Owen's "continual 'We love you (fill in regional area  here)!' interjections" again shows your lack of knowledge of the group. Alabama  has millions of fans across America and abroad. This is an excellent gesture to  make the fans in every city feel special. I know Alabama is not the only group  to do this. Randy has always been energetic and emotional in concert. That's  just Randy.  </P> <P> The song "The Fans" was written especially for the fans by Alabama. That means  a lot in this fast-paced world of so-called superstars who eventually forget  their roots and the people who helped them attain their popularity.  </P> <P> Your reference to Teddy Gentry's "The Borderline," which you state was "so  removed from real grit and feeling that it could make Marty Robbins puke in his  grave," was a cheap shot. (You call yourself a journalist?) The song is a  ballad. Did you honestly ever listen to the lyrics of Alabama's songs?  Apparently not.  </P> <P> It is quite evident from your review that you have never been to an Alabama  concert before. For some reason, it appears you have a chip on your shoulder  about Alabama. You might be well advised to stick to reviewing pop music  concerts because you obviously don't know anything about country music.  </P> <P> DEBBIE COX  </P> <P> Placentia  </P></p>

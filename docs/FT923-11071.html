			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Ministers to push for VAT accord ONE of the largest remaining obstacles to a barrier-free European market could be removed later today, when EC finance ministers will make their strongest attempt yet to agree minimum VAT rates and excise duties. At a 10-hour meeting in Brussels last week national officials swept away some of the remaining hurdles to a harmonised indirect tax regime. The British presidency of the EC has now arranged for ministers to have a whole day to tackle the remaining problems, following up their meeting last month when they came close to agreeing the package of eight indirect tax directives. If they fail, further discussion will be delayed until after the EC's unofficial summer break, making it practically impossible to implement the new system by the end of the year. That would give member states an excuse to postpone the lifting of border controls on goods come 1993. 'It is essential that we don't wait for the September meeting, but sort these things out on Monday,' said a senior Commission official at the weekend. The meeting will be chaired by Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer. He raised hopes for an agreement last month when he indicated the UK could relax its long-standing opposition to a binding minimum standard VAT rate of 15 per cent. At today's meeting the British paymaster general, Sir John Cope - who will represent London's position - is likely to insist that the directive on rates should be reviewed after four or five years. The greatest worry is that agreement on the whole package might be derailed by individual national concerns about the tax rating of everything from children's seat-belts to guide dogs for the blind. Mr Lamont is expected to table a compromise on one outstanding problem - excise duty on whisky. The deal will be based on an earlier Portuguese compromise which would split national duties into two tiers. Ministers will be asked to decide where to fix two levels of duty. Under the Portuguese suggestions, only Spain would have to increase its tax on spirits, while duty in most other countries would be frozen at current rates. Other potential problems include Belgian concerns about the VAT exemption for gold in neighbouring Luxembourg. France is also worried that the Netherlands and Germany may win the right to apply reduced rates to flowers.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Tenuous balance beneath Bovespa's calm exterior - Bill Hinchberger analyses Brazil's equity market Brazilian stock markets have seemed remarkably immune to the political and economic instability that surround them. Yet underneath their calm exterior, it appears that the balance is tenuous, provided by a jittery combination of push and pull. Last week, after Mr Paulo Haddad resigned as finance minister and Mr Itamar Franco, the Brazilian president, named Mr Eliseu Resende as his replacement  -a nomination widely criticised by politicians and business people alike - the Sao Paulo, or Bovespa, index lost just 1.4 per cent. Inflation of about 5 per cent during the week boosted the drop in real terms, but on Monday of this week the market rebounded with an 8.1 per cent surge, to 14,974, making up the losses. Most traders agreed that Monday's jump was primarily due to defensive moves by investors, worried about potential politico-economic initiatives, shifting out of fixed interest stocks. Yesterday the Bovespa finished a further 3.1 per cent ahead. Before the ministerial shakeup, Brazilian equities were up with the leaders among emerging markets. In the two months to end-February they showed an increase in dollar terms of 21.7 per cent, according to figures from the International Finance Corporation in Washington, outpaced by only Turkey and Taiwan. From December to February, the Bovespa index gained 207 per cent, compared with inflation of 99 per cent for the period. In December, improvement was primarily sparked by the end of the political crisis that had dragged on for most of 1992, ending with the resignation and impeachment of the former president, Mr Fernando Collor de Mello, after Christmas. In January and February, the market reacted favourably to gradual reform - the passage of port modernisation legislation, steps towards fiscal reform, and advances in debt negotiations with foreign creditors. Yet these positive signs were offset by apparently impulsive actions by the new president, like the decision to offer tax breaks for the relaunching of the Volkswagen Beetle, and delays in the privatisation programme. The biggest beneficial push was provided by the passage of legislation to allow public electric utility companies to set rates according to their costs, without interference by central authorities. Large industrial users currently pay about Dollars 45 per megawatt hour, compared with an average generating cost of Dollars 70 per megawatt hour. The prospect of higher prices made leading utility equities appear as attractive as stock in Telebras, the state-controlled telecommunications holding company that customarily accounts for half of daily trading in Sao Paulo. Eletrobras, the federal electricity company, gained 122 per cent in real terms in February. Cemig, the utility concern in Minas Gerais state, jumped 191 per cent in real terms during the month. Foreign investors might put Dollars 1bn into the electric sector this year, either by shifting from current Brazilian holdings or through new investment, ventured Mr Edmund Games - a vice-president of the US investment house Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, and portfolio manager for the Brazil Fund, a closed end fund which trades on the New York Stock Exchange - during a mid-February visit to Rio de Janeiro. However, politics are a potential wild card. As Mr Resende gets settled into office, conjecture will give way to reaction to real events. Today, the Senate is scheduled to pass final judgment on a financial transactions tax which, says Mr Franco, is necessary to help balance the federal budget. Share prices and stock market liquidity are still low. The 593 companies traded on the Rio de Janeiro exchange closed 1992 with an average book value of 28 per cent. This contributed to make February the third month in the last five with no new public share issues. Foreign investors are tempted, but playing safe. 'The vast majority are cautious,' Mr Robert Barclay, president of Baring Securities Brasil, says. 'They are waiting for a clear sign that economic reform is moving forward. Yet they are all terrified of missing out.'</p>

While inspecting the Haicang  project investment zone in Xiamen, the vice premier pointed out:  Under the vigorous support of relevant State Council  departments since 1990, especially since 1992, and through the  efforts of the Fujian provincial and Xiamen city party and  government leaders and the masses of people, the investment zone  has made great progress in infrastructure construction.  Equipped with essential roads, water and electricity supplies,  and communications, the investment zone is now ready for  all-around development. Great progress has also been made in  leveling the requisitioned land inside the zone and constructing  amenities outside it as well as other supporting facilities  related to the zone. All of this has laid a sound foundation  for the investment zone's future development and construction,  as well as for Xiamen's further development.    After listening to briefings by officials of the Fujian  provincial party committee and government, and the Fuzhou and  Xiamen city party committees and governments, Zhu Rongji fully  affirmed their achievements in recent years. He said: Guided  by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and led by the party Central Committee  with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, Fujian -- the coastal  pioneering province in opening to the outside world -- has  undergone tremendous changes and scored remarkable achievements  in reform and economic development.    Accompanied by Jia Qinglin, provincial party secretary and  governor, Zhu Rongji inspected the Taijiang farmers' market in  Fuzhou, the largest farmers' market in the province. With great  interest, he threaded his way through the crowd, frequently  stopping at vegetable, fish, and rice stalls to inquire of their  owners about supplies, purchase prices, sales, marketing prices,  and income. After listening to the consumer response to market  supplies, the vice premier expressed satisfaction with the  market's large stocks and the stable prices of goods. He said:  Fujian Province has attached great importance to and done a  solid job in promoting agriculture and the vegetable basket  project. Prices have slipped back as a result of plentiful  supplies of nonstaple food, especially vegetables, to the  satisfaction of consumers. Social stability has helped create a  relaxed environment for reform and economic development this  year.    While in Fujian, the vice premier held separate discussions  on taxation reform with officials of industrial and business  enterprises and tax offices in Fuzhou and Xiamen cities, and  listened to their opinions attentively. The officials generally  expressed understanding and support for the State Council's  taxation reform program, and offered suggestions for solving  problems in the course of implementation. After hearing a  report by the Furi Company, Zhu Rongji praised it for not  raising the marketing price of its products -- television sets  -- despite a hike in the prices of imported raw materials,  parts, and components caused by the increased tax base figure.  He pointed out: As a result of the recent taxation reform,  about 28 percent of state-owned businesses will shoulder a  slightly heavier tax burden. It is hoped that to absorb the  increased prices of raw materials, these businesses will further  improve management, cut back on expenses, and lower production  costs, rather than raise product prices which will trigger price  rises of other commodities. What they do should be a credit,  not a smear, to reform. In response to the Fujian Bulb Plant's  report about some monopolizing businesses taking the opportunity  of taxation reform to increase product prices while adding a 17  percent value-added tax based on the increased price, the vice  premier immediately instructed the relevant department to  conduct an investigation and duly handle any violation. He  urged all State Council departments concerned to earnestly  review progress in the taxation reform program since it was  initiated a month ago; pay close attention to studying  suggestions and problems in general brought up at the  discussions; and take action to improve and perfect the program  in order to ensure the smooth progress of taxation reform.    During his inspection tour of the Haicang project  investment zone, Zhu Rongji also called on cadres and workers  who were still working industriously at the various construction  sites prior to Spring Festival, to extend regards and New Year  greetings to those remaining at their posts. A responsible  person of the Haicang administrative committee gave Zhu Rongji a  report, saying: Construction of some parts of the Haicang  project has begun. Construction of the main body of the Xianglu  Terylene Fiber Project, which is capable of manufacturing  180,000 metric tons of polyester products a year, has been  largely completed, and installation of equipment will begin  soon. At the same time, preparation work for the construction  of other downstream projects, such as the PVC Tubing Plant, will  also start soon. After listening to the report, Zhu Rongji said  happily: The development and construction of the Haicang  project investment zone have entered a new phase. This project  will certainly push forward the development of Xiamen's economy.    Zhu Rongji put forward some important suggestions for the  next- step development and construction of the Haicang project.  He called for accelerating the construction of such  infrastructure facilities as the Gaoyu Power Plant and the coal  handling wharf, and for improving the investment environment.  He also called for stepping up construction of the Xianglu  Terylene Fiber Plant, which is under construction, and for  making good preparations for installing the plant's equipment to  complete the project and put it into operation according to  schedule. At the same time, he also called for efforts to make  preparations for construction of other projects related to the  Haicang project to bring about a new situation regarding its  development and construction.    Accompanying Zhu Rongji on the inspection tour were He  Chunlin, Chen Jinhua, Wang Zongyu, Gu Xiulian, Yu Zhen, Dai  Xianglong, Li Yanling, Li Yizhong, Pan Liansheng, and Zhang  Xianghai, all responsible persons of the relevant departments  under the State Council.</p>

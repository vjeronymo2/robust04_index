			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Strike halts rail and air transport AN INDEFINITE general strike yesterday paralysed Ukrainian airports and railway stations, just as the country prepared to join the International Monetary Fund. The timing provides a vivid illustration of the contradictory pressures on the government, which is torn between workers' demands for more industrial subsidies and IMF insistence that Ukraine slash its bloated deficit. Most Ukrainian air traffic controllers, many rail workers and some of the powerful coalminers' organisations heeded a call by the Association of Independent Trade Unions and took to the picket lines in an effort to force the government to grant the unions official status. Most of Ukraine's airports were closed, and trains were halted outside many cities. Coalminers, potentially the biggest political threat to the government, participated less enthusiastically, however, with only 30-40 per cent stopping work. Ukrainian officials said that in Washington today Mr Hryhori Piatachenko, finance minister, was due to sign the documents which will formally admit the country to the IMF. A Fund delegation yesterday concluded a visit to Kiev for negotiations on a stabilisation programme. Speaking on television, President Leonid Kravchuk sounded a defiant note about the IMF. 'We shall act as an independent country and not just agree to any conditions put to us,' he said. Last month, in a letter leaked by Mr Vadim Hetman, reformist chairman of the Ukrainian national bank, the IMF warned that unless Ukraine began to implement reforms it should not count on an aid package. A Fund official said yesterday that there was still disagreement between the national bank, which advocates belt-tightening measures, and the prime minister and president who are more inclined to yield to populist pressures for continued subsidies. Ukraine's government has dragged its feet on fundamental economic reforms while racking up a huge budget deficit which has driven down the value of its pseudo-currency, the coupon. It is hoping for an IMF stabilisation fund of Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn to shelter its long awaited new currency, the hryvnia, from the coupon's sorry fate.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Banks defend actions on Pounds deals THE CLEARING banks hit back yesterday against allegations from politicians that they have made huge speculative profits out of sterling's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Peter Wood, finance director of Barclays Bank - speaking for all UK clearing banks - said Bank of England regulations made it impossible that any of them could have made enormous profits from trading in sterling on September 16 when the currency was taken out of the ERM. 'We have limits on the open positions we can run,' he said. The limits were partly banks' internal constraints; partly Bank of England restrictions. As a result, even had the banks been convinced that sterling would fall sharply below its ERM floor - as it did on September 16 - they were unable to carry a big negative position. When a bank has a negative position, it has sold currency that it does not have. Mr Wood said the big profits from selling the pound were made by investment banks, some of which are not regulated by the Bank of England; fund management groups; and companies' treasury departments. 'On the Wednesday we at Barclays bought almost exactly Pounds 1bn from non-banks (investment banks and fund managers),' he said. 'That is two or three times the amount we would typically buy from these institutions.' Mr Wood admitted that the clearing banks made good profits from trading in sterling on the day, although Barclays' profit was significantly less than Pounds 100m. He said the bulk of profits derived from marketmaking by taking a dealing turn, rather than by taking a speculative position. In other words, it was the volume of trading in the market that benefited the banks most, rather than the direction of sterling's price. The British Bankers' Association said the banks had been stung into defending their behaviour in the foreign markets by politicians' allegations that they had made vast windfall profits. They were particularly concerned at the suggestion by Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, that there should be a special windfall tax on banks' dealing profits.</p>

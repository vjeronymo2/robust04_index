			<p>BFN     [Text] Guiyang, April 30 (CNS) -- China will develop its  coal resources in Guizhou Province in the not-far-distant future  in order to alleviate the pressures on coal transportation from  the north to the south and to supply energy to the southeast  coastal regions.    The development of coal resources in Guizhou would form a  rational distribution of energy in the country. It is estimated  that Guizhou's coal reserves rank third in the country and more  than the total coal resources in ten or more of the southern  provinces.    Guizhou's coal industry has been speeded up in recent years  with newly-built and renovated projects going into production  this year and next year and a batch of large-scale coal mines  with a yearly output of three to four million tonnes will be  built. Some power plants in coal mining areas will be built to  realize the conversion of coal into electric power.    Experts from the State Planning Commission and the Ministry  of Coal Industry have concluded, however, after a joint  investigation into Guizhou's coal resources that coal  development in Guizhou was impractical and failed to meet the  demand for quality anthracite and coking coal in the south.  Guizhou, in response, decided to jointly develop its coal  resources with relevant departments and other provinces short of  coal as well as with foreign investors to speed up the  development of the coal industry there.</p>

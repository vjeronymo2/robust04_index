			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The grazing fee system that would be implemented if this proposed rule is adopted would result in an increase in fees charged for grazing livestock on public rangelands. This proposed rule would establish the 1995 grazing fee at $2.75, and the 1996 grazing fee at $3.50. Thereafter, the fee would be calculated using the base value of $3.96, multiplied by the revised forage value index yielding a 1997 grazing fee of $3.96. In subsequent years, the calculated fee would depend on the changes in the market rate for private grazing land leases. After the 3-year phase-in, the grazing fee would change no more than 25 percent annually, plus or minus, from the amount charged the previous year. Preparation of a separate rule establishing an incentive-based grazing fee is underway. As currently contemplated, permittees could be entitled to a 30 percent reduction in their grazing fees using the $3.96 base value if they meet certain qualification criteria, the identification of which will be the focus of this separate rulemaking. Pending adoption of this separate rule, the base value shall remain at $3.50 for the purposes of calculating the fee. The proposed fee system would apply to all National Forest System lands in the Western States. Public comment is invited and will be considered in adoption of the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review.

Under the Guidelines, benefits, and privileges bestowed by the Government are expressly excluded from the definition of private property rights protected by the Fifth Amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Congress established that a grazing permit is a privilege through the Granger-Thye Act of April 24, 1950 (Section 19), and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of October 21, 1976 (Section 402(h)). Both of these acts state that the issuance of grazing permits in no way grants any right, title, interest, or estate in or to lands or resources held by the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A long line of court cases has established that a grazing permit is a noncompensable interest since it is a privilege to use federally owned land for livestock grazing purposes. Accordingly, it is a privilege_not a right-which can be withdrawn or canceled by the United States without compensation. Since this rule deals with granting a privilege, Executive Order 12630, which involves the taking of private property for public use, does not apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notwithstanding the above, the Office of General Counsel has prepared a Takings Implication Assessment (TIA) on grazing activities undertaken by the Forest Service. The TIA concluded that regulatory activities associated with Forest Service administration of grazing on National Forest System lands do not present the risk of a taking of private property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Information Collection Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule governing grazing and livestock use on National Forest System land does not contain any recordkeeping or reporting requirements or other information collection requirements as defined in 5 CFR part 1320. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Civil Justice Reform Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.

The fee is prorated on a daily basis and is multiplied by the number of head months of use and the number of days. For purposes of calculating grazing fees, a head month is a month's use and occupancy of rangeland by one adult cow, bull, steer, heifer, horse or mule, five sheep, or five goats. An animal is an adult if it is weaned, is at least 6 months old at the beginning of the permitted period of use, or will be 12 months old during the permitted period of use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) When sheep grazing is already authorized by a grazing permit, no additional charge shall be made for lambing upon National Forest System land or other lands under Forest Service management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The grazing fee established in &sect;&sect;222.51, 222.53, and 222.54 may be charged for all livestock grazing of National Forest System land authorized by a temporary grazing permit. However, the authorized officer may waive or otherwise adjust the fee when the Forest Service imposes limitations or requirements on grazing use for the purpose of implementing management objectives in the forest land resource management plan and the terms and conditions of the grazing permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) All fees charged for livestock grazing of National Forest System land are payable in advance of the opening date of the grazing period, or entry, unless otherwise authorized by the Chief of the Forest Service and provided for in the grazing permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Refunds or credits may be allowed under justifiable conditions and circumstances as the Chief of the Forest Service may specify. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) The fee year for charging grazing fees is March 1 through the following February. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

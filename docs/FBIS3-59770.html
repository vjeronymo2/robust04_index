			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] About forty years ago, an ingenious contraption  nicknamed ``the flying bedstead'' took to the air at a Rolls  Royce test facility in the United Kingdom. The name was an apt  description of an ungainly flying machine heralded as a  breakthrough in aviation. What made the craft unusual was that  it could take off and land vertically using downward-facing jet  nozzles at its four corners. Once aloft, the nozzles could  rotate to propel it forward.    The flying bedstead was the prototype for vertical takeoff  and landing (VTOL) jet aircraft. The appeal of VTOLs was that  they would not need runways; theoretically, they could take off  and land in city centers but fly like conventional jets once  airborne, carrying the same loads at the same speeds.       Over the next 20 years, about thirty different VTOL designs  were developed and tested. Some used jet engines, while others  used rotors that could swivel from a horizontal position for  lift to the vertical for flight. Nearly all the test flights  ended in disaster. Only one design found practical use--the  Harrier jump-jet fighter used by the Royal Air Force and the  U.S. Navy.    Not surprisingly, most VTOLs came to grief at takeoff or  landing, the moments of greatest risk for any aircraft. In a  normal jet aircraft, aerodynamic lift provided by the wings  gives a degree of stability as a plane takes off or cruises to  land. In a VTOL, this type of lift is nonexistent: only the  vertical thrust from the jets keeps the plane aloft and at the  correct attitude. The problems lie largely in finely controlling  the blasts from the downward-facing jets. Even slight gusts of  wind or variations in thrust from the engines could unbalance  the craft as it sat on ``pillars'' of air. When this happened,  the pilot had only seconds to restore the jet's equilibrium  before crashing.    Technological strides over the last two decades have changed  the outlook for VTOLs, which now might begin to fulfill their  original promise and meet modern safety standards for civil  aviation. VTOLs are being reexamined in several countries,  including several European nations and the United States. In  Japan, a revolutionary VTOL design from the National Aerospace  Laboratory (NAL) is now ready for implementation.    Progress in three key areas of technology has given VTOLs  their second chance, according to Dr. Masanori Endoh, who leads  the NAL team. ``Microelectronics now allow us to incorporate  very sophisticatedcontrols into the designs, something that  wasn't possible until recently,'' he explained. ``The  development of very lightweight composite materials also helps.  Since a VTOL takes off using engine thrust and not aerodynamic  wing lift, it is essential for the plane to be as light as  possible.'' The kinds of materials he is referring to include  both lightweight, carbon-reinforced plastics and new types of  ceramics.    The third advance is the development of new kinds of  engines.  ``VTOLs of the fifties were extremely noisy,'' says Dr. Endoh.  ``This alone would be a fatal defect today, because no one would  tolerate such noisy jets at civilian airports, let alone in city  centers.'' Dr. Endoh's team has designed a new engine that is  high-powered, lightweight, and creates no more noise than a  light helicopter. The new engine is the key innovation in NAL's  new VTOL design.    The aircraft would fly using a unique system of lift and  cruise fans powered by a trio of rear-mounted jet turbines.  High-pressure air from these three engines would be piped to  twin seven-foot cruise fans. At the center of each fan, a  combustor would ignite a mixture of high-pressure air and fuel.  The expanding gases would spin a turbine linked to the fan,  producing 24,000 pounds of thrust a side.    During vertical takeoff and landing, high-pressure air would  be channeled to three eight-foot, 200-blade, one-piece rotors  that are encased within each wing and shielded by movable  shutters. Collectively, the six rotors, with their own  combustors, would generate over 130,000 pounds of thrust.    Surprisingly, the lift fans are not noisy. ``Because of  their  size their rotation speed is very low, which reduces the  noise,'' says Endoh. ``The one-piece design also means that the  sound the fans produce is higher-pitched than in regular rotors,  where the blades are individually fitted. Our aircraft will be  quieter than a conventional helicopter!''    As the craft rises, the pilot gradually redirects the  high-pressure air from the lift to the cruise fans,  simultaneously closing the shutters in the wings. This increases  the wings' effective surface area, boosting the aerodynamic  lift. Should one or more of the lift fans cease working, the  plane should remain stable as long as at least one fan on each  side functions. Should all fail, the plane can still land on a  runway like a conventional airliner.    NAL's aircraft isn't on the tarmac just yet. Engine tests  are  due this year, but the pace of progress will depend on new  government funding. Computer simulations and wind-tunnel tests  using models indicate the plane will fulfill the designer's  expectations. In Dr. Endoh's most optimistic scenario, the first  test flights could be taking place around the end of the decade,  and commercial flights could start early in the next century. If  all goes well, the new VTOL could then be ferrying over a  hundred commuters a trip to and from city centers, taking off  and landing at ``vertports'' no bigger than 200 square meters.    Dr. Endoh calculates ticket prices on his VTOL would be  about  30 percent higher than on a conventional airliner. He doesn't  think this will prove a problem, since passengers will save the  time and expense of lengthy journeys to out-of-town airports.  ``In the past, people have been willing to pay more for easier  and swifter journeys. The extra cost of traveling by bullet  train compared with regular trains has not deterred travelers,  and I think the same will prove true for VTOLs,'' he explains.    For urban planners, the VTOL could also prove a boon. The  small size of vertports makes them easy and inexpensive to  build. Any city center tract of land, or even the space over  rail tracks, could be utilized.New vertports could go from the  planning stage to operational status within a year--very fast  when compared with the decades it takes to plan and build  costlier conventional airports. According to Dr. Endoh, VTOLs  should be ready to put the problems of civil aviation to bed,  about fifty years after that first flying bedstead took to the  air.</p>

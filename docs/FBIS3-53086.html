The appeal has been made by the Pakistani leaders being  encouraged by positive response to Pakistan's earlier request  for a temporary cease-fire and keeping in view the brotherly  ties existing between Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is also  based on a (?view) to restoring peace and stability in  Afghanistan. All Afghan parties have further been urged not to  resume hostilities until the Islamic Conference Organization and  friendly countries have had a full opportunity to effect  conciliation and to resolve their differences.    Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and Ms. Benazir Bhutto have  noted with alarm the situation in Afghanistan over the last 10  days and the resort to force by contending parties which have  resulted in the tragic loss of life and large-scale destruction  of property. In order to alleviate the sufferings of Afghan  brothers and sisters affected by the recent hostilities,  Pakistan has extended immediate humanitarian aid containing  medicines and fully equipped field hospitals. These will be  sent to Afghanistan as soon as the cease-fire is agreed.  Pakistan is already actively participating in relief facilities  for displaced Afghans who have left Kabul.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / UK Company News: Apax says price for Gabicci is too high APAX Partners, a venture capital company, has withdrawn from talks on making an offer for Gabicci, the casual clothing company which agreed last month to an all-share bid from Helene, the clothing distributor. The Helene bid is opposed by two dissident directors, Ms Ana Dodosh and Mr Gordon Lawrence, who have criticised the absence of a cash alternative. They deny any association with the Apax initiative. It is understood that Gabicci's former managing and finance director, Mr Michael Abrahams, was part of the management team leading the mooted management buy-in. The Helene bid is 2.043 shares for every Gabicci share, and carried a value of about 50p per Gabicci share against a closing price on Friday of 46p. 'Apax withdrew basically because it had a look and it just felt for this kind of price it's not worth it,' said the company, which had discussed a price of about 45p. Mr Norman Fetterman, managing director of Helene, said his company held about 31 per cent of Gabicci as of last Friday. He added: 'A number of institutional shareholders had been waiting to see what happened to Apax.' Mr Jack Sofier, chairman of Gabicci, said he believed shareholders would now accept the Helene bid by the closing date next Wednesday: 'There's nothing else on the table. They should all accept now.' Mr Lawrence, described Apax's departure as 'a major disappointment'. He believed Helene had not won as many acceptances as it had expected: 'We still maintain the offer is not a good one.'</p>

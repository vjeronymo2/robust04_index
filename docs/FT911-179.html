			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: W Scaffolding loss and rights issue Difficult trading, almost doubled interest charges and provisions for bad debts and reorganisation costs have pushed USM-quoted Westminster Scaffolding into a loss of Pounds 82,000 for the year ended October 31 1990, against a profit previously of Pounds 1.47m. With losses per share of 1p (earnings 9.4p) the final dividend is omitted, leaving the year's payment at 2p (3p). Because of the situation in the property market the directors have decided to sell certain properties for Pounds 5.87m, of which Pounds 2.83m in cash is payable immediately, and to strengthen the capital base by raising Pounds 3.54m net through a 3-for-2 rights issue at 25p each. Mr Tom Greenham, chairman, has undertaken to subscribe for 3.2m shares - 21 per cent of the issue. The shares closed 5p down at 33p.</p>

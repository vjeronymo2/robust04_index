			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN FOR YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL IS DELAYED  </P> <P> Bowing to pressure from angry parents, the Newhall School Board voted this week  to delay for at least two years the start of year-round schooling at one  elementary school in the fast-growing district.  </P> <P> The trustees originally voted May 8 to start year-round schooling at Meadows  Elementary School in Valencia in June, 1990. At the time, district officials  said other schools would be switched to a year-round schedule as necessary to  accommodate growing enrollment.  </P> <P> But this week the trustees voted 3 to 2 to delay the change at least until  July, 1992, to study other ways to cope with added enrollment.  </P> <P> About 100 parents attended this week's meeting. Several speakers said  year-round schedules would disrupt children's friendships and make family  vacations impossible.  </P> <P> Under year-round scheduling, traditional summer vacations are eliminated and  vacation periods occur throughout the year. Students often are divided into  three or four "tracks" that attend class on a rotating basis, with one group on  vacation while the others are in school.  </P></p>

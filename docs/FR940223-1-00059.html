			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The generic exclusion levels for the metals were based on the use of the EPA Composite Model for Landfills (EPACML), which predicts the potential for groundwater contamination from wastes that are placed in a landfill. The Agency limited the generic exclusion to residues disposed of in a Subtitle D unit because it could not properly evaluate concerns over potential releases to other media resulting from uses of the HTMR slag as product, especially as an anti-skid material on road surfaces. In the original rule proposing the generic exclusion for K061 HTMR slag (see 56 FR 15020, April 12, 1991), the Agency solicited comment to identify other significant routes of exposure for product uses of the slag. The rule specifically sought suggestions for methods to evaluate exposures from the use of the slag as anti-skid material. Although EPA received comments concerning possible risks from road uses, no useful data, methods, or models were submitted to assist the Agency in evaluating exposures from releases to media other than groundwater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the Agency noted in the final rule for the initial generic exclusion for K061 residues (see 56 FR 41164, August 19, 1991), the use of HTMR residues as anti-skid material was not prohibited, provided the residue meets the exemption conditions given in &sect;266.20. The Agency also noted in the same notice that it would further evaluate the uses of K061 HTMR residues that constitute disposal, and would consider amendments to &sect;266.20 for HTMR slags that might require further controls on such uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Summary of Petition and Settlement Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and the Hazardous Waste Treatment Council (HWTC), collectively ``NRDC Petitioners'', filed a petition for review challenging EPA's decision not to apply ``generic exclusion levels''_levels at which K061 slags are deemed nonhazardous_to K061 slags used as waste-derived ``products'' and applied to or placed on land.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The generic exclusion levels established for some metals in the K061 HTMR slags are lower than the BDAT standards that apply to K061. Therefore, while the generic exclusion requires that the nonhazardous K061 slag that meets exclusion levels be disposed of in a Subtitle D unit, K061 HTMR slag that may exhibit metal levels above the exclusion levels (but below BDAT) may be used as a product in a manner constituting disposal under the exemption in &sect;266.20(b). The petitioners pointed out the anomaly of the slag used in an uncontrolled manner being effectively subject to lesser standards than slag disposed in a controlled landfill.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 13, 1993, EPA entered into a settlement agreement with NRDC Petitioners which would address their concerns through two separate notice-and-comment rulemakings. EPA agreed to propose the first rule within 6 months of the settlement date (and issue a final rule within 12 months) to either establish generic exclusion levels for ``non-encapsulated'' uses of K061 slags, or effectively prohibit such uses of K061 slags on the land. EPA also agreed to propose a second rule within 16 months of the settlement date (and issue a final rule within 28 months), to establish generic exclusion levels for encapsulated uses of K061 slags on the land. The agreement specified that the generic exclusion levels for K061 slags will be based on an evaluation of the potential risks to human health and the environment from the use of K061 slags as waste-derived products, taking into account all relevant pathways of exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule proposes to prohibit non-encapsulated uses of products derived from hazardous HTMR slags (K061, K062, and F006), if these products are used in a manner constituting disposal. The term ``non-encapsulated'' use is being defined in this rule as a use in which: the material is not contained, controlled, covered, or capped in a manner that eliminates or significantly reduces its mobility and potential for release into the environment. The uses of HTMR residues on roads as anti-skid or deicing materials are considered to be non-encapsulated product uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Agency is proposing to amend the existing regulations under &sect;266.20 that conditionally exempt hazardous waste-derived products used in a manner constituting disposal from RCRA Subtitle C regulations to reflect this change. The language of &sect;266.20 would be revised to prohibit non-encapsulated uses of products derived from hazardous HTMR slags, unless they comply with all of the applicable Subtitle C standards ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , permitting, minimum technology standards for land disposal units, financial responsibility, etc.). Since these requirements cannot realistically be met by entities that would use the HTMR slag in a non-encapsulated fashion ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , entities are unlikely to seek land disposal permits for the placement of deicing materials on roads), the Agency is effectively proposing to prohibit non-encapsulated uses of the slags.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

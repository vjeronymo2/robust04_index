			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKS: DIFFERENT STROKES;  </P> <P> NEW INGREDIENTS AND BRUSHES PROMISE MASCARA-WEARERS NO-SMEAR LASHES  </P> <P> EARLY LAST year, Maybelline phased out its cake mascara, a product that had  been around since the 1920s. Although the product was discontinued because of  declining sales, within a month of its disappearance from drugstores and  supermarkets, the onslaught began. Fans of the $3.65 mascara flooded the firm's  Memphis headquarters with thousands of letters. By September, the lash makeup  in the little red case was back on display.  </P> <P> Mascara-wearers are both loyal and vociferous. Most would rather fight than  switch, and for good reason. Finding a product that lengthens, darkens and/or  thickens lashes all day without flaking, smudging or breaking can be a tedious  process. Often, a woman doesn't discover that a new mascara has failed her  until she looks in the mirror and sees black circles under her eyes, or until  someone helpful flicks little black specks from her cheeks. So when she finds  one that works, she typically stays with it.  </P> <P> This season, women are about to hear that recent innovations have made mascaras  better than ever. Exotic-sounding ingredients such as cashmere, silk and  primrose oil, as well as new brush designs that coat lashes more evenly, have  been introduced to prevent the Tammy Faye Bakker look -- and to woo consumers  away from the leaders in the field: Maybelline, which sells 35 million tubes  year in drugstores and supermarkets, and Lancome, the top-selling department  store brand.  </P> <P> In 1988, Max Factor launched No-Color mascara, a $5 clear glaze for the lashes.  The promise of "no more racoon" eyes was enough to get women to try the  product. So many bought it, in fact, that Max Factor's mascara sales jumped 45%  that year, compared with an overall market that grew only 5%, according to  market reports.  </P> <P> Next month, there'll be another $5 mascara on the shelves: Stretch, a  fiber-free lash lengthener. Max Factor's research shows that more than seven of  10 women want a product that adds length.  </P> <P> Despite the newcomers, mascara-wearers still prefer Maybelline's Great Lash and  Cover Girl's Professional, which together represent 14% of the mascaras  purchased in the country. Many women, it seems, are like Andrea Dovichi,  manager of a specialty store in Hermosa Beach, who buys Cover Girl at the  grocery store. "I used to wear Clinique," she notes, "but for $4, I can buy  mascara and some bananas."  </P> <P> But about one-third of mascara-wearers buy their mascara in department stores,  often spending triple the price of drugstore brands. A Whittier housewife and  mother of two small boys, Barbara Podevin has used Lancome Immencils Gentle  Lash Thickener for 10 years and is more than willing to pay about $13 a tube.  "I don't have the time or money for experimentation," she says.  </P> <P> Women who have time to investigate at department store counters will find some  new mascaras. Guerlain's StarCil is supposed to moisturize lashes as it  lengthens and thickens. At $21, it's one of the most expensive of the new  products. Earlier this month, Christian Dior introduced its Mascara Parfait  With Cashmere, which is also intended to prevent lash breakage. The product's  $12.50 price tag makes it one of Lancome's strongest new competitors.  </P> <P> Still, no mascara, regardless of price, will be effective unless it is applied  carefully. Makeup artist Joan Mazzei of Images for Hair in Corona del Mar  suggests three coats, each allowed to dry completely. "After you apply the  first," she explains, "hold the brush vertically and move it across the tips of  the lashes. Then add a third coat traditionally."  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNESSEE'S VICTORY IS SUGARCOATED;  </P> <P> SEC: VOLUNTEERS BEAT VANDERBILT, 49-20, FOR THEIR SECOND CONSECUTIVE CONFERENCE  TITLE.  </P> <P> Tennessee won the Southeastern Conference championship and a trip to the Sugar  Bowl with a 49-20 victory over Vanderbilt Saturday.  </P> <P> The 12th-ranked Volunteers, 8-2-2 overall and 5-1-1 in the SEC, overcame a  17-14 halftime deficit and earned a New Year's Day date with Virginia in New  Orleans. Florida has a 6-1 SEC record but is not eligible for the conference  title or Sugar Bowl because of NCAA sanctions.  </P> <P> Tennessee's victory wasn't easy. Vanderbilt (1-10, 1-6) trailed only 21-20 late  in the third quarter.  </P> <P> "It was tougher than I imagined," Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors said. "The  wishbone presents many difficulties. It runs the clock and shortens the game."  </P> <P> When Tennessee had the ball, it was a matter of giving Tony Thompson running  room.  </P> <P> Thompson carried 31 times for 236 yards, scoring on runs of nine, 12, 11 and 13  yards in winning the SEC rushing title, finishing with 1,261 yards in 219  carries.  </P> <P> "It couldn't be more appropriate for this team to have Tony Thompson as its  captain. He's a champion, a winner," said Majors, who guided the Volunteers to  back-to-back SEC championships for the first time since the 1938-40 Tennessee  team won three in a row.  </P> <P> Vanderbilt's loss may have been the last appearance on the sideline for Coach  Watson Brown, who has lost 25 of his last 27 games and is 4-29 against SEC  opposition in his five years.  </P> <P> "You're asking the wrong people about that," Brown said when asked about his  job security.  </P> <P> Paul Hoolahan, Vanderbilt athletic director, said he had discussed the  situation with Brown Friday and that a decision on next season will be reached  "in the near future."  </P> <P> The Nashville Banner and several local television stations have reported that  Brown will be fired next week.  </P> <P> Brown said his team did its best Saturday and for most of the season but came  up against a Tennessee team that appears to be peaking.  </P> <P> "That's the best they've played since I've played them," Brown said. "We've  only played half a game (against Tennessee) each year. We'll have to see if  Tennessee will play half a game one year, and knock them off."  </P> <P> The Volunteers didn't take the lead until Thompson scored on a 12-yard run with  11:24 left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Vanderbilt then drove to the Volunteer 19 before settling for a 36-yard field  goal by Jeff Owen that cut the deficit to 21-20 with 5:19 left in the quarter.  </P> <P> Thompson then carried on seven of eight plays during a 52-yard scoring drive  that gave Tennessee a 28-20 lead. He skirted left end for 11 yards, avoiding  six potential tacklers along the way, for his third touchdown of the game.  </P> <P> On Vanderbilt's next possession, Corey Harris fumbled and Tennessee's Darryl  Hardy recovered. Five plays later, Andy Kelly passed 20 yards to Carl Pickens  in the end zone for a 35-20 lead.  </P></p>

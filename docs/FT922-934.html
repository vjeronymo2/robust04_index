			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Arthur Lee rises to Pounds 604,000 Shares of Arthur Lee &amp; Sons, the steel and plastics maker, rose 6p to 98p yesterday following the announcement of a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 323,000 to Pounds 604,000 for the half year ended March 31. Directors said the improvement in part reflected action to reduce costs, particularly of raw materials and staffing levels where numbers fell to 1,268 against 1,427 a year earlier. Turnover of the continuing operations slipped from Pounds 53.7m to Pounds 51.3m. Earnings amounted to 1.28p (1.05p) and the interim dividend is a same-again 1.65p. The directors pointed out that although the volume of deliveries in some of the group's steel-based operations was currently showing some modest uplift compared with the levels attained in the depth of the recession and, in plastics, demand for medical moulding was encouraging, competition remained intense.</p>

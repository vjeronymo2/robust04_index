			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TITANS JUGGLE THEIR BATTING ORDER, RALLY FOR 7-5 VICTORY OVER ARIZONA  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton Coach Larry Cochell made a couple of changes in his lineup  Saturday and it paid off in a 7-5 nonconference victory over Arizona in front  of about 700 at Titan Field.  </P> <P> Cochell moved Mate Borgogno from the No. 8 spot to leadoff in place of Bobby  Jones, who moved into Borgogno's former spot.  </P> <P> Borgogno responded with three hits, scored two runs and had a key RBI. He  raised his team-leading batting average to .448.  </P> <P> Jones also fared well in his new spot, getting two hits and scoring a run.  Jones also made an outstanding catch in center field to save two runs.  </P> <P> Arizona got three runs in the fifth to take a 5-3 lead, but Fullerton rallied  with one in the sixth, two in the seventh and one in the eighth.  </P> <P> In the seventh, Fullerton's Trevor Neighbors and Rex Peters singled with one  out. Arizona starter Jason Hisey was replaced by left-hander Jim Richardson,  who was brought in to face left-handed hitting catcher Brent Mayne.  </P> <P> Mayne spoiled the move with a single to right field to score Neighbors.  </P> <P> Peters scored the go-ahead run when right fielder Don Parker had trouble  picking up the ball. Parker, who was charged with an error, didn't see Peters  rounding third and threw the ball to second base. Peters had singled in the  first to extend his hitting streak to eight games.  </P> <P> Fullerton added a run in the eighth when Jones doubled to the fence in right,  went to third on a throwing error by Parker and scored on a double by Borgogno.  </P> <P> Sam Colarusso, a junior right-hander from Orange Coast College, worked the  final 3 2/3 innings to get the victory. Colarusso (1-0) allowed one hit and no  runs. He has worked seven innings this season and has not allowed a run for  Fullerton (5-3).  </P> <P> Hisey (5-1) took the loss for Arizona (13-3).  </P> <P> Fullerton got two runs in the first on an RBI single by Mayne and an RBI  groundout by Dave Staton.  </P> <P> Arizona countered with two runs in the second and it looked as if the Wildcats  would score again in the third.  </P> <P> The Wildcats had runners on first and second with two outs when J.T. Snow, a  sophomore from Los Alamitos High School, lined the ball deep to center. But  Jones made an over-the-shoulder catch as he slammed into the wall.  </P> <P> Fullerton took a 3-2 lead with a run in the third. Borgogno tripled to left and  Neighbors followed with a sacrifice fly to center field.  </P> <P> In other nonconference games:  </P> <P> San Diego State 4, Irvine 3 -- San Diego State scored two runs in the ninth  inning at San Diego. With two outs, Brian Cunn singled to right-center, driving  in both runs for San Diego State (8-2), ranked 25th in the nation. John Skaggs  and Stacy Parker each had two hits to lead Irvine (2-7-1).  </P> <P> Southern California College 24, Grand Canyon 15 -- Denny Berni's grand slam  sparked an 11-run third inning for the Vanguards (4-3) in Phoenix. Alex Andrade  added a two-run home run in the third.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SELF-INTEREST AND OIL CRISIS IN PERSIAN GULF  </P> <P> As a 55-year-old African-American who served four years in the U.S. Navy, I  find the commentary "Colorblind at the Front Lines," by Charles E. McGee,  astonishing (Platform, Aug. 14).  </P> <P> Where is he coming from when he asks an African-American to be colorblind.  </P> <P> America has never had to worry about African-Americans giving 100% effort in  any war, and it doesn't now.  </P> <P> I hope he is concerned enough and is doing something about the continued racism  in this country.  </P> <P> Also, if he thinks Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  has gotten where he is without the decision makers considering his color, he's  a bigger fool than Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> So, don't worry, Mr. McGee; your black brothers and sisters will follow orders  as if God were the one who ordered them; and you can go back to your  second-class living.  </P> <P> LIONEL BAIN  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

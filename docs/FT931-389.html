			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Aspen improves to Pounds 1.83m ASPEN Communications yesterday reported a 7.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.83m for 1992, on turn-over up 8.3 per cent at Pounds 60.3m. The profit was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 510,000 (Pounds 440,000) for bad debts and redundancies. The marketing services division had another difficult year with a severe downturn in Paris, but added new contracts such as Saab's direct marketing worldwide. The group started building higher margins activities, such as direct mail products and a magazine joint-venture with the Post Office aimed at older people, said Mr Henry Meakin, chairman. Supplying electronic inflight entertainment to British Airways is a sizeable development for the future, he added. Gearing was down to 29.6 per cent at the year end, against 35.7 per cent in 1991. The proposed final dividend is up by 32 per cent at 2.9p, for a maintained total of 4.9p payable from earnings per share of 8.6p (8p).</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Investors continue to move money into D-Mark bloc ACTIVITY in the European government bond markets was again dominated by tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism, with investors continuing to shift money into the D-Mark bloc. The strong demand for D-Mark assets pushed up German government bond prices yesterday, despite disappointing money supply figures for October which served to dash hopes of an imminent easing in German interest rates. German M3 money supply grew at a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of 10.2 per cent in October - well up on the Bundesbank's target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent for 1992, and higher than September's figure of 9.3 per cent and 8.8 per cent for August. While the market was disappointed with the money supply data, dealers pointed out that the figures were distorted as a result of heavy intervention in the foreign exchange markets during September's European currency crisis. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 91.47, traded in a range of 91.37 to 91.65 and ended towards the high of the day. Dealers said interest in the D-Mark bloc remained healthy as investors switched out of Danish and (to a lesser extent) French government bonds. Germany's three coalition parties agreed a package of over DM12bn in extra public spending in eastern Germany yesterday. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said that the spending would be financed by cuts elsewhere in the budget. While the decision may help to prolong the life of the Treuhand privatisation agency, it is unlikely to mean heavier-than-forecast bond issuance, dealers said. The yield spread of Treuhand's bond issue over 10-year Federal bonds was unchanged. Dutch government bonds benefited from the switch to the D-Mark bloc, ending the day higher. The 8.25 per cent bond due June 2002 was quoted yielding 7.40 per cent, against Monday's close of 7.46 per cent, while the 10-year Dutch-German yield spread slipped from 13 basis points to 3 basis points. FRENCH government bonds ended the day firmer or little changed, despite another difficult day for the French franc in the foreign exchange markets. Dealers said there was some domestic buying of French government bonds at the lower price levels, which helped to support the market. The 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 ended with a yield of 8.26 per cent against its opening of 8.27 per cent. In the futures market, the Matif contract rose from 109.70 to 110.04. ACTIVITY in the UK government bond market was dominated by the Bank of England's gilt auction announcement. The Bank plans to sell Pounds 2.5bn of a new 8 per cent gilt due 2003 on December 2 and the issue is expected to take over as the new 10-year benchmark bond. Gilt prices closed higher across the yield curve with dealers reporting some limited foreign interest. JAPANESE government bonds ended firmer in quiet trade, helped by slightly lower money market rates. The yield on the benchmark No 145 opened at 4.645 per cent and moved to 4.615 per cent before closing at 4.625 per cent. The key unsecured overnight call rate was traded at 3 7/8 per cent, down from 3 29/32 per cent on Friday. The Ministry of Finance is expected to auction about Y800bn of 10-year bonds today. Dealers expect a coupon of 4.8 per cent, down from 5 per cent at the previous auction. US Treasury prices firmed slightly yesterday after a successful five-year auction helped the market rebound from early weakness related to two stronger-than-expected economic reports. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  5/32 at 101 1/8 , yielding 7.524 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  1/8 at 99 31/32 , to carry a yield of 4.625 per cent. Prices eased slightly in early trading after the Commerce Department reported that durable goods orders jumped 3.9 per cent in October, a much larger increase than analysts had expected. The goods orders figures, however, are a notoriously unreliable indicator of economic conditions and the market held its ground despite the data. Treasuries also held up well on news that the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence rose from 54.6 in October to 65.5 in November. Dealers who had expected prices to drop after the confidence report were quickly forced to buy securities to cover their short positions. The market firmed further after the new five-year notes met good demand from investors in the afternoon Treasury auction.</p>

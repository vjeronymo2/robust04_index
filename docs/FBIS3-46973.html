			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's shipbuilders  defeated their Japanese rivals to make Korea the country with  the largest volume of ship orders last year, but face a  formidable challenge in holding on to the top spot this year.  Industry insiders say that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has  received orders for five 300,000-ton very large crude carriers  (VLCC) from Saudi Arabia's state-run oil company.    Many shipbuilders around the world had competed for the  Saudi  Arabian VLCC fleet contract since it was announced in late 1991.  In 1991, when the world shipbuilding market was booming, a VLCC  was priced at 115 million U.S. dollars, but Mitsubishi cut its  price to below 90 million dollars. The orders for five VLCCs,  totaling 1.5 million tons, alone represent one-fourth of the 6.5  million tons of orders placed with Japanese shipbuilders in all  of last year.    Kawasaki Heavy Industries and other Japanese yards have  received enough orders in the last month or two to keep them  busy all year thanks to their stepped-up promotional programs  and the yen's decline against the dollar.    The sources say Korean shipbuilders, who enjoyed a sharp  price edge over their Japanese rivals on the rising yen last  year, must now cut their prices to compete with the  technologically-advanced Japanese yards as the yen is now  falling.    Encouraged by their boom last year, Hyundai Heavy Industries  and Samsung Heavy Industries are planning to expand their  dockyards for building VLCCs, and this is feared to put domestic  shipbuilders in cut-throat competition for the world VLCC market  of about 20 vessels a year.</p>

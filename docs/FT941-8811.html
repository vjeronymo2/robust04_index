			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Government lawyers doctored documents, Scott told Government lawyers doctored official papers in an attempt to stop the Matrix-Churchill trial judge seeing confidential Whitehall documents crucial to the acquittal of three businessmen charged with breaching rules over exports to Iraq, the Scott inquiry was told yesterday. Mr Andrew Leithead, an assistant Treasury solicitor, admitted that government lawyers, as well as ministers, were involved in attempts to suppress highly sensitive information about sales of arms-making equipment to Iraq. His evidence is the first to show the extent of government lawyers' involvement in the alleged cover-up of the relaxation of the guidelines for exporting such equipment. Mr Leithead made the admission under questioning over the government's controversial use of public interest immunity (PII) certificates to suppress official information. Challenged over the general policy for seeking PII certificates in criminal trials, Mr Leithead said the government took a 'generous view' of what should be suppressed. The government's view was that high and middle order information should not be disclosed as a matter of policy. 'It is damaging to the public interest to have any part of the decision-making process made public,' he said. The documents in question recorded ministers' decision to relax the guidelines. Before the trial in October 1992, the judge rejected calls from government lawyers for PII certificates to be granted to prevent the disclosure of the documents in the trial. Mr Leithead agreed with Lord Justice Scott that at a meeting between himself and Customs prosecutors it was agreed to alter documentation relating to the certificates. This was a tactic to prevent the judge asking to see the documents in the first place - before deciding whether they should be suppressed. Asked if this was legitimate, Mr Leithead said he had not been happy, but the decision had been taken by Mr Alan Moses QC, the barrister prosecuting for Customs. Mr Leithead said ministers had no discretion whether or not to sign PII certificates. It was not their function to decide whether disclosure of documents would damage the public interest. The accepted practice was to leave this to trial judges. Mr Leithead was also challenged why he and other officials had rewritten a witness statement by Mr Anthony Steadman, a former DTI export licensing head. 'It would be wrong to put words into his mouth if they were not correct, but where you have a civil servant giving evidence on behalf of a department, many hands contribute,' he said.</p>

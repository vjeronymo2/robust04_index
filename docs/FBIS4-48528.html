			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Isaacson] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg May 19 SAPA -- PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo Sexwale has promised  150,000 low cost houses as part of an upliftment programme for  the province.    Delivering his opening address to the PWV Legislative  Assembly at Nasrec [National Exhibition Center], near Soweto on  Thursday, he also outlined various campaigns to combat crime and  provide education and health.    "The projected target for the provision of housing in the  province over the next 12 months is 150,000 units." The premier  said the units would be provided with all essential services  including electricity, running water and telephones. But he  warned the provincial government would not allow the scheme,  which would be aided by private enterprises, "to create serviced  informal settlements in the name of housing".    Turning to hostels, Mr Sexwale said: "We have the  responsibility of reintegrating hostel dwellers into the broader  community. Hostel accommodation can be upgraded into family  units and alternative housing provided. Hostel dwellers who  wish to remain in hostels should be assisted to upgrade their  facilities."    Mr Sexwale also promised that township residents who fled  their homes because of violence would be assisted in returning  to their houses which would be restored.    The premier also promised to create sustainable employment  for the almost 50 per cent of people "without formal or adequate  employment". Creating an enabling economic environment would  depend on stability, which in turn would be created by urgent  reconstruction and development projects. "We need a vigorous  cycle of progress in the PWV."    Mr Sexwale said education and health policies would be  shaped  for the province after central government had formulated its  policies. But he promised free, compulsory and basic education  to all school- going children, and an urgent immunisation  programme.    Reiterating his strong stance against crime, he said there  would be gun control and a disarmament campaign. "A crime-free  PWV has the potential to serve as the economic gateway not only  to the rest of South Africa, but also to the sub-continent.  Within the first 100 days we will establish a comprehensive and  regularly updated economic data base to facilitate the marketing  of our province and country."    Mr Sexwale said the provincial government would maintain  fiscal discipline and "use our resources wisely and  efficiently". "We as government will stretch every rand before  we can spend yet another rand."    Throughout his speech, Mr Sexwale stressed partnerships in  all policy formulation. "At a political level the government of  national unity, characterised by the ongoing process of  reconciliation in the PWV, has provided a tangible example of  partnership in action that should pervade all aspects of our  society."    Earlier, the Provincial Assembly adopted an interim set of  procedural rules. The PWV legislature will sit again on Monday.</p>

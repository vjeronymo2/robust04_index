			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Academics in line with industry Work between academics and industry in the UK has produced developments in medical science, air traffic control and architecture, according to a joint study, writes Sheila Jones. In one project, X-rays and other medical images are combined to give computerised 3-dimensional pictures. These should enable early detection of blood clots in heart surgery and greater precision in brain surgery to avoid nerve or vessel damage. Computing tools are being developed to reduce bugs in software used in conditions where safety is critical, such as air traffic control. The study also points to work on enhanced virtual reality for use in architecture and engineering.

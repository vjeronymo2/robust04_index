			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / German Bonds: Statistics underline investor pessimism IT IS almost as though the rally had never taken place. Yields on 10-year bunds were back at over 8.1 per cent on Friday, up sharply since prices reached their high point for the year in February. The optimism which followed the Bundesbank's rate rise in late December has evaporated and investors are talking gloomily about yields being back up to 8.2 per cent again before long. Talk of 7.5 per cent by the middle of the year is dismissed out of hand. A series of recent statistics has underscored the pessimism. A fortnight ago it emerged that M3, the broad measure of money supply, climbed by a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5 per cent in February, compared with a target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent growth for the full year. Last Thursday, year-on-year inflation for March came out at 4.7 per cent - and is expected to come in at the same level this month. On Friday it was announced that industrial production in February climbed by 1.2 per cent on January - worse than expected in that the market was expecting evidence of a slowdown. Although there have been few tangible developments in the wage round in the past month or so, what settlements there have been have tended to exacerbate the gloom. What investors really care about is a cut in interest rates. When they bought bunds in late December, they had persuaded themselves the rate rise would induce sense into the wage round, slow the economy and curb inflation  -all in time for a rate cut by late spring. As recent indicators show, there is no evidence of a severe slow down in the economy. Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist and head of research at Deutsche Bank, argued at the bank's seminar for international investors in Berlin two weeks ago that it looks unlikely the inverse yield curve will presage a recession, as is traditionally the case. Current stagnation is likely to give way to recovery later this year, as borne out by a poll of 400 big German companies conducted by the Munich-based IFO economics research institute published last week. The companies are expecting a pick-up in orders, sales and investments next year. This optimism appears in stark contrast to this year's daily announcements of staff lay-offs and falling profits - but it is perhaps the medium-term view which will determine management's willingness to face down high wage demands. Another negative factor is the 1 percentage point increase in the VAT rate to be introduced at the beginning of next year. This may push up the headline inflation rate once again, which will in turn influence next year's wage round. Against this background, it seems improbable that the Bundesbank will hurry to cut interest rates when it is clear inflation has peaked for the current year. Mr Walter predicts a cut in money market rates in June. Others are not so sanguine and it looks as though the bund market will be in the doldrums for some months to come.</p>

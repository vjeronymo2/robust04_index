			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET STRIKERS WARNED AGAINST RAIL SHUTDOWN;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV SAYS WIDER ACTION IS 'THE WRONG WAY,' HINTS OF NEW MEASURES TO  CONTROL UNREST  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warned Wednesday that a threatened  spillover of coal strikes to the railroads could have "very far-reaching  economic, social and political consequences" and could force the Kremlin to  consider new ways "to prevent the situation from getting out of hand."  </P> <P> Gorbachev's unscheduled remarks before the Soviet Parliament constituted the  most ominous official reaction since labor unrest erupted 10 days ago in the  Kuznets Basin of Siberia. They were interpreted here as a signal of growing  government alarm over what at first were depicted as justifiable protests.  </P> <P> Referring twice to previously unreported calls for railway workers to join the  coal strike Aug. 1, Gorbachev said: "We must declare this with full  responsibility before the entire people, we must tell them, 'This is not the  road! This is the wrong way!' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Railways Are Vital  </P> <P> Given the Soviet Union's vast distances and underdeveloped highway system,  railroads are an extraordinarily vital economic link. They carry about 80% of  the country's freight and the greater part of its inter-city travelers. A  widespread rail strike could quickly cripple the country.  </P> <P> "It seems to me that we must keep a cool head but not rest complacent or  inactive" in the face of the rail threat, Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, government efforts to appease the striking coal miners apparently  were having mixed results.  </P> <P> Soviet television reported Wednesday night that about 24,000 Siberian miners  had gone back to work after being urged by strike committee leaders to accept  pledges of higher pay, improved food supplies and more financial autonomy at  their mines. However, it said, 150,000 others remained on strike.  </P> <P> Nikolai A. Artinov, a dispatcher at a Kemerovo coal combine that earlier in the  day was idle, said in a telephone interview that four mines resumed operations  with the midnight shift and that workers at nine others were scheduled to be  back on the job by 9 a.m. today.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a related strike in the Donets Basin of the Ukraine apparently was  growing. This strike, which began over the weekend at eight mines, had by  Wednesday closed 70 of the region's 120 mines, according to the main evening  television news.  </P> <P> A special high-level government commission has been negotiating with the  Siberian miners, and Gorbachev disclosed Wednesday that he had sent a telegram  the night before promising the Donets miners equal treatment. However, the  Soviet leader acknowledged that "I understand from the information I got this  morning that there are still differences."  </P> <P> The somber tone of Gorbachev's remarks contrasted sharply with the authorities'  initial reaction to the Siberian strikes. Nikolai N. Slyunkov, a member of the  Communist Party's ruling Politburo, who was sent to the Kuznets Basin to deal  with the situation, quickly capitulated to several of the strikers' demands and  even praised the miners for their "high civic consciousness."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pressure From Below  </P> <P> The strikers were seen as having responded to Gorbachev's call for pressure  from below to implement his program of reforms known as perestroika. The  miners' call for greater local autonomy appeared to mesh with Gorbachev's  efforts to decentralize the system -- efforts that he says are being frustrated  by a stubborn layer of party and government bureaucrats.  </P> <P> At first the reformers may have quietly welcomed the strikes, but a Western  analyst said Wednesday that "I think in the last 36 hours, they have become  somewhat more alarmed as this has spread" from Siberia to the European part of  the country.  </P> <P> Widespread media coverage of the miners' demands and of official concessions  could encourage a spread of strike fever.  </P> <P> "Clearly, workers all over have the same grievances as these guys -- shortages  of food, poor housing, a rising cost of living, unresponsive local officials,"  the Western analyst said. "Those grievances are almost universal here."  </P> <P> Some of the miners' complaints can be dealt with quickly, but there appears to  be no easy solution for the others. Gorbachev said it will take at least a  month to study all their grievances.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Polluted Cities  </P> <P> For example, the Moscow News reported that Kemerovo and Novokuznetsk are among  the 10 most polluted cities in the world. Life expectancy in the Siberian coal  region, it said, is 10 years below the national average.  </P> <P> The mining town of Yenakiyevo in the Ukraine has running water only two hours a  day, Soviet television said. Such problems are not likely to be solved soon.  </P> <P> The workers, meanwhile, have been far less compliant than in some past labor  actions. Local officials in Prokopyevsk, one of the centers of the Kuznets  Basin unrest, quickly arranged for supplies of instant coffee, candy and  fashionable clothing to go on sale on the second day of the strike. But  according to the Moscow News, the local strike committee immediately stopped  the sales, saying, "We don't want handouts."  </P> <P> Officials here are also concerned about the coal strikes being used for purely  political ends.  </P> <P> "There are already people in Kemerovo who are urging miners to put an end to  communism and socialism," Gorbachev told members of Parliament. "Emissaries  appeared who want to see if it's possible to merge their extremist,  anti-socialist slogans with those raised by the workers, and to cash in on the  workers' dissatisfaction."  </P> <P> Gorbachev said that while workers' concerns should be heard, "even in the  sharpest form, one should realize that the pressing problems can be solved only  along the road of perestroika."  </P> <P> Gorbachev, while focusing more on the danger of the strikes getting out of  control, also repeated his criticism of local party and government officials  who are undermining his reforms in the mining regions and elsewhere.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, he had singled out the official trade union organization for  criticism, and there was some speculation here that it may be headed for a  shake-up.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev in the past has used these crises to his own advantage and to  advance the long-term reform goals that he has promoted," the Western analyst  said. "He may be getting ready to point the finger at the trade union movement,  which has been lukewarm about perestroika from the beginning."  </P> <P> The trade unions are headed by Stepan A. Shalaev, 60, one of the few remaining  holdovers from the era of the late and now-discredited Soviet leader Leonid I.  Brezhnev.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RARE LABOR UNREST  </P> <P> The labor strike is not a new phenomenon in the Soviet Union, but for a long  time it has been a rarity.  </P> <P> Trade unions were organized after the revolution of 1905, and strikes were  commonplace for much of the next two decades. The Bolsheviks, who established  the Soviet Union after the revolution of 1917, virtually outlawed strikes.  </P> <P> Under the Soviet system, trade unions were transformed into an instrument of  the Communist Party. Their role has been to enforce worker discipline,  administer welfare plans and work for the achievement of the government's  economic goals.  </P> <P> There have been unpublicized strikes off and on during the postwar period. One  of the most serious was in 1962 at Novocherkassk in southern Russia, when  troops shot scores of workers to death while putting down protests against food  price increases. In 1988, there were widespread strikes in the autonomous  region of Nagorno-Karabakh, spurred by ethnic conflict between Armenians and  Azerbaijanis.  </P> <P> The strikes now sweeping Soviet coal mines are regarded as particularly  significant because they were triggered for the most part by social welfare  issues.  </P></p>

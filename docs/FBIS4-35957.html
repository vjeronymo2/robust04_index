			<p>BFN     [Text] Well-informed political and military sources have  spoken about the political and military dilemma in which the  ruling regime in Sanaa has found itself because it insists on  continuing the war against the Democratic Republic of Yemen by  seeking more military supplies. These sources linked the recent  visits of Yahya Husayn al-Arashi, member of the Permanent  Committee of the General People's Congress, and Muhammad  'Abdallah (al-Yadumi), the third man in the Yemeni Alliance for  Reform [al-Tajammu al-Yamani Li-al-Islah] to Khartoum and the  visit paid to Sanaa today by the Sudanese minister of  information, 'Abd-al-Basit Sabdarat, as the envoy of Sudanese  President Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir. The sources  said the visit was linked to the question of military supplies  sent from Sudan to the Sanaa regime.</p>

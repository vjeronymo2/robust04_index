			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ATTORNEYS CALL FOR FAIR PLAY, INTEGRITY  </P> <P> We are all practicing attorneys as well as Santa Monica community leaders. We  are outraged and disgusted by the tactics of the supporters of the Elected City  Attorney Initiative to discredit the present city attorney and to intentionally  mislead Santa Monica's voters. We have often disagreed with our city attorney's  positions. However, as attorneys we respect honest disagreement, provided that  the rules of fair play are observed and the integrity of our political system  and rights of free speech are upheld.  </P> <P> Supporters of the elected City Attorney Initiative have trampled on fair play  and integrity. They placed a misleading and unfair "ad" in the local newspaper  for the Santa Monica attorney's position. Yet they know full well that our  voters have not yet spoken on the initiative and that the position will not be  vacant if the initiative is defeated.  </P> <P> They have also unfairly maligned our city attorney by mischaracterizing his  exercise of his personal rights of free speech as criminal. As another campaign  maneuver, they have filed a complaint with the State Bar Assn. on these same  grounds. These tactics show a gross contempt for fair political process and our  democratic right of free speech. They amount to an attempt at political  censorship.  </P> <P> There are significant reasons to oppose the Elected City Attorney Initiative,  including the need to keep our chief legal adviser independent of politics and  special interests. Whether or not an appointed or elected city attorney is  better government is an issue on which intelligent people can reasonably  disagree. However, there is no room for reasonable disagreement on unfair  political tactics. The dialogue here should be on the substantive issues. Santa  Monica voters should reject a below-the-belt campaign.  </P> <P> KATHLEEN SCHWALLIE  </P> <P> BARBARA BROWN  </P> <P> BEA NEMLAHA  </P> <P> MICHAEL BROURMAN  </P> <P> ERIC CHEN  </P> <P> STEVE ROTHSCHILD  </P> <P> PETER SPELMAN  </P> <P> Schwallie is a candidate for Santa Monica City Council in the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> </P></p>

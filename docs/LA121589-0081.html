			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHIOPIAN REFUGEES IN SOMALIA MAY GO HOME  </P> <P> The voluntary repatriation of tens of thousands of Ethiopians who sought refuge  in Somalia 12 years ago during a war between Ethiopia and Somalia should begin  in March, officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> The refugees are predominantly ethnic Somali Ethiopians who fled the fighting  during the two nations' war in 1977-78 over a piece of arid land in  southeastern Ethiopia called the Ogaden.  </P> <P> The number of refugees has never been certain. Somalia says there are 700,000,  the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees puts the figure at  160,000 and Ethiopia says they number about 100,000.  </P> <P> Somalia has begun registering some of the refugees. They will be asked if they  want to return to Ethiopia. Those who don't will be granted limited assistance  to help them settle in Somalia.  </P></p>

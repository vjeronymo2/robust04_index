			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> HARRELL, OHYAMA WITH PHILHARMONIC  </P> <P> The program for the fifth week of subscription concerts at the Los Angeles  Philharmonic looked only mildly inviting on paper. It was an agenda, led by  Philharmonic assistant conductor Heiichiro Ohyama, consisting of an Elegy by  American composer Samuel Adler, Shostakovich's First Cello Concerto (played by  Lynn Harrell) and Berlioz's "Symphonie Fantastique."  </P> <P> At the first performance Thursday night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the  Music Center, however, mildness was nowhere in evidence. Ohyama and the  orchestra delivered a powerful reading of Berlioz's familiar masterpiece;  cellist Harrell and his colleagues plumbed the sometimes-neglected depths of  the E-flat Concerto, and the brief Adler piece started off the proceedings in  serious vein.  </P> <P> Actually, what started the evening was most serious: a tribute, via a recording  of Vladimir Horowitz's playing of Schumann's "Traumerei," to the late pianist.  This seemed to set the tone of this satisfying concert, since it put in a  larger perspective the emotional range of the three works to come.  </P> <P> Most polished was the "Symphonie Fantastique," in a sweeping and admirably  detailed account which moved logically and with apprehendable continuity from  first to last. All choirs of the orchestra rose to what seemed a special  occasion, and the solo lines emerged with particular passion -- especially  those of clarinetist Michele Zukovsky.  </P> <P> Harrell's touching and virtuosic performance of the First Cello Concerto turned  out not to be the usual, heart-on-sleeve reading many soloists produce, but one  more thoughtful, more self-restrained and ultimately more memorable.  </P> <P> The progress of feeling outlined in the work is thus detailed, nuance by  nuance, the accumulation of strong emotions building, through the piece, to the  final cadence. Paradoxically -- or perhaps not so paradoxically -- the lack of  grandstanding from the solo cellist resulted here in a triumph for the  composer. Ohyama and the Philharmonic supported Harrell's concept thoroughly.  </P> <P> Strong feelings in miniature are the product in Adler's brief, pointed and  atonal Elegy for strings, a work written in 1962 after the death of Marjorie  Fulton Harrell, the mother of Lynn Harrell, in an auto accident.  </P></p>

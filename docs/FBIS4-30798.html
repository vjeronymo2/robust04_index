			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna at its session in Mostar today endorsed the  Washington and Vienna Agreements, assessing them as being a  historical necessity, but also as being an acceptable solution  for the Croat nation. The deputies concluded that by their  consistent implementation, and through the confederation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia, equal rights and  survival of the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina are being  secured. Zdenko Vranjes has a report on other conclusions  reached by the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna:    [Begin Vranjes recording] In addition to its support for the  Vienna negotiations, following a day-long discussion, the  chamber of deputies instructed the deputies of this chamber who  are to be present at the constitutive assembly session of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation in Sarajevo on Monday [30 May], to  vote only for the election of the president and the vice  president of the federation in line with the Vienna Agreement,  while other decisions on the agenda should be voted for only if  they are in accordance with the adopted constitution of the  federation.    This conclusion was endorsed in order to postpone the  adoption of a law on the federal government, because deputies  who took part in the discussion said that the draft law was not  completely coordinated with the adopted constitution.  Therefore, the deputies were advised to discuss the draft law  at the constitutive assembly session on Monday and return it to  be further coordinated with the constitution.    Even though the agenda of the constitutive assembly session  on Monday does not include the decisionmaking on the final  cantonal set-up of the federation, the chamber of deputies, in  addition to its positive assessment of this part of the Vienna  Agreement, instructed the deputies, when making a decision on  this issue, to take into consideration all constructive  proposals, opinions, and suggestions of the Croat people voiced  at the session today.    The chamber of deputies endorsed a stand of the leadership  of  the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina that was  presented in the discussion today that scope and opportunities  still existed for making alterations to the agreed maps of  cantons.    All these conclusions, even though read out, were not  formally endorsed because Mostar was left without electricity  this evening and the session was wound up for that reason.    Before that, the chamber of deputies positively assessed the  work of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government so far, as it was  said, given the conditions under which it has been working.    The deputies decided that the Defense Ministry and the main  HVO [Croatian Defense Council] headquarters should begin  demobilization, advising the government to invest more effort  into the reconstruction of the economy.

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Italy plans capital gains tax change ITALY'S new government announced yesterday it was planning to water down its complex capital gains tax on bourse transactions as part of a package of measures to advance its ambitious privatisation programme. Stockbrokers have attributed part of the recent decline in equity trading to the effects of the tax, introduced last year. At present investors can pay one of two rates - 15 per cent or 25 per cent - according to a complex formula which they must choose in advance. Mr Giovanni Goria, the finance minister, said after a cabinet meeting that the steps aimed at 'cooling investors' desire to sell shares and reinforcing that to buy', particularly new issues. But he said this did not imply the government accepted that the market's current difficulties stemmed from the tax treatment of investors. In a seven-hour cabinet session, ministers also authorised the four public sector groups transformed into joint stock companies last week as a first step towards privatisation, IRI, ENI, ENEL and INA, to revalue their portfolios. IRI, the biggest of the four, which has consolidated debts of more than L60,000bn (Pounds 28bn), experienced difficulty after the change of status, because Italy's civil code forbids joint stock companies to issue debt if their own capital is inadequate. The new decrees will allow the groups to revalue their holdings free of tax, instantly raising their capital and getting round the legal knot. The new measures coincided with the decision by Moody's, the US debt rating agency, to downgrade Italy's foreign currency borrowings. Moody's lowered the rating for Italy, already the only one of the world's seven leading industrialised countries not to have a top-notch triple A status, to AA3 from AA1. Expectations of the move, which had already caused the lira to slip against the D-Mark in foreign exchange trading earlier this week, obliged the Bank of Italy to intervene to prevent a move against the currency. The lira closed at L759.175 against the D-Mark, compared with L757.150 on Wednesday, after the central bank sold DM100m and Ecu25m in a deliberate signal of its readiness to intervene in the markets. The government yesterday also tidied up television broadcasting concessions, with long-awaited legislation confirming the roles of the main broadcasters, notably the three private channels owned by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate. At the same time, the cabinet approved draft laws to create a new supremo for internal security, who will attempt to improve co-ordination between the police, the military-style carabinieri and the guardia di finanza, Italy's three separate police forces. Disorganisation and rivalries between the three have in the past been blamed for the inability to combat organised crime.

			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VOTE ON EXPANSION OF JAIL DELAYED  </P> <P> Opponents of a proposal to expand the Men's Central Jail in downtown Los  Angeles Tuesday delayed a Board of Supervisors' vote for one week, but admitted  their chances of picking up the votes to kill the project are slim.  </P> <P> The county has proposed adding 2,408 beds to the Bauchet Street jail, bringing  the capacity to 8,000 inmates. The $328-million project is the cornerstone of  efforts to alleviate overcrowding in the county jail system.  </P> <P> About 75 residents and merchants from Chinatown, Olvera Street and the William  Meade housing project directly behind the jail showed up at the board meeting  to protest the plan, saying their communities are already overloaded with  existing or proposed jail facilities.  </P> <P> The board agreed to the delay to give residents time to study the proposal.  </P> <P> Soledad Castellanos, president of the William Meade housing project's residents  council, told supervisors in Spanish, "From my apartment, it is less than 50  yards to the wall of the jail. Every day, we see prison guards, helicopters and  patrol cars, especially when there are escapes. It is no way to raise  children."  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre said the plans for a jail  expansion run counter to efforts to revitalize the northeast corridor to  downtown Los Angeles. He and others urged supervisors to "spread the burden"  for jail facilities throughout the county.  </P> <P> A new 2,100-bed jail is nearing completion in the Santa Clarita Valley and a  1,000-bed jail also is planned for Lynwood.  </P></p>

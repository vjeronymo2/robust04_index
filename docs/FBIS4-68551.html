			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Russian </F> Union of Journalists, by Vasiliy Feklyunin; date, place not  given: "Let Us Look Truth in the Face" -- first paragraph is  introduction]    [Text] The publication in IZVESTIYA of the famous letter  about television has generated a flood of letters and protests  from leaders of regional television companies who are even  threatening to leave the Russian Union of Journalists. Vsevolod  Bogdanov, chairman of the Russian Union of Journalists, who  worked in Ostankino as head of the most troublesome service --  that of television programs -- before he arrived in the union,  answers the following questions.    [Bogdanov] I would like to explain straight away that this  statement was adopted on the basis of the results of  journalists' hearings which were held under the aegis of the  Union of Journalists. Representatives of all television  companies, both state and commercial, were invited to  participate in them. Unfortunately I was not present at the  actual hearings and did not participate in composing the letter.  The fact that my signature is on it is a misunderstanding.    It remains a secret to me why representatives of the council  of leaders of regional television companies did not participate  in drawing up the recommendations set forth in the letter. The  flood of emotional telegrams from the localities testifies to  the differences of opinion which could have been settled at a  "roundtable"    Let us look truth in the face. The state cannot continue to  maintain around 100 television and radio broadcasting companies  as it used to in the past. This year the budget for the  functioning of television has been halved. There are no  guarantees for vital funding for the future either.  Consequently, ways of providing for television companies must  be sought.    Forms of ownership can and should be varied. Naturally  television and radio broadcasting companies in our country can  be state, public, private, or whatever. Something else is  fundamental: How to ensure that journalists from regional and  republic television and radio broadcasting companies do not lose  control of the situation. We must achieve a situation whereby  it is precisely the journalists who become the bosses in their  own editorial offices, on television and radio airtime, and on  the pages of newspapers and journals. So that they could turn  from being hired workers into the owners of television and radio  programs and newspaper columns, and so on. And if this is to  happen, then they must be ensured the possibility to participate  on equal terms in the process of privatization and turning  enterprises into joint stock companies. That is why a law is  needed.    Yes, there is a real danger that television and radio  broadcasting companies, particularly regional ones, may be  contracted out [angazhirovany], bought lock, stock, and barrel  [na kornyu], corrupted, and alienated from journalists'  collectives. The Union of Journalists will fight against this.  We consider it to be our duty to fight the ugly phenomenon of  the parasitic existence, on the body of state television and  radio companies, of various commercial structures, which are as  a rule run by showmen. They use state television, which is paid  for out of the pockets of television viewers, that is,  taxpayers, to their own ends: They gain huge capital from  advertising and contracting. In these cases journalists have to  make bargains with their professional conscience, otherwise they  would be left without any work.    [Feklyunin] So it works out that a number of television and  radio companies, including the largest one, Ostankino, are only  symbolically "state" companies, but essentially, as the letter  published in IZVESTIYA accurately notes, they are "private  carriers using state transportation."    [Bogdanov] My viewpoint is that the essence of the problem  is not in the name or even in the ownership of the company, but  in the content of the airtime.    Speaking of commercial television, we do not have to explain  what it can be like. The owners of such a television channel  naturally do all they possibly can (though within the framework  of the law) to get profits. This is perfectly explicable -- it  is business. The consumer, the viewer, has the right to acquire  this commodity, that is, to watch a program or not. The  editorial office collective has the right to sell its output.    But there is another kind of television in the world.  People's television, serving the people, television as a means  of contact with the people, a way of expressing public opinion.  In the majority of countries it is financed by the people  themselves, the viewers. People pay for using a particular  channel. And naturally, those who pay in a certain way control  the television, so that its programs do not go beyond the  framework of generally recognized morals, and so that it is  expressing the viewers' interests.    For instance, in Italy there are three RAI channels -- that  is the state-national television. And another three have been  created by the notorious Berlusconi. Naturally, these channels  are of a commercial nature and serve their boss. But Italy's  private television has been forced to adapt to the best models  of Italian television art in order not to lose viewers.    In our country the state apparently allocates funds to  maintain the state television and radio broadcasting companies.  But after all, this is our money, this is the money of the  Russian citizens, the taxpayers. However, we cannot control the  way this money is spent or influence the content of the  programs. Therein lies the essential difference between our  television and foreign television.    Unfortunately, Russian television is gradually turning into  an arena for games of chance with presenters-brokers  manipulating wads of banknotes and expensive prizes, and gaudy  advertisements. This irritates viewers. We are also  exasperated by the abundance of various preachers from abroad,  magicians, soothsayers, and astrologers. After all, who stands  to gain from all this charlatanism on the television screen, who  earns money from this! There is no country in the world with  such a market-style television, in the direct sense of the word,  as we have.    [Feklyunin] When I was in Japan recently, I watched programs  on 12 television channels. And I did not see any scenes of  violence, killings, so-called oriental combat, or sex on any of  them. I would call Japanese television humane television  activity. Although the majority of the companies are nonstate  companies, moral monitoring of them by the public is very  strict. In Germany, Sweden, and France television is designed to  serve the interests of society -- it informs, educates, trains,  and entertains.    [Bogdanov] I would add that any country which respects its  citizens bans base American blockbusters on television, who,  thanks to our own television, have become a school of depravity  for young people, a school of cruelty, crime, and bad taste.  The worst thing is the pernicious influence of such television  on our children.    It seems to me that it is high time for the complete reform  of Russian television. You cannot change anything by  half-measures alone. A concept of Russian national television  based on the idea of Russia's spiritual rebirth is needed. And  all studios and companies, regardless of form of ownership,  should build their program policy within the framework of the  nationwide concept.    We are proposing to declare an open competition for the  creation of a law "On Russian Television and Radio." Drafts  will have to go through an examination in republic and regional  television and radio broadcasting companies before being  submitted for discussion by the State Duma.    The Russian Union of Journalists is putting forward an  initiative: To create a professional television league which  would include both employers -- broadcasting television  companies -- and producers of products for broadcasting. Such  an organization has already been created by the publishers and  chief editors of Russian newspapers.    A league would help protect the interests of the creative  collectives of television and radio broadcasting companies and  have an authoritative influence on the elaboration and adoption  of the relevant law, elaborate the principles of the  privatization of television and radio broadcasting and turning  it into joint stock companies, and would have levers with which  to control the use of state licenses on television and radio  broadcasting.    In the first ten days of May, we intend to hold an  international conference on the problems of radio and  television. We are going to invite leaders of all television  and radio companies, including regional ones, to participate.  The Union of Journalists plans to ensure that all participants  in the conference are received and are given accommodation. An  exchange of opinions will help find the sensible path along  which Russian television should develop, remembering the main  principle: "Do no harm!"</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 5 (AFP) -- President Francois Mitterrand  said Thursday [5 May] that France could not consider rejoining  NATO's integrated command because it wanted to keep its  independent nuclear deterrent.    "For the moment, French nuclear weapons are not at  everyone's  disposal, they are under sole French control," the socialist  president said in an address at the presidential palace to  French military and civilian officials.    Mitterrand said control of the nuclear weapons could not be  handed over to an international authority, adding that he stood  by the late president Charles de Gaulle's 1966 decision to pull  out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's integrated  command.    "I firmly maintain this decision. Nohing will make me change  it," Mitterrand said.    Referring to the "tragic solitude of those who have the  power  to decide," the president said that the decision to use nuclear  weapons must rest with the head of state because of the short  time available to "respond to a threat of aggression."    Mitterrand spoke after he and his conservative government  adopted a bill setting out French defence options for the next  six years.    His audience Thursday included Prime Minister Edouard  Balladur and Defence Minister Francois Leotard.    The head of state and the government disagreed on two issues  -- whether or not to resume nuclear testing at Mururoa in the  Pacific and the fate of nuclear weapons buried in silos on the  Albion plateau in southeastern France.    Mitterrand opposes resumption of nuclear testing, favoured  by  the right, and wants to keep the Albion site operational.    Much of the governing right-wing coalition wants to abandon  strategic missiles in favour of airborne nuclear weapons.  France also has nuclear missile-armed submarines.</p>

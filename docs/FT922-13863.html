			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / World Trade News: Nafta 'depends on US Congress' US TRADE representative Carla Hills said yesterday that a North American free trade agreement was still within reach this year, but that its implementation may depend on the US Congress. Speaking after three days of talks with her Canadian and Mexican counterparts in Montreal, Ms Hills said she did not expect the campaign for the US elections in November to have 'any slowing effect' on the Nafta talks. 'There is still time to negotiate and sign an agreement, and to notify Congress before the election. It would be up to Congress whether it would put this first on the agenda and approve the agreement.' Mr Michael Wilson, the Canadian finance minister, described the meeting as 'quite candid and quite constructive,' with good progress in some areas, including standards, temporary entry, rules of origin and customs procedures. But he cautioned that, even in these areas, disagreements remain. He instanced motor vehicles and textiles as sensitive industries where negotiations were not complete. In both these areas, the US and Canada are concerned that low-cost Mexican producers will draw a disproportionate share of investment. Although Ms Hills said that an agreement was still possible this year, the three representatives refused to commit themselves to a timetable. Chief negotiators and the heads of working groups have been instructed, and they will report back in the next few weeks.</p>

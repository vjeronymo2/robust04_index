			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Growth in US helps Haynes to Pounds 5m A strong performance by the US operations of Haynes Publishing Group, the car and motor cycle maintenance manual company, helped lift annual pre-tax profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 5.04m. Turnover moved ahead to Pounds 25.7m (Pounds 22.8m) in the year to May 31, with US sales up 23 per cent at Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 10.5m) and UK sales up 5 per cent at Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 12.2m). 'As in recent years, much of our growth is expected to come from the US, ' Mr John Haynes, chairman, said. But, he added, the board had achieved its objective of returning the UK operations to their former levels of profit. Pre-tax profits for the UK rose by 23 per cent to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.3m). This included a write-off of Pounds 223,000 largely caused by the closure of the contract printing business. Operating profits for the UK stood at Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 2m). Mr Haynes said an improvement in new titles had helped reduce publishing losses and additional products were being considered. The replacement of old machinery would mean an improvement in UK capacity. The US operation saw pre-tax profits grow by 32 per cent to Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 2.5m). Operating profits moved ahead from Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m. The company now has book manufacturing facilities on both sides of the Atlantic following the opening of a print facility in Nashville in November. Despite Mr Haynes' concern about expected rises in raw material prices - they account for 50 per cent of product costs - Mr Max Pearce, group chief executive, was confident the current year's profitability would not be affected. A final dividend of 5p (3p) has been recommended, making a total of 9p (6.5p) on earnings per share 12 per cent ahead at 19.6p (17.53p). Last year's dividend and earnings per share have been restated for November's 1 for 2 scrip issue. The shares rose 12p to 450p.</p>

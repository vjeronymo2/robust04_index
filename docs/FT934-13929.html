			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Survey of Aluminium (4): Contract fights on / A look at alloy trading on the LME THE London Metal Exchange, through long experience, does not expect its new contracts to be welcomed with open arms. The aluminium alloy contract, launched just over a year ago, has proved no exception. Argument raged around the industry for more than two years before the contract finally got off the ground. Its success is important to the exchange, which is constantly on the look-out for ways to expand its business and has run out of pure base metals. Leaving aside the high grade aluminium contract (which replaced the initial aluminium contract) and the relaunched tin contract, the alloy contract is the exchange's first new product for 13 years. The LME has again found itself defending its product. As Mr Ralph Kestenbaum, LME vice-chairman, told Metal Bulletin's eighth international aluminium conference in Montreal last month, the two other contracts introduced on to the LME in the past 25 years - primary aluminium and nickel  -were met with extreme hostility. In fact the leading producers tried to boycott the contracts, which today provide the daily prices that govern the industries. 'If you look at the turnovers of primary aluminium and nickel today as compared with five, 10 and 20 years ago and if you look at metal stored in LME warehouses you can see that the growth is overwhelming,' said Mr Kestenbaum. Mr David King, chief executive of the LME, believes that the contract is gaining acceptance and has considerable potential. Three-month metal has been trading for about 10 months and turnover is significantly higher than we experienced when nickel and primary aluminium were introduced, he said. Two years ago the chances of making the contract work were put at only 50-50 by some LME members. The Organisation of European Aluminium Smelters and the Japan Aluminium Alloy Refiners Association were against it. But by launch time, the omens appeared good. Secondary aluminium smelters were losing money because of the poor state of the economy and they were pleased to let the LME have metal for ready cash. This was reflected in the rapid build-up of stocks in LME warehouses, which reached 15,000 tonnes at the beginning of the year and were approaching 40,000 tonnes by April. They now stand around 46,000 tonnes. Secondary aluminium production is about 4.5m tonnes a year mainly of automotive grade alloy. The motor industry uses more than 70 per cent of production. By the time of the contract launch 47 alloy brands had been registered by producers, between them accounting for about 2m tonnes a year output. The contract specifies three grades for delivery - German DIN 226, Japanese AD12.1, and US A380-1. These represent the basic or (in the words of one trader) 'bog standard' die-casting specifications in Japan, Europe and the US, the three main consuming regions. Although the three chosen grades vary slightly they are designed for the same function - automotive die-casting - and consequently in practice there is little difference in their prices. The contract is in dollars, covers lots of 20 tonnes and can be traded 15 months forward. Whatever the omens at the launch, the first year of trading has seen low volumes and featureless trading. This is not surprising given that the launch was made at the height of the recession. There has also been no specific event to make the secondary price vary from the primary price. And the primary market has had a tough year as demand remained flat and production rose to the extent that primary stocks in LME warehouses burst through 2m tonnes in August. 'Some might take the view that it was launched at the wrong time,' says Mr Angus MacMillan of Billiton-Enthoven Metals. 'They are wrong. It's better to launch when prices or the economy are depressed than when the primary price is volatile - that would only have exacerbated any reluctance to use it . A slow work-in is probably better.' Even so, there are those in the industry who believe that the LME has listed too many alloys, making it more difficult to get a clear price. Mr Peter Nix, of the secondary ingot producers association, believes a single alloy would lead to wider participation by the industry. 'The 380 would be best to start with - that is the most universally used.' However, Mr MacMIllan, says the LME would have been restricting itself unnecessarily in using only one specification. He also believes the LME would be foolish to start tampering with the contract now. Mr King of the LME agrees: 'We are more than satisfied with the current situation, but we will be putting more resources into educating the secondary aluminium market about the contract and the LME.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       WESTERN WORLD SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCE FOR ALUMINIUM (000 tonnes)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CONSUMPTION       1988    1989    1990    1991    1992    1993    1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- N.

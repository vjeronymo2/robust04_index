			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Pioneer profits reach record ADollars 90m PIONEER, the Australian building products and petroleum group, has reported record net profits of ADollars 90m (Dollars 67.60m) after abnormal items for the six months to December, a rise of 2.4 per cent on the corresponding period last year. The result included an abnormal profit of ADollars 37m on the sale of its holding in Ampol Exploration, an Australian petroleum company. However, the abnormal profit was offset by a provision of ADollars 40m against the book value of US assets, which was also treated as an abnormal item. Pioneer said it had restated profits for both periods to exclude contributions from Ampol Exploration, the sale of which was completed for accounting purposes in July. The group said sales revenue fell 13 per cent to ADollars 2.5bn. Revenue from building materials was down 2 per cent to ADollars 1.2bn, primarily because of weakness in Australian markets. Petroleum refining and marketing operations revenue fell 17 per cent to ADollars 1.3bn, principally reflecting a fall in crude oil prices at the end of the Gulf war. Directors declared an interim dividend of 7.5 cents a share, unfranked because of available tax losses incurred in previous years.</p>

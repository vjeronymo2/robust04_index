			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIVE WRIGHT WITNESSES MAY FACE CONTEMPT CHARGES  </P> <P> The House Ethics Committee may vote contempt charges against five balking  witnesses in its investigation of Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), the top-ranking  Republican member of the panel said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "That's one option," Rep. John T. Myers (R-Ind.) told reporters after the  subpoenaed witnesses failed to show up for questioning Tuesday in San Antonio.  The committee will meet today to consider further action.  </P> <P> The challenge to the committee's authority will delay a hearing for Wright that  the Speaker requested immediately, Myers said. He said he does not now expect  the Speaker's appearance until "sometime in May."  </P> <P> Myers and committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) flew to San  Antonio to take sworn testimony from Morris Jaffe, a Texas oilman, and his son,  Douglas Jaffe, principals in a transaction that produced a quick profit of  $340,000 for Mallightco, a firm half-owned by the Speaker and his wife.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the sale allowed Wright to receive an unexpectedly high price of  $350,000 for shares held by him and his wife in the company, jointly owned with  George A. Mallick Jr., a Ft. Worth developer, and Mallick's wife.  </P> <P> The Jaffes and three others involved in the transaction refused to testify  before the Ethics Committee.  </P> <P> Wright, who met with reporters before Wednesday's House session, turned away  questions on the issue, saying: "I'm not going to make any comment today on  that ethics thing."  </P></p>

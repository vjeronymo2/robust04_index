			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: MGM-Pathe seeks Orion release link MGM-Pathe Communications has made a non-binding proposal to distribute Orion Pictures' unreleased motion pictures and its library products, AP-DJ reports from California. MGM said it would make an advance under a distribution agreement and provide a line of credit for print and advertising expenses. It said its proposal contained an option for it to purchase the film assets of Orion. Terms of the MGM proposal were not disclosed. Although Orion, which last December filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors, has 10 films ready for release, it has lacked the funds to do it. An agreement with Orion would give MGM-Pathe films to send through its existing distribution pipeline. MGM-Pathe needs more films to release because its prolonged legal and financial problems have halted production. MGM said that the proposal, if accepted, would effectively benefit MGM's distribution infrastructure and make the most of the value of the Orion library and also the unreleased motion pictures. MGM-Pathe is principally owned by Credit Lyonnais following the bank's recent foreclosure on MGM's stock.</p>

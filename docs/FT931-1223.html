			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mudslinging prompts a quick fall  -Yamaha's troubles have been all too public THE downfall of Mr Hiroshi Kawakami, the ex-president of Yamaha, the world's largest musical instruments maker, has been swift and unceremonious. Last Friday, just a year after he was forced out as president, he was made to relinquish his seat on the Yamaha board and was appointed head of a little-known affiliate which develops holiday resorts in Hokkaido, Japan's remote northernmost island. The latest move against Mr Kawakami was triggered by an article in a popular weekly magazine in which he gave his account of his removal from the presidency. He said intrigue against the Kawakami family and a management coup, rather than the official explanation that he was stepping down to take responsibility for the company's sluggish performance, were the real reasons for his resignation. This revelation proved his final undoing. Mr Kawakami, by carrying on his feud in a magazine, committed the unforgivable crime of exposing Yamaha's shame in public. To the Japanese, unaccustomed to public demonstrations of corporate discord, the goings-on at Yamaha seemed more appropriate to a third-rate TV soap opera than a prestigious international corporation. For Yamaha the public mud-slinging was not just disgraceful; it was totally unbecoming a company which counts among its sister companies Yamaha Motor, the world's second-largest motorcycle manufacturer, and Yamaha Music Foundation, a network of music schools teaching millions of Japanese children. The ousting of Mr Kawakami was an unusual display of a Japanese labour union flexing its muscles and joining forces with management to remove a leader they felt to be inadequate. However, with the deteriorating economic environment in Japan, such management-labour alliances to force out incompetent chief executives are becoming more common. In February last year, Yamaha's labour union was scheduled to meet Mr Kawakami and the management to discuss his responsibility for the company's sluggish profits and lack of direction. However, Mr Kawakami called in sick, prompting the union call for his resignation. The next day, Mr Kawakami, at the helm for over eight years, resigned and was replaced by the vice-president, Mr Seisuke Ueshima. Mr Hiroshi Kawakami was the third Kawakami family member to have run Yamaha since Mr Kaichi Kawakami rescued the company nearly 60 years ago from the brink of bankruptcy. The family's total shareholding in the group, however, is less than 1 per cent, although it wielded enough power to ensure the succession. Critics said Mr Hiroshi Kawakami, an avid skier and concert-goer, was more interested in classical music and sports cars than in turning around the company's slumping businesses. After nearly 10 years of lacklustre performance with no prospect of improvement, falling employee morale and lack of trust in the management finally prompted the labour union to act. Yamaha has suffered from a continuing decline in its core musical instruments business. Unit sales of pianos have fallen from a peak in 1980 of 238,000 to 160,000 a year. Areas into which the company has diversified, from sporting goods to furniture and audio equipment, are suffering from the slowdown in consumer spending. Pre-tax profits fell to Y2.83bn (Dollars 24m) in the year to March 1992 from Y4.25bn the year before. A restructuring programme aimed at returning pre-tax profits to Y10bn in 1995 was launched belatedly last year. But the post of chairman has been left vacant while Mr Ueshima, who was vice-president for nearly nine years before becoming president, is himself hardly free of blame for the company's lack of direction over the past few years. Unless Yamaha opts to bring in new management from outside, the company's only hope for full-scale recovery lies in its current management displaying the kind of leadership skills it has so far failed to show.</p>

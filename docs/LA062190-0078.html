			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> TRAILER TO DISPLAY SPEEDS AS CARS PASS  </P> <P> In an effort to slow driving speeds in Camarillo, the Ventura County Sheriff's  Department will set up a radar-equipped trailer on city streets that will  display the speed of an approaching car.  </P> <P> In addition to showing the actual speed of cars, the trailer's scoreboard will  display the proper speed limit, Sheriff's Sgt. Bill Boyd said.  </P> <P> "It brings up the level of awareness of how fast people are driving," Boyd  said. "It is an educational tool."  </P> <P> The trailer will be placed on different streets each day, Boyd said.  </P> <P> Money for the unit, which costs $7,570, was donated by the Tri-County Traffic  School of Thousand Oaks, which runs classes for people who have received  traffic tickets, Boyd said.  </P> <P> The trailer will be presented to the Camarillo City Council on Wednesday and  then will be put out on the streets, Boyd said.

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Economic Watch: Danish inflation reaches 2.1% The strong recovery under way in the Danish economy was reflected in a significant increase in consumer prices in April. The index rose by 0.4 per cent from March and by 2.1 per cent from April of last year. In the 12 months to April 1993 prices increased by only 1.1 per cent. The increase over the past 12 months, however, has been predicted by the government, which expects consumer prices in 1994 to increase 2.0 per cent from last year. This compares with an increase of 1.2 per cent from 1992-3. The government last week adjusted its economic forecasts upwards, predicting an increase in GDP of 4.0 per cent this year, with private consumption to rise by 4.8 per cent and business investment by 10.4 per cent in constant price terms. The strong growth is expected to continue in 1995, the government said. Hillary Barnes, Copenhagen. Inflation in the European Union was 3.2 per cent a year in April, unchanged from March, but marginally down from the 3.4 per cent rate a year earlier, according to Eurostat, the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg. Italy's merchandise trade account with other EU countries saw a surplus of L1,026bn in February compared with a surplus of L506bn in February 1993, the Italian statistical agency, Istat, reported yesterday. It also reported March industrial output 0.7 per cent higher than March 1993.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Dividends and profits IS IT possible for a small private limited company such as ours to pay out dividends in excess of trading profit, in any one accounting year, thus making use of the retained profit of previous years? If so, then at the end of the year will the company be able to get back from the Inland Revenue the difference between the ACT (which presumably has to be paid in any case at the end of the relevant quarterly period) and the corporation tax due on the year's profit? Or is the adjustment of this excess payment allowed only against future tax liabilities? If the dividend route is not permissible for distributing the retained profit, can you please suggest other tax efficient ways of achieving this? Yes, you can pay dividends in excess of profits. It is possible, in principle, to carry the excess ACT back and thus recover part of the corporation tax paid for past years. The rules are complex. The company's accountants are best placed to advise you on what strategies to adopt, because they know the full background facts, figures and dates. If the fact that you have written to us indicates that you have no confidence in the company's accountants' competence in tax matters, perhaps the Board should consider changing to a better firm. Possibly your bank manager can recommend a suitable one, if you do not wish to seek recommendations from business acquaintances, for example. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL DEATHS  </P> <P> Regarding the article concerning the multiple killings of Tustin resident pets  (Orange County section, March 10):  </P> <P> Excuse me, please? Did I read correctly that Tustin area pets found dead with  almost no blood in their bodies, severed paws and "washed organs" are being  explained away as coyote kills?  </P> <P> Are coyotes getting tidy these days? Well, I just think it's so kind of the  coyotes to leave the kitties nicely arranged for the owners to find later.  </P> <P> Golly, when I lived in coyote country, four of my kitties and many of my  neighbors' pets disappeared without a trace, and the coyotes never left so much  as a brief note.  </P> <P> The other theory, that the animals were killed while trying to keep warm in car  engines, was, to say the least, creative.  </P> <P> J. LUND  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

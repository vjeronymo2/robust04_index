			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Worcester opposition group appoints Cazenove to advise SHAREHOLDERS in Worcester Group who are opposed to a Pounds 71.8m bid from Robert Bosch, the German conglomerate, which the company has agreed, yesterday appointed Cazenove, the brokers, to act for them. Also yesterday, Bosch's adviser posted the offer document to Worcester shareholders. It disclosed that Bosch already has undertakings to accept from 51.4 per cent of holders, or 50.6 per cent on a fully diluted basis, and so could go unconditional as to acceptances. In the document Mr Michael Davies, Worcester's independent director, advises Worcester shareholders to accept or 'it is likely that you will become a minority investor in a company effectively controlled by Bosch'. The document also outlines the industrial logic in combining Bosch's Junkers boiler division with Worcester, the leading maker of combination boilers in the UK. Shareholders who met yesterday to discuss action are believed to account for about 25 per cent of Worcester's capital. They think that the 225p price being offered is too low. Some are also concerned that an arrangement giving Worcester's management shares in the new Bosch subsidiary, rather than cash, means that not all shareholders are being treated similarly, a requirement of the Takeover Code. Worcester's management will be bought out in 1996 at a price depending on average earnings in 1993, 1994 and 1995. The document says the management deal was 'discussed extensively' with and approved by the executive of the Takeover Panel before the offer was announced. The dissenting shareholders have already lodged a complaint with the Panel and are considering an appeal to the full Panel.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Survey of Conferences and Exhibitions (6): Bargain basement seeks business - Some 350 northern venues are being marketed to European organisations NORTHERN ENGLAND may once have been an untapped gap in the European conferences market but, with the backing of the European Commission's regional development fund, that seems set to change. The Commission is paying the first year's rent for the Northern Conference Bureau, which has been set up in Macclesfield, Cheshire. It markets 350 venues in northern England - principally city and country house hotels and university accommodation - to industries, companies and trade associations in Germany, northern France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. It is run by Mr Bernard Owen, Manchester's former conferences organiser, with Mr Claude Guilot, a former conferences manager for Philips in Eindhoven, as his partner in Brussels. Mr Owen says Manchester Airport, the under-exploited north and its ability to undercut London and the south-east by 25 per cent on costs are proving decisive selling points. 'London and Scotland are well organised but many people in Europe are fed up with the prices and congestion they face if they organise a conference in the south-east,' he adds. The bureau offers a one-stop shop and is now recruiting the north's top 50 conference hotels to its database of packages. In Europe, most people have heard of the Lake District and York and want to see them. Mr Owen and Mr Guilot are spreading the word that the Derbyshire Peaks, Liverpool, other parts of Yorkshire, Manchester, Newcastle, Cheshire, Northumberland, Durham and even North Wales also have much to offer. The ease of getting about on relatively uncongested motorways and trunk roads is another benefit. 'The north in general offers so many attractions within a very short distance of its major cities and towns, as well as good shopping in the big cities and in historic towns like Chester and York,' Mr Owen says. The new Sheffield Meadowhall development - Europe's biggest out-of-town shopping centre - is also an attraction, as is the Metrocentre, Britain's first, on Tyneside. 'The crux of our market is the meeting of between 50 and 80 people,' he adds. 'These account for 75 per cent of all conferences and they fit easily into very many city centre or country house hotels.' Target markets in the various countries being sold to are conferences about fast-moving consumer goods, insurance, banking, medicine, and pharmaceuticals. 'Northern England is the bargain basement of Europe,' Mr Owen enthuses. 'In the rest of Europe, conference prices are about the same as in south-east England. With direct flights into Manchester, Leeds-Bradford or Newcastle, we offer big savings, with the chance to see the British way of life at its best in places that are still relatively unknown in Europe.' Offering the north in this way as a niche market is not, of course, new in the conferences and exhibitions sector. Both main northern exhibition centres, at Harrogate and Manchester, have been doing so for some years. Neither is dauntingly oversized and each has a steady schedule of year-to-year regulars. Harrogate, in particular, has a good base of exhibitions which are tied to conferences, ensuring overnight stays in the town and trips by delegates and their spouses to the Yorkshire Dales, Moors or York. The six-year-old G-Mex Centre in Manchester is reporting another successful year, despite the recession, because of its flexibility. The Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre is a Pounds 22m conversion of the disused Central Station and its arched, single span roof has created 10,000 square metres of floorspace with no pillars in the way. Temporary structures outside can provide another 6,500 sq metres if needed. G-Mex can thus function as a large arena for boxing matches, six-a-side soccer tournaments and rock concerts, all of which have all proved crowd pullers, with a spin-off promotion of G-Mex itself as a result of their being televised. As exhibitions have contracted or, occasionally, been cancelled in the recession, Mr Frank Winter, G-Mex's chief executive, has upped the numbers of concerts or sporting events. The result has been 210 days' full usage in the last year. This is far below its 289-day record of the previous year, but Mr Winter says that was a freak result caused by exceptional demand. In any event, it equated to a usage rate of 93 per cent - well beyond the 85 per cent optimum level any exhibition centre prefers to have for ease of maintenance. Harrogate's International Centre was built nine years ago for Pounds 32m and caught an expanding market well. G-Mex has not appeared to dent a trend of long-term growth because the two places operate in complementary niches, in effect benefiting the northern economy as a whole. With three 2,000 sq metre indoor areas and another 4,000 sq metres available in the basement, Harrogate also offers flexibility. Two months ago the local authority, which owns the facilities, decided to spend up to Pounds 3.5m to refurbish the exhibition halls after a marketing study revealed long-term growth potential. Harrogate has recently suffered a blow from losing its twice-yearly fashion fair because of a rival event at Birmingham's NEC, but exhibition hall usage has remained at the 80 per cent level of the last decade. The conference centre managed 70 per cent, which Mr Paul Lewis, director of resort services says is 'excellent'. 'Numbers attending most events have been only about 5 per cent down because of the recession, but some shows have been well up on expectations,' he says. He forecasts an operating profit of Pounds 250,000 for 1992.</p>

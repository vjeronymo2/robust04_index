			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Balladur's call for truce spurned The French prime minister's call for a political ceasefire among fellow conservatives yesterday drew a tart response from several of his presidential rivals, with Mr Jacques Chirac spurning a bilateral truce. Mr Edouard Balladur had invited Mr Chirac, the leader of his own RPR Gaullist party, and ex-President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of his UDF coalition partner, to discuss ways to help unite the conservative government and parliamentary majority 'with a view to the presidential election'. Yesterday, Mr Chirac made it clear that he was not going to answer any summons from Mr Balladur before convening top leaders of the RPR, which he dominates, to discuss the strains that presidential rivalries are placing on the government. A close Chirac aide, Mr Eric Raoult, complained yesterday that Mr Balladur was trying to gag Mr Chirac's supporters while giving free voice to his own. Mr Giscard d'Estaing yesterday claimed that his UDF federation was not to blame for the recent political ructions, implying he had nothing to discuss with Mr Balladur. Mr Balladur's appeal for presidential campaigning to be delayed until the New Year looks likely to go unheeded, partly because his rivals see it as self-serving.</p>

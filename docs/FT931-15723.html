			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / International Company News: IBM boosts management team INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the troubled US computer maker, has moved to strengthen its management by appointing three extra members to its main executive committee. This brings to six the number of executives in the group's top management team, which reports directly to IBM's board, and provides more direct representation for several of its business units. Joining the committee are Mr Robert LaBant, Mr Ned Lautenbach and Mr Patrick Toole. The existing members are Mr John Akers, chairman and chief executive, Mr Jack Kuehler, president, and Mr Frank Metz, chief financial officer, on the committee The expansion of the committee is the latest move in a broad restructuring of IBM's operations. The appointments also fuel speculation as to who may succeed Mr Akers as chairman, if he retires as expected at the end of next year. Mr LaBant is among the favourites for the top job, according to IBM insiders. Mr LaBant is a senior vice-president and general manager of IBM North America. Mr Toole, also an IBM senior vice-president, is in charge of manufacturing and development. Mr Toole oversees IBM's mainframe computer, data storage, networking, printer and software operations. Mr Lautenbach, IBM senior vice-president will take on a newly-created role as the contact executive at IBM headquarters for IBM World Trade, the company's international marketing and sales operations. He was formerly president of IBM Asia Pacific. He has been replaced in that post by Mr Robert Stephenson, also an IBM vice-president.</p>

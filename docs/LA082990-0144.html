			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MAYTAG REFUNDS ON MICROWAVES  </P> <P> Up to 50,000 people who bought microwave ovens thinking they were new when they  weren't can get refunds from Maytag Corp.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Robert B. Propst gave initial approval to the Maytag offer  but set an Oct. 19 hearing to allow any objections from the buyers of the Magic  Chef ovens.  </P> <P> Since 1987, Maytag's Anniston plant has repackaged or reconditioned ovens that  customers had returned. The company then sold the ovens as new for $80 to $160.  </P> <P> In the agreement, Maytag, parent company of Magic Chef, denied any liability  but agreed to halt the practice and to offer refunds of $35 to people who  bought the ovens, primarily through Wal-Mart stores. The refunds would be cash  payments of $25 and a $10 certificate toward the purchase of a Magic Chef  product.  </P></p>

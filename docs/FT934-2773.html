			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Buyers make the running - Directors' transactions Directors have been doing a great deal more buying than selling, as reflected in our table this week. JD Wetherspoon is one of the new breed of pub chain. The company has grown rapidly on the back of a formula which, among other things, eschews juke boxes. Timothy Randall the chairman, managing director and founder, has sold 350,000 shares at 330p. They came to market only in October last year but have outperformed the market since then by almost 70 per cent. Earnings are forecast to rise by over 20 per cent in the year to July 1994, which would bring the price/earnings ratio down to below 20. Desmond Graves, a non-executive director of George Wimpey, has sold a total of 800,000 shares at prices between 183p and 186p. Construction companies have been on the mend for the past 12 months, and interim results announced in September showed Wimpey had returned to the black after reporting interim losses last time round of almost Pounds 25m. The shares have outperformed the market by 54 per cent over the past year. The headline-hitting share purchase of the week was that of Peter Wood at Royal Bank of Scotland. He bought 1.85m shares at prices between 402p and 412p, taking his holding to almost 2.5m. Wood is responsible for the bank's Direct Line Insurance arm and profits from that have increased by leaps and bounds over the past year.

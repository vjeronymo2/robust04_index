			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA'S CAR CULTURE  </P> <P> I read your article about car salesmen with great interest. The "victory"  stories of these successful car salesmen in Los Angeles are most enlightening.  Few consumers realize the salesman's determination in profit-taking. By  complicating the car-buying experience, these verbal "bait and switch" sellers  are assured "easy" money.  </P> <P> It is most entertaining for me to expose the seller's trade secrets over radio  and television.  </P> <P> The public opinion of car salesmen is a strong one. Theirs are considered the  least trusted of professions. Recent news indicates car salesmen have risen to  tie with the second least trusted profession -- lawyers. This landmark  improvement in public opinion, reminds one of the Big Three's car-quality  successes in recent years.  </P> <P> DARRELL PARRISH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> Parrish is author of "The Car Buyer's Art: How to Beat the Salesman at His Own  Game."  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT PROPERTY: ENGELBERT TO SELL HIS 'PINK PALACE'  </P> <P> The King of Romance is selling his "Pink Palace."  </P> <P> Singer ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK has listed the Holmby Hills home, once owned by  the late movie star JAYNE MANSFIELD, at $8 million.  </P> <P> The eight-bedroom, nine-bath mansion on 1.25 acres became known as the "Pink  Palace" after the platinum-blond actress painted it her trademark color in the  '60s. Humperdinck recently repainted it a bright pink.  </P> <P> The singer has owned the three-story, Spanish-style estate, with an elevator  and seven fireplaces, since 1976. He bought it from a spinster who lived mainly  in a back room of the nearly 10,000-square-foot home, sources said.  </P> <P> "Engelbert doesn't use the giant house so much anymore and plans to purchase a  smaller property . . . that is closer to the beach," said Richard Schwartz, who  shares the listing with Linda Linn at the Prudential California Realty's  Sherman Oaks office.  </P> <P> Humperdinck, his wife and their four children have divided their time between  their homes in England, their main residence; Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Hawaii  and Holmby Hills.  </P> <P> The Holmby house was built in the 1930s for a Texas oilman, Schwartz said, and  it was later owned by singer Rudy Vallee. It was best known, however, for being  Mansfield's home until she was killed in a car accident in 1967.  </P> <P> While she lived there with her husband, Hollywood muscleman Mickey Hargitay,  Mansfield not only painted the house but also built meandering walkways, ponds,  fountains, statues and a heart-shaped swimming pool. Hargitay wrote "I love you  Jaynie" on the bottom of the pool, according to the 1988 book "Sexbomb: The  Life and Death of Jayne Mansfield."  </P> <P> The inscription is gone, Schwartz said. "It was painted over, but something  like 'Jaynie, my love will flame for you always. Love, Mickey' remains on the  bronze hood over the firepit in the pool house." Mansfield's initials also  remain in the wrought-iron gates facing Sunset Boulevard.  </P> <P> "There's also supposed to be a hidden wall in the house with Jayne's magazine  covers, which had been framed," Schwartz said. "We believe that wall is behind  a newer wall covered with Engelbert's Platinum and Gold records."  </P> <P> "Dallas" oilman Bobby Ewing has been house hunting on the CBS-TV show, but the  house he actually finds is about 1,200 miles, as the crow flies, from Texas.  </P> <P> The house that was used for the set is a new home in Calabasas Park Estates.  Built by Coastal Development, the home has four bedrooms plus maid's quarters,  a swimming pool, spa and views of the community golf course and tennis courts.  </P> <P> "I don't know what he is supposed to be paying for it in 'Dallas,' " said  Michele Kantor of Fred Sands Realtors, "but the reality is that it is priced at  $1,195,000." It's listed with Barbara Lipkin and Wendy Gale, both with Sands'  office in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Bobby Ewing, played by PATRICK DUFFY, also gets romantically involved with a  real estate woman in the segment, due to air, according to CBS, Feb. 2.  </P> <P> PIA ZADORA is at it again, but this time she's selling, not buying.  </P> <P> This column reported in early November that the entertainer and her wealthy  husband, Meshulam Riklis, were about to move into their new, $6.7-million house  in Beverly Park Estates.  </P> <P> Their new house is near Pickfair, which they also own and where they were  starting a two-year renovation/expansion.  </P> <P> They were also building a house in Malibu Colony, near an older home that they  also own, and they were redecorating their apartment in Manhattan.  </P> <P> That's the background, now to the news:  </P> <P> The couple is selling the Beverly Hills house where they lived before moving  into Beverly Park Estates. This house was previously owned by jockey Bill  Shoemaker. Before the Shoe, it was owned by Jeannie Martin, singer Dean  Martin's former wife.  </P> <P> Listed at $5.5 million with Beverly Hills realtor Mike Silverman, the one-story  contemporary has a skylight entry and larger-than-usual glass doors looking out  at treetop and city views; a gym, breakfast room, swimming pool, spa and  sunken, lighted tennis court. There is also a two-story staff or guest house  with four separate suites.  </P> <P> A. J. CAROTHERS -- who co-wrote the 1987 movie "The Secret of My Success,"  starring Michael J. Fox, and is working on a sequel -- and his wife, Caryl, are  buying a 4,320-square-foot home in the Haseko-Wilson project known as Crown  Villas at MountainGate in Brentwood.  </P> <P> The couple is moving from another Brentwood residence into the new $1,085,000  home as soon as interiors are completed.  </P> <P> The Carotherses also talked their good friends, Bill and Joyce Asher, into  buying at Crown Villas. All of their homes are due to close escrow the first  week of February.  </P> <P> BILL ASHER, who produced the TV series "Betwitched" and directed most of the "I  Love Lucy" episodes, and his wife, Joyce, are moving into their new $1,225,000  home from a Malibu home valued in the $2.5-million to $3-million range.  </P> <P> "So they're moving down," said developer Ken Wilson with a chuckle, "but they  like the views from Crown Villas overlooking Benedict Canyon, and the project  is right next to the tennis courts."  </P> <P> Security aspects of the 870-acre MountainGate, a planned community, also  appealed to the Ashers, who have been doing considerable traveling. She was  just in Madrid on a fund-raising tour as executive vice president for a  national dyslexia research organization, while he has been flying back and  forth to New York, working on a pilot for a series.  </P> <P> A West Hollywood triplex that singer FRANK SINATRA owned in the '50s and  MARILYN MONROE called home from 1952 to 1954 has been sold to actor JAMES  COBURN's ex-wife, Beverly Coburn, who plans to live there.  </P> <P> Interior designer Kalef Alaton, who died last May, was the most recent owner.  He turned the triplex into a 7,000-square-foot townhouse, which Coburn bought  for about $1.7 million. She sold her Moorish-style, 40-room villa in Beverly  Hills to the SULTAN of BRUNEI in April, 1988, for $5 million.  </P> <P> Steve Levine at Asher Dann &amp; Associates represented Coburn, and Linda May  of Caverhill &amp; May represented Alaton's estate.  </P></p>

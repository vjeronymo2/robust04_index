			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND NOW, A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THE NEW NC-17 MOVIE RATING  </P> <P> In response to Pete and Maria Francis' remarks about NC-17 and the number of  times suggestive words appear in "Henry &amp; June" ads, I say that if they  counted the times that words in movie ads -- and in the movies themselves --  pertain to violence, murder, mutilation and drugs, they would be appalled.  </P> <P> Self-righteous people should lighten up and concentrate on the things that are  destroying the world instead of berating movies or ads that contain (sexual)  words and feature some nudity.  </P> <P> I do not care if someone gets a little aroused from a movie that depicts sex,  but I do care if someone tries to emulate Rambo or some crazed killer in a  motion picture.  </P> <P> JOHN BYRNES  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

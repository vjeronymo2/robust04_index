			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Observer: Influx A conga line of Cuban political refugees looks to be forming in Argentina behind the three dancers from Havana's Tropicana nightclub revue who decided to stay on after performing in Buenos Aires recently. No sooner had the trio been spirited off to a safe house in the city than their footsteps were followed by two aircrew from the Cubana airline, a computer programmer who'd overstayed his tourist visa and three other miscellaneous defectors. With the country's immigration chief saying he wouldn't be surprised if all 400-odd Cubans now in Argentina on tourist visas soon applied for refugee status, President Carlos Menem must be dancing his own gleeful jig. Besides scoring brownie points in Washington, he's doing down his arch enemy Fidel Castro.</p>

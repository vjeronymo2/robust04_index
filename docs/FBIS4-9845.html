			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Air General Ramon Vega Hidalgo, Chilean Air </F> Force, FACh, commander in chief, by reporter Maria Eugenia  Oyarzun "yesterday on the occasion of the 64th anniversary of  the Air Force" at the Armed Forces building in Santiago]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Oyarzun] Does the FACh have  deterrent power?    [Vega] During the past 64 years the Air Force commanders'  main concern has been to provide the Air Force with effective  deterrent power. It is not just the Air Force but the nation's  air power as a whole. This is what Arturo Merino Benitez [one  of the founders of the FACh] envisaged when he established LAN  [Chilean National Airline], the Main Hangars, and the Chilean  Air Club, long before founding the FACh. The development of  aeronautics is intertwined with the economic development of the  nation. We canot expect to have the kind of air force developed  countries have because there are priorities which have to do  with social needs that must be taken care of. Within these  limitations the FACh has an excellent professional team of  outstanding potential in terms of human resources which are  scientifically trained and know their job inside out. Within  this context the FACh is technically and professionally a first  class organization.    [Oyarzun] Was the Hunter plane purchased in 1968 later  modified in Chile?    [Vega] Yes, it has been modified. We added several systems  which made this plane more versatile and gave it some  capabilities it did not have before. This plane was used to  train more than half of the FACh personnel.    [Oyarzun] What is the current status of the National  Aeronautical Enterprise (Enaer)?    [Vega] Enaer started operating under the military  government.  General Matthei [Fernando Matthei Aubel, former FACh commander]  was the driving force behind the establishment of a national  aeronautical industry. The initial steps were difficult because  the aeronautical industry is complex, dynamic and amazingly  prone to changes. This means that technicians, managers, and  workers must keep up with these changes. An air force cannot  remain in the past, it must be modern or else it is no air  force. The need for such fast changes and technology requires  excellent human resources because planes do not stay up in the  air through magic but because man wants them to. Planes pose  several requirements which means that those who operate them  must be up-to-date on the technology in their hands. Thus,  Enaer cannot stop working and neither can the very sophisticated  DTS [Desarrollo de Tecnologias y Sistemas Limitada --  Technologies and Systems Development Ltd.] company specialized  in avionics. All this means that we have to have a plane which  will be more or less up-to-date bearing in mind that our  technology cannot be similar to that of the United State or  other developed countries, but in keeping with national  priorities.    [Oyarzun] It has always been said that the Air Force is in  the third place after the Army and the Navy. In today's wars  which is more important, the Army, the Navy, or the Air Force?    [Vega] All three branches must be tightly coordinated and  act  in unison. The three are interdependent. This means that the  three braches must develop at the same rate and plan along the  same lines. The Armed Forces are a system whose subsystems must  all have the same quality.    [Oyarzun] United?    [Vega] Total coordination and unity is essential. That is  how Chile's Armed Forces do things.    [Oyarzun] Have they always been united?    [Vega] Always. The Army and the Navy gave the Air Force its  start. We inherited the ranking system, discipline and uniforms  from the Army. The star on the tail of our planes is the Navy  star and the shield on the wings of our planes is the Navy  shield. The Air Force has been fully integrated with the other  branches of service from the very beginning. As of 1930 the  FACh began moving toward autonomy because the technology,  strategy, and doctrine applicable to this branch of service are  different and so is the approach to the building up of  capability.    [Oyarzun] All this costs money...    [Vega] Every action or movement in life has a cost. I  believe that the point is knowing how to establish priorities  for spending and how to direct the funds available to the  fulfillment of objectives that can help each institution carry  out its mission. There will never be enough funds and there will  always be more needs than resources available, even in the U.S.  Air Force.    [Oyarzun] There are politicians who believe that the Armed  Forces budget should be cut because "no military conflicts are  expected" in the short or medium term, and because from looking  at the overall international scenario, the phantom of war seems  to be fading away. Do you agree with them?    [Vega] Your question is very interesting. I do not reject  outright any opinion, but one does not build an air force from  one day to another. It takes years to build up operational  effectiveness, train technicians, develop the infrastructure and  the quality which is necessary to operate sophisticated  materiel. An air force cannot become obsolete, it should either  be maintained up-to-date or disappear. If it is no longer there  one day, there is no room for improvisation. It takes years to  train workers, pilots, mechanics, technicians, and to set up the  logistic support for the highly sophisticated systems that an  air force operates nowadays. There may be no conflict in sight,  but no one can say for sure what will happen tomorrow. We have  dramatic examples of what could happen. Perhaps a huge  ideological east-west conflict is no longer likely, but regional  conflicts are certainly possible.    [Oyarzun] Why do you say so?    [Vega] Because whenever regional interests are at stake  there  could be conflicts. We can see it in Yugoslavia and in many  other parts of the world where they may be latent -- whether  valid or not it is not for me to say -- but sometimes lead to  the use of force. I would not like this to happen in our region.  I believe that we have taken the course of reasonable regional  understanding and the Latin American countries have taken an  unprecedented approach.    I agree that there is a new approach to development methods  which does not necessarily mean that there are no conflicts. It  is impossible to prepare for conflicts from one day to another  and it is the responsibility of the Air Force leadership to  prepare the branch as best they can with the funds available for  this. [passage omitted]    [Oyarzun] Did the FACh contribute to Chile's development  during the military government?    [Vega] I believe that it is not easy to quantify the  results,  but undoubtedly Chile is a very modern country, one that has  prestige both domestically and abroad. This all began after  1973.    [Oyarzun] Some people claim that the Armed Forces did not do  enough for national reconciliation during President Patricio  Aylwin's administration. What do you think?    [Vega] I do not engage in political discussions, all I can  do  is voice an opinion. Chile is moving along amid widespread  reconciliation. I have reached this conclusion on the basis of  the opinions of politicians of different leanings and the  motivation with which Chile is working and developing.    [Oyarzun] The Eighth International Airspace Fair [Fidae]  opened on the occasion of the 64th anniversary of the FACh. Is  there anything that sets this year's Fidae apart from those of  preceding years?    [Vega] Just as Chile as a whole, the Fidae has experienced  spectacular growth. Since technologically speaking our country  is far behind the highly developed nations, the FACh is making a  great effort to bring some of this technology down here. Not  everyone around here can get a close look at high technology.  The Fidae allows us to bring this technology to Chile.    [Oyarzun] Why do so many foreigners attend the Fidae?    [Vega] Because Chile's current image is excellent. It is a  developing country clearly on its way up, and capable of  becoming a developed country in the short term. There is no  show like this anywhere else in South America, and I believe  that it offers an excellent opportunity to display all the  aeronautic technology available. I do not mean just planes and  arms. The Fidae's strong point is that it displayes everything  that has to do with aeronautic technology. All countries need a  meeting place and this is an attractive one.    [Oyarzun] What does Fidae show?    [Vega] Aerospace technology.    [Oyarzun] What does this technology include?    [Vega] We would like to have a complete array of space  technology items. It has not been easy but there are some  interesting things. Russia is participating for the first time.    [Oyarzun] What can Russia contribute at this point?    [Vega] The Russian Academy of Sciences is the oldest in the  world. Their level of development in rocketry, satellites,  communications and aeronautic technology is very high.    [Oyarzun] Haven't they become obsolete?    [Vega] Russia has had a temporary setback, but I believe  that  their scientific potential is still there. They will have to  streamline their production systems and their companies after  the drastic changes they have undergone. They will have to find  new ways to produce goods, that is not an easy task. They will  have to redesign a number of systems taking into account new  economic and production conditions, but I believe that they will  find their way. The Fidae is an important meeting; 400 companies  and 36 countries are participating. [passage omitted]    [Oyarzun] How did the Air Force fare during the four years  after the end of the military government? I am asking this  question because you seem to have managed to keep out of the  conflicts...    [Vega] It is not that I do not want to answer your questions  on politics; it is simply not appropriate for me to do so. I  love my fatherland, and I have tried to serve it from this  position that has been entrusted to me. I never expected to  become the Air Force commander in chief. As a Chilean citizen I  believe that this has been an extraordinary stage in Chilean  history. It has been very positive, with pros and cons as any  endeavor is bound to have. In any conflict among human beings  each one tries to make his own legitimate interests prevail.  Overall, Chile has moved steadily, calmly, and confidently  forward on the wings of an exceptional development.    [Oyarzun] What do you expect from the newly installed  administration?    [Vega] I do not believe that there will be any substantial  changes. Steps will be taken to improve this positive  development of ours. We have set a very stable course and all  Chileans -- regardless of their political and personal interests  -- are making a significant contribution to the nation's  development.    [Oyarzun] What is the status of the FACh on its 64th  anniversary?    [Vega] Good. It is surprising how many people join the FACh  because of their inclinations! The results of this year's draft  were very good. I admire the energy and knowledge that the new  generations have.    [Oyarzun] A person who joins the Air Force knows that he  will  make less than he could as an independent professional in  private business. What prompts people to join?    [Vega] Not all human beings aim at material achievements.  Many people join the FACh because they have a calling, and they  follow their instincts. The people who join the FACh do so  because they have a calling, like the people who get involved in  arts.    [Oyarzun] What effect will the Chilean Copper Corporation's  [Codelco] loss of $206 million have on the FACh?    [Vega] It will have no effect on us this year, next year I  do  not know how much it will impact on our budget. We have a  budget established by law and we operate within the framework of  this budget. We streamline and rearrange our priorities in  order to do our yearly programming... Institutionally speaking  I would say that Codelco's loss will have no effect on us.    [Oyarzun] It is not like you can spare the money...    [Vega] One never has money to spare, especially in the case  of small air forces like ours. Our budgets have been cut and  are relatively small for the kind of technology we are operating  with.

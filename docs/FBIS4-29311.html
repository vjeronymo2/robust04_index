			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dangerous Nuclear Design" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Foreign  Minister, Koji Kakizawa, recently said "in view of the actual  conditions of international politics, it is hard to state the  use of nuclear weapons is a total violation of the international  law," while the Japanese Government supported the super power's  doctrine of "nuclear deterrent," contending that "it is  impossible to deny even the nuclear deterrent by totally denying  nuclear weapons."    NODONG SINMUN today says this shows that what Japan seeks in  accelerating nuclear armament is, in the long run, to use  nuclear weapons as a means of realising its dominationist  ambition.    It is a very grave development that the Japanese Government  says "yes" to the use of nuclear weapons, the analyst says, and  continues:    This sounds a note of warning that if Japan's nuclear  armament were not checked, it would bring a serious disaster to  mankind.    In actuality, the Japanese Government has stockpiled a large  quantity of plutonium, seeking to convert Japan into a nuclear  power. It launched even a space rocket capable of delivering  nuclear warheads. This bespeaks that all the regions of the  world are within Japan's nuclear range.    Japan, which is seeking the repetition of its past policy of  aggression, will make no scruple of plunging the Asian people  into a nuclear disaster for the purpose of conquering Asia and  restoring its old colonial empire.    If the Japanese reactionaries, captive to reinvasion  ambition, think that they will get scotfree after using nuclear  weapons, it is a mistake.    Japan's nuclear armament and use of nuclear weapons will  drive it to destruction.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas did not  confirm the law on the declaration of property by civil servants  and sent it back to the Seimas for a second round of debates.    According to the president, some articles of the law run  counter to the clauses of the Constitution which declare general  equality before the law and inviolability of private property.    Everybody understands that this law is needed. However, it  is absolutely not necessary to carry it too far and violate the  Constitution, Brazauskas said at a news conference this morning.  According to him the law was adopted in certain psychological  circumstances.    The provisional law on the declaration of income and  property  by civil servants and [word indistinct] was adopted 23 December  on the initiative of and great pressure from the rightwing  opposition. According to the law, civil servants and office  workers must supply information about property which is in their  possession until 1 February, 1994. Furthermore, the information  must be supplied by 1 May this year. Information concerning the  purchase of property in 1994 must be supplied by 1 March, 1995.    According to the president, a number of office duties  specified in the law which are subject to the declaration of  property violate the constitutional concept about general  equality before the law.    According to the president, the seizure of undeclared  property envisioned by law is anticonstitutional.    Mr. Brazauskas pointed out that a package of laws on  taxation  which also includes the law on general declaration of property  is currently being prepared. According to him after this law  has been adopted then it will be possible to speak about the  declaration of property by individual persons.    The president also said that he personally is ready today to  declare his property and his income.</p>

Nevada and  other states support public gambling. Every day we are cajoled into betting on  "Sweepstakes" for the gain of magazine companies and other respected businesses  -- and now betting on races by satellite!  </P> <P> Pete Rose is paying a penalty for assumed gambling on baseball.  </P> <P> Am I the only one who questions this double standard?  </P> <P> HELEN M.

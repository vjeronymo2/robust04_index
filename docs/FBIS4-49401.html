			<p>BFN     [Text] As of today, a five-day "Canada Week" is being  observed simultaneously in the Guangdong cities of Guangzhou,  Shenzhen, and Zhuhai.    This morning, accompanied by Vice Governor Zhong Qiquan,  Canadian Governor-General Ramon John Hnatyshyn, who had arrived  in Guangzhou especially to observe the "Canada Week," attended a  symposium in Guangzhou on the development of relations between  Canada and the Zhujiang Delta, as well as a ribbon-cutting  ceremony marking the official commissioning of Guangdong's block  code exchange system.    At the symposium on developing Canada-Zhujiang Delta  relations, Hnatyshyn warmly praised the friendly relations  between Canada and Guangdong, saying that a large number of  Canadian Chinese who are natives of Guangdong Province have made  enormous contributions to the development of Canada's highways  and telecommunications, as well as its minerals prospecting.    The Canadian governor-general expressed his hope that Canada  and Guangdong will take steps to strengthen academic exchanges  so as to enhance mutual understanding and lay a solid foundation  for continued cultural and economic exchanges.    Guangdong's block code exchange system was built with  Canadian loans and with technology provided by Canada's North  Electric Power Corporation.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A SQUEEZE in stock index futures sent the near month contract sharply ahead in thin trading, writes Joel Kibazo. But for an early sell order which caused the decline of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 from its opening of 2,854 to 2,846, it moved steadily ahead, pulling the underlying equity market higher. The strong demand for the contract meant that June maintained a steady premium of around 10 points for most of the session, although actual dealing remained very low. It reached the day's high of 2,870 in the last hour of trading and finished at 2,864, up 15 from its previous close and around 6 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 5 points. Turnover at the official close was a mere 4,557 lots, although that total was boosted in after-hours' trading. Volume in traded options was also poor. The day's total came to 24,332 contracts, against Friday's 27,986, and the total included 4,175 lots dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. BT, which was also busy in the underlying equities, attracted a resurgence of strong support in the traded options after news of the group's move into satellite dish retailing. It was the busiest option with a total of 4,566 lots dealt, and the 420 puts were the busiest series. It was followed by Hanson with 1,971 contracts traded, and the Euro FT-SE 100 option with 1,693.</p>

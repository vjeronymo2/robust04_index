			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Zimbabwe's hopes of equality have yet to take root: Alison Maitland finds the gap between white farmer and black smallholder as wide as ever after 15 years of independence In Zimbabwe there is a saying: where you see a Mopane tree, there is no water. Mopane trees are plentiful in Masvingo province, in the semi-arid southern half of the country. Maize seedlings planted in small neat rows wilt in heat of more than 40 degrees and the few scrawny cattle feed on scrub as villagers wait for the next rains. Here the population is still suffering the effects of the worst drought in more than 100 years. Some 60 per cent of Masvingo's oxen died in the 1992 drought. The poorest families, often headed by women, have less than two hectares of land and no irrigation. Three hours' drive further north, in the rich, mainly white-owned commercial farmlands around Harare, a healthy crop of young maize flourishes under water sprinklers. Flowers and vegetables for export grow in greenhouses where plentiful irrigation is funded out of earnings from tobacco plantations extending over thousands of hectares. Fifteen years after independence, the gap between Zimbabwe's commercial farms and its poor rural smallholdings is as wide as ever, made bigger by drought and economic reforms. During the colonial period, the best land was reserved for whites while blacks were concentrated in 'tribal trust lands' - now known as communal areas - which are home to half the population. Some 74 per cent of communal area farms lie in the two poorest 'natural regions', where annual rainfall is 60cm (24in) or less. By contrast, 4,800 predominantly white commercial farmers own or operate 59 per cent of the land in the regions with the highest rainfall - and nearly 84 per cent of all irrigated land. This means that in a country normally self-sufficient in maize, the staple food, 420,000 rural households still cannot be sure of producing enough to eat. Government agricultural strategy in the post-independence 1980s was designed to change this, but yielded disappointing results, according to the World Bank. Yield improvements, greater crop plantings and better marketing produced sharp increases in output of cotton and maize. But agricultural growth did not extend much beyond the commercial sector and the top 10 per cent of smallholders. 'The bulk of Zimbabwe's rural population has participated minimally in the expansion of national output of food and cash crops,' it says. The government has lifted most state marketing controls on agricultural commodities as part of the structural adjustment programme begun in 1991. But this has benefited the well positioned commercial sector most, while smallholders have lost out in the parallel squeeze on public services. Land reforms, under which 57,000 households have been resettled on land formerly belonging to commercial farmers, also failed to deliver the desired results, largely because restricted tenure and capital have prevented the beneficiaries from taking a long-term stake in their farms, the bank believes. Land redistribution remains a political football, especially with elections approaching next year. But not all black Zimbabweans are eager to force white farmers off the land. 'The commercial farms do the country a lot of good,' said one. 'The farmers have experience, producing food on a large scale and employing a lot of people.' Instead, smallholders plead for fair treatment. Solutions appear simple. By having an animal to plough, a smallholder can treble the amount of land tilled to as much as 3.5ha. But delivering is easier said than done in the current economic climate. For the past two years, 41 farmers in the village of Binda, 115km south-west of Harare, have benefited from a credit scheme backed by the International Fund for Agricultural Development, a UN organisation. As a group, they were able to borrow to buy fertiliser, seed and oxen to recover from the drought. They are the envy of other villagers. But while the fund provides the government with soft loans at 0.75 per cent interest, the farmers are still at the mercy of exorbitant domestic rates as the money is on-loaned through the agricultural credit system. They had to pay 23.5 per cent on their annual loan this year - well below commercial rates but still too high to borrow for the tractor that would transform their lives. The World Bank and donor agencies urge greater targeting of public agricultural services at smallholders, making credit more available and encouraging community-based irrigation schemes. The bank argues that long-term leases on land, or even grants towards land purchase, would encourage smallholders in resettlement areas to farm commercially - especially if they could produce under contract to private sector farmers or agri-businesses. Other solutions involve diversification. Many small farmers already weave or crochet, carve wood and soapstone figures for tourists, or participate in wildlife management schemes to supplement their incomes. The fast growing horticulture sector offers opportunities to smallholders where there is irrigation: about 200 are involved in three export projects producing tomatoes for paste and fruit for canning under contract to commercial farms. Where there is no water, trials are taking place of drought-resistant varieties of maize, and of the tougher staple crops, sorghum and millet. Lack of expertise, capital and transportation remain huge barriers. But the need for change is widely recognised as urgent. 'The real poor are not getting anywhere,' said one white farmer. 'We do have a conscience. It's not nice living in a place where the gap is not going to narrow.'</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean gold mine to close CHOQUILIMPIE, Chile's third largest gold mine, will be closed down at the end of the year as it has run out of reserves of gold oxides. The operators say, however, that they will attempt to extend the life of the mine with a project to extract the more difficult gold sulphides. The pioneer high-altitude mine, located in the Andes close to the Bolivian border, is owned by Royal Dutch/Shell's Billiton, Northgate Exploration and Citibank. It began production in mid-1988 and produced 100,000 ounces of gold a year between 1989 and 1991 - a tenth of Chile's total output. But further exploration failed to uncover new oxide reserves and production is set to fall to 65,000 ounces this year. Choquilimpie was refused permission to continue prospecting in surrounding areas, as the mine is located in the middle of a nature reserve. Mr Jorge Chamy, Choquilimpie's general manager, said extraction of gold oxides would come to a halt at the end of the year because the current low world prices for gold made the operation unprofitable. However, he said the owners were studying new alternatives to keep their Dollars 32.7m investment alive, including the mining of gold sulphides.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Shalikashvili-Gligorov Meeting"] </F>   [Text] Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] President Kiro Gligorov received yesterday  U.S. Chief of Joint Staff General John Shalikashvili. The  meeting was also attended by Foreign Minister Crvenkovski and  Defense Minister Popovski. They expressed satisfaction with the  role of the U.S. contingent serving as members of UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] in Macedonia thus far, and discussed  replacing the Nordic contingent with another American unit.  They also exchanged ideas on the situation in the region and  President Gligorov stressed the importance of resolving the  Greek-Macedonian dispute, saying it could destabilize the south  of the Balkans. Gligorov again actualized Macedonia's request to  be included in the project "Partnership for Peace."    General Shalikashvili pointed out his country's interest in  a  stable Macedonia as an exceptionally significant factor of  stability in the Balkans. He also announced appointment of U.S.  Army representative to Macedonia in the near future.    General Shalikashvili also visited U.S. soldiers in  Macedonia  and patrol units on the Macedonian-Serbian border.</p>

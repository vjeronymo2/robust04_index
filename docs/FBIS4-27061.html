			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, June 29 (XINHUA) -- A large economic  region has sprung up in the middle part of northeast China's  Liaoning Province.    The region comprises eight large industrial cities, namely,  Shenyang, Anshan, Fushun, Liaoyang, Benxi, Dandong, Yingkou and  Tieling.    As early as 1985, the eight cities decided to set up a  cooperation region to give full play to their own advantages.    As a heavy industrial base of China, this region has sound  scientific and technological foundation and the most  concentrated railway network in the country. The  Shenyang-Dalian expressway links the region with the leading  port in northeast China.    By now, the industrial production value of this region has  amounted to 62 percent of the total of the province and the  heavy industrial production value to seven percent of the  country's total.    In the past ten years, the region has established 22  enterprise groups involving machinery, metallurgy and  environmental protection, and it set up a united market in 1992  in Shenyang, capital of the province.    The cooperation region not only helps the eight cities  supplement each other but also helps these cities to jointly  open the world market.    These cities have jointly held several trade talks and  strengthened trading with Japan and the Republic of Korea.</p>

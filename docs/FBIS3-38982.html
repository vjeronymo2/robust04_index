How Gerry Adams' </F> U.S. Visit Crippled the `Special Relationship'"]    [Text] It looked as though it was going to be a productive  holiday for Edward Kennedy. As his plane touched down at Dublin  airport for a Christmas break with his sister, the veteran  Democratic senator had a hunch he was about to achieve a  long-held ambition.    For years, Kennedy, brother of the assassinated president,  scion of the premier Irish-American family and prominent  supporter of a united Ireland, had lobbied to get a lasting  peace agreement. For years, successive Republican  administrations had refused to negotiate with terrorists or to  whisper a word against America's closest ally in this most  sensitive area of policy.    But now the whole political climate had changed. During the  previous month, it had emerged that the British government had  been in secret talks with the IRA over a possible ceasefire.  Then John Major and Albert Reynolds, the taoiseach [Irish prime  minister], announced their joint declaration, giving Sinn Fein  the chance of joining the peace process if the IRA stopped its  terrorist campaign.    Kennedy was convinced that he now had the ammunition to get  his way; he had a powerful ally in his sister. Jean Kennedy  Smith had been appointed American ambassador in Dublin in June  last year on her brother's recommendation; in that short time  she had made an impressive power play to control American policy  in the whole of Ireland, attempting to wrest control of policy  in Ulster from Ray Seitz, the American ambassador to London.    The Kennedys got to work, organising dinners with Reynolds,  Seamus Mallon, the deputy leader of the mainly Catholic Social  Democratic and Labour party (SDLP), and Brian Lenihan, the  former Irish foreign minister, at the taoiseach's house. Later  Kennedy met John Hume, the SDLP leader who had launched his own  peace initiative with Gerry Adams, the IRA's political front  man, and Mary Robinson, the Irish president.    By the time he headed home on January 2, Kennedy was well  satisfied that if he pushed for a visa for Gerry Adams, the  Irish govemment would not stand in his way -- he might even have  convinced himself that an Adams visit to America might help move  the stalled peace process forward.    As it turned out, the opposite happened. Adams's 48-hour  trip to America last week ended up as a humiliation for the  Kennedys, a publicity coup for the IRA and a public relations  disaster for the British government. It also crippled the  special relationship which the two nations had cherished for  half a century.    The first sign that Adams might be on his way to America  came  at the beginning of January, with a call to the British embassy  in Washington asking for Sinn Fein's fax number. It came from  the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a think-tank  run by an Irish-American businessman, Bill Flynn, which, unaware  of the Kennedy initiative, had decided to set up a conference in  New York to bring together all the political parties in Northern  Ireland. As the alarm bells rang in London, Belfast and  Washington, the Foreign Office contacted Kennedy's office and  asked if it knew about the conference. "There was complete  surprise," said a Foreign Office source. "They were upset as  they had not yet got their own plans ready and thought the  invitation had come too early."    But Kennedy was not one to waste an opportunity. His  lobbying had begun a month earlier, after President Clinton had  written to the then New York mayor, David Dinkins, saying Adams  would be denied a visa because of his "involvement in terrorist  activity." That was the eighth time Adams's visa application  had been turned down.    Kennedy mobilised his well-organised staff to set up an  assault on the administration. Forty Congressmen including  Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York signed a letter to  Clinton supporting the application. Kennedy himself spoke to a  number of senior officials and in particular sought out Nancy  Soderberg, his former foreign affairs aide, now number three in  the National Security Council (NSC).    In her late 30s, with the blond hair of her Swedish  ancestors, Soderberg is a strong backer of a united Ireland and  for years has been a point of contact between Kennedy and  supporters in Northern Ireland. Her appointment to the NSC was  in part a payoff to Kennedy for his support during the  presidential campaign.    In September, four prominent Irish Americans had visited  Northern Ireland and met Adams. They returned convinced that an  earlier administration proposal for a Clinton peace envoy to  visit the province would not work. Instead, they thought they  could persuade Clinton to grant Adams a visa. They met  Soderberg, who agreed to support the application. That time she  was overruled by the president. This time, she was determined  to make it happen.    Initial soundings by the Foreign Office suggested that the  Americans' usual opposition to the visa request would hold  solid. American intelligence had access not only to Adams's  record of terrorism but also to the current British assessment  of his influence on the IRA army council, where he is one of  seven members.    More recently, offlcials at the American embassy in London  had visited Belfast and been briefed by British intelligence on  Adams's role in organising and ordering recent terrorist  attacks. The Americans were told that Adams would not accept  the peace proposals and had no intention of stopping the  violence. This view was accepted by the Americans and passed to  Washington.    "But there was a different tone this time," said a Foreign  Office official. "We had the peace proposals and the fact that  we had secretly been talking with the IRA. That gave the IRA's  allies (in America) some powerful levers and it was clear we  were going to have a fight on our hands."    Sir Robin Renwick, the mild-mannered yet tough British  ambassador to Washington, had been preparing for such a  confrontation ever since he arrived three years earlier. He  came from the turmoil of South Africa to steer the  Anglo-American relationship through what was to become the rocky  road of the Clinton administration. A formidable operator with  a dry sense of humour, he had assiduously courted senior  administration officials and his dinner parties had achieved  legendary status for the range and distinction of their guests.    Last month, he hosted a dinner in honour of Michael Howard,  the home secretary, to which he also invited Louis Freeh, the  director of the FBI, and Janet Reno, the attorney general. In  his after-dinner toast, Renwick stressed the role America had  played in countering IRA terrorism, a message later underlined  by Howard. In reply, Reno promised that the support would  continue.    Now it was time for Renwick to cash in some of those chips.  In the course of four days, he contacted Reno, Freeh, Sandy  Berger, the deputy national security adviser, and Peter Tarnoff,  the undersecretary for political affairs at the State  Department. Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, called Warren  Christopher, his counterpart in the State Department. All  assured the British officials of their full support: Adams would  not come.    The one holdout was Tony Lake, Clinton's national security  adviser, who was unconvinced when called by Renwick. The  position of national security adviser is traditionally held by a  man with strong views on foreign policy. But Lake has proved  the exception to this. He has emerged as a conciliator between  different departments, a man, like the president himself, who  searches for the middle ground. For months he had been  criticised for his weak leadership and many of his staff had  become thoroughly demoralised. Renwick was unable to get a firm  commitment from Lake.    At the same time, lobbying by Kennedy, Ray Flynn, the former  mayor of Boston and now the Vatican ambassador, Soderberg and  Jean Kennedy Smith was beginning to pay off. Kennedy had made  clear that if Clinton wanted his vital support on health care  and welfare reform, the visa would have to be issued. In an  administration obsessed by domestic policy, health care clearly  mattered more than upsetting America's oldest and most faithful  ally.    In cables to Washington, Kennedy Smith said that an Adams  visit would help the peace process. She also said that the  Irish government was strongly in favour of a visa being granted.  This stretched the truth, as Reynolds was largely neutral on  the matter and Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, assured  the British that there was no active campaign by the Dublin  government to get the visa. George Stephanopoulos, Clinton's  closest adviser, saw the issue as a simple calculation between  the president's need to keep Congress happy and the marginal  concerns of a British government to which they owed no favours.    The British government's actions during the presidential  campaign still rankled strongly with Clinton. It was bad enough  that Conservative Central Office had sent over two officials to  advise President Bush on the best tactics to win. But Clinton  was particularly peeved that the government had also launched a  search of Home Office files to check for evidence of his  activities while a student at Oxford and whether he had ever  sought British nationality to evade being drafted for the  Vietnam war. Such evidence would have sunk the Clinton campaign  -- it was not something he was going to forgive lightly.    The coolness showed when Clinton travelled to Europe for the  Nato summit on January 10. Major saw the opportunity to press  his case against Adams being allowed into America and officials  from the Foreign Office began to push for a bilateral meeting  between the two leaders. But it was a measure of the state of  relations between the countries that this was not automatically  granted. Instead, at the last minute and sandwiched between  other meetings, a grudging 10 minutes was given to Major.  Clinton listened to the case but, to the prime minister's  disappointment, made no promises.    In Washington, some administration officials argued to  Clinton that by letting Adams in, he would play a key part in  securing peace in Northern Ireland. The president had just  returned from a successful trip where he had met President  al-Asad, of Syria, to discuss peace. He had also brokered the  famous handshake on the White House lawn between Yasir 'Arafat  and Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister.    By January 26, it was clear that the White House was not  going to be deterred from granting Adams a visa and so the  Foreign Office agreed a compromise. Adams would be asked:  Would he personally renounce violence and work to end violence  in Northern Ireland? Would the IRA and Sinn Fein work for peace  on the basis of the proposals evolved by Major and Reynolds?  The British knew that if Adams answered either question  positively it would be a big step forward. He had never  renounced all violence and had refused to sign up to the peace  proposals with unspecified "clarifications." London was  confident that he had been cleverly boxed in.    On Friday, January 28, Adams was summoned to the American  consulate in Queen Street, Belfast, for a 90-minute meeting with  Valentino Martinez, the consul-general. Faced with the  questions, the Sinn Fein leader replied: "If I accept those, I  might as well retire to the mountains." Martinez pressed Adams,  but he refused to either condemn all violence or accept the  peace proposals. In a cable to Washington that afternoon,  Martinez firmly recommended denying the visa.    But immediately after he left the consulate, Adams gave an  interview to NBC news in which he said that he did indeed  condemn violent attacks on innocent civilians and that the peace  proposals were a useful framework. It was this form of words,  rather than those given to Martinez, that was relayed by  Soderberg to senior officials in Washington later that day.    The British embassy received a copy and was asked for its  comments. It pointed out that nothing Adams had said was new  and that he had very specifically not accepted the two questions  that had been put to him by Martinez.    A further wrinkle to the drama was added on Friday afternoon  when three disarmed grenades were found in San Diego. The  southern California branch of the Provisional IRA claimed  responsibility and warned that more would follow if Adams were  not granted a visa.    News of the spoof attack caused near-panic in the  administration, where there were absurd visions of a full-scale  campaign against targets in America. But officials also  recognised that if a visa were granted under such a threat, then  Clinton would be seen as a weak leader who had caved in to  blackmail.    Fearing that the fight was about to be lost, an  administration official contacted Adams to alert him to the  problem. He had heard nothing about the dummy bombs, which had  received no publicity, apan from a brief mention in the local  San Diego paper. Adams was only too happy to condemn an attack  he knew nothing about if it would save his visa application.  So, once again, Soderberg was able to produce "evidence" that  Adams was on the side of the angels.    Last Sunday morning, in the Oval office, Clinton held a  meeting with his senior foreign policy advisers. In a heated  exchange, Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, continued  to oppose the visa, while Lake thought Adams should be allowed  in. The NSC argued that Adams had complied with all the  conditions the Americans had set. Although Christopher still  opposed the visa, he was under the impression, because of that  NBC interview, that Adams had indeed renounced violence, a lie  skillfully propagated by the NSC.    It was on the basis of this deceit that Clinton went ahead  and authorised the visa. Adams would be allowed into America  for 48 hours, prevented from fundraising and ordered to stay  within 25 miles of New York. Naively, it was believed these  restrictions would restrain the media circus that the British  had warned the Americans was certain to be unleashed.    Within minutes, news of the decision had leaked -- the White  House believes from the NSC -- and it was running on the wires  by Sunday afternoon. To the fury of the British embassy,  officials heard about the decision not from the administration  but from the media. It was the start of a week that was going  to convince some British officials that the administration was  run by naive incompetents who had little or no understanding of  foreign policy in general and Irish politics in particular, and  cared little about tossing the special relationship overboard.    With his dark suit, carefully combed hair, manicured teeth,  white shirt and conservative tie, Adams arrived at Kennedy  airport to be treated not as a visiting terrorist but as a  conquering hero.    For the next two days the American press indulged in a  sycophantic orgy of coverage, allowing Adams free rein with his  Goebbels-like propaganda spree. There was scant mention of the  IRA, of which he is in charge, or the death toll of innocent  people, for which he is responsible. The Irish novelist Edna  O'Brien described Adams in one American paper as "thoughtful and  reserved, a lithe, handsome man.... Given a different  incarnation in a different century, one could imagine him as one  of those monks transcribing the gospel into Gaelic."    At each stop, his message was the same and little different  from the language he used back home. "The largest military  presence in the north of Ireland is the British army followed by  the allies of the loyalists and then the IRA. I want to see  them all disarmed."    To the British, this was little more than Orwellian  doublespeak, at which Adams had become a master. American  journalists could not grasp that when Adams spoke of peace, he  meant surrender by his enemies. He was winning the propaganda  battle and the British appeared helpless to do anything about  it. By coincidence, Douglas Hurd was in America to visit  officials in New York and Washington. There is, rightly, a  standing policy that government ministers do not appear on the  same programme as terrorists. But instead of finding other ways  to put the truth about Adams across, Hurd showed almost a  patrician disdain for becoming involved in the debate. At a  press conference he said he did not want to answer questions  about Adams, thereby missing the chance of a robust attack on  Adams. Nor did the British authorities put up a tough official  critic to counter Adams's carefully chosen yet meaningless  phrases about peace.    Adams had decided to pack as many appearances as possible  into his brief visit and each one was carefully selected to  reach the maximum audience, preferably with a "soft" interviewer  like Larry King on CNN. He was driven from one studio to  another with an entourage of bodyguards. No matter that his  chauffeur was a convicted IRA bomber who had entered America  illegally and been granted political asylum, the media lapped up  his every word. At each appearance, the soft-spoken Adams  preached the same message: it was the British government and not  Sinn Fein that was the real obstacle to peace.    As the extent of the coverage emerged, it began to dawn on  the White House that it had blundered and a disaster was  unfolding. "They were warned what would happen but they honestly  believed nobody would pay any attention to the visit," said one  British official. "That may be hard to understand but it is  true and a measure of just how ignorant the officials are."    Here was Adams, making speech after speech, but there was  none of the public commitment to stop all violence that Kennedy  and his allies had been promising. There was nothing, either,  about accepting the terms of the peace accords agreed last  December.    With rising alarm, both the White House and the NSC made  calls to Kennedy, insisting that Adams had to make a positive  statement that could be presented as some kind of breakthrough.  First, the reply came that Adams would renounce all violence  before he left. Then he was going to announce a three-month  ceasefire during his speech at the conference on Tuesday.  Finally, Adams promised a dramatic announcement before he took  the aircraft home on Wednesday. As each opportunity passed with  another promise broken, the administration began to understand  it had been duped.    When Hurd went to see vice-president Al Gore on Tuesday he  brought with him the headiines from the British papers which had  been united in their condemnation of the visit and of the  Clinton administration. Gore, who had favoured the Adams visit,  was shocked and immediately issued a statement which called on  the Sinn Fein leader to accept the framework of the  Major-Reynolds peace proposals. Later that day, the president  backed that line and announced that any idea of sending a peace  envoy to Northern Ireland had been dropped.    "Part of the incompetence is that the administration had no  idea what the impact of the visit would be," said one Foreign  Office official. "To puncture your relations with your closest  ally and not realise you are doing so is quite a spectacular  feat."    As he headed back to Ireland on Wednesday, Adams promised  that he would be looking at the peace process "in a more  concrete way." The phrasing ofthis statement was designed to  appease his American supporters and act as the important  statement he had promised Ted Kennedy. In fact, he achieved  neither.    To Clinton and the Adams supporters in the administration,  the visit was a profound disappointment. Instead of the  breakthrough they wanted, Adams, the consummate political  operator, made fools of all of them by promising everything and  delivering nothing.    Officials spent the end of the week running for cover.  Gore's office leaked that the trip was nothing to do with him;  the State Department made clear that it was all the NSC's fault;  while Soderberg was nowhere to be seen. "There is a smell of  burned fingers around town," said one senior British official.    As usual, it was a glittering occasion when Robin Renwick  hosted a dinner party last Thursday in honour of Lady Thatcher,  who was visiting America to be enrolled as chancellor of William  and Mary College. The guest list was a distinguished one, with  Dick Cheney, the former defence secretary, Bob Gates, the former  head of the CIA, Brent Scowcroft, the former national security  adviser, and other senior officials from previous Republican  administrations.    The talk was all of how things used to be, when Britain and  America stood shoulder to shoulder against the Soviet Union. It  was a paean to a bygone era which the British government would  like to think will return, but most now accept has gone, perhaps  forever.    To Thatcher, the visit had a particular piquancy. The next  night she gave the toast at a dinner to celebrate the 83rd  birthday of Ronald Reagan. Over a decade, the two had forged an  extraordinary friendship that had brought Britain and America  closer together than at any time since the second world war and  had played a crucial role in bringing the cold war to an end.    Friends were quick to point out that Thatcher would never  have allowed the Adams visa to have been issued without picking  up the phone and calling "Ron" to demand a hearing. It is  striking that Major failed to do that, recognising perhaps that  he would be rebuffed. His only recourse was to call in Seitz,  the ambassador, to remonstrate with him over American policy.  It was, as The New York Times commented, "a diplomatic demarche  virtually unknown in recent memory."    While last week's fiasco over Adams may have been the symbol  that finally laid to rest the special relationship, the  destruction of its foundations began the day Thatcher was  toppled from power. It was undermined still further when  Clinton entered the White House a year ago.    Although the 47-year-old president had been a Rhodes Scholar  at Oxford, he has no particular fondness for Britain. Other  "Rhodies" around him, including Stephanopoulos and Strobe  Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, regale friends with  stories of the slights they received as "Yanks at Oxford."    Culturally, too, Washington has begun a divorce from London.  The generation in power today is the first to have no  representatives who fought alongside the British in war. This  is also a generation to whom Europe, and particularly Britain,  are seen as a kind of cultural theme park that has been left  behind by the economic tide. Brought up without the "baggage of  history," their eyes are focused instead on the American economy  and domestic affairs.    As a result, their gaze, when it is lifted from the  minutiae of health and welfare reforms, looks in only one  direction: to the Pacific Rim. They believe that America can  only boost its recovery and secure its long-term economic future  by focusing on the Pacific "tigers" which are bounding ahead in  economic growth. This new America wants a slice of the action  and looks hungrily at markets in the vast economy of Japan a  booming China and South korea.    Clinton and his advisers believe these markets were largely  ignored by Reagan and Bush and are determined not to repeat the  mistake. Today, the Pacific Rim contains almost half the  world's GNP, $120 billion of American exports, keeps 2.3 million  Americans in jobs, is three times America's trade with Latin  America and accounts for 50 percent more trade than America has  with West Europe.    To underline this shift in policy, Clinton hosted a summit  in  Seattle last November of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  forum designed to find new ways to develop an economic and  security relationship among the 14 members. There is even talk  that Nafta, which brings together the United States, Canada and  Mexico in a trade pact, could be extended across the Pacific to  some of these countries, creating a formidable rival to the  European Community.    Normally, the United States is careful to play down these  realities so as not to alarm its European allies, but in a  significant statement last year Christopher admitted that "West  Europe is no longer the dominant area of the world." Stung by  European criticism, he is now more diplomatic, saying that  America is seeking only a "new balance" in its relations with  Europe and Asia.    It has been hard for British officials to adjust to the  change. Both Reagan and Bush were on the phone every week to  Thatcher when she was prime minister, discussing all aspects of  world affairs and allowing Britain to "punch well above its  weight." But her departure meant a subtle Atlantic sea change:  suddenly Britain was run by a grey figure who lacked the iron  lady's chutzpah.    That change was abruptly and rudely reinforced by Clinton.  Here was a new president intent on not allowing his domestic  policy-- which won him the election and may secure a second  term--being sidelined by foreign affairs unless it could boost  his standing and that of the American economy.    Britain, as part of a self-preoccupied continent in  recession, barely "featured on his radar screen." Acutely aware  of the Tories' role in trying to disrupt his campaign, he also  personally had no fondness for Britain or its leader. His  relationship with Major is at best "respectful but not close."  At worst, according to one White House aide, "it is lousy. He  doesn't like Major and never thinks of asking his views." He  also knows the prime minister is in political trouble, and this  in turns further weakens his international standing.    The contacts are now strictly rationed, with barely a  monthly  phone conversation between the two leaders. In one celebrated  incident, Major rang the president to congratulate him on the  signing of the Nafta agreement. Clinton was "unavailable" and  did not bother to ring back until three days later.    Bosnia has served all too clearly to expose the rifts.  America wants bombing raids on Serbian forces and the lifting  of an arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims, policies that have  been opposed by Britain. Here, too, Clinton has succeeded in  humiliating Major: in talks last year Clinton made an  embarrassing aside about how Major had privately confessed that  he could not support lifting the arms embargo because his  government might fall; it was hardly the stuff of a special  relationship.    In truth, when he does turn his mind to foreign affairs,  Clinton concentrates on Asia. His policy in Europe is to keep  out of trouble and hope Russia does not explode. The only two  leaders he is comfortable with are Boris Yeltsin and Helmut  Kohl, with whom one diplomat wittily commented he shares the  same healthy appetite.    When Major comes to Washington to meet Clinton at the end of  this month, there will be much talk about Bosnia, Russia, trade,  the success of Gatt and so on. It is unlikely that they will  dwell too long on the Adams affair, but the scars will be  profound.    By the end of last week, a senior State Department official  dismissed the row as a mere "blip" in an enduring relationship.  That analysis is not shared by the British. Even experienced  diplomats talk derisively about the "incompetence" and "naivety"  of senior officials. Where once there was forgiveness for  mistakes in places like Somalia and Haiti, there is now a clear  judgment that this administration is both unprofessional and  dangerous.    Maybe the Americans will, as has happened in the past, find  their new friends far from reliable in a crisis, and come  running back to embrace sturdy, loyal Britain. According to  this fantasy--for that is all it is at present--once again the  telephone lines will start humming and the warmth will return to  melt the ice. But as one diplomat said last week, "I wouldn't  bet my last buck on it."</p>

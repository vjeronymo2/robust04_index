			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Rocard to overhaul Socialist party MR Michel Rocard yesterday promised an overhaul of France's Socialist party and launched an attack on the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, following his election as Socialist leader on Saturday. Mr Rocard, a former prime minister who has led the Socialist party since its crushing defeat in March's general election, won 80 per cent of the 587 votes cast in a secret ballot for the post of the party's first secretary. He called for a reorganisation of the party and a rethink of policies aimed at reviving support from voters. In his attack on Mr Balladur's centre-right government, Mr Rocard focused on its conduct of negotiations in the Uruguay Round of Gatt international trade talks. He said the government had acted irresponsibly and warned that failure to conclude an agreement with trading partners would have dramatic consequences. Mr Rocard also said he was willing to lead a list of Socialist party candidates in next year's elections for the European parliament. But he only would do so, he added, if women were given half the places on the list. Despite Mr Rocard's unopposed victory, however, the divisions within the party which have contributed to its electoral decline remained in evidence. More than 100 delegates to the weekend party congress cast blank ballots in the secret vote and there were 51 abstentions. The abstentions are believed to have included Mr Roland Dumas, former foreign minister and an ally of President Francois Mitterrand, who is an opponent of Mr Rocard. Mr Mitterrand sent a message to the congress stressing the importance of party unity but failing to endorse Mr Rocard. Mr Rocard defeated Mr Laurent Fabius, Mr Mitterrand's protege, in the leadership struggle following the collapse of the Socialist vote in the March elections. The Socialists won just 54 parliamentary seats, compared with the 252 they held before being forced out of office. Both Mr Rocard and Mr Fabius lag behind Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, in opinion polls forecasting support in next year's French presidential elections. Mr Delors, who has declined to comment on the presidential elections, appears in polls as the only Socialist able to defeat right-wing candidates in the elections.</p>

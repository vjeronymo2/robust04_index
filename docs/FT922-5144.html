			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Swiss business opens its doors to the world / A look at rapidly changing attitudes among the country's company directors SCARCELY an eyebrow was raised in Swiss business circles when Ascom, the telecommunications equipment group, revealed last week that a majority of its capital was held by non-Swiss. And the group's announcement that it proposed appointing a German and an American to its board of directors drew only muted reaction. A few years ago, such developments would have provoked shock and dismay in Switzerland's introverted business community. With a mercantile culture uncannily similar to Japan's, Swiss industry thrived for a long time by attacking markets all over the world while keeping most operations at home. Ownership and top management posts remained exclusively in Swiss hands. In the past few years, however, top Swiss industrialists have recognised that being international now requires more than having sales offices abroad. And this year the pace of change has accelerated sharply. Among the big companies and banks, cases of exclusively Swiss boards of directors are now the exception rather than the rule. And many companies are actively encouraging foreign ownership of their shares. Swiss business leaders seem to be making these changes with their eyes open. 'Our responsibility is to run an international group called Sandoz, not to stick to our roots,' says Mr Rolf W. Schweizer, group vice-president responsible for strategic planning at the big Basle-based pharmaceutical group. Mr Schweizer says it was even possible that Sandoz would one day move its headquarters out of Switzerland, especially if some Swiss hostility to some types of pharmaceutical research continued. For now, what is noticeable is that Sandoz and other leading companies are aggressively building up operations abroad while just ticking over or cutting back in Switzerland. Nestle, which has hitherto concentrated its group management in Vevey, revealed recently that, in the wake of its takeover of Source Perrier, it would locate the headquarters of its mineral water operations in France. Sandoz is expanding drug production in Ireland and the US. The big Swiss banks have shifted large chunks of their capital market operations out of Switzerland to London and Luxembourg. The changed focus often shows up through big foreign acquisitions. The engineering group, Brown Boveri, led the way in 1987 with its huge merger with Asea of Sweden. Roche basically moved its biotechnology research effort from Basle to the US when it bought a controlling stake in Genentech two years ago. Schindler, the world's second largest lifts group, bought Westinghouse's lift business in 1989 and is now concentrating on building up its position in the east Asia. The big Swiss insurance companies, Zurich and Winterthur, have also been active on the foreign acquisition trail. Ascom made a strategic leap in the world corporate telecoms equipment sector by acquiring Timeplex in the US last year. The group, which a few years ago was largely dependent on the Swiss state posts and telecoms authority for its revenue, is aiming to make 70 per cent of its sales abroad by the end of the century. The reasons for these moves tend to be the same. Probably the most important is that the Swiss-skilled manpower pool is no longer sufficient for the needs of the international companies. This is particularly the case in high technology fields and the fast-moving financial specialities, such as the design and trading of derivatives. Yet companies and banks find it increasingly difficult at a time of rising unemployment to get permits for foreigners to live and work in Switzerland. In the past, Switzerland's neutrality and its laws providing solid protection of intellectual property were strong incentives to keep research, development and production inside the country, but these characteristics are no longer as unusual or important. The cozy Swiss capital markets, which used to be adequate for most companies' needs, are in decline and can no longer provide the large amounts of capital on the internationally competitive terms that big companies demand. Thus, they have had no choice but to open their share registers to foreigners and meet the tough disclosure requirements that international capital markets demand. As they do so, they risk running afoul of Switzerland's Lex Friedrich, the law which obliges companies wanting to buy property to prove that more than half their capital is owned by Swiss nationals. Otherwise, any proposed purchase is subjected to a government review. Last week, Ascom revealed it had gone through that process on a purchase last year. (Banks will probably maintain limits on foreign shareholdings, as Swiss ownership is crucial to their Swiss status for regulatory purposes.) The inevitable effect of these trends will be to dilute the 'Swissness' of the companies. Whether that is a good thing or not remains to be seen. In the past, the close-knit Swiss business community has usually closed ranks to save a member in distress, as in the case of the rescue organised last year by the big banks for the armaments and engineering group, Oerlikon-Buhrle. As companies become more cosmopolitan, this sort of community spirit is likely to weaken. The Swiss media already feels betrayed. It roundly criticised Ciba-Geigy, the pharmaceutical group, and CS Holding, the parent company of Credit Suisse, for holding their annual press conferences last month in London rather than in Switzerland. And the new chairman of Societe Generale de Surveillance, the Geneva-based inspection group, has been attacked for replacing some of the group's Swiss directors with foreigners. In spite of this grumbling, the centrifugal trends are unlikely to be reversed. They might slow a bit if Switzerland joins the European Economic Area (EEA), the new free trade association between the European Community and the seven countries of the European Free Trade Area (EFTA). EEA membership would require the country to permit free entry of people and capital from other EEA countries, and to exempt EEA nationals from the Lex Friedrich. However, this liberalisation would not come into effect until 1998, and most companies seem to feel they cannot wait that long.</p>

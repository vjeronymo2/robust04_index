			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav </F> Shushkevich by Yuliy Semenov of Ostankino Television, Lyudmila  Telen of MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, and journalist Igor Rudometov;  Shushkevich and Rudometov speak from a Minsk studio, Semenov and  Telen are in the Moscow studio; from the "Live Dialogue"  program--live]    [Excerpts] [Semenov] You know, journalists always look for  something extraordinary to start a conversation, and I also  propose to start our conversation with a scandal, although not  with a scandal between you and me, of course -- I hope that  everything will be fine between us on the air -- but with the  political scandal which has stirred the Belarus Supreme Soviet  over the last few days. [passage omitted] So Stanislav  Stanislavovich, perhaps it is not a very pleasant topic for  conversation, but today I think it is unavoidable. What is your  attitude toward this situation?    [Shushkevich] Good afternoon, esteemed viewers. Esteemed  Yuliy Aleksandrovich, of course this topic is not the best way  to start a conversation, but we should be ready to consider any  question. I have probably spent the last three days thinking  about this question above all others. I would like to separate  it from the essence of the accusations and so on and so forth,  because they are different issues.    Here we have a very clear example of our inability to work  in  the new conditions, that is, when we become a truly legal state.  We are seeing that law by telephone continues to operate in  Belarus. That is, a sanction is issued over the telephone by  the procurator general, and it seems to represent an  authorization to act completely freely from then on. The  parliament has been analyzing this situation for a long time,  and I can say that yes, unfortunately written laws are being  violated in the upper echelons of authority, the upper echelons  of our law-enforcing bodies.    We sometimes ask why this or that law is not working, or why  something is not happening; after all, the laws are written.  There are structures that must make them known and structures  that must study them and implement them religiously. And we are  seeing the violation of those laws. That is unfortunately a  fact, a sad fact, and it will serve as a bitter lesson for the  whole Supreme Council, for the republic's law-enforcing  structures, and probably for a wider group of people as well.    [Semenov] Do you see any legal problem here for the CIS as a  whole? For instance, some states have agreements between  themselves on legal assistance, others do not. You see, there  have been cases when representatives of certain Central Asian  countries have caught members of their own oppositions here in  Moscow. Is there a possibility that tomorrow Azerbaijan will  demand the extradition of Mutalibov and Vezirov in connection  with the accusations that are being directed toward them? Is  there a legal mechanism for such cases? Should not the special  services of some countries work on the territory of other  countries, all the more so if it is openly and legally? What do  you think?    [Shushkevich] You are absolutely right. These are ordinary  things that one can well understand. I would point out that  Russia is probably the most careful implementer of such an  approach, and so I do not understand your concern, especially  your strange examples. I did indeed touch on similar issues both  with the Russian procurator general and even with the president  -- I hope he will forgive me for taking the liberty of  mentioning it. But I perceived an entirely correct and cool  approach here: everything must be carried out according to the  letter of the law.    Such a legal accord does not exist between many states of  the  USSR [as heard], but we do have such an agreement with  Lithuania, and it is all the more regrettable that our services  are not mature enough to implement this agreement. Because the  procuracy, which worked for a week on this question with  representatives of the Lithuanian procuracy, suddenly came forth  with a verbal instruction. This of course is entirely irregular.  And, therefore, the concern in the Supreme Council was natural.  I hope that coolness will prevail and strict juridical rules  will operate and this case will receive a proper assessment.    [Telen] Mr. Shushkevich, you said that this case will  receive  a proper assessment, but nevertheless the situation is still  quite acute today. Clearly you and the Supreme Council will  have to take some kind of action to settle the situation. How  do you see the situation developing, and what do you intend to  do in order to ease it?    [Shushkevich] Lyudmila Olegovna, you know the situation in  Belarus quite well. I follow MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI and your  writings closely. It is very difficult to forecast how the  situation will develop. The thing is that we lack the  analytical disposition and the coolness that a parliament should  have. The parliament should not sink to score-settling,  forgetting about its main business.    What do we have now? Those laws that would allow us to  rectify the economic situation, as well as those corrections to  the constitution -- or rather the solution of questions  concerning the adoption of the new constitution -- are being  held up by political score-settling. It is not always Supreme  Council business; the cases when it is the business of the  council are exceptional. Because whatever happens, the work of  the council is paralyzed.    And you know, there are serious events ahead of us. There  are very serious treaties ahead of us, of a kind not previously  seen in practice between CIS states, and indeed it is difficult  to find similar approaches anywhere else in the world. We have  to work on this and work seriously. But a week has passed and  we have made very little progress in the work of our session.  So I repeat once again: Professionals, legal experts, and  parliamentary commissions should work on issues, submit  proposals, and not make decisions or turn the council into a  commission of enquiry. That will be fruitless, because emotion  will prevail over reason and the juridically correct approach.  That must be avoided.    [Semenov] Before handing the floor to our Minsk colleague  Igor Rudometov, I have a question here. Viewer Kuznetsov from  the Moscow area has evidently been attentively following what  has been happening in your country. He is interested in this.  Some kinds of troop contingents have twice appeared in Minsk  outside the Supreme Council. Is this so? And what was it  connected with?    [Shushkevich] You know it seems to me that if the Moscow  area  has already been informed of this, our affairs are in quite a  bad way. Unfortunately, one has here again a case of law by  telephone -- or, you know, not even law, but an anonymous  telephone call. According to the report I received from the  commander of our interior troops, an anonymous telephone call  led to the fact that, contrary to existing regulations under  which contingents of interior troops cannot be moved from the  locations where they are stationed without the sanction of the  head of government and without the sanction of the interior  minister, troops in our country were moved some 150-200 meters  from the Supreme Council.    I asked why this occurred and I demanded a written  explanation. The explanation was very simple. It said: I  received a telephone call, and I was afraid that the deputies  would not be treated with due respect when they emerged from the  Supreme Council. But what I do not understand is that they do  not come out of the council at that spot. These games take on  an unpleasant character, and there have been some examples of  this in neighboring countries. I think in general that the  grave and tragic character of these events has not got through  to the understanding of some of our leaders.    Within their understanding they almost want to play a little  game with the troops. These games are very dangerous and are  very dangerous for Belarus. I think that we must be very  emphatic in this regard.    As far as I am concerned, I think that one such occasion was  discussed at the security council during its preparation, and  there were no grounds for bringing the troops out. All the  subsequent events showed that there was no reason, that is to  say, there was no attempt to destabilize the situation. Now we  have run into it again and there was not even a hint of such an  attempt, and again the troops were brought out. I consider it  my duty in the most resolute way to address this issue tomorrow  on the basis of the documents in my possession. It is essential  in general to build a law-governed state and not a state where  there can be methods of intimidation. I hope that Belarus will  not be an example of such a state and that the Supreme Soviet  and the government will do everything possible to see that no  further such games take place on the territory of the Republic  of Belarus and that such things do not occur. [passage omitted]    [Rudometov] Before we turn to purely economic questions,  such  as the single ruble zone, I'd like to read the following  question. It's from Russia, from someone who describes himself  as: Golubovich, a Belarusian living in Russia. Here goes: What  were Shushkevich, Kravchuk, and Yeltsin guided by when in  Belovezhskaya Pushcha, contrary to the will of the people --  that's the way the question is worded -- they were wrecking the  Soviet Union? I won't make any comments on the question, I'm  just passing on to you.    [Shushkevich] I have already spoken about it a thousand  times.    If today I had to do everything all over again, I would not  have been able to find a better way to ensure that we build  legal relations between us in a civilized manner. I would have  taken the same road. I believe that there are many negative  phenomena both in the CIS and, on the whole, in individual  countries; but the fact that this step was taken has averted  much more evil events. I am proud of this step.    [Rudometov] Which leads us to the many questions we have  about the single ruble zone.    [Semenov] We too have many such questions. Well, go ahead.    [Rudometov] OK, question number one: What is it? Why are  there so many advocates and opponents on either side? One would  naturally prefer to be rich and healthy rather than sick and  poor, but what should we do now?    [Shushkevich, laughs] You know, the funny thing is that I  cannot give a precise, comprehensive, and meaningful answer to  the question of what it is. And neither can anybody else, I  believe. What I can say is what aim it pursues, what I'd like it  to be. It would be very good if we could have a single means of  payment; it would be very good if we could pursue an agreed  monetary policy; and it would be very good if we could make the  settlement process less complicated.    And I'd like to say that Russia is in no way threatened by a  unification with our financial system, even on those terms that  have been formulated and have been denounced in Russia. Because  in general, if, as it were, our Belarusian rubles turn into  Russian ones, there will be no inflationary processes -- because  we have so few that it poses no threat.    In fact, our enterprises are generally penniless. The  absence of the financial means that we so often talk about is  what we inherited from socialism. This is why I believe that it  is a positive move, which should help us to stabilize the  economy.    [Rudometov] But there is an opinion that in this case we are  going to Russia as poor relations.    [Shushkevich] That will depend on what specific agreements  we sign. I think that in the communique signed by Boris  Nikolayevich Yeltsin and I, not a single line suggests that we  are going to Russia as poor relations. In fact, we believe that  we are uniting, that we are unifying the financial systems in  order to enable both Russia and Belarus to gain profit because  we will simplify a whole range of relations.    But I can tell you what is my main priority. For me the most  important point is this: The economy of Belarus can be knocked  out, it has in fact been knocked out; that is to say, it is in a  sorry state. I will give you an example. In Russia prices went  up eightfold last year, while here prices went up 28 times! In  Russia, the dollar rate has increased threefold... By the way,  I was asked about it during a TV program and I checked later and  this is in fact true. Well, in Russia the dollar went up  threefold, while here the increase was 16.5 times. This means  that we are bad managers. Why? Here is the main problem: Our  main market is Russia. This is a fact. And our exports there  are of quite good quality. But if we include in the price of  these goods the price of the Russian oil -- and it is a lot more  expensive here than in Russia -- we end up with astronomical  customs duties! Last year we had to pay $28 for one tonne of  oil. If this oil is included in the price of our goods -- and  our energy consumption is high -- our goods will end up being  very expensive in Russia. Russia will not buy them. And the  primary reason is the price of oil. If Russia does not buy  goods, our industries will perish. We have no one else to sell  the goods to, because oil is expensive and we will not be able  to sell our goods anywhere else.    But look how this backfires on Russia. Enterprises producing  these goods use spare parts made in Russia. There are so many  of them -- and we are not talking about raw materials, but about  engines, electronics, and the like. These Russian industries  will in turn collapse because they will not have a market  either. We are destroying a huge mechanical engineering  industry, radio electronics, motor industry, tractor industry.  We are ready to kill them through an unreasonable pricing  policy. We have to stop this. And for me the solution is in  unified prices for energy carriers. This is not a sacrifice for  Russia. This is something that Russia must do.    I'd like to make one other remark in this connection. Please  understand that Russia is a legal successor to the former Soviet  Union on most points. It was not us who generated Chernobyl, it  was not us, bear this in mind. But every product we sell there  has a 5.2 percent Chernobyl tax, because otherwise we cannot  bring these people out of their most difficult plight and  resettle them somewhere they can live, and help them settle --  because there is no way they can stay where they are.    It was not us who led to a situation in which 15 percent of  our budget -- mind you, 15 percent, which is more than what is  spent on defense, on education, on culture, and many more things  taken together -- 15 percent is spent on the Chernobyl tax.  And, therefore, we cannot invest in industry even though it is  now necessary that the state should support many positions in  industry through planning. But we are deprived of this  opportunity. Therefore, I believe that one has to move in the  framework of a sensible treaty, understanding that there are no  reasons, no grounds for the so-called Russian-speaking  population who form a majority in Belarus -- there aren't that  many Belarusian speakers -- there are no reasons for them to  complain to Russia about some kind of policy against them -- it  is not like in other countries.    [Semenov] You know, unfortunately not all your fellow  countrymen share your view. The publication of a notorious  article by Zenon Paznyak has created a stir in Moscow. Here I  have Russian TV viewers' reaction to it. For my part I can only  say -- I understand that we are probably placing you in an  awkward position by mentioning this -- but this article has been  noticed in Moscow, and it is understandably causing irritation  among Russian readers. One cannot speak of the Russian people  the way Zenon Paznyak does. And even though he is trying to  frighten Belarusians with Zhirinovskiy, he comes very close to  him in some respects, particularly in his use of language and  the nature of arguments.    But let us now return to the subject of our discussion. You  know, we understand your pain, your concern, particularly  regarding Chernobyl. And TV viewers really welcome the fact  that Russia and Belarus are coming closer together. [passage  omitted] But there are also doubts on this point, connected  with fears of some damage for Russia, particularly financial  damage if funny money is exchanged one for one. Someone here  tried to calculate Russia's financial loss. It can be as high  as 1.6 quadrillion rubles. By the way, this figure is  marginally higher than the annual budget of Ostankino. These  are the estimated losses this exchange can bring the Russians  due to inflation. Another problem is that there would be a  second center for the emission of rubles.    [Shushkevich] Yulian Aleksandrovich, first of all I cannot  leave unnoticed your remark concerning Zenon Paznyak's article.  First of all I'd like to say that I categorically dissociate  myself from such an approach. But I'd like to explain just one  thing. You know what the trouble is? We can, all of us,  Russia, Belarus, and many other countries, find in our previous  history a whole range of incidents that can lead to a strained  and apprehensive attitude to each other. But, you see, one  cannot be partial in treating historical facts. I just don't  know, with all those things about Malyuta Skuratov and  oprichnina [Skuratov was Ivan the Terrible's henchman most  associated with the 1565-72 practice of mass repressions,  executions, and confiscation of land on suspicion of treason,  known as oprichnina].    Was not the oprichnina really calamitous for those who are  now Belarusian-speaking, for those who live in these regions.  And was it not calamitous for Russian citizens? I could go  through history, and sometimes, you understand, the genocide  carried out by the Russian authorities against the Russian  people was so harsh and so tough that it was simply terrible.  And now we are singling out one factor; that, for example,  those same authorities that carried out genocide against the  Russians more than any others also carried out genocide against  the Belarusian people and that's what we'll build a policy upon!  This is just juggling facts. I oppose this, and I want to say  this: In our history there are many remarkable examples. We can  always build and are continuing to build good relations. And  the main criterion, the main approach, is the people: No article  of any sort, including articles about the inhumanity of Russian  Federation imperialism, will nurture anti-Russian Federation  attitudes in our republic! As for unification, this is a  difficult issue, I repeat. If we manage to resolve the main  question, if Russia resolves the main question on pricing  policy, then I assess it is a worthy solution.    And now as for the losses: I mentioned the figure of about  15  percent of our budget. This is a higher figure than the one you  mentioned, and we are shelling out on Chernobyl expenditure --  although I repeat, we have never had, and do not now have, a  single nuclear power engineering installation -- but why should  we remain in isolation? According to contemporary calculations,  we are indeed receiving assistance from the Russian Federation,  but if you will excuse me saying so, in comparison with the sum  you mentioned, this assistance is positively paltry, just  peanuts. And so realistically speaking, given our previous  history and given whose legal successors we are, we really do  have a worthy package of agreements and they must be sacredly  observed. And there is sufficiently good motivation and grounds  for drawing these up.    [Telen] Mr. Shushkevich, if I may I should like to continue  on this topic. The communique that you and the Russian  president signed make considerably more difficult both your and  his positions within your states. [passage omitted] Can you  say, please, will you, as chairman of the Belarus Supreme  Soviet, and President Yeltsin, as head of the Russian state,  manage to convince your opponents and convince the people that  this decision is for the well-being of both states? [passage  omitted] What happens when Russian citizens are told today:  unification with the Belarus monetary system means an extra 10  percent inflation a month? Does it not seem to you that this  could make relations between peoples more difficult rather than  easier?    [Shushkevich] Lyudmila Olegovna, first of all I don't want  to  give an opinion on who has been saying what and how about  joining or not joining the Russian Government. But I ought to  say that it is difficult to find a politician in Russia for whom  I have more respect than Yegor Gaydar or Boris Fedorov, and I  could name many others who have and haven't joined the Russian  Government.    The matter is this: Either the Russian reforms, the monetary  approach, were excessively intensive and corrections are now  needed, that is, they went slightly in the wrong direction, or  they were largely correct. There are official declarations  everywhere that the reforms are continuing and that the brake  won't be applied to them. But on the other hand, given the  lineup that we see, they'll have a little less monetarism and a  little more state planning. That's how I understand the issue.    I don't think that Belarus can add 10 percent to the  inflation rate. We've made some very serious miscalculations,  or rather calculations, and that kind of inflation... [pauses]  It's quite another matter that everyone who can will claim that  such inflation has come about due to unification. So the  agreements have to be carefully drawn up, and the reason for  that explained.    As far as political unification is concerned, then excuse  me.  I'll say once again that I'm proud that Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin, the president of Russia...[pauses] It wasn't even me  that asked him or pushed him about this. You see, it turned out  during talks that we both came up with the same proposal. We  should have made it clear that this is two states reaching  agreement here, two countries. That we are preparing a  full-scale and far-reaching treaty on relations between our  states. But taking into account the realities and the great  extent to which we are interwoven, this probably won't be the  kind of agreement that is reached between other states. That  is, it will be a closer relationship anticipating the kind of  links, perhaps, of which some countries in Europe dream.  [passage omitted]    [Rudometov] The question of dual citizenship arises. How is  it being resolved in Belarus, and in this connection there is a  question from our next group of listeners.    [Shushkevich] I can answer that one straight away.    [Rudometov] Go ahead, please.    [Shushkevich] This question has not been resolved in our  legislation. It can be decided in two ways: One way is by being  drawn up by our commission on nationalities, because we have to  find a way. There is a certain category of people affected, and  we've understood that this issue has to be resolved. The other  way might be set out in this treaty. It could be drawn up  applying international law. Instructions have been issued.    [Rudometov] [passage omitted] What measures are being taken  by the Belarus Government to uphold ensure rights in Belarus  that are being encroached upon in other ex-USSR republics? This  question comes from a lady in Riga who didn't give her name.    [Shushkevich] Yes, this kind of question could well be  asked in Riga, because there's a problem there. There's a group  of servicemen's families who, in our opinion, do not largely  enjoy all the rights enjoyed by citizens of Latvia. This is a  delicate issue. Our Supreme Soviet commission is aware of it  and a whole range of specific approaches to it have been  examined. It might possibly be resolved with international  involvement. We have told the Latvians about this and also  other states who are trying to help Latvia sort this issue out.  There are families of former servicemen of Belarusian origin in  Latvia who, our commission on inter-ethnic relations is  convinced -- I stress is convinced -- do not have the status  that free citizens of a free country should have. This,  unfortunately, is a fact. [passage omitted]    [Rudometov] Will the promise about early elections to the  Supreme Soviet be honored, and why is there no law on recalling  deputies? A lot of people are concerned about this.    [Shushkevich] Once again, I repeat that unfortunately the  Supreme Soviet is so distracted from its proper work by  secondary issues and investigations it shouldn't be involved in  that I think we can only meet the announced deadline by  mobilizing all forces within it. Because the process is clearly  being drawn out, there's no secret about that. I'm beginning to  think certain groups of deputies are even doing this  deliberately. [passage omitted]    [Semenov] Viktor Viktorovich Poteskiy from Nizhniy Tagil is  interested in your attitude toward your Polish minority.    [Shushkevich] I don't think that we have a problem with the  Polish national minority. In particular this is linked to the  Catholic faith...[pauses] Our legislation and the realities are  such that Poles have a proper status in Belarus.    [Semenov] Regarding your new position on nuclear disarmament  by Belarus: You're known to have set a good example for  everyone in this respect, but some nuances have appeared.    [Shushkevich] Our position is in no way new. It's as it was,  as was announced on literally the first day of the Presidium of  the Supreme Soviet when I was elected chairman. We are for  withdrawal. We signed all the documents and we are withdrawing  them.    As far as a share of the value of the materials obtained  from  the nuclear warheads in our country is concerned, we have an old  and long-standing agreement with Russia and the United States  with all our fellow CIS members.    [Semenov] Here is a curious question. It is known that  President Boris Yeltsin, in his meeting with Bill Clinton, gave  him certain official documents on the Lee Harvey Oswald case,  who as you know was officially recognized as the man who killed  President Kennedy. Meanwhile, there was a report that the  volumes on this case were sent to Minsk, where Oswald once lived  and was even married. Did you give anything to President  Clinton, and do you know anything about this dossier?    [Shushkevich] Yuliy Aleksandrovich, everything that could be  done in accordance with our legislation was done previously. We  are punctual here in our observance of the law. But I, like all  my colleagues in Minsk, have already said everything I can about  this, right up to the fact that I personally taught him Russian,  the man who is believed to be Kennedy's killer. All the  documents that could be handed over according to the law were  handed over a long time ago.    [Telen] Stanislav Stanislavovich, your position in the  Supreme Soviet is, unfortunately, somewhat complex. Up to now,  you've always managed to find some kind of balance and  equilibrium to work constructively with the Supreme Soviet. On  what political forces are you now ready to rely within the  Supreme Soviet, and with whom is it easier for you to find a  common language?    [Shushkevich] You know, I've now become a centrist,  initially  spontaneously but now by conviction. This is a lengthy answer  to your question, because I can say that I can rely on the  communists as well, because Marx was the greatest free-marketeer  of them all. I can demonstrate what's primary and what's  secondary, beginning with Engels's speech at Karl Marx's grave.    I'm obliged to rely on the majority who support the  government, because they're also all claiming to be  free-marketeers. Therefore, I'm seeking a platform for  compromise from the standpoint of rational organization of the  economy, and such a platform can be found.    That's why I'm not a member of any political party and do  not  intend in the near future to create one.    [Telen] One more question. Economic reform is known to be  proceeding in a less intensive way than many people and  economists in Belarus would like. Are there any differences in  this respect between yourself and Prime Minister Kebich?    [Shushkevich] You mentioned differences. I want reforms to  move faster than the prime minister can realistically achieve.  You see, I want this to happen. We're creating laws on the  basis of which they can move faster, but it's the prime minister  who has to do it. And this is where the complications arise.  It's a lot harder for him -- I understand that -- but I do  think that in the actual present conditions we can head toward a  free market faster. [passage omitted]    [Semenov] Did you get a saxophone concert during your  meeting  with President Clinton?    [Shushkevich] No, we didn't get a saxophone concert because  we didn't have enough time and had to tend to business. We  didn't have any breaks for a personal chat except in the car.  [passage omitted]    [Semenov] Stanislav Stanislavovich, we have a little time  left. Perhaps you'd like to speak on something the questions  didn't touch upon? Go ahead if you wish.    [Shushkevich] Esteemed colleagues, I'd like to say one  thing.  It's very difficult to reform a simple structure, and very  difficult to reform the economy of a large state. Naturally,  difficulties are encountered in the course of such reform. The  whole trouble is that without completing one phase or one task,  we start making such a noise about these difficulties and  cursing the reformers that we sometimes lose sight of the goal.    I appeal for calm and persistence, because once you choose  the type of treatment it's impossible to hand the patient over  to someone else. That would only kill the patient. You should  either believe the doctor or not believe him. In our country,  we have every reason to believe in our Supreme Soviet. But in  the past week it's badly undermined these reasons because we've  started occupying ourselves with secondary tasks.    I'd say this: We shouldn't be diverted from our planned  market-economy policy, a policy for a social market economy. I  stress the social, so that pensioners, veterans, and Chernobyl  victims understand that we should do everything to look after  them. But we mustn't be deflected from our course. And the  Russian prime minister... [pauses] We can see that things have  got better in Russia because Russia has moved more determinedly  toward the free market. [passage omitted]</p>

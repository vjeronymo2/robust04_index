			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Europe's 'green' policy attacked MR TIM YEO, environment minister, yesterday attacked European environment policy, saying there was 'growing cynicism among the public' that other European countries would ever be forced to comply with a host of European directives. His criticism comes two days before the government and the water industry will press for a revision of the EC 1980 drinking water directive to allow countries more discretion in setting standards. Speaking in Manchester at an international environmental conference hosted by the government, Mr Yeo said the 'temperature, taste and odour' of drinking water were 'not the European Commission's business'. Tomorrow's meeting of government officials in Brussels was organised by the commission after months of lobbying by Eureau, the association of European water suppliers. It will be the first attempt to renegotiate the drinking water directive. Mr Yeo called the directive 'very out-of-date'. Much of the UK water industry's Pounds 45bn investment programme is directed towards meeting EC standards on drinking water and sewage treatment. The water services association, which represents the 10 large UK water companies, together with Ofwat, the industry regulator, have called for a revision of the standards to help slow the rise in bills. Mr Yeo acknowledged that other countries - particularly the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark - may call on Britain to tighten controls on agricultural pesticides. Any move to restrict farmers from using pesticides, which contaminate water supplies and need expensive treatment to be removed, is likely to provoke controversy between the government and farmers. The Eureau proposals call for new drinking water standards to focus on health, not 'aesthetic factors', and to specify average levels of permitted substances instead of maximum levels.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Ulster talks set to reopen this week ATTEMPTS to resolve Northern Ireland's political future by 'round table' talks are expected to resume this week after getting the go-ahead from British and Irish ministers at a meeting in London today. The negotiations between Unionist and nationalist leaders that collapsed in July may reopen on Wednesday, possibly leading to devolved government for the province. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, will meet Mr David Andrews, Irish foreign minister, today for an Anglo-Irish conference meeting under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. They are expected to agree a three-month gap before the next meeting, so satisfying the Unionist demand for the conferences to be suspended during negotiations. The Northern Ireland Office is committed to giving the talks the best chance. Officials and politicians realise however that difficulties over apparently minor procedural points wrecked the initiative last time. The first 'strand' of talks, chaired by Sir Patrick, would be on the internal government of the province. The second strand would be on relations between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic and become the point at which Dublin entered the talks. Last time there were lengthy disputes over the location of the second strand and over who should chair it. Sir Ninian Stephen, a former governor-general of Australia who eventually emerged as an acceptable independent chairman, is available again. It is uncertain whether Unionist leaders will allow the talks to proceed to strand two at the speed that is preferred by the nationalists. The third, and final, strand would be on relations between the UK and Ireland and might lead to a replacement for the 1985 agreement.</p>

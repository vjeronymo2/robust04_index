			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEER AND CONCERTS  </P> <P> Paul Grein's July 30 article, "Suds 'n' Bucks 'n' Rock 'n' Roll," cogently  illustrates the beer makers' voracious appetite for profit and the "futures"  market as they target the young by sponsoring rock concerts.  </P> <P> And kudos to retiring U.S. Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop, quoted in the article,  for his efforts to: (1) eliminate alcohol sponsorship of concerts and athletic  contests where much of the audience is likely to be under the drinking age; (2)  eliminate the use in alcohol ads of celebrities who appeal to youths, and (3)  develop training for community groups in opposing alcohol ads.  </P> <P> With "the prime concert audience and the prime beer-drinking market  (overlapping) to a degree that is a marketer's dream" (as Grein wrote in  referring to the 18-to-24-year-old bracket), small wonder that young people are  continuing to self-destruct through vehicle crashes, homicide and suicide as  their leading causes of death -- all alcohol-related in the majority of  incidents. Small wonder, too, that 65% of violations of California's alcoholic  beverage control laws involve illegal sales to minors.  </P> <P> RAY CHAVIRA  </P> <P> Board Member, Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

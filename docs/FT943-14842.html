			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / US telecoms group launches bid worth Dollars 2.2bn for QVC Comcast, the US telecoms group, last night launched a Dollars 2.2bn (Pounds 1.4bn) bid for QVC, the US television shopping group which last week agreed to a similarly valued merger with CBS, the broadcast television network. The Comcast bid, made in a letter to QVC chairman Mr Barry Diller, involves an offer of Dollars 37 a share cash and Dollars 7 a share in Comcast convertible preferred stock for all of QVC's outstanding shares. Under the terms of the bid, Comcast is willing to pay a 22.2 per cent premium on the current value of QVC shares, which closed last night at Dollars 36. Comcast's offer came after the close of trading in New York. Comcast, which is a founding shareholder in QVC, said it was making a rival bid because it believed the proposed merger between QVC and CBS was not in the best interests of Comcast shareholders. Comcast currently owns 15.4 per cent of QVC on a fully diluted basis. The funding for Comcast's offer will come from the Bank of New York, which has told the company it can obtain commitments for a Dollars 1bn senior credit facility, and from other sources to be arranged. QVC officials were not available for comment last night, but it is likely that Mr Diller will initially reject the Comcast offer. Although the value of Comcast's bid is essentially the same as that of the QVC-CBS deal, Comcast said last night the difference between the two transactions was that it would not require QVC to pay any break-up fees if the Comcast merger failed. In the letter to Mr Diller, Comcast said QVC's board, which was scheduled to meet today to discuss the CBS merger, should lay both bids on the table, and submit the competing offers for consideration by a committee of independent directors. The rival offer from Comcast is unlikely to come as as surprise to Wall Street. When CBS and QVC announced their merger plans last week, analysts said that the proposed deal had in effect put both companies in play, although industry experts had expected any new bids to have been made for CBS, not QVC. The battle over the CBS-QVC merger comes against a background of major consolidation in the US cable and broadcast television industry, which is becoming rapidly dominated by a few large operators.</p>

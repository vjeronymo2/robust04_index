			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a report UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali has submitted to the UN Security Council for its  consideration, some 17,000 government and Mozambique National  Resistance, Renamo, soldiers must be demobilized from the  centers where they are serving at this stage. Such centers  include hospital, air, and naval bases, as well as barracks.    The report presented to the UN Security Council says that  soldiers have had to stay in their assembly areas for long  periods because of demobilization delays. The UN secretary  general's report also mentions delays in the scrapping of some  155,000 militia and other (?paramilitary) forces, and it adds  that a lack of air transportation helped paralyze that process  in March, though half of the weapons declared by the government,  in the hands of the paramilitary forces, had been collected in  April.</p>

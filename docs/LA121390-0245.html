			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TUCSON TRYING TO ATTRACT ORIOLES  </P> <P> A campaign is under way in Tucson to attract the Baltimore Orioles as a  possible Cactus League replacement for the Cleveland Indians, who will move  their spring training headquarters to Florida.  </P> <P> "We have talked to the Orioles," Jim Ronstadt, director of the Tucson Parks and  Recreation Department, said Wednesday. "They may be interested."  </P> <P> The Orioles, who trained in Yuma in 1954 and in Scottsdale in 1956-58, have no  home stadium for the 1991 Grapefruit League season in Florida.  </P> <P> Baltimore played its spring training home games at Miami Stadium from 1959-90  but has left the park because it is old and there is no room for expansion or  the addition of other training facilities, said Bob Miller, a team spokesman.  </P></p>

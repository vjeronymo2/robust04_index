			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Banda nomination threatens reforms: Likely fallout from the candidacy of Malawi's ailing president Progress towards democratic government in Malawi may be threatened by a deterioration in relations between government and opposition after a decision at the weekend by the ruling party to retain President Hastings Banda as its presidential candidate for the May elections. Western diplomats believe that President Banda, who underwent brain surgery late last year and was temporarily replaced by a Malawi Congress party triumvirate, has been ill again. Mr Hetherwick Ntaba, external affairs minister, said the president had suffered a bout of malaria and was 'in poor shape' when he received British overseas development minister Baroness Lynda Chalker a fortnight ago. Local newspapers claim the president, who has made no public statement or appearance this year, is being attended by specialists who want to transfer him to South Africa, but that he is too ill to be moved. President Banda was on Sunday formally adopted as the presidential candidate of the Congress party, with Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, home affairs minister, as running mate. It seems Mr Chakuamba, who served 13 years in jail for allegedly plotting to overthrow Banda, is the party's real choice for the future, but that the party cannot bring itself to relinquish President Banda as a figurehead while he remains alive. This has earned the ridicule of opposition politicians, some of whom are calling for Mr Chakuamba's resignation on the grounds that he has failed to halt a creeping tide of domestic violence. Several schools in the capital Lilongwe have been attacked by armed gangs who have beaten teachers and abducted students. There is evidence that those responsible are Malawi Young Pioneers who were forcibly disarmed by the regular army last year but have not yet been formally disbanded. The gangs are thought to be targetting teachers because of their role in the registration of voters for a referendum last year on political pluralism. In separate incidents, at least three deaths have been reported in the last fortnight as a result of political brawls. In one case a university lecturer was stabbed to death by a regular soldier, prompting a protest march by students to the local barracks. Further industrial unrest is also feared as the inflationary impact of the floating last week of the local currency begins to be felt. The kwacha is depreciating rapidly and retail prices for some food products have already risen by 25 per cent, with an oil price rise expected soon. Meanwhile, government and opposition have not yet agreed a formula for replacing President Banda if he dies before the election. The all-party National Consultative Council meets this week to discuss the issue which threatens again to put other negotiations on the back burner. A further area of likely conflict is the country's new constitution, to be discussed this week at an all-party conference partly funded by the British government. An NCC committee is preparing a draft document with UN technical support. For elections to go ahead on May 17 a final version will have to be adopted quickly and without substantial revision. However Mr Lovemore Munlo, justice minister and the government's representative on the committee, has missed seven out of nine sessions, and Congress party officials have said they are drafting their own document to present to the conference.</p>

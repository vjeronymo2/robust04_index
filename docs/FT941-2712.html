			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Setback for Bildt over EU referendum date Sweden is to hold its referendum on joining the European Union on November 13 - assuming the EU resolves its row over voting rights in the enlarged Union. Although Finland and Norway have yet to set dates for their referendums, the Swedish decision almost certainly ensures that the order of voting in the three Nordic neighbours will be Finland in September, followed by Sweden, and then Norway, in late November or December. Austria is to vote in June. With support for EU membership among the Nordic countries strongest in Finland and weakest in Norway, the east to west sequence has long been regarded as the best way to win a 'yes' vote in the three nations. Polls in Sweden and Norway show the yes vote rising if their neighbours decide to join. But yesterday's decision was a blow to Mr Carl Bildt, the conservative prime minister, who wanted to hold the referendum in June, or at the latest on general election day in September. He was forced to postpone the date by the opposition Social Democrats, the country's biggest political party, which it is widely acknowledged holds the key to winning a 'yes' vote. The dilemma for Mr Bildt is that if he wins the general election, the Social Democrats are unlikely to campaign enthusiastically for joining the EU, which many of its members oppose. In Norway yesterday, opinion polls taken after agreement on accession terms this week showed conflicting results. A Gallup poll showed opposition rising to 49 per cent, with support slipping to 28 per cent. But a poll in the newspaper Dagbladet showed support moving up sharply to 41 per cent, with opposition falling three percentage points to 49 per cent.</p>

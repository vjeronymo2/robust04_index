Until now, attempts to create and maintain such  hybrids have been fraught with a number of problems. A  fundamentally new technique for detecting human DNA based on a  polymerase chain reaction [PCR] with arbitrary primers (referred  to as the AP-PCR method) has been developed. The new method was  tested on two previously created hybrid clones representing a  cross of Chinese hamster (VL79-_g_-8) and the human cell line  HeLa. The yeast strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae 15V  P4 was used as a negative control. Genome DNA that yielded  well-differentiated PCR patterns when amplified with two  different arbitrary primers (21 and 45) was isolated from the  hybrid clones and from the pure cell lines. From the standpoint  of the appearance of their PCR patterns, the two hybrid clones  produced with the two different primers were in no way different  from the starting hamster line. Dot hybridization of the  amplified DNA of these clones with tagged human amplified DNA  clearly demonstrated the presence of human DNA, however. The DNA  of the yeasts amplified with primer 45 yielded the same negative  result as the hamster DNA. In the human genome DNA (HeLa),  researchers succeeded in amplifying those unique, strictly  specific genome sequences that, when used as a tagged probe,  revealed homologous human DNA in the DNA cell hybrids and thus  confirmed their hybrid nature. Dot hybridization with the  amplified hamster DNA used as a probe demonstrated that  hamster-specific sequences are completely absent in the human  DNA amplified with the same primer. Similar results were  obtained for primers 21 and 45. The new AP-PCR, which is said to  be without analogues, was deemed suitable not only for detecting  human DNA in interspecific hybrids but also in identifying human  chromosomes by in situ hybridization or cross dot hybridization  with monochromosomal human hybrids. The new AP-PCR method was  said to possess the following distinctive features:     -  the selection of primers is unlimited (no knowledge of  nucleotide sequence is required when constructing primers, and  paired combinations of primers may be used to make sequencing  easier;    -  one and the same primer may be used to identify the DNA of  both  organisms whose genomes constitute a given cell hybrid;    -  the result of amplification is always positive (the  amplifiability of DNA is directly controlled)    -  the presence of DNA is judged not by the fact of  amplification  but rather by the capability of the amplified DNA under analysis  to hybridize with human DNA amplified with the very same  primer.

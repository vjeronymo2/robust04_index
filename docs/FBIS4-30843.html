			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 1 June carries in its  regular 7-minute newscast two reports on the combat situation on  the Brcko and Gracanica fronts.    Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "the Serbian  aggressor's provocations that characterized the day [31 May] on  the Brcko front intensified during the night. In the evening  hours, the chetniks used 62 and 80-mm mortars, Tromblon  grenades, and infantry weapons to pound the Brcko defense  positions. On several occasions, the chetniks from (?Lipe)  opened fierce fire at the central part of the defense. At 2115,  the enemy used a hill gun to shell the wider area of Bajici but  to no avail. The first morning hours on the Brcko front are  marked by the Serbian aggressor's small arms' provocations,  which are particularly pronounced in the region of Djukici. The  defenders are not responding."    Izudin Durakovic, the correspondent from Gracanica,  recapitulates the situation on the front in the past 24 hours  and adds that "the shelling from howitzers, tanks, and Bofors  from [name indistinct] and Besanj continued in the evening  hours. Enemy vehicles were on the move throughout the day,  bringing in fresh forces and hardware. In the 117th Lukavac  Brigade theater of operations, the chetniks used a Broving and  anti-aircraft guns to shell Malinjak. The night was more quiet  than usual for this part of the front."</p>

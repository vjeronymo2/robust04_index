			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Observer: Crossed line Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland's pushy phone-based insurance outfit, seems hell-bent on selling ever more complex products, such as life insurance and mortgages. But despite yesterday's impressive increase in profits, Direct Line's expansion plans have been met with scepticism. Hence, it will be heartened by yesterday's press release from another firm headed 'Customers say yes to phone-based mortgages'. Any concern that complicated financial matters like mortgages can't be properly handled over the phone has been dispelled by research, said the release. And who has Direct Line to thank for this timely observation? The Household Mortgage Corporation, the UK's largest centralised lender, which will be Direct Line's number one competitor.</p>

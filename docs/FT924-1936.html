			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: French insurers seek tax help over property crisis FRENCH INSURERS are calling on the government for tax breaks to help them through the property crisis, less than a week after banks appealed for state assistance over bad property loans. The request comes from the Federation Francaise des Societes d'Assurance, which estimates its members have a combined property investment portfolio worth FFr300bn (Dollars 56.6bn), on top of the FFr250bn to FFr500bn property loans made by banks, some of which are also insurance company subsidiaries. Average rentals on Parisian property have fallen by 20 per cent over the past three years, provoking heavy provisions by banks with loans to property developers. The FFSA's appeal, made at a convention of its members, comes just as the government is putting the finishing touches to measures to support the property industry, which Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said would be announced in the next few days. The FFSA has called for investors to be excused capital gains tax on property, on condition they reinvest capital gains in building rented housing or offices for which planning permission was obtained before January 1993. Among its other ideas are a tax exempt property savings plan, similar to an existing share savings scheme and the creation of a national data base on property prices to help investors avoid price explosions such as the one which preceded the present decline in property values. Mr Sapin is more interested in possible measures to support the construction industry, an important employer, rather than bailing out institutional investors or property developers, said property analysts. This reflects the influence of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, who is understood to be reluctant to do anything that might be misinterpreted as bailing out property speculators. Any proposals could well take the form of big infrastructure projects as envisaged in the European growth initiative, agreed at the Edinburgh summit. In the meantime, Mr Sapin has attempted to calm the property market. 'Contrary to certain foreign experiences, one should treat property assets as long-term holdings and avoid the collapse in prices which could be harmful to the financial system,' he told a dinner held by the Association Francaise des Banques on Monday evening. The crisis would hit banks but not threaten their financial 'foundations,' he argued. Office property prices were now showing signs of stabilising after having reached 'excessive levels', especially in Paris, while the fall in housing prices benefited potential home owners.</p>

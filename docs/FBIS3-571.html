For Paulin Murayi, the Brussels-based  representative of President Habyarimana's MNRD [National  Revolutionary Movement for Development], things are clear: The  RPF, and only the RPF, is responsible for blocking the Arusha  peace process.    Having said that, President Habyarimana is certainly no  angel, and he has done everything to ensure that the Arusha  negotiations with the RPF will be stymied as much as possible  since the agreement that was finally reached and that is now  seven months old reduces his powers in favor of power sharing  with the RPF, which unleashed a war in Rwanda in October 1990.    In the meantime, Habyarimana took an oath on 5 January as  "transitional president." In doing so, he is, in actual fact,  the only existing institution resulting from the implementation  of the Arusha agreements. Neither the enlarged government,  which will include five RPF ministers, nor the transitional  parliament, in which the five coalition parties will have a  seat, has been set up because within the MDR [Republican  Democratic Movement], the PL [Liberal Party], and the PSD  [Democratic Socialist Party], three opposition parties that  already have a seat in the government, old scores between  supporters and opponents of the RPF are sometimes settled in  deadly ways.    Quite a few observers believe that Habyarimana has stirred  up  this opposition, faultlines which run along ethnic, i.e. Hutu  versus Tutsi, dividing lines, within the political parties in  order to block the RPF's path to the government because, after  the power sharing arrangement, there must follow a fusion of the  government's existing army and the RPF forces after which  Habyarimana will no longer enjoy a power base. Paulin Murayi  (MNRD-Brussels) turns this analysis around: The dissent within  the MDR, PL, and PSD will make it impossible for the RPF to  manipulate the Arusha government, and therefore the RPF no  longer sees any point in the peace agreements. He quickly  glossed over the fact that according to UN observer Jacques  Roger Booh-Booh the regime is widely distributing arms among  Hutu farmers in order to concentrate primarily on the arms race  which the RPF has,it says, begun. Independent sources also  confirm that the RPF is buying arms in Eastern Europe and in  Belgium, according to Murayi.  <H5>  FN-Herstal </H5>   In this regard, he pointed to an unexplained matter at  FN-Herstal: After the coup d'etat in Burundi in late October  1993, Burundi officers of the Tutsi ethnic group have presented  themselves at the Liege-based arms factory with a major arms  order. The Burundian Embassy in Brussels denied that this is an  official order and the Belgian Government has denied that an  export license has been issued. It was assumed that the  officers in question were sent by the Tutsi putschists in  Burundi. Paulin Murayi, however, maintains that the RPF high  commander, Paul Kagame, was part of the group that knocked on  the door of FN-Herstal. There are said to be reliable witnesses  to this. Hence, the failed arms order was actually intended for  the RPF. It is an open secret that the RPF, which recruits  primarily among Tutsi exiles in neighboring countries, can count  on much sympathy in the Burundian Army, which is still comprised  almost exclusively of Tutsis.  <H5>  Land Mines </H5>   According to Murayi, the several thousand land mines that  the  RPF used to seal off the front line in northern Rwanda were made  in Belgium. He does not know how the RPF got hold of these  mines: It was initially thought that perennial troublemaker  Libya had delivered them, but because of the fact that these  mines were smuggled via Cairo and Mobutu is no friend of  al-Qadhdhafi, the suspicion does not appear to be well-founded.  In addition to British-Ugandan weapons, the RPF also has access  to American arms, the supplier of which is unknown.    Murayi says that the fact that the RPF recruits many young  Tutsis in the neighboring countries of Zaire (especially in  North Kivu), Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania, something that has  been confirmed by other sources, is clear proof that the RPF has  moved away from the Arusha peace process toward an offensive  military strategy. "They do not want to share power. No, they  want to monopolize power. They still believe in the myth that  they were born to rule, and that makes it impossible to live  with them."</p>

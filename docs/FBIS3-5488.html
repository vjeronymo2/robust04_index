			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The government's fair trade  watchdog unveiled Friday [4 March] new draft guidelines designed  to eradicate rampant bid-rigging activities on tenders for  public works projects. The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) will  formalize by summer the draft calling for strict controls on a  wide range of activities related to bids on public works  projects to replace the current standards established in 1984,  FTC officials said.    The new guidelines will classify suspect corporate  activities  into three categories -- those that violate the Antimonopoly  Law, those that do not, and those that are on the borderline.    Such acts as selecting before bidding takes place firms  expected to get the orders on public works projects, rigging bid  prices or deciding the minimum tender price, will be stipulated  as violation of the law.    The draft also says exchanging information on bids,  including  bidders' business records or tender prices, has a high  probability of violating the Fair Trade Law.    Exchanging information about the prospect of firms'  participation in bids or forming joint ventures for bidding will  also fall into the category of acts that could violate the law.    The existing guidelines allow firms to exchange information  about bids as long as they do not select the successful bidder  or set the tender price, but the system is regarded as being  full of loopholes to allow bid-rigging practices.    The FTC move comes against the backdrop of prosecutors  investigating corrupt relations between politicians and  construction companies over public works projects and the United  States harshly criticizing the closed nature of the Japanese  construction market.    The construction ministry, since last December, has been  tackling a wholesale review of the bidding system for public  works projects to secure fairness and give wider access to  foreign competitors under the open-bidding system expected to be  introduced in April, ministry officials said.    The FTC will finalize the draft guidelines after hearing  views from ministries involved and economic organizations, as  well as from the U.S. and the European Union, the officials  said.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: IRVINE;  </P> <P> CITY WANTS TO APPEAL DENIAL OF ROAD FUNDS  </P> <P> The City Council has directed the city attorney to begin exploring an appeal of  the county's recent decision to deny Irvine its $4-million share of county  highway funds. The council also directed the city manager to set up a meeting  between county and city officials to discuss the matter.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors last week voted to deny Irvine its share of  state gas tax money because county officials say the city's road improvement  plans are not compatible with the county's master plan for roads. Laguna Beach  is the only other Orange County city to have been denied gas tax money by the  supervisors.  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Agran defended the city's improvement plans Tuesday night and said  the county decision was unfair. "I don't intend to beg Supervisor (Thomas F.)  Riley in this matter," Agran said. "The county made a mistake. I'll help them  rectify it. . . . I don't intend to sit there and listen to the county berate  us."  </P> <P> Agran added that he would like to meet with County Administrative Officer Larry  Parrish, who criticized the mayor personally in the dispute. City Manager  William Woollett Jr. offered to meet Parrish in Irvine, where the county  official lives, and jokingly added, "We have already cut his water off."  </P></p>

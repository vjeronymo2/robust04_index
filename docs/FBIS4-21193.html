			<p>Senator   Kerry's Charges   <F P=102> PA1104134594 Paris AFP in Spanish 0440 GMT 11 Apr 94 </F> <F P=103> PA1104134594 </F> <F P=104>  Paris AFP </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 Apr (AFP) -- Colombian  Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez admitted on Sunday that the  sentences given to those who surrender to justice should be  tougher, but he denied U.S. allegations that Colombia is a  ``narcodemocracy.''    In an interview with Caracol Radio Network, Gonzalez denied  assertions that the current Colombian legal system is a  ``narcocode.'' Just as the Attorney General's Office, the  Prosecutor General's Office, and the Supreme Court have been  saying, the minister admitted that the code requires immediate  changes, especially regarding sentences given to drug  traffickers.    Gonzalez insisted that despite the success of the policy to  get drug traffickers to surrender, the law can still be  improved. He said the code, contrary to what some groups are  saying, does not grant automatic benefits to drug cartels and  establishes discretionary mechanisms that allow authorities to  impose strict sentences.    The minister said that the recent differences regarding  sentences given to certain criminals arose because of problems  in the way the sentences were applied and the interpretation of  norms. The minister, however, refrained from identifying the  reasons for the problems. He also described as unacceptable  statements made by U.S. Senator John Kerry that Colombia is a  ``narcodemocracy'' and said that ``Colombia is a democracy that  grows stronger each year, a democracy that has made huge  sacrifices to fight organized crime, terrorism, and drugs.''</p>

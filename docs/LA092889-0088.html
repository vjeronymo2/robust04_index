			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> DOG RUN GETS 6-MONTH TEST  </P> <P> The City Council this week approved a "dog run" at Memorial Park for a  six-month trial period, making it the first place in the city where canines  will be allowed to run free.  </P> <P> The run is to be 21 feet by 230 feet and fenced. Dogs will be allowed to roam  without leashes, but must be accompanied by an adult. People will be required  to pick up after their pets. Small scoops might be provided by companies that  produce pet products, according to Barbara Franklyn-Moran, director of cultural  and recreation services.  </P> <P> The run, near Olympic Boulevard, will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. The  council vowed that, if the dog run is successful, more open space would be  provided for dogs.  </P> <P> A Santa Monica group called Pets are Worth Sharing (PAWS) had been campaigning  for the run and collected about 1,000 signatures supporting the idea. One  proponent of the run said "New York City is a less hostile place to dogs than  Santa Monica," which bans dogs without leashes from all parks and beaches.  </P> <P> One critic of the plan said the run is too small and dilapidated. He called the  park a "doggie ghetto" and said it is occupied by homeless people.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> So the baseball season has been saved, much to the relief of the Dodgers'  season peanut-holders.  </P> <P> "About a dozen business people prepay me $2 worth a game for peanuts,"  explained celebrity vendor Roger (The Peanut Man) Owens. "Then I always make  sure to throw to whoever's sitting in their seats."  </P> <P> Owens, whose behind-the-back tosses have won him a scroll from the L.A. City  Council as well as two guest spots on the Johnny Carson show during his  32-year-career, wasn't idle during the labor impasse.  </P> <P> "I've been writing a book on my life," said the former Manual Arts High pitcher  (he threw baseballs, not peanuts, back then).  </P> <P> The tome will tell how he rose from a soda-pop vendor to the more lucrative job  of peanut hawker in his rookie year with the Dodgers. "Now, because of  seniority, it takes a minimum of 17 years to graduate to peanuts," he noted.  </P> <P> But, as with the other veterans, the seasons have taken a toll on the Peanut  Man's body .  </P> <P> "My knees are really starting to bother me," admitted Owens, 47. "My  orthopedist told me I have to slow down when I go down the stairs in Dodger  Stadium because I'm putting too much pressure on my joints."  </P> <P> But he has no intentions of hanging up his goobers.  </P> <P> "My arm's fine," he said. "I've never had peanut elbow."  </P> <P> Maybe this method also would keep out Medflies:  </P> <P> Schoolchildren scared off several swallows attempting to return to San Juan  Capistrano Monday by throwing stones at them.  </P> <P> You are traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sights and  sounds but of mind, a journey past a hotel shaped like an Aztec temple, a hot  dog stand shaped like a pooch, a restaurant with a plane protruding through the  roof, a hosiery shop topped by a giant leg.  </P> <P> Next stop: The Twilight Zone?  </P> <P> Well, sort of: It's L.A., in the 1930s and '40s. Jim Heimann, co-author of  "California Crazy," will deliver a travelogue on Southern California's  eccentric roadside architecture tonight at a dinner hosted by the Art Directors  Club of L.A.  </P> <P> It's at the Sheraton Grande, a hotel built -- as is the conventional custom  these days -- in the shape of a hotel.  </P> <P> But you can still come across an occasional blurring of the line between real  and make-believe in La-La land. Such as:  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich will present a scroll today to the Magic Mountain  amusement park for allowing "use of the Roaring Rapids attraction by the County  Fire Department for swift-water rescue training."  </P> <P> Is there a subtle, cautionary message about the quality of the county's work in  those signs that mark the sites of construction projects?  </P> <P> "Another Public Works Improvement," says one such notice on 7th Street in Long  Beach.  </P> <P> Underneath that announcement, in much bigger letters, the sign warns:  </P> <P> "DRIVE CAREFULLY."  </P></p>

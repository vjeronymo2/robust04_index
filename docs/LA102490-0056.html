			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> RTD run-around?  </P> <P> A Montclair man's bus didn't show as scheduled downtown at 3:30 p.m. In fact,  it didn't show at all -- a clear test of the RTD's new guarantee of a free ride  for anyone whose bus is 15 minutes late.  </P> <P> The next bus on the line pulled up at City Hall at 3:50. The man asked the  driver to stamp his monthly pass, entitling him to a freebie.  </P> <P> The driver said: "I'm not late, I'm on time. I don't have to stamp anything."  </P> <P> Two other passengers told the Montclair man they had been caught in the same  vicious circle on other days.  </P> <P> What gives? RTD spokesman Anthony Greno said the driver was technically  correct. But any such passenger can receive compensation by phoning RTD  Customer Relations at 972-6235.  </P> <P> Or taking the bus over to RTD headquarters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Woody Woodpecker character appeared before the county Board of Supervisors  Tuesday and was christened official mascot of the county's recycling program, a  clear override of Only in L.A.'s veto attempt. We had pointed out in a previous  column that woodpeckers can cause great damage to trees.  </P> <P> Not only did the supervisors ignore us, but we were taken to task by a Woodland  Hills resident who asserted that it was "a sad statement of our times that a  world-famous fictional character" would be compared "to its live counterpart."  </P> <P> She asked whether we should also "abandon such enduring symbols" as Smokey the  Bear because "bears ravage campgrounds and attack people."  </P> <P> No, it's too late to get rid of Smokey. But let's not feed him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Authorities cordoned off a baggage area in the United Airlines terminal Tuesday  to examine a rifle, a hand grenade and shell casings found inside an unclaimed  duffel bag.  </P> <P> Fortunately, there's a Hollywood ending to the story.  </P> <P> They were movie props.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Speaking of props, to get us into the Halloween mood, the L.A. Public Library's  Carolyn Kozo sent over this 1920s L.A. Chamber of Commerce photo of a couple of  young ladies posing cheerily with some plaster skulls. Obviously, the Chamber  of Commerce deserves some credit for the kooky reputation that L.A. has  acquired.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Every once in a while Only in L.A.'s tired eyes come upon an eye-catching piece  of mail.  </P> <P> A since-forgotten local sportscaster once gave us a T-shirt announcing the  time, day and channel of a since-forgotten investigation of high school sports.  </P> <P> Another time we received the announcement of a press conference stamped on a  brick. Then there was the vial of bull semen that arrived in the mail.  </P> <P> Now comes a press packet labeled "Energy Unlimited," which has a small plastic  bag containing a white, powdery substance attached to it.  </P> <P> It's the first press release we ever had to flush down the toilet.  </P> <P> Only afterward did we notice it was chalk powder meant to rub on the hands  while working out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> Here's one the recent PBS "Civil War" series missed: El Monte had such a large  population of Southerners during that war that each time it heard news of a  Rebel victory, a Confederate flag would be raised in the town square.  </P></p>

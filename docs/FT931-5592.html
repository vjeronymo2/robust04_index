			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Met force faces shake-up THE SENIOR ranks of the Metropolitan Police could be reduced as part of a shake-up announced yesterday by Mr Paul Condon, the London force's new commissioner. Mr Condon, who took up the post last month and has a reputation for supporting a more devolved style of management, is considering eliminating about 700 management posts from the 28,300-strong force to get more officers on the beat. He intends to reduce the Metropolitan force's eight areas to five, each headed by its own chief constable. The local chief constables, plus Mr Condon and two or three other senior officers, would constitute a new management board at the centre of the force. Mr Condon acknowledged that his plans would leave many senior officers at chief superintendent and superintendent level in an uncertain position. Many such officers have more than 30 years' service, which gives them protected pensions, and they are likely to be encouraged to take early retirement. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr Condon share a belief that police management has become too top-heavy. The proposals being developed for the Metropolitan force should release funds to put an extra 1,000 officers on the beat. A government inquiry into police responsibilities and rewards headed by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT industries, is due to report in May. This is expected to advocate a reduction in senior ranks and the introduction of a flatter management structure in forces throughout the country.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN writes about the hideous  massacre perpetrated by the Zionist settlers under the  protection of the Israeli occupation forces in the holy Ibrahimi  Mosque in the occupied Palestinian city of Hebron yesterday.    The paper says: This massacre not only reminds us of the  terrorist massacres and mass killings in Dayr Yasin, Qibyah,  Kafr Qasim, Bahr al-Baqar, Da'il, and al-Samu', it also proves  the impossibility of coexistence between Arabs and Israelis as a  result of the fascist Zionist rancor against the Arabs.    TISHRIN says: This massacre was premeditated, planned, and  carefully studied. This is confirmed by the number of victims  who were killed or wounded. This is also revealed by the  killing of Palestinians which continued after the massacre at  the hands of the occupation troops in Hebron, Bethlehem, the  Gaza Strip, Jerusalem, and Nabulus, and which also extended to  Nazareth and the entire 1948 territories to 'Ayn Mahil, Kafr  Kanna, and Umm al-Fahm until they reached the Golan.    TISHRIN adds: Our people's wrath indicates that occupation  will inevitably vanish, that resistance must be escalated  against all the manifestations and pillars of the occupation,  and that capitulation and relinquishment of rights is  calamitous, especially since the Ibrahimi Mosque's massacre was  only one of the manifestations and results of the Oslo agreement  which gave Israel all that it wants and granted it all that  would enable it to continue its occupation and impose its  control on our people's destiny and their national and pan-Arab  will. What kind of peace is that which was produced by the Oslo  agreement? It is the peace of settlers who kill Arabs, violate  honor, defile sanctities, control the land, and imposes  capitulatory conditions.    TISHRIN stresses: Israel is still completely hostile to  peace. It still adheres to all its crimes. It perpetrates  massacres and falsely claims that they are perpetrated by  individuals. It shamelessly conceal the facts of its hideous  terroristic practices.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Although it is difficult to forget  the results of the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque without  forcing Israel to pay the price for what it has done to our  people, it has also unequivocally proved that occupation and  peace cannot go together, and that the road to peace cannot pass  through partial agreements and separate deals, but through the  full termination of occupation and the achievement of a just and  comprehensive peace.    In two articles, the newspaper also writes about the  bloodbath at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in the occupied city of  Hebron at dawn yesterday. Under the headline "Crime and  Responsibility," AL-THAWRAH says: Yitzhaq Rabin's government  has hastened to acquit itself of responsibility for the  massacre and to hold one person responsible. It came out with  several stories harmonizing with its known policy of blaming  provocative mass carnages on deranged Israelis, as it claims.    AL-THAWRAH stresses: The Rabin government's disinformation  campaign concerning this heinous massacre and its attempt to  acquit itself of responsibility for it cannot be accepted by  anyone, especially since the occupation forces guard all  entrances to the Ibrahimi Mosque, and consequently, no armed man  can enter without the approval of those Israeli forces.    AL-THAWRAH says: Moreover, we cannot separate the occupation  soldiers' killing and wounding of a large number of Palestinians  who were shocked by the crime and took to the streets in the  cities and villages of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip  from the timing of the massacre.    It says: Killing Palestinians in the occupied territories  and dealing with them as if they were strangers, and arming  Jewish settlers and supporting their crimes against Arab  citizens have become an official policy adopted by the Rabin  government. This policy has been escalating since the Oslo  agreement. This shows the Rabin government's hostility to peace  and stability, and its adherence to Israel's 1948 policy which  was based on a firm ideology concerning the perpetration of  massacres and daily killing of Palestinians. This also proves  that this government has no intention to withdraw from the  occupied territories or even to stop the establishment of Jewish  settlements on them.    Concluding its article, AL-THAWRAH calls on the U.S.  Administration, the cosponsor of the peace process, to adopt  fair stands toward what is taking place in the occupied  territories in harmony with its principles of preventing  aggression and terrorism. Moreover, all aid to Israel should  stop, and the principles of the international legitimacy should  be implemented to achieve peace and stability in the region.    In another article on the same subject, AL-THAWRAH calls on  the international community to immediately and bravely assume  its responsibilities and to take the necessary measures to  secure protection for the Palestinians under the Zionist  occupation by terminating this occupation, especially after this  crime has proved to the world the extreme danger of the  continuation of occupation of Arab territories and of settling  on these territories. This danger can only by eliminated by  enabling the Palestinian people to determine their future in  accordance with the UN Charter and resolutions, particularly  those resolutions on which the peace process is based.</p>

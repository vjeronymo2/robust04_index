			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa met Palestinian president  Yasir 'Arafat this evening. Members of the delegation  accompanying the Palestinian president attended. They discussed  developments in the Palestinian issue and continued discussing  topics that the Palestinian president reviewed today with  President Mubarak.    Musa said afterward that he held contacts with Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres today on the Palestinian-Israeli  peace talks and added that he hopes the talks will continue. He  expressed his hope that the car bomb in Israel today will not  affect the negotiations, because the peace process is important  and fundamental. He said the peace process can put an end to  violence and that the launch of a Palestinian entity,  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho Accord, and a move toward  implementing the timetable will all pacify the situation. He  noted that what is required is a fast and sincere implementation  of the provisions of the Declaration of Principles.    Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat said his talks with  President Husni Mubarak and Musa today were important, positive,  and constructive and would contribute greatly to advancing the  peace process. He added that regrettably, the Palestinian side  has seen no real gestures from the Israeli side for a precise,  sincere, and swift implementation of what was agreed upon  recently.    [In two related Cairo-datelined reports, at 1835 GMT and  1845  GMT respectively on 6 April, Cairo MENA in Arabic adds the  following: "Musa ruled out the possibility of visiting Israel  right now."    ["'Arafat refused to answer a question on the explosion in  Israel today."]</p>

Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DOCTORS' SLIP COSTS LIVER DONOR HER SPLEEN DURING TRANSPLANT  </P> <P> Doctors performing a historic liver transplant operation involving a living  donor today accidentally damaged the donor's spleen and were forced to remove  it.  </P> <P> The spleen of Terri Smith, 29, of Schertz, Tex., was damaged as doctors removed  a portion of her liver to implant in her 21-month-old daughter, Alyssa, who  suffers from biliary atresia, a spokesman for the University of Chicago  Hospital said.  </P> <P> A retractor came loose during surgery and hit the spleen, said Dr. Peter  Whitington, director of pediatric transplant services. The spleen was then  removed, forcing a delay in preparations for Alyssa's surgery.  </P> <P> The loss of the spleen will not adversely affect Smith, doctors said.  </P> <P> Doctors said they expect the surgery on the youngster to continue into the  evening.  </P></p>

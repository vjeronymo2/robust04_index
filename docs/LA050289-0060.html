			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Lech Walesa, leader of Poland's independent union Solidarity, has accepted an  invitation from the AFL-CIO to make his first trip to the United States and  speak at the AFL-CIO convention in Washington in November, the Washington Post  reported. Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the AFL-CIO, said this is the third  time that Walesa has accepted an invitation from the federation. On the  previous two occasions he was not given permission to leave Poland. However,  Solidarity regained its legal status this year, and the Polish government has  allowed Walesa to travel abroad.  </P></p>

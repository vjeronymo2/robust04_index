			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: FII declines 13% to Pounds 3.2m FII Group, the UK's second largest shoe manufacturer, suffered a 13 per cent setback in profits to Pounds 3.2m pre-tax for the six months to November 30. An exceptional provision for redundancies, reorganisation and associated costs accounted for Pounds 200,000 of the shortfall. Turnover of Pounds 40.2m (Pounds 39.7m) included exports of Pounds 6m (Pounds 5.5m). The interim dividend is lifted from 5p to 5.5p. Directors said liquidity remained strong with cash balances of nearly Pounds 10m.</p>

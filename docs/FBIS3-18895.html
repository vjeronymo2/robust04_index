			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gerard Longuet, minister of industry and </F> foreign trade, by Marc Paoloni; place and date not given:  "Gerard Longuet: `The Three Large Powers Have an Interest in  Talking Together'"]    [Text] [Paoloni] On Monday [7 March] in Brussels you are  said to have agreed to a rather soft condemnation by the Twelve  of the U.S. use of the Super 301 weapon against Japan. On the  eve of your visit to Tokyo and one month after the signing of  the Uruguay Round agreements [as published], is that not a  mistake?    [Longuet] No. The Twelve felt that this was a decision made  by the United States during the interim period separating us  from the entry into force of these agreements and, to some  extent, that it was the "last" recourse to the Super 301. The  Twelve also clearly expressed their great concern and repeated  their vigorous opposition to any form of unilateralism used to  settle trade disputes. Moreover, the European Commission was  given the task of ensuring that the Community's interests are  not threatened.    [Paoloni] The fact remains that another GATT member, Japan,  is itself definitely threatened by unilateral trade sanctions.    [Longuet] Mickey Kantor let us know that this decision was  made in order to prevent the use of more radical measures,  bearing in mind how Congress feels about the conflict between  the United States and Japan. In this showdown with the  Japanese, the Americans are even asking us if we are prepared to  given them a hand.    [Paoloni] What is the answer?    [Longuet] The Europeans have remained very cautious. They  have condemned the unilateralism while at the same time  acknowledging that there is a fundamental problem with Japan  that will have to be dealt with some day.    [Paoloni] Will you take any initiatives in this area during  your stay in Tokyo?    [Longuet] If I were to suggest an idea, it would be to say  to  the Japanese that the three large trading powers have an  interest in talking together. Experience shows that  tete-a-tetes rather quickly turn into conflicts and that it  would perhaps be more judicious to move on to a "trilogue."  This is all the more true since a bilateral agreement between  Japan and the United States may well be useful, but if this  agreement is reached to the detriment of other partners, we  cannot accept it. Hence the idea of having three of us around  the table. There is a roadblock between Washington and Tokyo  and both of them need an ally; the Americans so that they do not  get themselves condemned for taking excessive unilateral  measures and the Japanese so that they can try and make the  Americans understand that if there is a trade deficit there are  perhaps structural reasons which cannot be solved by coercive  measures.    [Paoloni] What are the objectives of your visit to Tokyo as  far as France is concerned?    [Longuet] First of all, I would like to gain information  about the economic policy of the Japanese authorities and their  objectives; second, about their investment plans in Europe; and  lastly, I would like to encourage them to take the path of  modest but significant market openings, which we have obtained.  Indeed, for six months now, Japan's market has been open to  three French products: public works, where GTM [Marseille Heavy  Construction Works] won an initial contract; pork; and the  purchase of Eurocopter helicopters by Japanese governmental  departments.    [Paoloni] As regards investments, there must be at least one  about which you are primarily concerned.    [Longuet] Of course. As a representative of the main  shareholder in Bull, I will meet with NEC [Nippon Electronics  Corporation], one of the two private shareholders in the French  company. However, I will also talk to my interlocutors about  other issues of interest to France: the automotive sector,  telecommunications, the agrofood sector, etc. Since I will be  accompanying the prime minister to China, I am also interested  in relations between Japan and China.    [Paoloni] With regard to China, how do you view its  application to join GATT?    [Longuet] These membership negotiations will be a good  opportunity to introduce social concerns into relations with  that major partner -- concerns which we are not yet in a  position to decree and impose within the framework of a world  trade organization. Indeed, one cannot imagine Europe  supporting this membership if there are no corresponding serious  commitments made by China in this area. To some, that might  seem to be overly formal, but we must bear in mind the fact that  the whole system of international progress advances by small  steps. The Uruguay Round took us almost 10 years to complete.  Environmental and social concerns are our next objectives in  the medium term.</p>

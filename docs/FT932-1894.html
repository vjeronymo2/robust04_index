			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Union warns Nestle on hours plan THE AEEU engineering union warned yesterday that Nestle could be heading for confrontation if it tried to force the introduction of annualised hours at its Findus frozen foods plant in Newcastle. The plant, one of Nestle's 26 UK factories, is the first at which Nestle has proposed moving from conventional shift working to an annualised hours system, which gives each employee a number of hours to be worked per year, which is then flexibly allocated according to production needs. The change, linked to the reduction of the working week from 39 to 37 hours without loss of pay, would give the company greater flexibility in determining work patterns. The AEEU says it would also give it the right to call in employees at 48 hours' notice, on any day, to work some of their contracted annual hours. The plan for the plant, understood to be making losses, is linked to a commitment to no redundancies under the restructuring programme. Mr Davey Hall, AEEU Tyne district representative, said it had been unanimously rejected at the weekend at a packed meeting of hundreds of Findus Newcastle workers. Many of those affected, he said, were female part-time employees who feared they would be unable to combine the proposed flexible work hours with family commitments.</p>

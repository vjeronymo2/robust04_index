			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / No mass yet to the market: Despite new services, UK mobile 'phone charges remain a deterrent On the surface, the UK's mobile communications industry has just entered an intensely competitive phase. In the past few months, consumers have been bombarded with advertising campaigns for three new services claiming to be much cheaper than the standard cellular services, and at least four more are to be launched later this year. Vodafone and Cellnet, the two established cellular companies, spent about Pounds 20m on advertising in the last quarter of 1992 and, despite the recession, their customers grew by 163,000 last year, more than double the 1991 growth. The current marketing ferment gives the impression of a price war. Although there are 1.4m cellular 'phone users in the UK - about twice as many as Germany, France and Italy respectively - almost all are business users. Observers believe the market could reach 10m by 2000, if the price is right. Could the latest marketing be just what is needed to bring about a mass market? The answer is probably no, because prices have not fallen. For instance, Vodafone's new Lowcall and Cellnet's new Lifetime services - jointly nicknamed 'Lowlife' - have cheaper subscription charges than the companies' standard cellular services, but higher call rates. The result is that customers calling more than once a day actually pay more with the new pricing packages. The only large price discounting has come from Rabbit, a 'telepoint' service run by Hutchison Telecom. But this is not a direct competitor to cellular, since customers cannot receive incoming calls and can only make outgoing calls in public places where they see the Rabbit sign. These limitations explain why only 8,000 have signed up. The mix of vigorous marketing and an absence of price cuts continues a pattern which has been a feature of the cellular industry since its birth in 1985. The reason is that neither Vodafone nor Cellnet, owned jointly by BT and Securicor, has an incentive to jeopardise substantial profits by launching a price war. And there is no outside pressure to do so, since they were established as a protected duopoly, not subject to price regulation. Vodafone made operating profits of Pounds 152m from sales of Pounds 320m in the six months to the end of last September - a margin of nearly 50 per cent. Cellnet, which started losing market share in the late 1980s, made operating profits of Pounds 75m from sales of Pounds 184m - still a margin of over 40 per cent. Could the entrance of competitors undermine this duopoly? That was certainly the idea behind the government's decision in the late 1980s to license three personal communications networks, a variation on cellular communications, as Cellnet and Vodafone rivals. But things have not worked out exactly as planned. Microtel, one of the new networks, was sold when its backers got cold feet over raising the required Pounds 1bn investment. There are still doubts over whether the new owners, Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa and British Aerospace, are willing to put up the cash. This leaves Mercury Personal Communications, a merger of the two remaining personal communication networks. A joint venture between the UK's Cable and Wireless and US West, MPC plans to launch its service in the middle of the year. The new 'tripoly' will almost certainly be more competitive than the old duopoly. But it remains to be seen how a market with two established players and one entrant will work. The signs are that all parties wish to avoid a price war. Mercury, in particular, has made clear that it does not want to compete head-on for Vodafone's and Cellnet's existing customers. This might seem odd. But MPC knows that a head-on attack would provoke a price war, which it would not be well placed to win. This is because initially its service will only be available in the south-east, while it will need to subsidise handset prices by about Pounds 200 a customer because they will be more expensive to make than standard cellular ones. Moreover, its network design is such that it will only be profitable if it eventually attracts more than 1m customers. 'I don't want to fight over 1.4m customers because that is not enough,' explains Mr Richard Goswell, MPC's managing director. Instead, the company plans to develop a new segment of the market consisting of small businesses and affluent consumers. Mr Goswell promises 'significantly' cheaper prices - rivals expect cuts of about 30 per cent - to achieve this. Its biggest discounts will be on the cost of making incoming calls, which will be less than half current rates. MPC believes this will be an important selling point. But its rivals cannot understand why MPC would give up a large slice of easy revenue, when cutting incoming charges will not lower customers' bills at all. Cellnet goes so far as to describe the move as 'mad'. Nevertheless, MPC's segmentation approach suits Vodafone and Cellnet. It seems to offer them a way of cutting prices for new customers, while keeping margins high on existing business. Their strategy is to devise pricing packages which appeal to new segments of the market but are not so generous that the existing market is 'cannibalised'. Vodafone has two initiatives planned. The first, called GSM and aimed at the international executive, will allow customers to use their 'phones in many other parts of Europe. It will cost 20 per cent more than the standard service. The second, MCN, will be in direct competition with MPC. Customers will receive large discounts if they make local calls from their local areas, but charges will rise if they make national calls or move outside their local areas. Somebody driving along the motorway or in open countryside will pay twice the current rate, which should deter many customers from switching. A similar pricing package, LSM, is planned by Cellnet. It admits candidly: 'We'll get the impression of price wars but not the reality.' All this means that 1993 will not witness the birth of a mass market. To achieve that, prices would have to drop sharply. The average running costs of Pounds 700-Pounds 800 are the main obstacle. Industry executives acknowledge charges will have to fall by half to appeal. But Vodafone's and Cellnet's fat profit margins give them both scope to make discounts of that order and Mercury's network design means it will eventually be driven to expand the market. So, although 1993 will see only the appearance of a price war, the reality may not be that far off.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- MOBILE SERVICES: COMPARING THE COST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Vodafone   Vodafone  Vodafone       Vodafone                      Standard    Lowcall       GSM            MCN  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly subscription (Pounds)                   29          18       35              23  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Outgoing calls Peak rate/minute (p)                     29-39       54-63    35-41           12-76  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Incoming calls Peak rate/minute (p)                        39          39       39              39  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Customers (thousands)               749          46        -               -  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment so far (Pounds m)                550         N/A       80              30  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Launch date              1985        1992     Spring         Autumn                                                1993           1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Coverage                                      90 per- (now or at             Nation-      Nation-   cent of        Fairly launch)                wide          wide    population    nationwide  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Cellnet    Cellnet    Cellnet                      Standard   Lifetime       LSM     MPC     Rabbit  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly                                    Cheaper   Cheaper subscription                                  than      than (Pounds)                29       15-18    standard  standard      7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Outgoing calls                             Cheaper   Cheaper Peak rate/minute                              than      than (p)                  29-39          59    standard  standard     23  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Incoming calls Peak rate/minute (p)                     39          39         39       39     N/A  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Customers (thousands)            558          44          -        -       8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment so far (Pounds m)             600         N/A        100+     300      80  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Launch date           1985        1992       1993     mid      1992                                                       1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Coverage                                     London   London  Urban (now or at           Nation-     Nation-   Manchester South-  centres &amp; launch)               wide        wide     Birmingham east    main roads  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT research and Mobile Communications  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Subscription and call rates include VAT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

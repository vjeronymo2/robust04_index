			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (4): Clearing the way - Profile, KFB KOREA FIRST BANK, the country's second largest commercial bank, has gained a reputation for being the most aggressive among the older banks in preparing for a deregulated financial market. The efforts it has made to rationalise operations, such as reducing staff levels and introducing automation, are already bearing fruit. It reported the largest profits among Korean commercial banks last year, with a 53 per cent climb in net earnings to Won147bn. Net profits rose by 77 per cent to Won81bn during the first half of 1993 and analysts expect earnings to reach Won150bn for the full year. Its operating income grew by an impressive 88 per cent in 1992, although this will slow to only 9 per cent growth this year because of the economic slowdown and weaker demand for credit. The Office of Bank Supervision rated KFB as the best managed bank in 1992. The rationalisation programme was launched by Park Ki-jin, who became the bank's president in 1991. It was thus ironic that Mr Park was forced to resign this spring when it was alleged that he had provided questionable loans to a failed property company run by his brother. He was the third bank president forced from office this year as a result of a government investigation into corrupt practices in the banking industry. Mr Park's departure, however, has not slowed down the reforms at KFB, which was established in 1929 as the Savings Bank of Korea. The main emphasis remains on improving efficiency. An elimination of 300 jobs over the past two years has reduced the staff level to 8,900, around 600 fewer employees than at the other main banks. It already has the lowest ratio of overhead costs per unit of operating income at 44.7 per cent against an industry average of 48.2 per cent. The bank plans further job cuts through natural attrition that will reduce its staff to 8,360 by 1995, even as it increases its domestic network - the smallest among the big city banks - to 305 branches from the current 276. KFB is depending on the installation of automatic cash-point machines, which have only been recently introduced to Korea, and upgrading computer systems to compensate for the personnel cuts. It is also promoting a progressive personnel management policy in an attempt to improve customer service. Last year, it became the first Korean bank to guarantee equal career advancement opportunities for employees. Profits have been improved by deft financial management. It relies less than other banks on holding certificates of deposits, the costliest source of funds. It has become an aggressive trader in the stock market and reported the industry's biggest gains from securities last year. It also recorded the second-best performance in the industry for managing trust assets after the Bank of Seoul, which specialises in the trust business. KFB must still contend with the critical problems that are also affecting the other older banks. It has a high percentage of non-performing loans, amounting to Won11,855bn or 6.9 per cent of total credits, although its provisions for doubtful accounts has reached 2.1 per cent of loans, above the central bank's 2 per cent guideline. It may also need to raise new equity to meet the Bank of International Settlements' capital adequacy ratio of 8 per cent by 1995. The bank claims that its equity/assets ratio is 10 per cent, but independent analysts estimate that the ratio is closer to 7 per cent. Nonetheless, its capital base remains strong. Total assets amounted to Won27,498 at the end of 1992. It accounts for 14 per cent of loans and 17 per cent of deposits among the commercial banks. Its business is heavily oriented toward the corporate sector, accounting for 90 per cent of loans which are almost evenly divided between large and small companies. KFB, which is already one of the most active Korean banks overseas, is now concentrating on expanding international activities. It has developed its foreign exchange business by taking the unusual step for a Korean bank of hiring outside dealers. It is taking a lead in international financial trading, including floating bonds overseas and managing international syndicated loans. But net profits from its overseas branches fell by 25 per cent last year to Dollars 9.7m because of large loan loss reserves following a sharp rise in non-performing loans. Loan loss provisions are expected to rise further this year.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Survey of Spain (1): All depends on Gonzalez - After 10 years in power, the Socialists face an election that they seem unlikely to win outright. It is hard to find anyone with a good word to say about them. But Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, may still have a chance to stop the rot IF recessions were tests of national mettle, Spain would not be doing very well at all. Two quarters of falling GDP and the country is behaving as if the sky had fallen in. Partly, this is simply the impression the anti-government print media (that is to say, most national newspapers) are trying to foment ahead of this year's general election. Every march of farmers or steelworkers on Madrid, every unhappy economic statistic, is magnified and trumpeted from the opposition ramparts. The cobwebbed old views of the government's critics in big business and the unions have been polished up and paraded as new evolutions of political thought. It is pre-campaign politics as usual, with the Socialist government paying the price of a decade in power. It says it is sticking to its orthodox economic guns and is lambasted for having no new ideas. A new jobs programme is rejected as too little, too late. When Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, went to France last year to support the French government's Yes campaign in the Maastricht referendum, he was attacked for not asking Spaniards the same question. When his main conservative opponent flew to Paris a few weeks ago for a 10-second photo opportunity with Mr Jacques Chirac, he was hailed as a statesman. But the media froth does not entirely smother the view. For above it, or through it, a picture of a very depressed Spain is emerging. In the cities, smooth financial types who have basked in the reflected international glory of Mr Gonzalez for most of the 10 years the Socialists have been in power have begun to say he should go now that their jobs may be threatened by recession. In the countryside, recent polls show the Socialists can count on the sure support of only two of the country's 17 autonomous regions - Andalucia and poverty-stricken Extremadura. By no coincidence, these are the only regions where Madrid operates a rural unemployment scheme under which small town mayors pay out-of-work farm workers a special benefit. Most of the mayors are Socialist and provided the payments keep coming, it stays that way. The polls may be misleading. Certainly, the Socialists think they are. But with company failures running at record levels, unemployment over 3m and little chance of respite this year, it is hard to find anyone with a good word to say about the government. It is odd, though. Unemployment may be above 20 per cent now but at the very height of the boom in the late 1980s, it was still well above 15 per cent. Spain is also much richer than the last time it was in this much economic trouble and should be able to deal with it far more smoothly. All this makes it difficult to know whether Spaniards are depressed or whether they think they are or whether they think they ought to be. The answer matters for two reasons. First, Spain's allies are learning what may be valuable lessons about how the country reacts when the going gets tough. Second, it makes it easier to live with the uncertainty about who will win the election. It could be another eight months yet. What matters is which big party gets to form what will almost certainly be Spain's first democratically elected coalition or minority government since the end of the civil war in 1939. Another overall majority, least of all a fourth one for the Socialists, seems impossible now. There are only two contenders - the Socialists and the conservative Partido Popular (PP), the democratic progeny of Franco's movemiento. For the last 10 years the Socialists have kept the AP/PP at bay by holding firmly to the middle ground in economic and social policies. It has taken the PP that long to begin to bury its Francoist past. Now for the first time, the PP is making a real effort to shove the Socialists off the centre line, especially on economic policy. They are promising tax cuts where the Socialists have been forced to delay them. They will privatise deeper and faster than the government. This will help, the theory goes, to cut interest rates which have been kept artificially high in order to attract foreign investment to feed the state's vast appetite for debt. With low interest rates and lower taxes, Spain will be able to resume its happy progress. Business has already given the PP its blessing, though that is little wonder. To put it politely, a PP-led administration would be very close to the Spanish employers' organisation, the CEOE, whose president, Mr Jose Maria Cuevas, is a much more cogent critic of the government than the PP leader, Mr Jose Maria Aznar. The PP, which is gaining support in the cities, could just win enough seats to allow it to put together a coalition, though it is far from clear with whom that would be. It is also not clear that it would be in a position to do any of the things it claims to stand for. Most of Spain's public sector companies are loss-makers and probably unsellable. The other few are already being privatised, though slowly. In addition, the conservatives have little appetite for the dereg- ulation the Socialists are forcing upon the country's service industries. The difference a PP-led government would make would be threefold. First, it would refocus economic policy priorities towards local business, probably paying less attention to the country's image among foreign investors. Second, it would force the pace on devolving more political power to the country's autonomous regions - because to be in government the PP needs to join forces with at least one and possibly two regional parties which would probably demand a high price for their co-operation. Third, foreign policy would become more nationalistic. Mr Gonzalez has until the end of November to hold his election, and hopes that by then some good economic news will have begun to seep into the arena. Inflation is at least falling and making room for dramatic interest rate cuts later in the year. On the whole, the prime minister has little to be ashamed of after 10 years in power although he has been remarkably slow to appreciate the damage that repeated charges of corruption have done to his party. Only now, as a scandal over clearly illicit party financing has become more toxic than most, is he showing any signs of concern. The mixture of recession and corruption is potent. According to an important recent poll in the El Pais newspaper, the Socialists and the PP are neck and neck, with the Socialist vote falling fast. The danger to the government is that if nothing is done, there might come a point where the trend becomes irreversible. The only person who can do anything is Mr Gonzalez. For all the party's posturing to his left, it needs him to win. He has to stop the rot before the August summer break, perhaps long before. One opportunity will be a state of the nation debate later this month. People have been saying for years that Felipe is tired and dispirited. The next few weeks will tell. He has to pull his socks up.</p>

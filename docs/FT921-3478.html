			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Daily News loss mounts THE Daily News, the New York tabloid acquired last year by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, says its losses in February were higher than expected and that it no longer expects to break even this year, writes Alan Friedman. The newspaper, which has filed for protection from creditors, is meanwhile searching for a buyer. Thus far the main candidate is Mr Peter Kalikow, owner of the rival New York Post who filed last year for personal bankruptcy protection.</p>

In letters sent to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  and other U.S. officials, the Ministry of International Trade  and Industry insisted that many pacts have worked well on  raising imports of U.S. products, the official said. These  letters point to the fact that Japan's imports of U.S. beef  nearly doubled in 1992 from 1988 following a bilateral trade  agreement and that the ratio of foreign products to government  purchases of computers climbed to 18.9 percent in fiscal 1992  from 8.8 percent in fiscal 1991.    Also cited in these letters are statistics showing an  increase in sales of imported autos in defiance of a general  market slump and progress in cooperation between Japanese and  U.S. firms in boosting the U.S. share in Japan's chip market.  In bilateral talks on a new trade framework, the United States  has insisted past trade pacts have not worked well because of a  lack of objective criteria.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Utah's proposed revision at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;201&hyph;110 and 645&hyph;201&hyph;120 to provide that only coal exploration operations on lands which are not subject to 43 CFR parts 3480&hyph;3487 will be regulated by the Division is thus an appropriate limitation on the Division's regulatory authority and is consistent with the corresponding limitation in the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, although the specific responsibilities of a State regulatory authority in administering the coal exploration program within a State are not addressed in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 772 for coal exploration, the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 731.14(c)(1) requires each State to have enacted and promulgated laws and regulations which will allow the State to implement, administer, and enforce its program, and to regulate coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with SMCRA. Utah's proposed regulations at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;220 and 645&hyph;200&hyph;230, specifying the regulatory responsibilities of the Division, are thus consistent with the requirements of 30 CFR 731.14(c)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the foregoing discussion, the Director finds that Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;200&hyph;220, 645&hyph;200&hyph;230, and 645&hyph;201&hyph;100 through 645&hyph;201&hyph;130 are not inconsistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 772. The Director approves these proposed rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Following are summaries of all substantive written comments on the proposed amendment that were received by OSM, and OSM's response to them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM invited public comments on the proposed amendment (administrative record No. UT&hyph;891), but none were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Federal Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Utah program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In separate telephone conversations on February 11, June 1, and July 29, 1994, the Bureau of Mines stated it had no comments on the proposed amendment (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;893, UT&hyph;933, and UT&hyph;965). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service responded by letter dated March 7, 1994, that it found nothing of significant concern to the agency and again, by letters dated June 8 and August 9, 1994, that it had reviewed the proposed changes and had no comment on them (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;901, UT&hyph;937, and UT&hyph;960). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letters dated March 23 and August 29, 1994, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) stated that it had reviewed the amendment and that there appeared to be no conflict with the requirements of 30 CFR (administrative record No. UT&hyph;904). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers responded by letters dated June 6 and August 10, 1994, that it found the changes to be satisfactory (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;934 and UT&hyph;962). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence and Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> None of the revisions that Utah proposed to make in its amendment pertained to air or water quality standards. Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence with the proposed amendment. However, pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (administrative record No. UT&hyph;891). EPA responded by letters dated February 15 and June 8, 1994 (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;894 and UT&hyph;936), that it had no comments on the proposed amendment and that it did not believe there would be any impacts to water quality standards promulgated under authority of the Clean Water Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from the SHPO and ACHP (administrative record No. UT&hyph;891). By letter dated August 4, 1994, the SHPO indicated, after review of Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;202&hyph;300, that it concurred with the content of the rule and OSM's determination of no effect with respect to the consultation requirements of 36 CFR Part 800 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;959). The ACHP did not respond to OSM's request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

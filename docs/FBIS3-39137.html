			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "f.gui.": "Martinazzoli and Segni Argue Over </F> Symbols and Those Under Investigation"]    [Text] Rome -- It is a pity not to be able to witness the  negotiations between the two (former) Christian Democrats.  [Pact for Italy leader] Segni and [Italian Popular Party, PPI,  Secretary] Martinazzoli are being forced into a trial of  strength that each must win, though they both pretend it will  end in a draw. They are still in dispute over at least two  issues -- candidates and symbols. Segni does not want anyone  under investigation on the joint lists. Martinazzoli still has  to decide what to do about Mattarella, on the assumption that De  Mita will have the sense to withdraw on his own. As for  [Interior Minister] Mancino, also under investigation, the  attitude is that it is better not to attempt too many things at  once, and that whoever prevails will decide what to do.    It seems that the business of the suspect candidates has  given rise to some grotesque episodes. "I will exclude  so-and-so, even though he is not in trouble with the law, so  that you too can be free of anyone who might be tainted." This  is more or less the suggestion Segni is making to Martinazzoli.  But the latter's response is to say that he is willing to forego  standing for reelection himself, precisely in order to make a  gesture of renewal. If Martinazzoli does stay home, however,  Segni must do so too, after being on the political scene for the  past five legislative terms. And so this entertaining dance of  the Christian Democrats is marked by a succession of proposals  made and denied.    The disagreement is not confined to names, whether presumed  or inferred. Segni is also demanding a single symbol -- his, of  course -- for candidates for the proportional quota. In other  words, it is clear that the promoter of the referendum wants to  secure leadership of the group both de facto and de jure. As  usual among Christian Democrats, there had to be a mediation  proposal. This is being attempted by the philosopher, Rocco  Buttiglione, who has one foot in the Pact for Italy and the  other in the Popular Party.    His idea is this: that the popularists yield over the issue  of those under investigation, and that the Pact permits  Martinazzoli to use his own symbol in the electoral contest. It  is only a compromise in a manner of speaking. In fact  Buttiglione would succeed at a stroke in achieving De Mita's  exclusion and at the same time not humiliating Martinazzoli. On  the other hand, the issue of those being investigated is a  matter of principle. Segni absolutely refuses to have them on  the lists. The popularists, however, are urging that an  exception be made for the crime of public funding of the  parties. If money was appropriated for corrupt purposes, they  say, then the veto remains valid. But when it was taken in  violation of a parliamentary law governing public funding of the  parties, then it is a different matter.    Be that as it may, it is clear that the PPI is angry about  their beloved Segni's stubbornness. Segni apparently went as  far as to threaten resignation for the sake of "salvaging" the  principle of excluding those under investigation. But at this  stage it is difficult to distinguish between rumors,  interpretations, and attempts to raise the stakes in the  negotiations. A succession of very confidential separate  meetings were held by Segni at his offices and by Martinazzoli's  popularists at Piazza del Gesu [PPI headquarters]. Late  yesterday evening the Popular Party's Vito Riggio acted as  ambassador between Segni and Martinazzoli. There were  diplomatic missions and external statements in an attempt to  influence the talks.    "A solution of the problem of candidates to be listed  depends  on common sense, humility, and realism," Rosy Bindi suggested,  changing her role as "pasionaria" for that of the good and  conscientious older sister. However, she still addressed the  following sharp remark to Segni: "I would simply point out that  the troops will be needed nevertheless." Basically, for once  Bindi perfectly reflects the feelings of a party newly "reborn"  that feels humiliated by Segni's diktats.    Gerardo Bianco, the PPI's lower house floor leader, referred  to this "pure obsession with the new." Martinazzoli was very  resolute: "It no longer accepts this cursing of the old. This  is a Popular Party which is contesting the elections for the  first time. We are seeking alliances. It seems to me that what  we are creating is politically significant. However, if the  conditions are unacceptable, the minimum rules for a contract  would be lacking."    Martinazzoli warned his friend, Segni: "Nobody is sending me  any messages." The PRI's [Italian Republican Party] La Malfa  commented, somewhat enviously: "If [Democratic Party of the  Left Secretary] Occhetto had received a notice of investigation,  he would still stand as a candidate."</p>

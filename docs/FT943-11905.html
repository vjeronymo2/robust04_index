			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Swiss rethink tunnel plan One of the two rail tunnels Switzerland has proposed drilling through the Alps looks likely to be postponed indefinitely because of cost and increased competition. Swiss parliamentarians, worried that the SFr27bn (Pounds 13bn) project would strain government spending later in the decade, have ordered the federal Transport Ministry to make a fresh study of its viability. The project, known as Neat (New Alpine Transversal Tunnel), was approved by Swiss voters in a referendum two years ago and calls for two high-speed rail tunnels to be built under the Alps to boost north-south goods transport capacity.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Management: A daunting menu for managers - Companies are in danger if they ignore innovative ideas GOOD management ideas have always taken a long time to trickle down from concept into common practice. At least 20 years has been the norm even within a single country, let alone between continents thousands of miles apart. Many Japanese companies were practising what is now called Total Quality Management by the early 1960s, but only in the last few years has it become common currency in the West. Yet now, like everything else in business, the pace of managerial innovation is accelerating under the influence of global competition and communications, and all the other factors that make management today so hectic. Woe betide the company - of any size - that takes a decade or more to emulate the management innovator in Tokyo, Turin or California. Take two powerful but contrasting concepts which ) just happen to be slightly connected. The first has still not become common practice after more than 20 years, while the second is doing so in less than half the time. The first is 'supplier networks' (or 'vendor networks' in the US): the establishment of close relationships between a company and a limited number of carefully selected long-term suppliers, each of which has its own network of sub-suppliers. This approach replaces the traditional annual bidding war between a vast number of actual and potential suppliers, in which the customer company chooses largely on the basis of whose price it can squeeze most viciously. The latest variant of this approach is 'partnership sourcing'. Japanese companies, and American pioneers such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard, were using it back in the 1960s. Britain's Marks &amp; Spencer would also claim to have done so for years (though some critics describe its attitude to its supplier network as dictatorship rather than partnership). The pioneers have demonstrated for decades the advantages of forging much closer relationships, with far fewer suppliers. The benefits include a reduction of the customer company's total cost through three factors: better quality; faster and more reliable delivery; and greater product or service innovation than is possible when customer and supplier companies behave as adversaries. But only now is partnership sourcing starting really to catch on. A survey this summer by the Confederation of British Industry suggested that the proportion of UK companies that use it has still not quite reached half. The second concept is 'time-to-market': the acceleration of the complicated process by which a company develops a new product or service from initial idea into launched reality. Western companies first heard of this about nine years ago and then just in the electronics industry. Most other industries did not pick up the message until the middle or late 1980s. But today there is hardly a company anywhere that is not trying to introduce products or services more rapidly by accelerating its 'development cycle', as the jargon calls it. The connection between the two concepts is that a close relationship with one's external suppliers can help immeasurably in shortening time-to-market. But this is by no means the only facet involved in accelerating one's development cycle, and it tends to receive less attention than purely internal ones. These include the dismantling of departmental walls to introduce so-called 'simultaneous engineering' - in which previously sequential engineering tasks involving different specialists are carried out in parallel. Some advocates of supplier networks feel that 'time-to-market' has taken off more rapidly than their concept for reasons other than the general acceleration of managerial innovation. They argue that time-to-market is a simpler idea to grasp than are supplier networks (or partnership sourcing), and that its benefits are more obvious at first sight. There is a sliver of truth in this. Yet the 'relative simplicity' explanation does not really hold water. It is true that, at first sight, some companies find it difficult to weigh the advantages of partnership sourcing against its disadvantages: primarily the loss of short-term flexibility if a supplier's performance slips, or a competitor offers slightly lower prices. But the same perceptional problem applies to 'time-to-market'. Managers often find it hard to become convinced of its essential message: not merely that it is possible to accelerate the development process without reducing its effectiveness or increasing its cost, but also that faster can mean more effective and cheaper. When it comes to implementation, time-to-market can actually be more tricky than partnership sourcing: overcoming a lifetime of inter-departmental wrangles within a company is often a more monumental task than encouraging internal adversaries to get closer to the company's suppliers. There is an old but valid management adage that insiders often prefer dealing with outsiders to collaborating with each other. The more rapid adoption of time-to-market is explained in part by the general acceleration of management innovation. But there may also be a more fundamental factor: that managers are at last realising that such concepts are not stand-alone approaches to be adopted one after the other over several years, but that they are intricately intertwined and must be digested rapidly in parallel. That certainly applies to the concepts discussed here. It all adds up to a pretty daunting managerial menu. But a very necessary one in today's competitive conditions.</p>

According to the same sources, Moslem forces fired from  infantry arms, grenade launchars, snipers and mortars on the  Serbian districts of Sarajevo -- Grbavica, Dobrinja one and  Dobrinja four, Lukavica, Nedjarice, Ilidza, Vogosca and Rajlovac.    It is further said that Moslems have renewed attacks on the  Serbian settlement of Zlatiste near Sarajevo, trying to cut off  traffic between Sarajevo and Pale, the political and military  headquarters of Bosnian Serbs in the vicinity of the capital  city of the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Intensified Moslem attacks have also been registered in the  region of Doboj, Ozren, Maglaj and Zavidovici, while Moslem  armed provocations persisted near the Teslic, Vlasic, Gradac and  Trebava battlefields (central Bosnia-Herzegovina).    There is no peace either in the region of Gorazde, a Moslem  enclave in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina which has been under U.N.  protection, where Moslem forces persist with their attacks on  neighbouring Serbian towns of Foca, Cajnice and Ustikolina.    Moslem units in the region of Kladanj and Kalesija, in  eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, also continued their  artillery-infantry operations against the Serbian side, Bosnian  Serb sources said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Snub by Washington"] </F>   [Text] The British Government's Northern Ireland strategy  has not been advanced by the decision of the American  Administration to grant the Sinn Fein president, Mr Gerry Adams,  a visa to attend a conference in New York. Dublin and London,  presenting a united front, are seeking to induce Sinn Fein to  attend all-party talks. The carrot is to be implicit  acknowledgement of Sinn Fein's legitimacy. The stick is the  implicit threat to Sinn Fein of a permanent future in outer  darkness, if the party and its IRA terrorist arm refuse to  renounce violence. For weeks now, Mr Adams has been  prevaricating over a decision on whether Sinn Fein will accept  the terms for talks; meanwhile IRA violence has continued. It  remains highly uncertain whether, in the end, the terrorists  will come to the conference table.    Yet, even while the outcome is in suspense, the Washington  Administration has accorded Sinn Fein's president a visa. The  American Government was never in any doubt that the British were  strongly opposed to such a concession at this stage. It is  difficult, therefore, not to interpret Washington's action as a  snub to the British Government, at a time when Anglo-American  relations are already poor -- as Anne Applebaum argues on this  page. Many Americans, along with British opponents of the  Downing Street Declaration, argue that since the Westminster  Government has shown its willingness to traffic with IRA  spokesmen, the American Government can scarcely be blamed for  granting Sinn Fein's leader temporary house-room. But the  consequence, in any event, is to give some comfort to Sinn Fein,  while emphasizing the current divide between Westminster and  Washington.    The British Government is left to try to divine some  possible  benefit from Mr Adams's trip. It is plain that labyrinthine  discussions are taking place within the IRA about the Downing  Street Declaration and the case for joining talks. Sinn Fein's  leader continues to profess his own desire to "bring an end to  the IRA and take the gun out of Irish politics." Optimists  suggest that his American visit might strengthen his hand within  his own movement, to win the argument for laying down arms. It  will be important to watch both how Mr Adams conducts himself in  the United States, and how the American Government and the  Irish-American lobby handle him. The hope must be that they will  encourage him towards the conference table, if only to gain some  political kudos for doing so.    We, like the British Government, would have much preferred  that Washington had not granted Mr Adams his visa; and that the  United States should have made common cause with Dublin and  Westminster in maintaining pressure on Sinn Fein unless or until  the IRA declares an unconditional cease-fire. The Clinton  Administration's fumbles and stumbles in foreign policy make it  difficult to regard any American initiative over Ireland with  enthusiasm. But the decision to admit Gerry Adams sends a more  significant signal about the current state of Anglo-American  relations than about the prospects for the Northern Irish peace  process.</p>

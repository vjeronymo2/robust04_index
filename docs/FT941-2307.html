			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Hurd opposes council shake-up Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has called for the structure of local government to be left alone in Oxfordshire, which includes his constituency of Witney. He is the first cabinet minister to express publicly opposition to the local government review, which is drawing up plans to replace the present two-tier structure of counties and districts with 'unitary' authorities. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, has said he only expects to see two tiers survive in exceptional circumstances in any area. But Mr Hurd said: 'I have come to the firm conclusion that the right answer is to leave things as they are.' There was a theoretical case for unitary authorities but he doubted whether the advantages outweighed the dislocation and possible expense. He had detected 'no popular demand for change'. The Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, is due to announce plans for restructuring Oxfordshire and 11 other counties in early June. Plans for the reorganisation have raised alarm about the effects on education, currently a county responsibility. Ms Margaret Morrissey, co-ordinator of the National Confederation of Parent-Teacher Associations, said parents' groups were campaigning against the move, which they feared could leave schools under-resourced.</p>

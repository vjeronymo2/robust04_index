			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg volatile Merchant bank SG Warburg saw its shares whip around in an otherwise dull market as the effect of poor figures was offset by takeover talk and a large market deal. The shares were 5 off initially. Warburg reported first-half profits down at Pounds 62.5m from Pounds 148.8m previously. But the bank had warned in early October that they would be badly affected by the global slump in bonds, and the fall had no substance to it so the price began to recover. Then, whispers resurfaced that a US investment bank was interested in making an offer for the UK bank. Also, one dealer crossed a line of half a million shares at 635p, well above the market price, and the underlying price leapt forward to close a net 20 higher at 629p.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTHWEST;  </P> <P> COUNCIL LIKES PLANS FOR GOLF COURSE  </P> <P> Plans to refurbish the Los Alamitos Golf Course were greeted with rave reviews  this week as the Cypress City Council approved a request from the developer to  begin renovations.  </P> <P> "It closed a long chapter in our history," Mayor Cecilia L. Age said.  </P> <P> "We are all very happy."  </P> <P> Plans unanimously approved by the council Monday call for the overhaul of the  course, including adding 30 acres of fairways and 11 acres of lakes. The  18-hole course will even get a new name -- the Cypress Golf Club. Dye Equity  Inc. of Colorado is overseeing the renovation. The course was recently  purchased by Fuji Country Co. of Japan.  </P> <P> The council agreed to allow the developer to construct an interim  4,500-square-foot clubhouse while a proposal for a permanent site is drawn up.  Eventually, the golf course is expected to be integrated with the development  of a hotel complex. However, plans for the hotel are not complete, officials  said.  </P> <P> Residents expressed concerns about the cost of playing at the new site, but the  developer has not released any fee schedules. "There are just too many factors  involved to determine green fees at this time," Hamlin said.  </P> <P> The course has been a source of controversy since 1986, when developers tried  to shut it down to build a business park. A plan was approved in April for the  Los Alamitos Race Course and the adjacent golf course.  </P> <P> The project is scheduled to be completed by January, 1992, officials said.

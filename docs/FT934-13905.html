			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Bundesbank says derivatives pose threat to world markets THE BUNDESBANK today warns that the growth of derivatives markets could endanger the stability of the world financial system. In its monthly report, the German central bank argues that the increase in the use of options, futures and other complex derivative instruments has led to an interlinking of the world's financial markets that makes them more 'vulnerable to crisis'. The Bundesbank's concerns echo fears voiced last year by other leading regulators, including Mr Gerald Corrigan, then president of the New York Federal Reserve Board. However, recent reports, including one by the Bank of England, have adopted a more conciliatory tone. Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is based on underlying assets, such as a currency, interest rate or share price. The Bundesbank calculates such transactions for German banks alone totalled DM6,116bn (Pounds 2,490bn) in mid-1993, which is the equivalent of 90 per cent of the balance sheets of the entire German banking sector. The notional amount of futures contracts traded on the world's exchanges every year has reached Dollars 140,000bn (Pounds 92,710bn), while the notional outstanding amount of swaps (contracts entered directly between banks) is about Dollars 4,500bn. In today's report the Bundesbank recognises the positive aspects of derivatives - that they can be used to hedge risks and allow banks and companies more flexibility. But it warns that the collapse of a leading market participant or extreme market turbulence could set off a 'chain reaction', whereby problems in the derivatives markets could prompt a liquidity crisis in the cash markets and endanger the whole financial system. 'Such developments can only be avoided if all market participants are aware not just of all the ways in which such instruments can be deployed, but also of the risks attached to using them,' the Bundesbank says. The central bank warns against 'fair-weather' risk and control mechanisms for derivatives business. And it suggests ways of mitigating the risks. Market participants should improve their risk recognition systems, and disclosure requirements should be improved so that banks cannot hide much of such business 'off balance-sheet', the Bundesbank says.

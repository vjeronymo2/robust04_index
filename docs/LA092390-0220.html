			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ZIMBABWE;  </P> <P> PLAN TO LEGALIZE 1-PARTY RULE SHELVED  </P> <P> Zimbabwe's ruling party decided to drop its campaign to legalize one-party rule  in the African nation.  </P> <P> The move was seen as a political setback for President Robert Mugabe. The  central committee of Mugabe's ZANU-PF party argued that the country is a de  facto one-party state because of the party's hold on Parliament and there is no  need for legal status. Mugabe contends that a multi-party system breeds tribal  conflicts, and he had made a one-party law the linchpin of his plans for the  nation.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARADISE PRESERVED ;  </P> <P> FILOLI, IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, IS A STEP BACK TO THE GOLDEN AGE OF LAVISH  ESTATE GARDENS  </P> <P> THE MOST ELEGANT PUBLIC GARDEN in the state is virtually unknown by Southern  Californians. Located in Woodside, in an oak-speckled valley just south of San  Francisco, it easily compares with the classic European gardens that inspired  its design. Named Filoli, an acronym for "fight, love, live," by its Faustian  builder, William B. Bourn Jr., the estate is now a property of the National  Trust for Historic Preservation. Bourn had the good fortune to inherit a  hard-rock gold mine and the foresight to invest in water -- thus controlling  Northern California's two most valuable resources. Suitably financed, he set  about building his country place in 1916.  </P> <P> He had the perfect spot, at the head of his own Crystal Springs Reservoir,  which supplies San Francisco with water. Willis Polk, the designer of San  Francisco City Hall, did the grand Irish country house, and Bruce Porter, a  painter and designer of stained-glass windows, laid out the gardens (one walled  garden is planted to resemble a window at Chartres Cathedral).  </P> <P> In 1937, Mrs. William P. Roth purchased the property. An avid and knowledgeable  horticulturist, she was careful not to tamper with the original scheme. A crew  of expert gardeners, most of them Italian (many were in their 60s and 70s by  the time the garden was transferred to the Trust), kept the garden impeccably  maintained. Filoli is now one of the few grand estate gardens from the Country  Place Era (which began at the turn of the century and ended with the  Depression) that still looks as it did.  </P> <P> Walking through the gates takes one back to this golden age of lavish gardens.  "When I first arrived, it was like stepping into 'Alice in Wonderland' or the  'Secret Garden,' " recalls Lucy Tolmach, superintendent of the garden. "It was  so charming and so well preserved." A rustic copse of olives softens the  transition from native oak savanna to man-made landscape. Once inside, yews,  hedges and brick walls assert their formality -- everything is prim and pruned.  The gardens are laid out along classic Italian-French lines with a series of  walks connecting enclosed spaces and the allees tying the parts together  visually. As is a characteristic of the Country Place Era, borders are brimming  with flowers in bloom, as they are most of the year (these photographs were  taken last August).  </P> <P> Tours of the gardens are conducted, by reservation only, Tuesday through  Saturday. Dedicated gardeners might enjoy the self-guided tour on Friday, which  allows time to study the plants (reservations not required). Admission: $8; no  children under 12.

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / International Company News: SAS cleared to negotiate four-way European link-up SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System was given the go-ahead yesterday by its Danish, Norwegian and Swedish owners to negotiate an ambitious alliance with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines. The link-up is aimed at establishing a fourth force in the European airline market to compete with British Airways, Air France and Germany's Lufthansa. SAS said its board of directors had authorised negotiations after a review of the airlines' outline plan by its parent companies and the three Scandinavian governments. Under a complex ownership structure, the three governments own 50 per cent of SAS through their respective 50 per cent stakes in the three airline companies which make up 100 per cent of the SAS shareholding. Private shareholders have the remaining 50 per cent of the three airline companies. SAS officials said the intention was still to produce a memorandum of understanding with its three potential partners by the end of the summer, despite signs of resistance to the integration plan, particularly in Switzerland. The Swiss government has asked Swissair to produce an alternative strategy for consideration which would preserve its independence. The four airlines announced in April they intended setting up a jointly-owned company with a single management and balance sheet by next year. SAS, KLM and Swissair would each own 30 per cent of the new company, and Austrian Airlines 10 per cent. The plan envisages 'a profitable, global airline' with an integrated traffic system based on a multi-hub European network, including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Geneva, Stockholm, Vienna and Zurich. Pressure to enter an alliance stems from the need to compete with larger carriers which have the muscle to benefit from greater liberalisation and globalisation of the airline business. These carriers are themselves seeking co-operation agreements and equity investments in other airlines. However, the question of eventual submergence of the four airlines' present identities into a full merger with a common 'brandname' has so far been left open in recognition of potential political objections.</p>

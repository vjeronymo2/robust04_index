			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Emap seeks Pounds 77m for further acquisitions Emap is about to return to the takeover trail, funded by, in what is becoming its regular method, a substantial rights issue. The media and exhibitions group's interests include a wide range of consumer magazines. It plans to raise Pounds 77.2m net of expenses from a 1 for 8 rights issue at 360p a share, underwritten by Schroders, the merchant bank. Sir John Hoskyns, chairman of Emap, said yesterday it continued 'to see attractive opportunities to make small to medium-size acquisitions, which complement our core businesses.' The rights issue would allow it to maintain 'an appropriate level of borrowings consistent with the cash generative nature of its businesses and their prospects in the light of the company's expectations for further growth in the economy.' It is believed that an acquisition could come in a couple of weeks, followed by another within the next two months. Both are believed to be in the UK and in the business and consumer magazines divisions. Within the next six months, if potential deals go well, more than half of the latest rights issue could be spent on targets which have already been identified. In June 1992 Emap raised Pounds 78m through its first rights issue for eight years. The first acquisition to follow, the Pounds 12.6m purchase of the Northampton Mercury Company, came almost immediately. It was joined in August 1992 by the Pounds 4.9m purchase of the Local Government Chronicle. By April this year Emap had spent Pounds 74m on acquisitions, the largest of which was the purchase for Pounds 27.8m of Thomson Business Magazines in February 1993. The pattern of the past two years is likely to continue - the purchase of small to medium-sized companies, without taking on unacceptable levels of debt. Emap does not, however, rule out a very large acquisition if the right opportunity presents itself, although there is no sign of that at the moment. Since April, Emap has spent a further Pounds 105m in acquiring 38 magazines in France. It has also made an unconditional offer to acquire the balance of Trans World Communications, the commercial radio group, which it does not already own. This will result in payments of about Pounds 50m. Emap's last annual report said it was experiencing what it expected to be a gradual, but long term, improvement in advertising, which accounted for about 50 per cent of total revenue. Yesterday Emap said this continued to be the case and that it was 'making progress in line with expectations.' The rights issue was received well in the City and the share price fell by only 3 1/2p to 414 1/2p.</p>

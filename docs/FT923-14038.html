			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow settles back into narrow trading range Wall Street US SHARE prices settled down after Tuesday's program-related sharp losses, but the underlying tone remained weak, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.89 at 3,293.28, having spent most of the session only a few points off the opening mark. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished slightly firmer, up 1.11 at 410.27, while the Amex composite ended 0.40 lower at 379.86, and the Nasdaq composite 0.20 higher at 557.61. Turnover on the NYSE was 201m shares. Overnight losses on foreign markets set the scene for a muted opening in New York, but a rebound in the dollar and recent declines in bond yields helped keep early declines to a minimum. Investors remained concerned, however, about how second quarter corporate earnings will look. The first reports are beginning to trickle in, and the market is unlikely to make up much of the recent lost ground until it has clear proof of improvements in corporate profits. Among individual stocks, sports shoe makers were in the limelight. The market leader, Nike, jumped Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 66 1/8 in heavy trading after the company reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings of 92 cents a share, up from 76 cents a share and above the average of analysts' forecasts. Going in the other direction, LA Gear dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 10 5/8 on a second quarter loss of Dollars 1.29 a share after taking a 68 cents a share litigation settlements charge. Georgia-Pacific fell another Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 54 1/2 after Dean Witter Reynolds, the broking house, cut its 1992 estimate to 50 cents a share from Dollars 1.50 cents a share. This follow's the company's warning on Tuesday that it would only just break even in the second quarter. Giant Industries rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 6 1/2 after the company projected second quarter net income of as much as 27 cents a share, which would represent a strong turnround from the loss it incurred at the same stage a year ago. First Virginia Banks rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 48 1/4 on news of second quarter earnings well up on a year ago. On the Nasdaq market, Roadway Services fell Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 62 after the broking house, Alex Brown &amp; Sons, cut its rating for the stock from 'buy' to 'neutral' and lowered its 1992 earnings estimate from Dollars 3.79 a share to Dollars 3.50 a share. Durr-Fillauer jumped Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/2 after the rival drug and healthcare group, Bergen Brunswig, announced that it had made an offer for the company of Dollars 26 a share. Exabyte Corp rose Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 29 3/8 after the company reported second quarter net income of 54 cents a share, well up from the 30 cents a share of the second quarter of 1991. Canada TORONTO share prices closed little changed in moderate trading. Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300 composite index gained 2.09 points, or 0.06 per cent, to 3,418.38. Advances edged declines 269 to 260, volume of 24.3m was below the previous 30.8m, and trading value was CDollars 268.9m against CDollars 361m. The real estate sub-group posted the day's biggest decline, down 1.71 per cent on index.</p>

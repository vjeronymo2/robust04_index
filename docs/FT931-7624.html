			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Fears of a Pounds 1bn rights issue in the market together with a general lack of buying interest led to an exceptionally quiet day in the derivatives, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the March contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,838. An initial bout of buying took the contract to 2,846, which turned out to be the high of the day. But talk of a rights issue from ICI unsettled the futures and with the drying up of the earlier buying, March drifted lower. It fell to the day's low of 2,829 over the lunch time period. A firm Wall Street helped the contract recover some of the earlier falls and March closed at 2,842, up 5 on Friday's close and at a premium to cash of about 6 points. Turnover was poor reaching only 4,886 contracts by the close. The traded options sector was equally quiet and saw volume of only 20,781 lots. The business in the FT-SE 100 index accounted for 6,917 contracts with the March 2950 calls the busiest series. The Euro FT-SE 100 index was very dull with only 273 lots dealt by the close. Among the stock options, trading in BTR was particularly heavy and volume rose to 3,162 contracts. The Majority of the trades were carried out in the August 500 calls in which 1,182 lots were dealt. This was followed by Fisons with total volume of 1,445 contracts.</p>

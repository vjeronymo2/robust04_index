			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: A party that dares not change its name - Political Notebook EVEN before the French Socialist party's drubbing at the polls last Sunday, Mr Michel Rocard had raised as part of his 'Big Bang' of wholesale reform the question of his party's name. While not coming out unequivocally for change, the-man-who-would-be-president insisted that it was essential that a change in the party's title was not considered a taboo subject for debate. The French PS - fruit of a three-party coalition in 1971 - has only 22 years of emotional baggage with which to grapple. In the UK in 1959, after four election defeats, Labour grandees momentarily pondered the question before roundly rejecting it. Thirty-four years - and another four consecutive rejection slips from the electorate - later, the issue is still not fit for discussion. Indeed, even though the other great sacred cow - the party constitution's Clause Four commitment to state ownership - has been prodded by Mr Jack Straw, Labour leaders are adamant that the name is not in play. Their main argument is simple, highly conservative and and conveniently identical to that employed to see off any tampering with The Clause: that to tackle the question would provoke a cataclysmic internal row. Mr John Smith himself has echoed that reasoning. He has pointed out that since there is no significant internal demand for changes either to Clause Four or the party name, such unnecessary disputes should - and indeed will - be avoided. Undoubtedly, there is no possibility whatever that the party's name will be changed in the foreseeable future. But that does not contradict the argument that at a time when the party's very raison d'etre is being discussed, it is at least odd that the product's brandname - so consistently rejected by the electorate - is a taboo subject. The reason after all why Mr Straw has managed to raise the question of the clause and live to tell the tale is because some Labour party members tacitly agree with one of his central premises. This is that, even if the question is largely regarded as an irrelevance within the party, it still gravely effects public perception outside. So, indeed, does Labour's name. So what does the word, Labour, evoke? According to Mr Roy Hattersley, it conjures 'shipbuilding, means tests and national plans'. He might have added class conflict, unions, flat caps and the unstated pre-supposition that its enemy is capital - Marxist associations quite as vigorous as those of Clause Four and equally user-unfriendly to modern Britain. Mr Hattersley makes a telling point, however, when he adds that Labour has its positive associations too, from Beveridge to the National Health Service and decolonisation. 'Political parties,' he concluded, 'like infantry regiments need battle honours to lift their morale.' In a more dismissive rejection of the case, the Fabian Society's draft Labour constitution also invokes the warning that 'to change the name would be a dramatic symbol that the party had disowned its history and had become a separate and new entity'. But is that really what it would symbolise? It could equally be argued that the change could be promoted not as a rejection of the past, but a 'dramatic symbol' of its radicalism and readiness to evolve with the times. What might be disowned is not Labour's proud history, but the negative associations evoked by the outdated class-based politics that the current leadership is so anxious to shed. It does not require a training in marketing to realise that any change to the party's brand image would have to be weighed up in a balance of advantages against disadvantages. One of the latter would be the propaganda weapon that would be handed to the Conservatives (another poor brand name for a party that currently promises things are about to change for the better). Yet a majority even among the so-called modernisers believe that the problem is not Labour's packaging, but what is in the box. 'Turning the brand round, not changing the name is what we should be about,' one shadow cabinet member observed yesterday. The most compelling reason for no change is that while Labour may be unsure as to what it stands for now, at least it knows what it once was. On the other hand poor corporate image, as Woolworth's management concluded when it changed its name to Kingfisher, does have its downside too.</p>

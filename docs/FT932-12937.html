			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Attali faces further criticism before EBRD annual meeting THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development yesterday pressed ahead with its efforts to help the economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union as controversy about the bank's high spending continued to dog Mr Jacques Attali, its president. As the bank announced an Dollars 80m (Pounds 51.9m) loan to Romania to improve its roads and launched a new programme on behalf of the United Nations Development Programme to improve management practices in central and eastern Europe, a senior German politician from Chancellor Kohl's Christian Democrat party called for Mr Attali's removal from the top of the EBRD. In a letter to Handelsblatt, the German business newspaper, Mr Karl Fell, spokesman for the influential finance committee of the German Bundestag, also urged Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister and current chairman of the EBRD board of governors, to intervene more in the bank's affairs. Referring to the high cost of fitting out the EBRD's London headquarters, Mr Fell said that 'extravagance on such a scale would normally be regarded as a breach of trust' in Germany. He also accused Mr Attali of being 'professionally out of his depth'. The EBRD's annual meeting gets under way formally today in London with its board of governors, representing the countries owning the bank, due to discuss the costs of its City establishment as well as the bank's progress towards assisting former communist countries develop market oriented economies. It is expected that member countries, if they want to voice criticism of Mr Attali's management style, will save their most forthright comments for a closed session of the board this afternoon rather than express them in the public opening session. However, Mr John Major, who as chancellor played a key role in ensuring the EBRD would be headquartered in London, is expected to underline the importance of the bank providing value for money when he speaks at today's opening ceremony. The British government appears to be satisfied with last week's statement from Mr Attali in which he admitted that mistakes had been made at the bank. It regards the measures that he announced to reinforce the EBRD's management structure, including the plan to appoint a new budget director, as a good basis for further development. Some delegates attending the EBRD meeting also suggested that the bank might emerge strengthened from the recent controversy, with its efforts more clearly focused on assisting the former Communist countries and its member countries taking a greater interest in its affairs.

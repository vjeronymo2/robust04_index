			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WEST VALLEY GROWTH  </P> <P> Thanks to reporter Leslie Berger for her article bringing attention to the  terrible traffic in Encino.  </P> <P> An inaccuracy should be clarified. The population of the Encino Hills has not  grown since the last traffic report was done in 1978, but there has been  tremendous growth of population in the West Valley.  </P> <P> We need more cross-mountain traffic routes. It is imperative that the Reseda  Boulevard extension be completed and that Mulholland Drive be paved between  Reseda Boulevard and Encino Hills Drive to the east. We need to move the heavy  flow of cars, and ensure the health and safety of the Encino Hills  neighborhood.  </P> <P> LAURIE KELSON  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo surges 6 per cent to settle above 17,500 ACTIVE buying ahead of the government's announcement of economic support measures sharply boosted share prices, and the Nikkei average surged 6.1 per cent to close above 17,000 for the first time since July 15, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 1,103.35 to 17,555.00, after opening at the day's low of 16,617.32 and setting a high for the session of 17,596.45 in the afternoon. Volume jumped to 620m shares from 327m on active buying by dealers and investment trusts. Individuals were seen placing small-lot orders, along with foreigners. Rises overwhelmed declines by 1,028 to 41, with 47 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks forged ahead 63.07 to 1,340.45, although in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended just 0.11 firmer at 1,098.35. Investors were encouraged by reports that up to Y1,000bn of public funds would be invested in the stock market as part of the government's support package. Traders said hopes of an easing in monetary policy by the Bank of Japan were also being discounted into share prices. Some investors are worried about the effects of a political scandal, involving one of the country's most powerful pol-iticians. After the market closed, Mr Shin Kanemaru, vice-president of the Liberal Democratic Party, resigned after admitting that he had received political funds from Sagawa Kyubin, a parcel delivery company. Mr Hiromichi Ishikawa, managing director at Yamaichi Securities, said: 'The market could fall some 500 to 700 points, but investors who have not been able to buy will be ready to jump in.' Stocks gained across the board. Activity was led by Ricoh, the office equipment maker, which advanced Y92 to Y682. Activity was prompted by reports that the company would post a double-digit rise in pre-tax profits for this fiscal year in spite of its previous forecast of a decline. Other heavily traded stocks included speculative, Aids-related issues. Green Cross rose Y50 to Y1,390 and Ube Industries, a chemical maker, put on Y63 to Y443. High-technology issues were higher on bargain hunting. Fujitsu gained Y40 to Y610 and Sony Y280 to Y4,290. In Osaka, the OSE average leapt 1,045.39 to 19,145.34 in volume of 30.5m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, added Y700 at Y11,200. Roundup TOKYO'S rise failed to prompt similar action in the Pacific Basin. HONG KONG ended weaker in dull trading after an early rally expired and jittery local investors rushed to take profits. The Hang Seng index finished 18.09 down at 5,460.72, after reaching 5,566.81. Turnover contracted to HKDollars 2.40bn from HKDollars 3.03bn. SINGAPORE was lower in light trading, with SIA Foreign and NatSteel particularly weak. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 9.69 to 1,360.84 in volume of 47.54m shares. NatSteel, which announced poor interim results, fell 23 cents to SDollars 2.71 and led the actives on a volume of 9.34m shares, more than a quarter of total turnover. SIA Foreign dropped 50 cents to SDollars 15.40 on profit-taking. SEOUL closed higher for the fifth consecutive session, although late profit-taking pared gains. The composite index added 6.74 at 520.61. TAIWAN opened higher on bargain hunting in the construction sector, but closed well off the day's best on profit-taking. The weighted index was finally 7.94 up at 3,800.97. Turnover remained thin at TDollars 19.38bn. MANILA fell on fears that the weaker dollar will affect the profits of Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which relies heavily on foreign exchange earnings. The composite index lost 28.18 to 1,426.31 in combined volume of 370m pesos. AUSTRALIA continued to advance but some analysts warned that it was too early to speak of a recovery. The All Ordinaries index put on 8.8 to 1,543.3 in turnover of ADollars 196.3m. News Corp receded 50 cents to ADollars 22.86 as investors took profits following Wednesday's encouraging results. TNT firmed 3 cents to ADollars 1.42 after News Corp said it may sell its 50 per cent stake. NEW ZEALAND was boosted by overseas markets and the NZSE-40 index rose 18.82 to 1,478.34 in turnover of NZDollars 20m. BANGKOK eased after the authorities announced that from today brokers will be barred from trading in 'designated securities'. The SET index dipped 3.81 to 749.04 in low turnover of Bt4.27bn. KUALA LUMPUR gained ground on bargain hunting. The composite index improved 8.05, or 1.4 per cent, to 567.56.</p>

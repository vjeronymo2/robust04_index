			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Number of Names may fall to 20,000 THE number of Names at Lloyd's, the insurance market, is set to fall to around 20,000 - the lowest level since 1982 - following losses of Pounds 2.06bn in the 1989 underwriting year which were announced last year, Richard Lapper writes. A total of 75 new Names - individuals whose assets support the market - are to join this year, but the number who have resigned or have been unable to meet solvency requirements could be as high as 2,000, according to Mr Bob Hewes, director of regulatory services at Lloyd's. A total of 250 Names died last year. Mr Hewes will be one of 16 members of the insurance market's new regulatory council, which begins work this year. The council is to be chaired by Mr Brian Garroway, a former deputy chairman of BAT Industries. Also on the new council are Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, and Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investments Board.</p>

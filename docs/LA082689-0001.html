			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL ACTIVIST NEIL GOOD DIES; LEAVES VOID IN GAY COMMUNITY  </P> <P> Neil Good, a longtime San Diego political activist whose narrow loss in a 1987  City Council race brought pride and a growing sense of clout to the city's gay  community, died late Thursday of complications related to hepatitis B.  </P> <P> Good, a former journalist who served as a top aide to several Democratic  officeholders and was active in a wide range of civil rights and civic  organizations, died at Sharp Cabrillo Hospital of liver failure.  </P> <P> A soft-spoken man with a rapid-fire, often self-effacing sense of humor, the  41-year-old Good had become ill only one month ago. After being diagnosed with  hepatitis, he spent several weeks at home resting, but entered the hospital two  weeks ago when his condition worsened.  </P> <P> Bill Beck, a close friend and spokesman for Good's family, said doctors  determined that his death was not AIDS-related.  </P> <P> "Part of the shock is that it all happened so fast," said Nikki Symington,  president of the public relations firm of Grossman Symington &amp; Good, which  Good joined 1 1/2 years ago. "My first thought today was, if Neil were here,  he'd think of something really funny to say about the whole thing. I wish I  could do that. But I just can't think of anything witty to say today."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Severe Leadership Vacuum  </P> <P> Good's death, coupled with the AIDS-related deaths of other prominent  homosexual leaders within the past year, leaves what several gay activists  described Friday as the most severe leadership vacuum within the gay community  in nearly two decades. In November, physician Brad Truax, for a decade a  preeminent spokesman for San Diego's homosexual community, died. Three months  later, Doug Scott, former president of the San Diego Democratic Club -- the  largest Democratic club in the county, gay or otherwise -- died.  </P> <P> "Our community is in shock and has an incredible void at the top," said  longtime gay activist Nicole Murray. "When Brad died, Neil was the logical one  to turn to. Now, I can't even think of one person to turn to. The second tier  in our community isn't even close to what we had in Brad and Neil. They're  irreplaceable."  </P> <P> "I see no one on the horizon who can duplicate either Brad Truax or Neil Good,  especially their experience, drive and effectiveness in being a spokesman for  the community," said Chris Kehoe, who served as Good's 1987 campaign  coordinator. "Neil had a long history of dealing with city and county officials  and the kind of credibility that no one else can match."  </P> <P> A New Hampshire native who moved to San Diego as a child, Good's political  involvement began when he served as administrative assistant to state Sen. Jim  Mills (D-San Diego) in the early 1970s. He later served a two-year term as  chairman of the San Diego County Democratic Party, ran unsuccessfully for  county assessor and spent seven years as a top aide to county Supervisor Leon  Williams, both at the county and during Williams' earlier tenure as a San Diego  city councilman.  </P> <P> Good's career path also included periodic stints in journalism and publishing.  A former reporter for the San Diego Daily Transcript and the San Diego  Independent, Good founded the Uptown newspaper and published a newsletter  dealing with local government and politics.  </P> <P> A gubernatorial appointee to the California Structural Pest Control Board,  which regulates the pest control industry, Good also served on the San Diego  Urban League's board of directors, the city's Charter Review Commission and the  county's Human Relations Commission, and was active with CASA, an AIDS live-in  project. He also sponsored a proposed initiative calling for the addition of  two seats to the City Council -- the same goal being sought in a lawsuit filed  by the Chicano Federation now pending in federal court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Happens to Be Gay'  </P> <P> Only the second openly gay candidate to ever run for the San Diego City  Council, Good often described himself during his 1987 campaign for the 8th  District seat as "a candidate who happens to be gay, not a gay candidate."  </P> <P> With other major candidates courting the gay vote, sexual preference never  emerged as a central issue in the race. And, though some gays criticized Good  for not being more overt on the issue, most saw his approach as both  politically savvy and indicative of the role that he assigned his homosexuality  in his life.  </P> <P> "By being openly but not brazenly gay, I think Neil handled it just about  right," said Rick Moore, head of public information at San Diego State  University. "He treated it as a part of his background, just like any other  part."  </P> <P> After being heavily outspent by ultimate victor Bob Filner and lawyer Michael  Aguirre, Good finished third in a nine-candidate primary, falling only 383  votes short, out of more than 13,500 cast, to qualify for the runoff.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Part of the System'  </P> <P> That strong showing, combined with the accolades that Good received throughout  the campaign for his articulate mastery of issues, generated immense pride  within the gay community. Aguirre once noted that the other candidates hated to  speak after Good at forums, "because there's nothing left to say but, 'I agree  with Neil.' "  </P> <P> "Things like Neil's campaign make gay people feel like they're a part of the  system, even if the system doesn't want them so much," Moore said. "That's  important, that's empowering, and that helps build self-respect."  </P> <P> Similarly, Murray said he believes that Good's most lasting legacy will be the  positive role model that he was for gays and non-gays alike.  </P> <P> "Neil proved that you can be gay and still be successful and make a  contribution to society," Murray said. "That's an important lesson for both the  gay and straight communities, and Neil made a perfect example to hold out to  people."  </P> <P> Symington, meanwhile, said that she will remember Good as someone who "refused  to acknowledge hypocrisy or apathy on any level. Nothing about life was too  sacred to laugh at or too common to care about."  </P> <P> "It would be a mistake to view Neil's death as a loss just for the gay  community," Moore added. "Because he really showed San Diego that the gay  community has something to offer it. He was a person who made a difference for  all of San Diego."  </P> <P> Good's family plans a private burial. A public memorial service will be held at  2 p.m. Sept. 10 at the First Unitarian Church, 4190 Front St. The family  suggests that contributions be made to the Casa Foundation (Community Actively  Supporting People with AIDS), 1015 Alameda Blvd., Coronado, 92118.  </P></p>

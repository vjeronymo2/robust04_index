			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed OJE: "Belgium Passes Council of Europe </F> Presidency to Bulgaria"]    [Text] Strasbourg, 11 May (BELGA) -- Wednesday [11 May]  marked the end of the six-month Belgian presidency of the  Council of Europe. The committee of ministers of the  organization, which comprises 32 states, will be chaired by  Bulgaria, the first country of Central and East Europe to head  the Council.    Another important event was the signature by all of the  organization's countries except Italy, because of the formation  of its new government, of the protocol of the European  Convention on Human Rights which set up a single court.  Although the protocol has been signed by 31 states, the date  when the court will be operational is not yet known. It is  believed that it will not become operational until 1998 at the  earliest, which is one year after all countries are expected to  have ratified the protocol.    At a news conference, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes  recalled that Belgium had assumed the presidency of the Council  of Europe and that of the European Union at the same time. He  added: "There are still six weeks of troika ahead, and then we  can have some rest." He said the 32 states had talked a lot  about Russia's application for membership to the Council of  Europe.    Stressing that the presence of foreign troops on the  territory of a sovereign state against the will of the latter is  contrary to the principles of the Council of Europe, Mr. Claes  stated that as far as he is concerned and as long as he is a  member of the committee of ministers of the Council of Europe,  he will say "no" to Russia's membership if its troops remain  stationed in countries against their will.    Questioned on the presence of neofascist ministers in the  new  Italian Government, Mr. Claes said he was convinced that "the  emergence of individuals who have a nasty tendency to take away  the freedom to think is a danger for the future of democracies."  "I am not one of those who believe that electors cannot be  wrong in a democratic state," he added. "All the European  institutions will have to be very diligent in monitoring the  application of democratic principles."</p>

The second and last portion of the Financial Sector  Adjustment Loan of $520 million, as managed by the World Bank,  can help in the cash operations of the Philippine Government.  It is also beautiful proof of frugal financial management by  the Philippine Government. In addition, it paves the way for  the restructuring of the Philippine debt of more than $3 billion.    One of the conditions set forth by the World Bank is the  reorganization of the old Central Bank. Various financial means  of freeing the new Central Bank of the Philippines from the  problems of the past have been realized. Now it can begin its  operations, which will have positive net worth or equity. This  has resulted in the release of the remainder of the loan.    The added cash will no doubt facilitate the daily operations  of the government. More importantly, it is a testimony to the  belief in reforming the system and to the credibility of the  Philippine government. It also strengthens the stability of the  security notes issued by financial institutions in the  Philippines, and furthermore, it attests to lighter foreign  debts, and to the procurement and securing of capital.    We should be happy about these new indicators of recovery,  and the anticipation of the positive effects of the additional  funds on possible job creation this year.</p>

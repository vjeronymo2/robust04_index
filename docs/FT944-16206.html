			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: University research - for or against an elitist approach Sir, It is a mistake to put forward the division of universities into research and non-research as a condition for uniformity in the quality of teaching. On the contrary, research among university staff is a condition for high-quality teaching. For individuals and nations, competitiveness in the global economy depends on the ability to acquire, criticise and produce information at ever increasing rates of turnover (see FT World Economy &amp; Finance survey, September 30). This is particularly relevant to the form and content of research and teaching. Only first-hand experience of an active research environment can give students the skills relevant to new flows of information, as opposed to outdated knowledge. For example, it is better to prepare students for a critical analysis of developments in the EU, than merely to teach them about the EEC. Teaching without research lacks the movement necessary for an assimilation to a world where productive innovation has replaced reproduction as the key to success.

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: European satellite networks offer SCIENTIFIC Atlanta, the US communications group, yesterday began offering private satellite networks to European companies, including data and voice communications and business television. The company said it was the first pan-European service of its type for private satellite networks usually known as Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) networks. VSAT networks allow companies or industrial sectors to set up their own telecommunications systems using satellites. Worldwide, the market for VSAT equipment and services is estimated at Dollars 350m, but so far it has been small in Europe. Scientific Atlanta says that, to begin with, it is concentrating on the automotive, banking and distribution sectors. Mr Thom Degnan, managing director of Scientific Atlanta's private networks division in Europe, said the company was in advanced negotiations with a leading car manufacturer for setting up a network. He declined to reveal the manufacturer but said the network, if set up, would link more than 800 of the company's dealerships in Europe. For a large network, the cost of linking sites with data, vision and sound varies between Dollars 300 and Dollars 500 a site per month.</p>

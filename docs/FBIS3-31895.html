			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bogdan Tiberiu Iacob: "Despite the Rumors That </F> Are Being Circulated, Mr. Coposu Remains Firm: `PNTCD Will Not  Join the Government Without CDR'"]    [Text] In a dialogue with our correspondents yesterday,  Corneliu Coposu, PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic  Party] chairman, categorically refuted the rumors that are being  circulated alleging that certain so-called changes occurred in  his political-strategic position. "As far as we are concerned,  no changes have occurred," the PNTCD leader said. "We decided  to answer favorably to the invitation addressed to us by Oliviu  Gherman [chairman of the Social Democracy Party of Romania --  PDSR] to engage in a dialogue with the PDSR separately from the  rest of the CDR [Democratic Convention of Romania], but we will  not join the government without our allies within the CDR, and  that could also happen only if Ion Iliescu renounces his  monopoly over the country's authorities. We refuse the idea of  setting up a national unity government and we will not cooperate  with the extremist parties -- the PRM [Greater Romania Party],  the PSM [Socialist Party of Labor], and the PUNR [National  Romanian Unity Party]. As far as the UDMR [Democratic Union of  Hungarians in Romania] is concerned, our relations with them  have not cooled down at all; they are the same as before. The  UDMR remains our ally, despite our reserve regarding their  program and the draft they elaborated for the ethnic minority  bill."</p>

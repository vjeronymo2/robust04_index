			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 24 (XINHUA) -- China will not be the  first to use nuclear weapons against other countries and urges  other nuclear powers to do the same, a Chinese representative  said here today.    Hou Zhitong, head of the Chinese delegation to the  Conference  on Disarmament in geneva, told the conference that "China has  never shirked its responsibility for promoting nuclear  disarmament."    It "has always stood for the fundamental objective of early  realization of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction  of nuclear weapons and has made unremitting efforts and  important contributions in this regard."    "It is known to all that since the first day when it came  into possession of nuclear weapons, the Chinese Government has  solemnly declared to the world its unilateral commitment of not  being the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any  circumstances," Hou added.    He pointed out, "China has on many occasions strongly  appealed to other nuclear weapon states to undertake similar  commitments and to conclude an international convention to this  end."    He said that in order to promote the process of nuclear  disarmament and realize the goal of preventing nuclear war, the  Chinese Government has recently taken further initiatives.    On December 23 last year, the Chinese Government formally  proposed to the United States, the Russian Federation and other  nuclear weapon states that negotiations be started among the  five nuclear weapon states to conclude a treaty on the  non-first-use of nuclear weapons.    "It is the view of the Chinese Government that under the  present international situation, the condition is ripe for the  five nuclear weapon states to negotiate and conclude such an  international treaty," Hou said.    China believes, Hou said, the conclusion of this treaty will  significantly reduce the risk of nuclear war and provide  security to the five nuclear weapon states, especially the small  and medium- sized ones among them.    He added, "it will also improve mutual trust and contribute  to the prevention of nuclear proliferation."    Hou noted that such a treaty will play an important role in  realizing a comprehensive nuclear test ban and promoting nuclear  disarmament.    He expressed the hope that countries concerned will give  positive response to China's initiative and start negotiations  with a view to concluding a treaty on the non-first-use of  nuclear weapons as soon as possible.    Hou said China "also hopes that the five states will join  together to promote vigorously the negotiation and conclusion of  an international legal instrument on not to use or threaten to  use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or  nuclear-weapon- free zones, so as to make a decisive  contribution to freeing mankind from the threat of nuclear war."    According to Hou, China has consistently pursued the  objective of the complete prohibition and thorough destruction  of nuclear weapons and stood for the realization of a  comprehensive ban on nuclear weapon tests within this framework.    He said, "proceeding from this fundamental position, China  has always exercised maximum restraint in its nuclear testing."    China has the lowest number of nuclear tests among all  nuclear powers, he said.    "China fully understands the sincere wish of most  non-nuclear  weapon states for an early conclusion of a comprehensive test  ban treaty (CTBT), in the belief that such a treaty will  contribute to the realization of the objective of complete  prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons," Hou  said.    "In view of the above-mentioned considerations," Hou added,  "the Chinese Government issued a statement on October 5 last  year, reiterating its relevant principled positions and  propositions."    The statement emphasized that China supports an early  conclusion of a CTBT and that it will join other countries in  the negotiation in an effort to conclude such a treaty no later  than 1996.    "It is our opinion that an appropriate solution of the issue  of security guarantees to the states parties ought to be one of  the tasks in the CTBT negotiation.    "The CTBT is an international legal instrument with a direct  bearing on the paramount security interests of its states  parties," he said.    According to Hou, just as correctly provided for in the  mandate of the ad hoc committee, CTBT should promote the process  of nuclear disarmament and contribute to the strengthening of  international peace and security.    Therefore, Hou said, "for this purpose, the treaty should  contain provisions for the states parties with nuclear weapons  to undertake not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons  against states parties which do not possess nuclear weapons."    "At the same time," Hou said, "it should also provide for  the  states parties with nuclear weapons to undertake not to be the  first to use nuclear weapons against each other."    Hou believes that "with all nuclear weapon states  undertaking  the above-mentioned obligations, it will add to the substance of  the CTBT, further the treaty's universality and constitute a  major contribution to international peace and security."</p>

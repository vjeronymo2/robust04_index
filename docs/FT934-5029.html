			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Petroleum revenue tax change Companies transferring North Sea oil or gas field assets to an affiliate will be charged petroleum revenue tax (PRT) on the disposal by reference to the asset's market value, in all cases where the asset is used, or to be used, to generate tariffs by providing services to other fields. This change will apply to disposals made after yesterday. The Inland Revenue said yesterday that the chancellor intended to prevent significant potential PRT avoidance through the transfer of tariff-earning assets between fields in the same ownership. 'It has recently become clear that there are risks of significant future PRT loss through transfers of tariff-generating assets such as pipelines between oil or gas fields in the same group of companies,' the Revenue said.</p>

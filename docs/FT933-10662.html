			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Ruling on PVC overturned - European Court In an opinion of the European Court of Justice, Advocate-General Walter Van Gerven says the judgment of the Court of First Instance in a case concerning polyvinylchloride should be set aside. The case should be sent back to the CFI for outstanding issues to be dealt with. The case concerned a Commission decision to fine certain companies for anti-competitive behaviour in the supply of PVC. The companies applied to the court to have the decision annulled. The CFI found that the decision was non-existent in that there had been a manifest breach of the principle of 'inalterability of the measure adopted', that the decision was not authenticated and that the member of the Commission responsible for competition matters who signed the decision did not have the competence to do so. The Commission appealed to the European Court. The advocate-general first rejected a claim by the companies that the Commission had not lodged its appeal in time and that it should not therefore be heard. He then dealt with the issue that changes had been made to the decision in between the time when it was adopted by the collegiate body of Commissioners and the time when it was notified to the companies. The CFI had ruled that the fact that the changes were more than mere spelling or grammar amendments meant that the principle that a measure adopted by the Commission could not be altered - the 'inalterability' principle - had been breached. The advocate-general said that the CFI had used the wrong test in making its decision on this point. Instead of examining the extent of the changes made, the CFI should have examined the effect of those changes on the companies and whether the changes had materially affected their understanding of the Commission's decision against them, and thus whether their legal position had been adversely affected. The CFI's findings on this point, therefore, were struck down by the ECJ. The advocate-general moved to the issue of authentication. The problem arose in the context of the fact the decision was authentic in five official language versions. The full Commission had adopted the final decision in three of those versions - English, French and German - but had left the commissioner for competition to adopt the other two remaining versions, namely Dutch and Italian. The CFI had ruled that the Commission had no power to delegate the right of adoption; and that only the Commission could adopt authentic texts. The advocate-general disagreed. He said it was permissible for the Commission to delegate to a commissioner the power to adopt the text of a decision which had already been adopted by the full Commission in another language version. Essentially, the task entrusted to the commissioner was one of practical execution or internal organisation, capable of being delegated. As to whether each decision adopted by the Commission should be signed by the president and secretary-general of the Commission, the advocate-general found that, although the Commission had breached its own internal procedural rules in this instance, the breach was not such as to nullify the decision in question. This was because the president and the secretary-general had signed the minutes of the meeting at which the decision in question had been adopted by the full Commission, and that, as the minutes accurately reflected the contents of the decision, the rights of the companies concerned - that the decision as notified to them individually corresponded to the decision taken by the Commission - had not been breached. Finally, the advocate-general found that the fact that the decisions individually notified to the companies concerned had not been signed by the commissioner for competition was irrelevant. The decision had clearly been adopted by the full Commission and its legal effects were not hindered by lack of a signature.

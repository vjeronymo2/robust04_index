			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Andes nations regain a taste for free trade - The revival of a moribund pact AFTER more than half a century of protectionism, trade barriers continue to tumble across the Andes. Even the Andean Pact, moribund for 23 years, is enjoying a revival, despite a rupture of diplomatic relations between Venezuela and Peru where President Alberto Fujimori suspended Congress in April. In October, tariffs between Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia were abolished and Venezuela is scheduled to join the free-trade zone in January. Peru, despite suspending its membership of the five-nation pact until December 1993, is meanwhile negotiating bilateral free-trade agreements, including one recently signed with Ecuador. The Group of Three, a trade group comprising Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, is also said to be ready to admit Ecuador, which is meanwhile talking to Chile about free trade. Years of political struggle and protectionism among member countries have given way to unprecedented co-operation and trade liberalisation. Economic necessities have sidelined many ideological struggles and the geo-political competition of the cold war. As Mr Mauricio Pinto, Ecuador's minister of industries and commerce, explains: 'We decided to take a risk. Rather than seeing the dangers of trading with a more developed economy such as Colombia, we began seeing the opportunities. If Mexico was seeking free trade with an economic power like the US, then it was because they saw opportunities of growth.' Mr Pinto claims: 'No other trade agreement in the world has established as open and unregulated a trade as the one between Ecuador and Colombia.' Scepticism and fear of being swamped by Colombian imports is gradually subsiding among some Ecuadorean manufacturers. Companies in both countries are beginning to restructure their operations in response to the trade liberalisation. Critics of the free-trade area had feared Ecuador's industries would be hard hit by Colombian imports. But Mr Jose Penaherrera, the under-secretary of foreign commerce, says the now obsolete maximum tariff of 20 per cent had not protected the industrial sector. He adds that labour and business management alike support trade liberalisation. The impact of freer trade may be less than implied by the official statistics. According to the official figures, Ecuadorean imports from Colombia in 1991 were, at Dollars 94.5m (Pounds 62.1m), three times its exports to its larger neighbour. But Mr Luis Ornando Diaz, an economist at the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Integration, estimates that contraband is three to four times the size of legal trade. Mr Penaherrera says: 'Informally there already existed a free-trade zone with Colombia.' Ecuador's relatively low labour costs give the country an advantage in some of its export industries. Ecuador exports mainly traditional goods to Colombia: canned sardines, fish meal, vegetable oils, synthetic yarns and aluminium tubes, among others. One Ecuadorean company that is responding to the challenges and opportunities of the new free-trade area is Textiles San Pedro. Specialising in high-quality carpets and industrial yarns, the company has modernised its machinery and opened distribution centres in Colombia. Mr Alberto Sanchez, general manager, says with these measures and access to the Colombian market the company hopes to double its current annual production of 200,000 blankets by next year. Ecuador has even started exporting cars - the sub-compact model built by Suzuki in Ecuador, although in modest numbers at first. Although the trade figures will increase markedly as previous contraband is encompassed by the figures, actual intra-regional trade is not expected to rise sharply. There are also some non-tariff barriers that will take time to be removed. According to Carlos Guzman of the Ecuadorean Export Federation, the impediments include poor communication and transportation links between member countries as well as corrupt customs officials. Mr Pinto insists that the common external tariff set by the Andean Group - in four bands ranging from 5 to 20 per cent - is not protectionist. The tariff, averaging about 10 per cent, does not impede trade with non-member countries, he says. In addition, trade negotiations between the Andean Group and the G3, as well as with Chile, provides opportunities for liberalising and increasing inter-bloc trade. Mr Pinto stresses that the Andean Pact has boosted Ecuador's international negotiating position enormously. The size of Ecuador's economy on its own is of little interest to countries such as Mexico or Chile, but the Andean market as a whole is a far more attractive negotiating partner. According to officials, the prospects of further integration among the relatively compatible Andean economies are good. Future efforts of the Andean group will focus on accommodating Peru and improving communications and transportation to facilitate the exchange of goods and services.</p>

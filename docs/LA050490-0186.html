			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MISSOURI BASKETBALL USED ILLEGAL RECRUITER IN DETROIT, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> The NCAA alleges that the University of Missouri basketball program used an  illegal recruiter in the Detroit area, according to a published report.  </P> <P> Citing an anonymous source familiar with the investigation, the Kansas City  Star reported in today's editions that Missouri will have to respond to the  allegation that Vic Adams acted as an illegal representative of the school.  </P> <P> The Star's report came one day after the school acknowledged that it had  received an official letter of inquiry stating a number of charges against the  program.  </P> <P> Missouri must formulate a response to all charges and present that response to  the NCAA Committee on Infractions, probably in August. The committee then  determines whether penalties are warranted.  </P> <P> In the past, the NCAA has been harsh when it has found that a recruiting action  gave a school a "competitive advantage." The Missouri roster has been full of  Detroit-area players in recent years, including Nathan Buntin, Doug Smith, Lee  Coward, John McIntyre and Lynn Hardy, all of whom have been starters.  </P> <P> Missouri Athletic Director Dick Tamburo said Thursday he was relieved to  finally receive the letter.  </P> <P> "I was pleased to get it just from the standpoint of getting the response  prepared for it and getting our program moving forward. We're in the process of  evaluating it right now," he said.  </P> <P> The university scheduled a news conference for Monday afternoon to distribute  the letter.  </P> <P> The basketball program has been under investigation since February, 1989, the  month when Coach Norm Stewart collapsed on the team plane and later underwent  cancer surgery.  </P> <P> Stewart recovered from his cancer surgery and led Missouri to a Big Eight  championship this year. Missouri lost in the first-round of the NCAA tournament  to Northern Iowa.  </P> <P> The NCAA investigation focused on recruiting violations, including assistant  coach Bob Sundvold buying airline tickets for recruits.  </P> <P> Sundvold was suspended in February, 1989.  </P></p>

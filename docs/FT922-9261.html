			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Poor BP figures disappoint FIRST-QUARTER profits from British Petroleum were expected to be bad, but the extent of the slide still managed to surprise the market. An early rise for the shares was reversed, leaving a decline of 2 1/2 on the day at 259 1/2 p. Volume reached almost 20m. Analysts had begun to wonder whether BP was not finally beginning to be oversold, but yesterday's presentation reinforced the gloom. Mr Nick Clayton of Smith New Court cut his full-year historic cost forecast by Pounds 50m to Pounds 600m. He said: 'There was nothing in the statement to give any cause for optimism.' Traditionally pessimistic Strauss Turnbull cut back its historic cost forecast by Pounds 106m to Pounds 400m. The house repeated its belief that the dividend would be reduced in the third quarter and said the shares were worth 220p at best. Queens Moat active A big placing of 41m Queens Moat Houses shares yesterday saw 86m traded in the market, with insurance concern Prudential reported to have sold its 4.5 per cent stake in the hotel group. Coincidentally, the sale came the day on which Queens Moat's annual report landed on fund managers' desks. Agency broker James Capel was thought to have done the business, with the block bought at 85 1/2 p and placed at 86 1/2 p. The shares slipped 3 1/2 to 88 1/2 p in a weak hotel sector. Sears tumbles Retailer Sears saw its heaviest turnover for more than five years as the group announced a sharp fall in full-year profits and raised doubts about the next dividend. The shares fell 6 1/2 to 97p, the biggest percentage drop among the FT-SE Index of 100 leading companies. However, buyers were attracted ahead of the stock going ex the dividend on Monday, and the two-way pull ensured that more than 28m shares were dealt by the close. Kleinwort Benson lowered its full-year forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 100m but advised holding the shares at least until securing the dividend. BT benefited from heavy buying across the utilities sectors, 19.5m shares being traded in the fully-paid, and a further 15m in the partly-paid. The former rose a penny to 347 1/2 p and the latter  3/4 to 127 1/2 p. Strong subscriber figures for April lifted Vodafone Group, as Kleinwort Benson underlined its buy recommendation. The shares rose 7 to 364p. Enthusiasm ahead of a presentation today by Reuters Holdings to analysts in Geneva left the shares 14 up at 1227p. A profits warning from the eponymous chairman depressed Bernard Matthews shares, which lost 6 to 64p. Unilever rose 12 to 930p as it returned to favour. The market range for first-quarter profits due on May 15 is between Pounds 360m and Pounds 400m. BET strengthened 12 to 154p on reports that SG Warburg, which has been negative on the stock for the last three years, had turned buyer. The word is that Warburg cited changes in the management at BET for its move and is said to believe that a dividend cut is now discounted in the share price. Turnover reached 6.2m. Confirmation that a consortium led by Trafalgar House is to be the lead contractor to build a suspension bridge in Hong Kong sent the company's shares climbing 5 to 152p in heavy turnover of 7.6m. Lloyds Bank fell 7 to 410p amid worries that its proposed hostile bid for Midland Bank (off a penny at 389p) may be referred to the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Electricity utilities were strong, with Scottish Hydro-Electric, up 10 at 198p, and Northern Electricity, ahead 13 at 336p, the star performers. A block of 3.5m British Land shares came into the market as one institution decided to switch out of the property group. The stock slipped 4 to 195p as the Seaq ticker reported 8.1m shares traded. SG Warburg was said to have bought the stock for 190 1/2 p and placed 2.9m at 192p. Hammerson 'A' was busy and 2 lighter at 371p after 2.4m dealt. US credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded Taylor Woodrow's rating, blaming the continued depressed state of the UK property and building market. The shares, however, closed 6 firmer at 140p. An upbeat statement at the T &amp; N annual meeting helped the shares climb 11 1/2 to 154 1/2 p. Trading was also boosted by broker recommendations. Nomura and Smith New Court produced substantive documents on Granada Group, with both houses recommending the stock. The shares rose 6 to 280p. Mr Chris Page at Goldman Sachs reiterated his overvalued stance on Ladbroke shares, which tumbled 10 to 254p in turnover of 5.4m. Publisher Euromoney received a boost on the back of good interim profits and a raised dividend. SG Warburg Securities highlighted the stock in a big review of media stocks published yesterday. The shares, which stood at 400p in November, jumped 102p yesterday to close at 785p. Troubled WPP fell again as concern about the group's refinancing continued. The shares lost 12 1/2 to 45 1/2 p. Eurotunnel gave up 8 to 390p after a Magazine survey revealed passenger fears about using the Channel tunnel when it opens. Light selling was seen in BAA, the shares easing 2 to 629p. There were suggestions in the market that the company would announce its plans for a fifth terminal at London's Heathrow airport next Tuesday. The group reports full-year figures on June 8. Charterhouse Tilney predicts profits of Pounds 176m. Closer inspection of Wednesday's traffic figures, which revealed premier passenger numbers to be around the levels of two years ago, sent British Airways down 8 1/2 to 284p on turnover of 6.1m. Smith New Court was reported to have turned cautious on the figures. In addition, there were suggestions in the market that BA may soon strike a deal to purchase TWA's European assets.

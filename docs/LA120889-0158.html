			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: BENEFIT FOR AGED ASKS $18,000 PER  </P> <P> The smelling salts, please.  </P> <P> A bash with an asking price of $18,000 per person? At this time of year?  </P> <P> You betcha. A bevy of heavy-hitting donors has already mailed in the megabucks  to attend the fund-raiser being staged Sunday by Newport Beach newcomers Bob  and Beverly Cohen (deep background: The couple owns what was once John Wayne's  beloved bayside digs and the Four Seasons Hotel in the Hills of Beverly, a  favorite pit stop of magazine giant Malcolm Forbes).  </P> <P> The cocktail cruise aboard the Cohens' 127-foot yacht P'zazz and the dinner in  their enclosed patio will benefit the new, nonprofit Heritage Pointe Jewish  Home for the Aging in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Now, this exclusive splash is significant for three reasons. First, it makes it  crystal clear that an organization can get away with an outrageous admission  price, providing it provides an exclusive locale (and along Newport Bay these  days, nothing is as all-out exclusive as the $10-million sea mansion that  belongs to the charismatic Cohens. For starters, it features Oriental carpets,  silk-smothered walls, gold-leaf ceilings, a cordon bleu chef and a cadre of  servants).  </P> <P> Second, it marks the first local benefit staged by the Cohens, who are highly  regarded in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills charity circles for the mega-benefits  they have chaired, including a recent one that hailed the philanthropic  endeavors of Wallis Annenberg, daughter of TV Guide founder Walter Annenberg  (guests included Jimmy and Gloria Stewart, Ali McGraw, Judith Krantz, Steve  Allen and a slew of other Cohen-loving superstars).  </P> <P> Third, it marks a celebration on behalf of a nonprofit retirement home that  will be the first of its kind in Orange County. According to Meryl Schrimmer,  its president, there are only two facilities in Southern California that offer  members of the retired Jewish community an environment where they can live in a  climate of Jewish tradition. One is in San Diego, and another, the Jewish Home  for the Aged of Greater Los Angeles, is a favorite charity of the Cohens.  </P> <P> When Beverly Cohen was given a tour of the modern Mission Viejo facility three  weeks ago, she flipped. Flipped enough to want to get the ball rolling  immediately on the "A Chai Sea Adventure" that has attracted guests such as  Rita and Bob Teller, owner of the Orange County Market Place at the county  fairgrounds (the swap meet that thrills the bargain-hunting masses); developer  Arnold Feuerstein, chairman of the home's board of trustees, and his wife,  Ruth; Sandy and Allan Fainbarg, a developer who also founded the Wild West  Stores; Meryl's husband, Hank, owner of the Schrimmer Insurance Agency in La  Habra, and Dr. Herb Modelevsky and his wife, Loretta, organizer of the home's  nine Orange County support chapters.  </P> <P> Why $18,000 and not $15,000 or $25,000? "The number 18 is considered good luck  in Jewish lore," said Meryl Schrimmer, who confided she had found some jazzy,  rubber-sole shoes -- a must for the teak decks. "And that is known as chai, a  lucky thing, something that is a positive salute to life!"  </P> <P> "To tell you the truth," Schrimmer added with a laugh, "I told Beverly: Maybe  we should call the party 'Adventure on the Chai Seas!' "  </P> <P> 'Tis a puzzlement: One minute Rudolf Nureyev was on stage at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center on Tuesday night, playing the scowling lead in "The King  and I." The next, he was howling at a post-performance party at Scott's Seafood  Bar and Grill in Costa Mesa, mugging it up for the paparazzi by popping a white  linen napkin in his mouth and making face after slapstick face.  </P> <P> How does he get from mean to madcap in a matter of minutes? No problem, said  the Tartar who became the most famous ballet dancer in the world in the early  '60s. "Actually, the King of Siam seems mean, but he really is not. He's just  trying to protect his kingdom from cultural rape, preserve something that is  good!"  </P> <P> Nureyev and his co-star, Liz Robertson, widow of lyricist Alan Jay Lerner ("My  Fair Lady," "Camelot") sat at a cozy table sipping 1987 Rutherford Hill  Chardonnay while they dined on plump filets and piles of lacy onion rings.  Beside them were buddies of Nureyev, including Wallace Potts, who had escorted  actress Leslie Caron to the production (at the Center through Sunday). Caron  (remember her in "Gigi" with Maurice Chevalier?) was visiting from Paris, Potts  explained, "because she was looping a remake of the movie 'Heidi' that is being  produced by Michael Douglas." (Looping has to do with dubbing in new sound,  Potts said. "You know, you do a scene and later the director realizes an  airplane is zooming in the background so you have to dub in your voice again.")  </P> <P> Nureyev said he was was ecstatic over the production's Orange County premiere.  "The theater is great. The story is great. And Liz was just wonderful."  </P> <P> Robertson loves playing the role of Anna Leonowens -- an English schoolteacher  who goes to Siam in the 1860s to tutor the King's children -- she said,  "because it runs the gamut of emotion. And it's a very feminine role about a  very strong woman." As for her late husband, whom she met 10 years ago when she  played the role of Eliza Dolittle in London's West End, she said: "He was a  genius. He will always live through his words. And those words have helped me  get through the hard times."  </P> <P> Also in the glittering opening-night audience: the eternally beautiful Loretta  Young -- stunning in a black velvet evening hat rimmed with blinding  rhinestones -- accompanied by Henry Segerstrom, his wife, Renee, Renee's  daughter, Nikette, and the legendary dress designer, Jean Louis.  </P> <P> High times: Washington political humorist Art Buchwald was the laugh-a-minute  highlight of the Times Mirror Community Leaders Dinner held at the Four Seasons  Hotel in Newport Beach on Tuesday night.  </P> <P> After a cocktail reception, guests such as Donald Koll, Arnold Beckman, Harry  Bubb, William Lusk, Reed Royalty, Carl and Don Karcher, and Otis Chandler dined  on grilled crab cakes and veal medallions, then settled back to hear Buchwald  regale the 280-strong crowd with gags that touched on topics such as the U.S.  Postal Service. If the post office has its way, he said, the day will come when  mail will be delivered only once a year. "They'll call it Mail Day! It'll be a  holiday, like Christmas!"  </P></p>

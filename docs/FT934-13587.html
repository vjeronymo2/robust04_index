			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Higher shop sales ease worry over recovery: Sales volumes beat City expectations WORRIES about the pace of the recovery diminished yesterday after a bigger-than-expected rise in retail sales volumes last month. The second successive monthly increase in sales volumes countered recent evidence that consumers are cutting back on spending as a result of concern about possible tax increases in the Budget. Volumes rose 0.5 per cent in September compared with the previous month, after a revised 0.2 per cent monthly increase in August, according to the Central Statistical Office. The City had expected a rise of 0.3 per cent for the latest monthly period. Shop sales in the third quarter of the year were 1 per cent higher than in the previous quarter, after a 0.4 per cent increase between the first and second quarters. However, the pace of growth in the retail sector - which accounts for about a quarter of the economy - has slipped from the January to March period which saw a 1.7 per cent rise in sales on the previous three months. In the latest three months, shop sales were 3.8 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago. The CSO's figures are adjusted both for seasonal variations and inflation. Shops selling household goods, and clothes and shoes, performed relatively well in the third quarter, with sales volumes up 2 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively compared with the previous three months. Stores offering food and non-edible products saw volumes rise 1.9 per cent over the same period. Shops selling just food did less well, experiencing a sales rise of 0.4 per cent. Based on non seasonally adjusted data, the average weekly value of retail sales in September was Pounds 2.78bn, 6.5 per cent higher than 12 months previously. In a separate breakdown of sales trends, the British Retail Consortium, a trade body, said chemists and beauty shops had seen strong growth in recent months. Retailers concentrating on carpets and furniture had had a 'difficult' September. The electrical and electronics sector experienced 'measurably better' sales growth than in August, in spite of poor demand for kitchen equipment.</p>

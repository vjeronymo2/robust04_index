			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING;  </P> <P> MAGICAL MILE SEEKS TO PROVE DEBUT WAS NO ILLUSION  </P> <P> If Magical Mile was running in New York instead of at Hollywood Park, he might  be described by now as the second coming of Devil's Bag, Easy Goer or even  Secretariat.  </P> <P> New Yorkers go overboard on horses much more than Californians do. There might  have been more written about Devil's Bag as a 2-year-old than there was about  Secretariat in his entire career. Devil's Bag was scratched from the Kentucky  Derby and never ran again.  </P> <P> Easy Goer has gotten the same treatment during his brief career, which is why  some Eastern journalists were so relieved when the colt redeemed himself by  winning the Belmont after Sunday Silence beat him in both the Kentucky Derby  and the Preakness.  </P> <P> In California, the tendency is to let the top horses establish themselves on  the track before enshrining them in the Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> Magical Mile has run only one time, and although he shattered Hollywood Park's  track record by covering five furlongs in :56 2/5, all that's being said about  trainer Warren Stute's colt so far is that he appears to be the best 2-year-old  on the West Coast.  </P> <P> Magical Mile will run Saturday in the $100,000 Hollywood Juvenile at six  furlongs.  </P> <P> Eddie Delahoussaye, who has never won the stake, has nevertheless ridden some  outstanding 2-year-olds, including Roving Boy and Gato Del Sol. Delahoussaye  won the Kentucky Derby back to back with Gato Del Sol and Sunny's Halo in  1982-83.  </P> <P> "This colt (Magical Mile) is one of the best 2-year-olds I've ever been on,"  Delahoussaye said. "Of course, you can't go by just one race, because you've  got to wait and see if they can stretch out, but the potential with this one is  there. For one thing, he's mature for a young horse. He's not that green. He  reminds you of an older horse."  </P> <P> Magical Mile suffered a minor leg cut in his debut and missed two weeks of  training, then Stute couldn't find a race to use as a prep for the Juvenile.  </P> <P> "This will be his first race in two months, and you have to be concerned about  that," Delahoussaye said. "But he's been working good and I won't trade my  chances with anybody. There'll be some other horses running Saturday who'll be  in the same situation."  </P> <P> There will be either a small field or a large group running in the $500,000  Haskell Handicap at Monmouth Park a week from Saturday, depending on whether  Easy Goer runs. Trainer Shug McGaughey is expected to make the decision on Easy  Goer today, with the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga on Aug. 5 being his other  option.  </P> <P> Easy Goer and Sunday Silence were weighted at 126 pounds for the Haskell, but  Sunday Silence is staying at Hollywood Park to run in the $400,000 Swaps on  Sunday.  </P> <P> King Glorious, winner of the Ohio Derby and beaten only once in his career,  worked six furlongs at Monmouth Wednesday in a good 1:12 4/5. King Glorious has  been assigned 123 pounds.  </P> <P> Another probable for the 1 1/8-mile Haskell is Music Merci at 120 pounds, but  he would have to be flown to New Jersey from Los Angeles. It seems that the  only definite starter besides King Glorious is Le Voyageur (114 pounds), the  French-raced colt who made his American debut by leading the Belmont for a mile  before finishing third, eighth lengths behind Easy Goer but only a length  behind Sunday Silence.  </P> <P> Only four horses -- Endow, Notorious Pleasure, Prized and Raise a Stanza -- are  expected to challenge Sunday Silence in the Swaps.  </P> <P> Bill Shoemaker has won the Sunset Handicap 13 times, never with a distaffer,  but he will get that chance Friday night at Hollywood Park when he rides No  Review in the $250,000 race. In her last start, No Review finished third in the  Beverly Hills Handicap for fillies and mares on July 2.  </P> <P> Shoemaker, who will turn 58 on Aug. 19, is retiring early next year and will be  honored Friday during a special evening program at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Shoemaker rode in his first Sunset in 1949 and overall he has missed only four  runnings of the stake since then. Besides the 13 victories, he has finished  second four times and third three times.  </P> <P> Seven horses are entered in the Sunset, including Frankly Perfect, who will be  favored to give trainer Charlie Whittingham his 11th victory in the stake. Six  of Whittingham's victories have come with Shoemaker in the saddle.  </P> <P> Friday night's lineup, with jockeys and weights:  </P> <P> Desert Crest, Chris McCarron, 114 pounds; Pranke, Pat Valenzuela, 117; Putting,  Gary Stevens, 114; Frankly Perfect, Eddie Delahoussaye, 123; No Review,  Shoemaker, 110; Pleasant Variety, Laffit Pincay, 114; and Miserden, Robbie  Davis, 108.  </P> <P> Present Value, the 5-year-old who won the Michigan Mile and One-Eighth at 49-1  last Saturday at Detroit Race Course, could be the answer to a Shoemaker trivia  question.  </P> <P> Unless Shoemaker wins a stake during his farewell tour, which is scheduled to  end at Santa Anita next Feb. 4, Present Value will be remembered as his last  stake winner in the United States. Shoemaker rode Present Value to a 1  1/4-length victory in the National Jockey Club Stakes on May 6 at Sportsman's  Park, the first time he ever rode at the Chicago area track.  </P> <P> With a price of $300,000, it was with some reluctance that trainer Ron McAnally  approved the sale of Bayakoa, and now the Argentine mare has won five straight  stakes.  </P> <P> "I thought $300,000 was too much," McAnally said, "but then I heard that they  paid $500,000 for Rosadora, which made the price of our mare sound better."  </P> <P> Rosadora finished fourth, far back of Bayakoa, in last Saturday's Vanity  Handicap at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Rahy, winner of the Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park last Sunday, was the  third highest-priced yearling to be auctioned in the country in 1986 when the  son of Blushing Groom sold for $2 million.  </P> <P> Whenever a horse flirts with Dr. Fager's record for the mile, as Rahy did when  he won the Bel Air in 1:33 last Sunday, John Nerud reminds that Dr. Fager's  1:32 1/5 came while carrying 134 pounds at Arlington Park in 1968. Rahy carried  117 pounds in the Bel Air.  </P> <P> Earlier in 1968, Nerud brought Dr. Fager to Hollywood Park to run in the  Californian. The trainer thought that the conditions of the race meant Dr.  Fager would carry 127 pounds.  </P> <P> An official from Hollywood Park met Nerud upon his arrival at LAX. "I've got  good news and bad news," the trainer was told. "The good news is that the horse  is doing fine; the bad news is that you'll really have to carry 130 pounds."  </P> <P> Dr. Fager won the Californian by three lengths.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Hollywood Park's season closes on Monday. . . . The Orange County Fair meeting  for thoroughbreds and quarter horses opens next Tuesday night at Los Alamitos.  It runs for 17 nights through Aug. 12. Post time for the first race is 6:45. .  . . At the Del Mar meet that opens next Wednesday, Gary Stevens will try to  become the first jockey to win three straight titles since Bill Shoemaker in  1952-53-54. . . . If Wayne Lukas wins his third consecutive training title, he  will join a Del Mar group that includes Willie Molter, Red McDaniel, Farrell  Jones, Bobby Frankel and Mike Mitchell. . . . The owners of Super Diamond, the  9-year-old gelding who earned $1.4 million and won the Hollywood Gold Cup and  nine other stakes, are hoping to keep the horse in competition as a jumper.  </P></p>

Addressing a national conference on ideological and media  work, the premier said: "The development of the international  and domestic situations has provided very good conditions for  improving our ideological and media work, and has also set still  higher requirements on it."    Li, who is also a Standing Committee member of the Political  Bureau of the party Central Committee, expounded four topics:  the international situation and the conduct of China's foreign  affairs; China's economic growth; the reform of the country's  economic structures; and hopes on ideological and media work.    Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the party Central  Committee, elaborated in his speech at the opening session of  the conference the position and role of the ideological and  media work during the current new period.    Jiang also spelled out the fundamental guiding principles  and  major tasks for ideological and media work.    Premier Li Peng asked all ideological and media departments  to conscientiously implement the spirit of Jiang's speech and to  do their work still better.    Speaking of the current international situation and the  conduct of China's foreign affairs, he said that China has made  great progress in relations with other countries by pursuing the  independent policy of peace.    Having analyzed Sino-U.S. relations, Sino-West European  relations, as well as friendly and cooperative relations between  China and its neighboring countries and other developing  countries, the premier said that overall, the current  international situation has provided a favorable external  environment for China to promote its reform, opening-up and  economic development.    The leader stressed that China is now in a period of  development rarely seen in history.    With a favorable international situation and good domestic  conditions, he said, it is entirely possible for China to strive  to achieve a "sustainable, fast-speed and healthy" growth of  national economy for a fairly long time to come.    According to Li Peng, the principle governing China's  economic work in 1994 is to implement the spirit of the party's  14th national congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  Central Committee, take major steps in establishing a socialist  market economic set-up, open still wider to the outside world,  strengthen and improve macro-economic controls, readjust the  economic structure, promote technological progress, improve  economic efficiency, and maintain sustained, fast-speed and  healthy growth of the national economy.    To this end, it is imperative to exp!nd the rural economy,  invigorate major state-owned enterprises, and strengthen and  improve macro-economic controls, he said.    On restructuring China's economy, Premier Li Peng said that  the central tasks for this year are to establish a sound  macro-economic control system, with focus on taxation system and  finance, push ahead with price reforms in a steady manner and  estaBlish a modern enterprise system that tallies with the  socialist market economic structure.    He called for efforts to handle well the relations among  reform, development and stability, saying that economic  development is the focus of all work while reform provides the  powerful motive force to social and economic development and  stability is the prerequisite for development and reform.    He urged active but cautious steps to promote reform and  make  substantial progress in key areas by seizing the opportune  moment.    The Chinese premier said that the Communist Party of China  is  competent in doing ideological and media work, which provides  support to and ensures the success of revolution and economic  development.    He expressed the hope that units doing ideological work and  the mass media,which have played an important roLe in reform and  opening and modernization drive, would provide a correct guide  to the public opinion and better serve the country's efforts of  reform, opening and modernization.    He stressed that news coverage must be complete, objective  and accurate and must guard against one-sidedness.    Li Peng urged the government departments at all levels to  attach importance to and support those doing ideological work  and mass media, provide them with necessary working conditions  and help solve their real difficulties.    Present at the conference were Zhu Rongji, Ding Guangen, Li  Lanqing, Li Tieying, Qian Qichen, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao and  Ren Jianxin.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses 1.3% as yen surges to a record high THE YEN'S surge to a record high unnerved investors, and share prices lost ground on arbitrage related selling in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell for the third consecutive day, losing 268.95, or 1.3 per cent, to 20,575.24, the lowest point of the day. The index opened at 20,842.49, the day's high, and declined on light selling. Volume remained flat at 350m shares, as investors were reluctant to participate ahead of the holiday today, and Friday's settlement of June futures and options contracts. The market is closed today due to the royal wedding of Crown Prince Naruhito and Miss Masako Owada. Declines overwhelmed rises by 821 to 238, with 122 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 16.82 to 1,655.03 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.06 to 1,250.59. The higher yen gave investors the jitters, sending leading exporters down. The dollar closed at a new Tokyo low of Y106.33, down Y1.14 on the day, after hitting an intra-day low of Y106.24. Continued worries over THK, the over-the-counter bearings manfucturer rumoured to be facing financial difficulties, also weighed on the market. Hopes that public funds would support shares ahead of the royal wedding faded quickly in the early session, and US pension funds, seen purchasing shares in small lots, were the only notable buyers. Royal wedding-related shares were losers, with Tasaki Shinju, the pearl jewellery maker, down Y80 at Y1,420. High-technology exporters lost ground. NEC receded Y20 to Y1,020 and Hitachi declined Y15 to Y859, while Toyota Motor weakened Y50 to Y1,640 and Honda Motor fell Y40 to Y1,360. In spite of denials by the company over rumours of financial difficulties, THK dropped by its daily limit of Y400 to Y2,120. The OTC market fell 28.89 to 1,616.62. Regional banks were among the few gainers on the day. Buying by US pension funds supported Ashikaga Bank, which advanced Y31 to Y980, and Bank of Okinawa, Y200 stronger at Y6,600. Punters sought speculative favourites. Kurabo Industries climbed Y19 to Y510 and Nippon Carbon was up Y3 at Y630. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 242.75 to 23,118.75 in volume of 21.5m shares. Roundup TOKYO apart, equity markets on the Pacific Rim were generally happier than they were on Monday. HONG KONG staged a technical rebound, the Hang Seng index finishing 135.01, or 1.9 per cent, higher at 7,259.74. Brokers noted medium-term bullishness as Hang Seng index futures all traded at more than a 100-point premium to the cash market. Blue chips posted gains across the board. The most active, Hutchison, rose 90 cents to HKDollars 21.80 as its major shareholder, Cheung Kong, put on 30 cents at HKDollars 27.70 and HSBC Holdings climbed HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 72.50. Turnover expanded to HKDollars 4.7bn from the previous day's HKDollars 3.2bn. SINGAPORE gained ground after early weakness, the Straits Times Industrial index finishing a net 14.55 up at 1,870.67. A recovery in speculative Malaysian over-the-counter (OTC) stocks led the upturn. KUALA LUMPUR itself featured increased buying of 'situational' stocks as the KLSE composite index gained 8.12 at 736.28 in volume of 273.3m shares (221.5m on Monday). SEOUL's turnover was a record Won1,200bn as the composite index hit a new 31-month high, adding 1.91 at 768.19. Strength in financials, however, was not sustained to the close. JAKARTA absorbed light profit-taking in the afternoon session and the Jardine Fleming index closed a slight 0.59 higher at 71.55. AUSTRALIA reflected weakness in golds as the All Ordinaries index ended 15.4 lower at 1,723.1 in turnover up from ADollars 187m to ADollars 293m. The gold shares index lost 4.5 per cent to 1.779.6. Newcrest Mining fell 30 cents to ADollars 3.85, down by 13 per cent in a week. NEW ZEALAND was dampened down by higher yields on debt-market securities and softer share prices in New York. The NZSE-40 index closed 1.40 off at 1,655.13 after a holiday on Monday. TAIWAN extended Monday's losses, the weighted index sinking 39.58 to 4,277.42 for a drop of 114.08 over the past three sessions. Selling of speculative shares was blamed for the decline. BOMBAY shed early gains to close lower on profit-taking, the BSE index losing 29 to 2,377, after a high of 2,423. KARACHI saw buying by institutions and foreign funds. There was hope of some improvement in the political climate, after the government and the opposition formed committees to hold reconciliation talks. The KSE index moved ahead 13.5 to 1,171.64.</p>

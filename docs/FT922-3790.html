			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Hanson's US arm goes back to basics: Why the group wants to convince investors that it does more than buy and sell companies IT has been a painful and frustrating period for Mr David Clarke and Mr John Raos, respectively chief executive and chief operating officer of Hanson Industries, the US arm of Hanson. They have had to watch from the sidelines as Hanson engaged in a phoney war with Imperial Chemical Industries, and its share price significantly underperformed the FT-SE 100 index. And they have had to live with bad publicity after Hanson's flotation of a majority stake in Smith Corona, the typewriter company, was followed by a collapse in its share price and a blizzard of shareholder lawsuits. Now, the two plan to regain centre stage, as the news that Hanson is again considering floating majority stakes in its US non-core businesses indicates. Behind that process is some simple arithmetic. If investors priced Hanson's shares by looking at the US market's average prospective price/earnings ratio of 17, rather than the UK's 13, the stock would look a lot healthier. The mooted US flotations are a way of tapping those higher American valuations. At one point, serious thought was given to floating or spinning off the entire US business, which contributed 60 per cent of Hanson's Pounds 1.3bn pre-tax profits for the year to September 30. 'In the end,' says Mr Clarke, 'it was never proven to be advantageous because unbundling the US businesses would have increased the tax bill, which in turn would be dilutive to earnings.' Instead, he decided to refocus Hanson's strategy. He hopes to persuade US investors that Hanson is no longer just a strategic buyer and seller of companies but a manager of seven core businesses. Significantly, five of them are based in the US: Peabody Coal; Cavenham Forest; the aggregates company Beazer USA; Grove Industries, the largest hydraulic crane manufacturer in the world; and SCM Chemical. Two are UK-based: Imperial Tobacco; and the Hanson building products operations, which now include ARC and London Brick. Hanson plans to expand its core businesses through 'bolt-on' acquisitions. Mr Mark Alexander, who leads Hanson's merger and acquisition team in the US, says: 'We are focusing primarily on our core businesses, which is why our bolt-on activity has dramatically increased.' Hanson still retains its opportunistic streak. For example, it is looking hard at Canary Wharf, the London office development owned by Canada's Olympia &amp; York, now in insolvency proceedings. But if Hanson acquires a bargain unrelated to any of the group's existing big businesses, the Clarke strategy calls for it to become a new core business - in Canary Wharf's case, by merging it with the group's extensive property portfolio in the US. Outside the core is a raft of smaller companies, which Hanson refers to as portfolio businesses. Under the Clarke plan, those that cannot be expanded will be sold off, raising perhaps Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m). The way became clear for Hanson to float off some of these smaller companies on US stock markets seven months ago, when Smith Corona settled the shareholders' lawsuit against it over its flotation in 1989. The total settlement was Dollars 24m, of which Smith Corona contributed Dollars 5m. It is easy to see why shareholders were angry. When Hanson sold 52 per cent of Smith Corona to the US public in July 1989, it obtained Dollars 21 a share. Not long after the sale, with Japanese competition increasing and the dividend cut, Smith Corona's share price collapsed to less than Dollars 5. (It was yesterday trading at about Dollars 9.) Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, believes there is a simple lesson to be learnt from the Smith Corona experience. 'The flotation price was pitched too high,' he says, 'while the business was severely affected by Japanese companies dumping on us.' The market will bear those words in mind as it contemplates the possible candidates for flotation. Hanson Industries has arranged them into four groups: Housebuilding, including Beazer's US housebuilding interests and MW (which produces interior moulding for windows); Consumer products, including Tommy Armour (golf clubs), Farberware (cookware), Ames (lawn, garden and industrial hardware) and Rexair (vacuum cleaners); Recreation and leisure, including Irte Toys and Valley (pool tables and electronic dart games); Jacuzzi, the whirlpool bath manufacturer, which is considered big enough to stand alone. Hanson would keep a small stake in all the possible flotations. If the US stock market unexpectedly falls out of bed, Lord White says, Hanson will quickly shelve the possible flotations and look for strategic buyers. But unless or until that happens, the overheated US market for initial public offerings has been performing in line with a stock-promoter's wildest dreams. One recent example is Royal Appliance Manufacturers, which makes the 'dirt devil' vacuum cleaner. It came to market in August 1991 at Dollars 15.50 a share; rose to Dollars 64; and is now around Dollars 40. With luck, such stories will make US investors forget Smith Corona.  ---------------------------------- HANSON'S CORE BUSINESS  ---------------------------------- in the US: Peabody (coal mines) Cavenham Forests Beazer (US) SCM Chemicals Grove Industries in the UK: Imperial Tobacco Building products incl.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Margarete Limbach report] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel reiterated in a radio  interview this morning that he advocates a political solution to  the Bosnian war. His meeting with his Croatian counterpart in  Bonn today also served this purpose.    The diplomatic merry-go-round regarding the Bosnian war  continues. The Bonn government, the chancellor, and foreign  minister have noisily stressed their contribution to the search  for a political solution to the conflict in the former  Yugoslavia, and hosted the Croatian Foreign Minister Granic  today. According to the principle that everybody who has  something to do with efforts to end the war in the Balkans tries  to influence that party to the war with whom he maintains good  relations, Germany is expected to devote its special attention  to Croatia, which turned from the victim of the Serbian  aggression into an equally brutal aggressor in the eyes of the  international community of states a long time ago.    Thus, the presence of Croatian Government troops in Bosnia  was also discussed today. The U.S. intelligence service  believes that 5,000-6,000 Croatian soldiers are deployed there.  A UN resolution calls for their complete withdrawal. So far  the Croats have not provided any clear information, and it is  difficult to identify the fighting soldiers, because they  naturally do not wear Croatian uniforms. Yet, Granic promised  today that Croatia will observe the UN resolution. A total of  600 Croatian soldiers are to be withdrawn from the Muslim part  of Mostar in the next few days. As far as Mostar itself is  concerned, where the Croatian population has suffered at least  as much as the citizens of Sarajevo, the town is to be placed  under European control after the adoption of a cease-fire.  Germany is ready to play a major role here, Kinkel pointed out.    In central Bosnia, where a Muslim offensive is taking place  against the Bosnian Croats, and in other trouble spots,  officials want to achieve with political instruments what was  accomplished by means of a military threat in Sarajevo -- that  is a cease-fire and the disengagement of hostile troops. Kinkel  does not want to rule out completely the instrument of a  military ultimatum, but a political solution is to be given  priority. The Russians have already made it clear that they  reject the Sarajevo model.    Above all, it is now important to make full use of the  dynamism that resulted from the success of Sarajevo.  Negotiations between the former allied, but now hostile,  Muslims and Croats, which will continue in Zagreb today, are  also a sign of hope. Although efforts are under way to end the  war in the former Yugoslavia, the Federal Government is still  skeptical of the proposal submitted by Russian President Yeltsin  to convene a summit conference. Such a summit would have to be  prepared carefully, Kinkel stated. He does not believe that the  time has come yet. He expressed the hope that the Russians will  prevent the Serbs from using the weapons withdrawn from Sarajevo  in other places in Bosnia.</p>

The current social tranquility in the Czech Republic  testifies also to the people's willingness to accept the road  that had been embarked on, along with the problems which  accompany it, Lux told journalists. He added that it was of key  importance that social peace be preserved this year as well.  Lux said that while implementing the principles of a market  economy, the government had actually managed to establish the  principle of a social market economy -- social consideration.    He said he firmly believed that in the process of the  general  denationalisation of state-owned enterprises, trade unions  should play an active role as a mediator between employers and  employees and that the KDU-CSL intended to support them.    As regards the envisaged five-percent unemployment, the  KDU-CSL considered it necessary and acceptable, said Lux, adding  that he considered the number of employed to be less important  than the period of time during which people have no jobs. He  pointed to the necessity of a more active implementation of  regional policy in problematic regions and especially in areas  with high unemployment.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: French franc pays price for partnership with D-Mark - William Dawkins considers why the currency has come under such pressure THE FRANC'S elevation in recent years to the position of junior partner to the D-Mark is ironically one reason why the French currency has come under such pressure in recent weeks. The structure of the market in francs and franc-denominated bonds, notes and equities shows why it has suffered more from fears about the stability of the European monetary system than from doubts about the health of the French economy. Foreign investors have come to use the franc in recent years as 'a proxy for the D-Mark', in the words of one US banker. So, selling francs is clearly a rational step for investors worried that the franc/D-Mark parity might break in a general collapse of the EMS. Market estimates have it that between FFr50bn (Pounds 5.7bn) and FFr100bn (Pounds 11.4bn) has been dumped in the past fortnight on the Bank of France, which may have used up all the FFr97bn of currency reserves it held at the end of August. Investment demand for francs and French capital instruments has expanded sharply in the past five years or so, thanks to the internationalisation of French finance and industry and success in curbing inflation and the budget deficit. Broadly, the main franc investors fall into three categories, explains Mr Christopher Potts, senior economist at Banque Indosuez. First, there are other central banks, commercial banks and intermediaries; then corporate investors which buy and sell francs to cover business in the French currency; and finally international funds, which hold equities and bonds in francs. 'All of them have made substantial profits in recent years on the rise of the franc and other European currencies. Now they feel the tide has turned,' he says. The signs are that all three kinds of investor have been heavy sellers of francs. A leading US commercial bank reports selling from Scandinavian central banks, which held francs in their reserves and needed to liquidate some of their portfolios to buy their own currencies. Understand-ably, they sold their riskiest holdings first, says the US banker. But the biggest pressure on the franc has probably come from the international funds, especially Japanese ones, Mr Potts believes. They have held on to their underlying franc-denominated investments through the crisis. But they have hedged on the French currency - buying and selling the franc in forward markets - to make enough dealing profits to cover the loss in value of their underlying investments. Typically, Japanese and some other foreign funds used to hedge 40-50 per cent of their franc-denominated investments and accept the exchange rate risk on the rest, estimates Mr Potts. In recent weeks, he estimates that they increased that proportion to 70 per cent. 'If your hedging ratio goes up like that over one month, that means huge flows out of the franc,' says Mr Potts. The market for francs used to be less liquid than for other currencies, but dealers in Paris reckon that over the past five to seven years it has become as easy to buy and sell francs as any leading currency in any time zone. The Bank of France has built up a sophisticated network of correspondent banks, which trade on its behalf, and includes other central banks, highly rated US and European commercial banks and leading French banks, both state-owned and in the private sector. The French central bank cannot, by contrast, lean on the powerful state-owned banks to help it support the franc. It does not have the legal means to do so, since France scrapped foreign exchange controls two years ago and French banks are only allowed to hold a limited proportion of their funds in a single currency. However, French commercial banks are said to have an informal accord under which they quote unattractive prices on French bonds and currency to US banks. Certainly the biggest French banks would not like to be caught speculating hard against the franc. This applies just as much to state-owned as to private-sector banks, since both are largely run by former Treasury officials and maintain close communications with the Treasury and the central bank. Mr Dominique Hoenn, head of market operations at private sector Paribas, says: 'There is no difference between the nationalised banks and us. Probably they have not speculated much against the franc and certainly neither have we because we believe in its value.' The same applies to commercial interest rates. French base rates reflect market conditions just as much as in any leading economy, but the timing of any rate change is the result of close concertation between the banking system and the government. Says Mr Potts: 'There is very close co-operation on the timing of rate changes. Unless they all agree on a move, it won't happen.' An example is the fact that base rates have stayed unchanged since last week's increase in the Bank of France's 5-10 day repurchase rate, the interest rate for borrowers of last resort. So the clear understanding between the state and the banks has helped the authorities, in defending the currency, to hold off any damage to the domestic economy. But for how long? Overnight money market rates - set by the market alone - shot up during the past week to between 21 and 26 per cent, more than twice their normal levels, in response to rise in the central bank's repurchase rate. Unless the cost of overnight borrowing drifts back again towards normal soon, French banks will require a base rate rise to stem their losses.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> Woman on the Beach (AMC Sunday at 10 a.m.) Jean Renoir's last Hollywood movie  is a moody thriller, about a deadly erotic triangle centering on a blind  ex-painter. Though ruinously cut by RKO, it's regarded by critic-filmmaker  Jacques Rivette as one of Renoir's great works.  </P> <P> Moonfleet (TNT Tuesday at 10:15 p.m.) Another Hollywood obscurity revered in  France is this somberly picturesque 18th-Century costumer, in a moonlit-seas  Robert Louis Stevenson mood, by director Fritz Lang. John Houseman produced;  Stewart Granger and George Sanders star.  </P> <P> Confidence (Bravo Thursday at 6 p.m. &amp; 10:30 p.m.) An unusual World War II  romance by the masterful Hungarian director, Istvan ("Mephisto") Szabo; in it,  a couple, thrown together to fool the Nazis, find themselves in the grip of  both terror and love.  </P> <P> The Naked Spur (TMC Friday at 2 p.m.) Perhaps the best of the top-notch Anthony  Mann-Jimmy Stewart Western cycle: a picaresque thriller in which wily killer  Robert Ryan amiably spreads dissension among the trio bringing him in for  bounty.  </P> <P> Movie Movie (ABC Sunday Dec. 16 at 2 a.m.). Two delicious '30's movie parodies,  one on Busby-Berkeley style musicals, the other on "Golden Boy"-style fight  pictures, by director Stanley Donen and writer Larry Gelbart.  </P></p>

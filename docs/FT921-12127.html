			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Statoil to boost refinery capacity STATOIL, the Norwegian state oil company, is planning to invest an estimated NKr4bn (Dollars 641m) to upgrade and expand European refinery capacity, and is also seeking new capacity outside Europe, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Statoil produces about 1m barrels of crude oil a day, but has just 200,000 barrels a day refining capacity. It will spend about NKr2bn to boost annual refining capacity in Denmark to 4.8m tonnes from 3.5m tonnes by building a plant adjacent to its existing refinery at Kalundborg. Construction will be completed in the fourth quarter of 1994.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bikuben cuts dividend as loss widens BIKUBEN, Denmark's third-largest bank, halved the dividend to DKr6 per share after reporting a net loss last year of DKr1.2bn (Dollars 191.7m) compared with a loss in 1991 of DKr48m. Mr Borge Munk Ebbesen, chief executive, said the result 'is obviously unsatisfactory and is a reflection of the general economic crisis.' He made no forecast for 1993, but said a positive vote in the country's second referendum on the Maastricht treaty on May 18 and lower domestic and international interest rates would be crucial to improving the bank's performance. Loss provisions last year increased to DKr1.75bn from DKr1.46bn. Last year's provisions included DKr300m against loans to Hafnia, the troubled insurance group which went into payments suspension last August. The value adjustment for securities gave a loss of DKr293m compared with a profit of DKr396m in 1991. The bank's balance sheet was strengthened by new subordinated loan capital - tier 2 capital - last year and despite the large net loss the capital adequacy ratio improved slightly from DKr11.45 per cent to 11.90 per cent. The legal minimum ratio last year was 10 per cent.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of Hungary (7): Utilities take up the torch - Privatisation HUNGARY appears to be losing its crown as eastern Europe's fastest privatiser. The government is still well short of its target of privatising half the state sector by the end of its term in 1994 giving rise to a widespread impression that privatisation has been disappointingly sluggish. In some cases that may be true. Chemicals group TVK could have been sold to Eastman Kodak of the US in 1991 for Dollars 400m. It was not, and now the company's prospects are bleak. Takeda of Japan sniffed at pharmaceuticals producer Richter Gedeon in 1990, but the authorities dithered, and the company's Comecon markets, and its value, collapsed. Speed counts because the uncertainty leading up to a transaction inhibits investment. 'Managers concentrate, not on the future, but just to survive,' says Mr Gyorgy Suranyi, managing director of Central European International Bank. For this and other reasons, Hungary's state auditors estimate that state property loses about a fifth of its worth a year. But it is easy to be wise after the event and say Hungary should have sold out to western multinationals when they were flush with cash and naive enthusiasm in 1990. No one forecast the extent of the recession in western and eastern Europe, nor the depressing effect that would have on investment flows. Rapid disposals have a downside, too. Acquisitions made in the euphoric days at the start of the decade now look overpriced. Early buyers such as General Electric of the US and Ansaldo of Italy have had to commit much more than they expected. The shattered illusions of pioneer multinationals make a poor advertisement for Hungary's attractions as a destination for cross-border investment. But Hungary's reputation for dragging its heels on privatisation is somewhat unfair. Hungary had about 2,000 state enterprises in 1989. By September 1993 the State Property Agency, the privatisation authority, had sold 273 companies outright, disposed of majority shareholdings in 144 cases and minorities in 71. Liquidation, which is privatisation of a sort, accounted for a further 370 enterprises. Private or partially private companies, including new start-ups, now employ about 36 per cent of the workforce, according to an estimate cited by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. But Budapest's programmes for building up the private economy have none of the grand sweep of the Czech, Polish or Russian voucher schemes while the growth of new private enterprises does not yet match the vibrancy of Poland's homegrown businesses. Yet Hungarian privatisation makes up in depth what it may lack in breadth. Hungary has put the creation of 'real owners' above a nominal shift to the private sector. Nobody can doubt that General Electric, acquirer of lightbulb maker Tungsram, is a private owner. But this is not the case, for example, with the state banks which manage the vouchers issued for the bulk of the Czech Republic's privatised companies. 'What kind of organisations are these?' asks Mr Tamas Szabo, Hungary's minister for privatisation. 'Holdings took the place of the state. Where are the real owners?' The Hungarian cigarette industry, by contrast, is now divided between four western multinationals, the sale of the last of Hungary's seven breweries is pending and the remnant of the sugar industry, still in the hands of the State Property Agency (Spa), is now on offer. Foreign, decidedly private, ownership has penetrated deeply into distilling, paper, confectionery, newspapers and cement sectors as well. Hungary's distinctive policy of selling - rather than distributing - state property has its limits, however. Privatisation revenues peaked at Ft63.2bn in 1992. In the first three quarters of this year the privatisation authorities raised only Ft23.2bn (Dollars 250m) in cash. This is partly because the State Property Agency, the original privatisation authority set up in 1990, is exhausting its portfolio. The Spa has run out of most of the consumer goods producers with their enticing markets, whose sale to western investors powered privat-isation between 1990 and 1992. 'My message to foreign investors is that they must hurry because stocks are running out,' says Mr Lajos Csepi, managing director of the Spa. Some potentially attractive companies remain in the Spa's portfolio however. Confusion over property rights complicated earlier efforts to find investors for the three main hotel chains and the Spa is now trying again. Still lingering with the AV RT state holding company are industrial giants such as TVK, bus maker Ikarus, engineering company Raba, and rubber processor Taurus. But the newly founded AV RT believes these strategic companies require restruct-uring before sale. The Hungarian authorities are banking on a World Bank credit to finance debt 'work-outs' for companies which could be viable when relieved of their inherited debts. The focus of attention now is the sale of the national utilities. 'Now come the bigger cakes, the great, big projects,' says Mr Szabo. International interest in the utilities on offer is intense. But preparation for their sale has taken time because the authorities needed time to devise the necessary regulations. 'You can't sell telecoms like a corner shop,' Mr Szabo says. But now the conditions for telecoms, gas and electricity privatisation appear to be slipping into place as legislation proceeds. The government desperately needs the privatisation revenues that only utility privatisation can bring to finance a budget deficit that it has warned could reach Ft350bn next year. The authorities are due this month to shortlist bidders for 30 per cent of Matav, the national telecoms operator, and the competition is fierce. Front runner is a consortium led by Germany's Deutsche Telekom and including Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK and Ameritech, the regional Bell operating company (RBOC). Another strong contender is the partnership of France Telecom and US West, another RBOC. Matav has drawn attentionas the first state telecommunications utility to be put on sale in eastern Europe. Advisers believe that the new socialist government's halt to Greece's telecoms privatisation will turn the focus of international industry investors on Hungary. 'It is the only near-term game in town,' says one. Schroders, the UK merchant bank, has won the mandate to privatise MVM, the electricity industry holding company. And N M Rothschild, another UK-based company, has a similar role for the gas sector. Legislation on both industries has gone before parliament this month. Further down the line is Mol, the national oil company, on whose sale Lazard Freres of France is advising. There are bound to be hiccups along the way. But, at the present rate of progress, Hungary's utilities will be under private control before most of their counterparts in continental Europe, let alone eastern Europe.</p>

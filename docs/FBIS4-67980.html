			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mustafa al-Liddawi, representative of the </F> Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, in Lebanon by an  unidentified correspondent; date and place not given]    [Excerpts] AL-SHIRA': There were reports  recently about the existence of an Islamic-Islamic dialogue in  which you were involved. What is the dialogue about and has it  had any results?    Al-Liddawi: The Palestinian problem is going  through its most critical phases at present. Years of suffering  and sacrifice have been forgotten and ignored. All our  Palestinian people's rights have also been bypassed and ignored  and there is no more talk about the Palestinian people's dream  of returning to the homeland and establishing their independent  state on all the national soil.    Thus, in view of the gravity of the plot and the great  sacrifices already made, we had to stand firm against the  squandering of our rights and those squandering them in order to  protect our people's right to their territories and homeland.  The Islamic Resistance Movement [Hamas] was eager to consult  all partners in the battle with a common destiny in order to  discuss how to frustrate this genocidal plot. The dialogue was  not limited to a specific party but to all those who are loyal  to this cause. We were prompted in this by the accelerated  squandering of our rights and our belief that all must be  involved in a coordinated and organized move to foil this plot.    AL-SHIRA': With which Arab Islamic forces is Hamas  meeting? How do you justify the methods followed, specifically  those in Egypt and Algeria?    Al-Liddawi: As written in its charter, Hamas  believes that Palestine is an Islamic awqaf land, that is, it  belongs to all Muslims everywhere, regardless of their race, and  to all Muslim generations throughout the ages. Hence the burden  of liberating it falls on the shoulders of all Muslims.    On this premise, Hamas believes that it should have solid  ties with all the Islamic and Arab parties whose objective is to  liberate Palestine and restore the Palestinian people's  legitimate and historic rights. Hamas believes that all the  Arab and Islamic efforts must unite to liberate Palestine.  Hamas needs the efforts of everyone who is faithful to the  Palestinian people and their cause, even if we have differences  with some of them over ideas and ideologies.    As for what is happening in Egypt and Algeria, the Hamas  policy is not to interfere in the affairs of others; this is  based on our desire to maintain the uniqueness of the  Palestinian cause. Hence, we do not interfere. But at the same  time, we call on all the parties to refer their differences to  the Koran and the true Islamic path. We also call on all of  them to begin a dialogue in order to end all the illusions and  deceptions that the enemies of this Islamic nation are trying to  plant in our midst to create more divisions and differences.    AL-SHIRA': You stand accused of impeding the work  of the Palestinian forces' alliance by rejecting the election of  an alternative leadership to 'Arafat and because of your bad  relations with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [DFLP] which reached their nadir when you killed one  of its military officials, "Yusuf Abu-Lafi," in the occupied  territories?    Al-Liddawi: [passage omitted] We are seeking  comprehensive Palestinian elections for the Palestinian people,  wherever they are. We do not want flashy and formal elections  that do not bring the best for our people or which are held  through popular conferences where the conferees are not allowed  any freedom of opinion.    As for our differences with the DFLP, we were deeply pained  by what happened and our pain increased when the DFLP opted to  discuss some of the problems between the two sides in the media  and in front of those who gloat over these differences. I do  not want to rehash the problem's details, for we jointly put an  end to it. But I hope that the brothers in the DFLP will  embrace the principle of coordination with us and that none of  us will resort to publicizing our differences in the media. The  DFLP will find that Hamas is ready to deal with it on the basis  of coordination and respect for each other, especially as we are  both going through such difficult times.    AL-SHIRA': Your killing of Abu-Lafi could trigger  a Kabul-style conflict in the occupied territories. The  elements of strife are there. What do you plan to do to avoid  this scenario?    Al-Liddawi: As I said in my last answer, we seek  closer coordination everywhere. We want to cooperate seriously  with other groups in order to serve the Palestinian cause. We  want to harass the enemy with more painful operations. We want  to contain any problem, however big, by referring it to the  joint coordination committee. We should not pay attention to  press reports and allegations, for these normally throw fuel on  the fire. [passage omitted]    AL-SHIRA': There were attempts to initiate a  dialogue between you and 'Arafat after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre. How far have these attempts gone?    Al-Liddawi: There will be no dialogue with 'Arafat  until he withdraws from the settlement process and renounces the  Oslo agreement. There have been no dialogues with 'Arafat  following his recent involvement in the quagmire of the Oslo  agreement.    But at the same time, we might meet with Fatah members  inside  the occupied homeland to solve local problems and avert any  further aggravation of the existing bad situation between the  two movements. Such meetings would also help prevent the  struggle from dissolving into infighting. We must make every  possible effort to insure that such infighting never occurs.  [passage omitted]</p>

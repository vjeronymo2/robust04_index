			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Algerian Prime Minister Redha Malek has granted an  interview to our colleagues of the French third television  channel. He says he is in favor of a strong state, and one  which at the same time is closer to the concerns of Algerians.  Redha Malek :    [Begin recording] [Malek] Our intention and, I would even  say, our wish and our determination, is to build a solid state  on firm foundations, a state which is also credible, one which  is in touch with the people and not cut off from the people, one  which is with the people, which forms one body with the Algerian  people.    [Correspondent Christian Mallard] So, it is a matter of  putting behind you certain errors which may have been made in  the past -- I am thinking in particular of the time of President  Chedli Bendjedid?    [Malek] Yes, absolutely. We are in favor of making a break  with it. If we have ended up in the current situation it is  because the state did not play its role, because the consensus  which had existed was eroded away, because there were deviations  of all kinds, which meant that the state lost the trust of the  people. The past is over, we are making a break with it, and we  are moving on toward the future, and we are going toward the  21st century with our heads high. [end recording]</p>

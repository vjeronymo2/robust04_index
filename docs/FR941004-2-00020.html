			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> AST provided no indication that the disregarded sales were at prices that would permit recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time and in the normal course of trade. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 773(b)(2); 19 U.S.C. 1677b(b)(2)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Constructed Value <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We calculated CV based on the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses, U.S. packing costs and profit. In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of the Act we: 1) included the greater of AST's reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of manufacture (COM), as appropriate and; 2) for profit, we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Price-to-Price Comparisons <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For price-to-price comparisons, we calculated FMV based on ex-factory or delivered prices, inclusive of packing to home market customers. From these prices, we deducted commission, where appropriate. We deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. We also made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In light of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ad Hoc Committee of AZ&hyph;NM&hyph;TX&hyph;FL Producers of Gray Portland Cement  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13 F. 3d 398 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Instead, we adjust for those expenses under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a) and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2), as appropriate. Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from the FMV under the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a). This adjustment included home market inland freight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For both price-to-price comparisons and comparisons to CV, we also made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). For U.S. sales with unreported payment dates, we based AST's credit expense on the average number of days outstanding between shipment and payment for AST's U.S. sales with reported payment dates. For a discussion of the Department's treatment of credit in this investigation, please see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Memorandum from Barbara R. Stafford to Susan G. Esserman  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (September 26, 1994) on file in room B&hyph;099 of the U.S. Department of Commerce. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1), we added U.S. indirect selling expenses as an offset to the home market commission, but capped this addition by the amount of the home market commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We adjusted for a consumption tax collected in the Thai home market. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the United States Price section of this notice, above.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

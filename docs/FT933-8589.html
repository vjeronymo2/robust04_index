			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever steady Food and toiletries giant Unilever produced figures at the top end of expectations and the shares appreciated 10 to 986p. However, hopes that the figures might herald a turnaround in the group's and food manufacturing sector's fortunes were largely disappointed as Unilever reported continuing tough trading conditions in the North American detergent market and little upturn throughout its European operations. Most gains were made in emerging markets. Unilever shares have been badly hit by worries over the fate of its brands as some of the world's top branded goods producers have been forced to cut prices this year in response to cheaper alternatives. Low food price inflation has also dragged the stock and the sector lower. One analyst said he remained cautious over any recovery in the sector's share prices, though he admitted that Unilever's low rating - the stock has underperformed the market by 23 per cent in the past 12 months - made it look attractive as a longer-term recovery play. Mr Carl Short, food manufacturing analyst at Strauss Turnbull, went further. 'This is a good set of results which should go some way to restoring the market's confidence in the underlying strengths of Unilever,' he said. 'In a nutshell: brands bite back.' There was further evidence of a change in sentiment in food retailing stocks as another two stockbroking firms turned positive on the sector. Dealers said that Henderson Crosthwaite had issued a buy note on three of the sector's leading stocks, arguing that the ratings had fallen too far. UBS was also said to be preparing to launch a 'buy' note early next week in which the broker will argue that the sector looks oversold and that the potential for any further downside is severely limited. Yesterday, Argyll showed some signs of recovery, adding 2 to 327p. Albert Fisher gained 4 to 73p, Kwik Save 4 to 682p and J Sainsbury 3 1/2 to 484 1/2 p. Food manufacturing stocks, chased up this week on yield considerations, ran into a bout of profit-taking. Booker, off 3, recovered to close unchanged at 443p. Dalgety lost 6 to 489p and Hillsdown a penny to 161p. Elsewhere, Unilever's performance was matched only by United Biscuits, up 4 at 379p. Unigate retreated 8 to 391p and Tate and Lyle 5 to 393p. Tour operator Airtours gained 3 to 378p after Canadian-owned rival Thomson reported good summer results and healthy pre-booking for next summer. Leisure analysts expect a crucial week ahead as the rival camps unveil their brochures and prices which should indicate the potential for discounting. Standard Chartered continued its impressive rally after Thurday's results. The shares closed 18 up at 967p. Profit-takers were at work on Barclays which has enjoyed a firm run after its recent figures. The shares slipped 7 to 494p. The share price of Medeva tumbled 11 1/2 to 95 1/2 p in late trading on news that a lawsuit had started in the US against the management regarding statements on the company's business prospects. Analysts said such actions were not uncommon in the US after large falls in shares. Wellcome shed 14 to 641p on US health cut worries. Smith &amp; Nephew, manufacturer of medical and consumer healthcare products, lost 1 to 143 1/2 in record daily turnover of 18m shares after negative comments from analysts on its interim figures. NatWest Securities said the combination of modest earnings growth coupled with high risk continued to warrant a reduction in overweight holdings. Credit Lyonnais Laing issued a note saying that British Land continued to offer the highest dividend growth prospects, pushing its share price up 4 to 370p, before settling down to the opening 366p. Land Security, which appreciated 14 to 674p, and Brixton Estate, which fell 3 to 237p, were the only other property leaders the securities house expected to increase dividends.</p>

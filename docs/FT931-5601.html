			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Retailer seeks OFT probe of Kellogg prices SHOPRITE, the discount food retailer, is calling for an Office of Fair Trading investigation into Kellogg, the food manufacturer, which threatened to stop supplying corn flakes to the chain unless it raised the selling price. The chain, which is based in the Isle of Man but operates only in Scotland, has written to the OFT complaining of 'unwarranted interference' by Kellogg, which told all retailers in January it would stop supplying them if they sold 500g packs of the cereal below cost price of 96p. Mr Deryck Nicholson, Shoprite chairman, said his 40 stores had been selling corn flakes as a loss-leader at 84p for two years, but made a profit on other Kellogg brands. He said other large retailers, unable to match Shoprite's price, may have put pressure on the manufacturer. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, tabled a Commons question this week to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, asking him to investigate the role other large retailers may have played in Kellogg's decision to stop supplying Shoprite. Kellogg insisted yesterday that retail pricing on its products was 'for individual retailers to determine. However, we also believe it is unreasonable for retailers to use Kellogg's brands as loss-leaders in order to build their overall business.' It said its decision to stop supplying retailers who sold Kellogg brands below cost was in accordance with the 1976 Resale Prices Act. Mr Nicholson disputed Kellogg's interpretation of the law. He said special prices for Kellogg's corn flakes and other products had featured in the launch campaign of many of its stores. 'Kellogg knew this and supported us with cash incentives that contributed to advertising and trade promotion. I don't understand why Kellogg is introducing restrictions now.' The case is another example of friction between the rapidly expanding discount retailing sector and big-name suppliers. Aldi, the German discount food retailer, complained to the OFT that large retailers were pressing manufacturers into not supplying it when it opened in the UK in 1990. The OFT said it could find 'no firm evidence' but would monitor the situation. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is investigating the perfume market at the request of the OFT, after a complaint from Superdrug, the cosmetics and toiletries chain, that some leading perfume manu-facturers were refusing to supply it.</p>

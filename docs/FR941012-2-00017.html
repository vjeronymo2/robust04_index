			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The major burden we are placing on parties is that they adopt procedures to ensure that the applicant does not disclose any of the APO information to anyone other than the submitter and other persons authorized to have access to the information in accordance with the requirements set forth in the DOC's regulations. We are continuing to require that the applicant use the information solely for the segment of the ITA proceeding in which it is submitted. Any other use of the information, including its use before the International Trade Commission in its proceeding, is a violation of the ITA's APO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Protection of Electronic Business Proprietary Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed application prohibits the applicant from seeking assistance from the ITA in handling or processing electronic data/medium served on the applicant by a party other than the ITA (Item 14 of the application). In an effort to reduce the complexity of the proposed standard APO, and to avoid any misconceptions on this matter, we have included this condition from the ``computer tape'' APOs in the proposed application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ITA is responsible for conducting its proceedings within statutory deadlines and does not possess the capability of providing instruction to parties who may be unfamiliar with computer processing. Should a party experience difficulty in handling or processing electronic data/media served on them pursuant to an APO, the party should seek assistance from the provider of the information. The ITA, of course, will provide appropriate assistance concerning electronic information prepared and released by the ITA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed application requires the applicant to ensure that APO information entered on computers will only be resident in the computer at times when programs are actually being run, and will not be accessible via modem or network (Items 15 and 16). These requirements are also taken from the ``computer tape'' APOs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ITA's ``computer tape'' APOs have been a major area of concern for the Trade Bar. Generally it is felt that the ITA has been overly restrictive in its requirements concerning electronic data. The standard ``computer tape'' requirements were developed in response to the Court of International Trade's directive that the ITA craft an administrative protective order specifically designed to provide a heightened degree of protection necessary to protect sensitive electronic data. In light of the experience we have now gained in routinely releasing this information under APO, and in view of the comments we have received from the Trade Bar, we have determined that two conditions, as set forth in items 15 and 16 of the application, are critical to the protection of this sensitive data. Electronic information resident in a computer is most vulnerable. Therefore, we believe that electronic data released under APO should only be resident in a computer when it is actually being used (Item 15). At the time it is resident in the computer and programs are actually being run, access via modem or network must be rendered impossible (Item 16). Compliance with these two conditions will prevent unauthorized access via electronic means.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Certification Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are two separate certification requirements in the proposed application. The first concerns the departure of a representative from a firm, and the second concerns the transition from an ITA APO to a judicial protective order. The proposed application requires the applicant to certify to the ITA compliance with the terms of the APO prior to departure from the applicant's current firm, and to submit a new application if appropriate (Item 17). This procedure does not change the established practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the current application requires an applicant to notify the ITA if any of the facts in the application change, many parties are not certain of the procedures that should be followed when an individual subject to an APO leaves a firm prior to the completion of the proceeding. Item 17 provides particular guidance to the applicant, and sets forth within the application specific procedures to be followed. Additionally, the proposed APO Guidelines outline the preferred procedure for handling the transfer of APO information should a change in representation occur during the course of a segment of a proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed application requires the applicant to certify to the return or destruction of the APO information within ten business days of the expiration of the time for filing for judicial or panel review at the end of the case (Item 18). Failure to do so is a violation of the APO. The ITA is making renewed efforts to ensure that this important provision is strictly adhered to. The ITA is publishing reminders in its  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices reminding parties about this requirement. In the proposed application, we have significantly increased from the two-day time limit required by the current application. The current application requires that applicants certify to the return or destruction of APO information within two business days of the expiration of the time for filing for, or intervening in, a judicial or panel review at the end of the case. The increase in time to ten business days allows the applicant sufficient time to be notified of a judicial or panel appeal. The ITA has routinely granted extensions to this deadline when requested, and will adjust this deadline for the convenience of the parties. The extended deadline is reasonable, and does not compromise the security of the APO information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

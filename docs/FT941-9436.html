			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / People: Finance moves In recent months, Birmingham Midshires, the UK's 13th largest society, has been notable for acquiring mortgage books to boost its assets. Now it has acquired a full-time corporate development director to take on this work. Stephen Bright, the society's finance director, has been appointed to a new position of corporate development director, though he will continue in post until a successor is appointed, probably within the next few months. Birmingham Midshires currently has assets of over Pounds 4bn, and aims to increase them to over Pounds 5bn by the end of the year. Bright, 44, has been finance director for almost 10 years since he moved to the society from a background in stockbroking and management consultancy.

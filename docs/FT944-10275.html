			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Arts: Musical farce and honour - Andrew Clark visits the Massenet festival in Saint-Etienne No French city has found a niche in the music market as deservedly as Saint-Etienne, home of the biennial Massenet festival. During his lifetime, the composer turned his back on his birthplace, and the city today - a dowdy mining centre just off the massif central - is a tourist's disaster area. But in recent years Saint-Etienne has developed a useful business in Massenet revivals, and the music world is taking note. First came Amadis in 1988, then Cleopatre in 1990, Esclarmonde and Griselidis in 1992, and now Panurge and Le Cid. Thas and Marie-Magdeleine are promised for 1996. When you consider how little the French have done to explore the lesser-known works of Berlioz or Chabrier, Saint-Etienne is serving Massenet rather well. The local opera company throws FFr9.5m (Pounds 1.1m), or 25 per cent of its annual budget, into ten days of music. Sponsorship from France Telecom and a recording deal with Koch-Schwann help to pay for the soloists. At the last two festivals, money seemed plentiful. This year bore signs of cost-paring and under-preparation. Unlike 1992, the local orchestra shouldered the burden of work alone - which may explain the sub-standard playing in Panurge. Few of the principals showed the familiarity with their roles that one expects at a festival. Panurge, a three-act musical farce, had not been performed since 1913, the year of its posthumous Paris premiere. Based on a novel by the 16th century French writer Rabelais, it tells of the misunderstandings, adventures and eventual reunion of Panurge and his wife Colombe. Some of the action has a whiff of sit-com - as when Colombe, trying to make her errant husband jealous, confesses her supposed infidelities to a gossiping priest, who is none other than Panurge in disguise. The music is slight and full of parody (has any other composer written a sheep's chorus?), and there is some subtle 16th century pastiche. But Massenet could have written it in his sleep. The Saint-Etienne production, staged and designed by Adriano Sinivia, looked more like a half-baked Gozzi pantomime than a comedy of the sexes a la francaise. The mobile toy-box sets resembled a children's playpen; the costumes could have passed muster for Jack and the Beanstalk. Worst of all, the action was no naughtier than a Sunday school tea-party. The work cries out for the irreverent approach of a Jerome Savary. But Panurge is unlikely to get another chance. Stronger characterisation of the principals would have helped. The title role - written, like Don Quichotte, for a basse chantante - requires greater comic skills than Jean-Philippe Courtis could offer. He was too noble in bearing, too frayed of voice. Colombe, an unusually down-to-earth Massenet heroine, was decently sung but unimaginatively acted by Helene Perraguin. Desmond Byrne's Pantagruel, imprisoned for much of the evening in an outsize mechanical costume, was a strait-laced master of ceremonies. The casting of smaller roles was barely adequate. Saint-Etienne's young music director, Patrick Fournillier, drew much more secure playing in Le Cid: it was hard to believe that the clarinet obbligato in the famous soprano aria 'Pleurez, pleurez mes yeux' came from the same orchestra as the scratchy violin soloist in Panurge. But the chorus was different - and what a disciplined sound the Lyon Opera chorus made] The fact that Le Cid was being recorded had clearly influenced the allocation of rehearsal time. Based on Corneille's play of love versus honour, Le Cid is a four-act grand opera in the Meyerbeer tradition, written immediately after Manon and before Werther. It may lack their intimacy, but it shares their creative vitality. The concert setting, with only two minor cuts, underlined Massenet's skill as a musical dramatist: heroic writing for tenor and soprano, atmospheric choruses, a sense of urgency in the duel scene, and ballet music in the best French tradition of fake Spanishry - all infused with characteristic refinement. It was written for first-class voices (the De Reszke brothers among others), and demands a spectacular staging. Saint-Etienne provided neither, but somehow got away with it. Michele Command was the formidable Chimene, a little unyielding in the gentler moments but rock-steady in attack. Chris Merritt was a rough-and-ready Rodrigue, lacking the tonal resonance and clarion ease the part demands. As Don Diegue, Jean-Philippe Courtis was in better voice than his Panurge 24 hours earlier. Marcel Vanaud was the stentorian king, and the veteran Gabriel Bacquier made a short but effective contribution as the Count of Gormas. Maryse Castets's pure soprano was ideal for the Infanta. Le Cid was preceded by a recital by Didier Henry, the young French baritone who - like most soloists at the festival - spends most of his time on the French provincial opera house circuit. His opening Massenet group was marred by offstage noise and a husky tone quality, but the voice took wing in Ernest Moret's 'Tu me donnas ton coeur', revealing ample colour and an easy top. Best of all was the gentle melancholy of Massenet's settings of poems by Armand Sylvestre, beautifully accompanied by Angeline Pondepeyre.</p>

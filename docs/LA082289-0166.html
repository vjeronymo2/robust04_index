Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> RICKY BERRY AUTOPSY FINDS NO DRUGS  </P> <P> Ricky Berry, the Sacramento Kings' star who shot himself to death following a  quarrel with his wife, did not take drugs or alcohol in the hours before his  death, the Sacramento County coroner's office reported today.  </P> <P> Berry was "very clean, there was no evidence of drugs at all," said Chief  Deputy Coroner Bob Bowers, who released the findings of an autopsy and  toxicology report.  </P> <P> Police investigators said Berry, 24, shot himself in the head on Aug. 14 within  an hour of quarreling with his wife, who left their suburban Sacramento home  following their middle-of-the-night dispute and returned hours later to  discover the body. Berry reportedly left a suicide note in which he described  marital problems. He and his wife, Valerie, had recently moved to their  $360,000 home.  </P></p>

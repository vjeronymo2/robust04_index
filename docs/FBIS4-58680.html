			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by MBC correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit in </F> Sanaa--live or recorded]    [Text] Political and military sources have reported to us  that the fighting has extended to the areas of Ta'izz, Abyan,  al-Bayda', and Aden. Also, warplanes belonging to the Yemeni  Socialist Party carried out air strikes against Sanaa, Ta'izz,  and al-Hudaydah, as well as the airports and vital targets in  the three towns.    Fighting is still raging. Various types of air force and  ground weapons are being used by the two sides. Meanwhile, calm  returned to Dhamar after the surrender of the Basahib camp and  the joining of its troops to the northern forces.    Seven military brigades belonging to the north are now  advancing toward Aden to tighten their control on it. The MBC  team is at this very moment in the Sanaa television building and  southern warplanes are flying over to attack the building.  Antiaircraft fire is intercepting the raiding planes.</p>

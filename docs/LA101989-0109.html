			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWN BOWLING LEGEND TO COMPETE  </P> <P> Neil McInnes rolled the draw, curved the yard then unleashed the drive.  </P> <P> Having demonstrated, with ease and accuracy, the three basic shots that have  made him an American legend in his sport, McInnes turned toward an onlooker at  the Pasadena Lawn Bowling Club and grinned.  </P> <P> "It's really a mental game, it's all up here," said McInnes, pointing to his  head. "If you can't handle it in your head, then you've got problems."  </P> <P> McInnes has presented opponents with dilemmas on the greens since 1971, when he  won the first of his 11 U.S. (American citizens only) and National (open) lawn  bowling titles in singles, pairs and triples competitions.  </P> <P> Next Monday, the 61-year-old Glendale resident is expected to contend for his  first major title in five years when he takes part in the U.S. Championships in  Roxbury Park, Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> "I rely a lot more on experience than anything else," says McInnes, who was  born in Scotland and came to the United States in 1964. "I keep telling these  young guys I'm not dead yet."  </P> <P> Indeed, the 6-foot, 170 pound, McInnes is a live wire in an otherwise sedate  sport in which most recreational players are senior citizens and top  competitors are in their 40s and 50s.  </P> <P> Employing the concentration of an archer, the patience of a hunter and the  tenacity of a boxer, McInnes is wont to laugh and joyously shout as he stalks  younger opponents on the green.  </P> <P> "I like to say he's overtly aggressive," says 30-year-old Lloyd Kennedy of  Santa Ana, who teamed with McInnes to win the doubles competition at the  Southwest Open last spring. "His presence on the green is sometimes enough to  really throw opponents off.  </P> <P> "He's pretty cunning. He knows what to say to certain people to really rattle  them."  </P> <P> To the casual observer, lawn bowling appears anything but unsettling.  </P> <P> The game, which dates to the time of Julius Caesar, is played on a 120-foot  square green that can accommodate eight rinks. Ideally, the grass is a dried,  greenish-brown color that gives the surface the consistency of a pool table's  felt.  </P> <P> Each player has four matching bowls, which can be as small as 4 3/4 inches in  diameter and as large as 5 1/8. The bowls, manufactured in Australia, England  and Scotland, are made of hard plastic and are weighted off-center to make them  curve when rolled.  </P> <P> Points are awarded for bunching the most bowls nearest the jack, a small white  ball that serves as a target. Players, therefore, must become skilled at  knocking an opponents' bowl away from the target since points are scored for  each bowl inside an opponent's nearest bowl.  </P> <P> Games are generally to 18 or 21 points and disputes are settled by tape  measure.  </P> <P> McInnes, who works as a carpenter, hones his skills by practicing four to five  times a week.  </P> <P> "You can't be too mechanical or too stiff," McInnes says. "A lot of bowlers are  very mechanical instead of letting the body flow.  </P> <P> "You also have to be able to handle pressure. A lot of people are good bowlers,  but they fold like a house of cards when they get into real competition."  </P> <P> McInnes was 29 when he was introduced to competitive lawn bowling in Australia  in 1958. He spent three years in Australia before returning to his native  Scotland. He came to the U.S. in 1964 intent on earning enough money to return  to Australia.  </P> <P> McInnes, however, remained in California, obtained U.S. citizenship in 1969 and  began his ascent to the top of the national lawn bowling scene.  </P> <P> The sport has allowed McInnes to compete in such places as Australia, New  Zealand, England and South Africa.  </P> <P> "One of the best things about lawn bowling is the comradeship with the other  players," McInnes said. "It's a sport where you form lifetime friendships with  people from all over the world."  </P> <P> If McInnes does well this weekend, he will almost assuredly be selected to the  eight-man team that will represent the U.S. in the World Bowls, a quadrennial  event that will be held next year in New Zealand.  </P> <P> Unlike many of the sport's observers who believe that the World Bowls will be  his last hurrah, McInnes thinks some of his best lawn bowling days lay ahead.  </P> <P> "When I was young I could bowl all day and I could go dancing at night,"  McInnes says. "I can't do that anymore. I've got to pace myself.  </P> <P> "But I'll be competitive as long as my legs last -- as long as I can bend and  get that right knee down and so I don't dump the ball like the old people.  </P> <P> "Once you can't get down, forget it."  </P></p>

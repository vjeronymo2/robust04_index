			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Taiwanese demonstrators stage sit-in NEARLY 20,000 protesters took to the streets in Taiwan demanding direct presidential elections during three days of rallies organised by the island's main opposition party, the DPP, writes Luisetta Mudie in Taipei. The protests were scheduled to end by midnight yesterday, but the protesters staged a sit-in in central Taipei, saying they would not move until the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) agreed to direct election of the president, currently chosen by the National Assembly. The issue highlighted deep divisions within the KMT leadership last month, but a decision was deferred until 1995 at the latest. KMT deputies in the National Assembly, which is currently in session to amend the constitution, have been ordered to shelve the issue. The DPP advocates formal independence for Taiwan. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, although scuffles broke out with police when DPP National Assembly deputies arrived at the presidential palace demanding to see the president.</p>

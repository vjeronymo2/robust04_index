The order was approved after it was learned that the mosque  served as a Hamas base.    Students from two Bethlehem schools stoned IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] soldiers, but there were no casualties. The  students hurled the stones because they failed in their  matriculation examinations.    Police Commissioner Rafi Peled said that the police plan to  increase supervision of residents from the territories crossing  the Green Line to work in Israel, and if needed approval of  entry into Israel will be made tougher.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEW IN CLASSES ON 2ND DAY OF SCHOOL STRIKE;  </P> <P> BEVERLY HILLS: MANY STUDENTS RALLY IN SUPPORT OF TEACHERS IN THEIR WALKOUT OVER  PAY AND BENEFITS.  </P> <P> Both sides in the Beverly Hills teachers strike said late Tuesday night that  they will resume talks today, although the district and the union disagreed on  whether the new round of negotiations might produce a settlement.  </P> <P> Bill Gordon, chief negotiator for the teachers, said that if the district is  willing to alter its latest offer, the labor dispute might be settled as early  as today.  </P> <P> "When this is settled it's going to be at the bargaining table, not the picket  line," Gordon said.  </P> <P> But Dana Tomarken, president of the Beverly Hills Board of Education, was less  sanguine, saying that the district's most recent offer to teachers was still  "the last, best and final" one.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased that there is some talking going on but I don't know what will  come out of it," Tomarken said.  </P> <P> Contract negotiations, which had been taking place for several months, broke  off last Thursday and nearly all the district's 300 teachers, nurses and  counselors walked out Monday morning. Talks are set to resume at 10 a.m. at  district headquarters, with a state mediator in attendance.  </P> <P> The district's latest offer is for a teacher pay raise of 11% over two years.  The teachers' union, Beverly Hills Education Assn., is demanding 18% over two  years, or 10.5% for the current school year.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, attendance plummeted at Beverly Hills schools as the first-ever  strike in the district weathered its second day.  </P> <P> Students gathered for a brief morning rally outside Beverly Hills High School,  shouting "Scabs go home!" and "We want our teachers!" One student held up a  sign that said "Students Can't Achieve With Bums."  </P> <P> Beverly Hills police officers were evident at the rally but there were no  incidents.  </P> <P> Robert French, superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District,  estimated that 125 students walked out of class, but students and others  observers said the number was closer to 200. Only a small number of students  appeared to return to classes.  </P> <P> French said attendance districtwide had dropped from 80% Monday to 53% Tuesday.  Only 42% of Beverly Hills High's normal enrollment of about 2,000 students came  to class Tuesday -- the lowest attendance rate of the city's five schools --  while 62% of elementary students showed up.  </P> <P> The district has a total of 4,700 students.  </P> <P> At a morning press conference at district headquarters, French said that all  classrooms were being staffed by credentialed instructors.  </P> <P> Reports from the high school suggested otherwise, however.  </P> <P> Shawn Pakizegi, 15, said he waited for about 40 minutes outside his classroom  Tuesday morning, but no instructor appeared. "That's why I'm out here today,"  he said, surrounded by a group of friends on the sidewalk outside the school.  </P> <P> Rady Rahban, 16, said his substitute teacher brought a VCR and television to  class and showed a program called "Basketball Bloopers."  </P> <P> Doron Barness, 15, who joined teachers on the picket line Tuesday, said many of  his classmates decided to go to Disneyland. "I wanted to go, but I decided to  support my teachers instead."  </P> <P> Doron said he conducted a quick survey of about 15 classrooms and saw an  average of seven students in each room.  </P> <P> Shortly after the first bell rang at the high school, about a dozen teachers  were huddled around a walkie-talkie, held by another striking instructor, that  was tuned to the channel used by the school's administrators and security  officers. Voices overheard on the walkie-talkie asked what to do about "kids  just milling about on campus" or "occupying themselves on the stairway." At  other times, school personnel were heard reporting the rooms that needed to be  unlocked.  </P> <P> When a male voice was heard saying, "We need a teacher (in) room 524," the  strikers cheered.  </P> <P> Of about 200 substitutes hired, about 10 chose not to return Tuesday, and five  or six had been deemed unqualified and were not rehired, French said.  </P> <P> Several Beverly Hills High students said their substitutes told them they work  in the Los Angeles Unified School District, where teachers waged a nine-day  strike in May for higher pay and more authority.  </P> <P> One Beverly Hills High substitute, who would not give her name, said she  teaches English at an adult school in the Los Angeles district, but is not a  member of the local union. She said she decided to sign up for substitute duty  in Beverly Hills purely for financial reasons. A single mother with two  children, she said, "I need a way to cover the rent."  </P> <P> Officials of United Teachers-Los Angeles have said that no union members are  among the substitutes.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills is offering substitutes $185 a day -- compared to the $137 a day  Los Angeles offered in the May walkout.  </P> <P> The teacher also said that school officials asked her to teach a German class  even though she is not qualified in the subject.  </P> <P> "The substitutes just don't cut it," said Jenny Brandt, an eighth-grader at  Beverly Vista Elementary School. She said her substitute teacher gave the class  an assignment to write a 250-word essay on "Would we rather be a tree or a  wave?"  </P> <P> Another student, seventh-grader Andrew Kline, said his substitute asked  students to write about "what our favorite movies were."  </P> <P> One Beverly Vista parent, however, said he was satisfied that the school was  trying hard to maintain normal routines. "From what I've heard, they (students)  are doing a lot of work," said Tom Guterres. "Not like at Beverly Hills High."  </P> <P> At El Rodeo Elementary School, three fifth-graders had set up a lemonade stand  across from the campus to supply striking teachers with refreshments.  </P> <P> "We're not learning anything," said Jessica Lee, 10, explaining why she was not  in school.  </P> <P> Many parents came to pick up their children early Tuesday because they felt  they were receiving little more than baby-sitting. One mother, who said she  came to campus to observe the conditions, said many children are confused and  troubled by the strike. "They want to come to learn," she said, "but they don't  want to cross their teacher by crossing the (picket) line."  </P> <P> Panos Nicolaou, a film and television producer who has two children in Beverly  Hills schools, said he canceled a meeting at Warner Bros. studios in order to  walk the picket line with the high school teachers.  </P> <P> "I'm very concerned with what's going on," Nicolaou said. "It's not just a  question of teachers wanting more money. It's a question of priorities.  Education should be No. 1."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Generator unit No. 6 at the Diez de Octubre power  plant in Nuevitas is being dismantled for general maintenance. A  total of 337 workers will participate in this task, which will  take 20 days. Afterwards, they will continue with the repairs to  the air-preheating system, change the air ducts, and install a  forced-air fan and a seawater pump.    The maintenance is scheduled to be done within 70 work  shifts, but the workers expect to conclude it in 60, as they did  before, with generator unit No. 5. Once the maintenance work is  completed, generator unit No. 6 will produce 110 megawatt-hours,  in contrast to the mere 45 megawatt-hours currently being  produced.</p>

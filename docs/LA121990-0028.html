			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUSINESSES EVACUATED AFTER TANKS RUPTURED  </P> <P> Authorities in Lancaster evacuated a four-block area of commercial and  industrial buildings Tuesday after construction workers ruptured two  underground liquid storage tanks thought to contain gasoline, county fire  officials said.  </P> <P> Businesses near Avenue J and the Sierra Highway were evacuated at 12:30 p.m.  when workers installing city street lights hit the tanks, said Howard Spinrad,  a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department.  </P> <P> About 20 businesses were evacuated, Sheriff's Lt. Dan Ridder said. It was not  known how many people were evacuated.  </P> <P> Officials said they believe that the liquid in the tanks is gasoline, but they  were unsure because of the age of the tanks.  </P> <P> The 350- to 450-gallon receptacles were buried 10 feet underground and may have  been left behind by the operators of a gas station, authorities said.  </P> <P> "It may have been a gas station in operation years and years ago, and nobody  knew they were there," Spinrad said of the tanks. The tanks were believed to be  40 to 50 years old.  </P> <P> Evacuated workers were allowed to return about 5 p.m.  </P> <P> Authorities were investigating the incident.  </P></p>

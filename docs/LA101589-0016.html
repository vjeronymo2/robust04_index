			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: SUITABLE FOR FRAMING  </P> <P> On the rabbit trail: Gary Wolf -- author of the 1982 novel on which "Roger  Rabbit" is based -- is writing a sequel: "Who P-p-p-p-plugged Roger Rabbit."  The book's about to be offered through auction to publishers, but Disney's  already optioned film rights (for a possible 1994 release).  </P> <P> This time, Roger and Jessica Rabbit have become movie stars (rather than  cartoon stars), up for parts in a big picture. Then there's a murder -- and  detective Eddie (Bob Hoskins in the original pic) is a suspect.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a "prequel," "The Return of Roger Rabbit," is already in development  at Disney as a 1991 production. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

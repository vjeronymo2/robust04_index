			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / DC may face federal rescue The federal government may be forced to take over the virtually bankrupt District of Columbia, according to reports circulating in Washington. The hardest evidence of such a prospect came in a television interview aired on Thursday night with Mrs Eleanor Holmes Norton, the DC delegate to Congress. She advised city employees who qualify for a job buy-out 'to take it and run, you're playing with fire'. The Washington Times also reported that the General Accounting Office, acting at the request of two Democratic congressmen, had begun a review of the history of previous examples of federal rescues of financially strapped cities, including the precedent of New York in the mid-1970s. Among several options under consideration by the independent federal agency, the newspaper said quoting the GAO, were a complete federal takeover of the city's affairs or the appointment of a federal board of directors to oversee civic finances. Mr Marion Barry will return as mayor in January with virtually no cash in hand and with little choice but to pursue even harsher budget-cutting measures than those instituted by the outgoing mayor, Ms Sharon Pratt Kelly. Even with such measures, it is considered certain DC would need to raise money on the capital markets, where it enjoys little confidence, or ask the federal government for assistance. Among Ms Kelly's proposals - and the subject of Mrs Norton's reference  - are incentives to city employees to take early retirement. This programme is now calculated to save Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.5m), well short of the Dollars 140m original target. Compounding DC's problems is the uncertain relationship between Mr Barry, whose three previous terms in office are generally seen as having wrecked city finances, and the new Republican Congress. Mr Newt Gingrich, the likely next Speaker, has already proposed abolishing the House district committee which, under the Democrats, had proved a sympathetic, if often critical, forum for the mayor and city council.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Water leaks may influence pricing MR Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water industry regulator, said yesterday he would be 'looking very closely' at the costs of water companies and their leakage rates when - in 1994 - he sets the formula for price rises in the second half of the decade. According to a report issued by Ofwat yesterday, nearly a quarter of mains water leaks away before it gets to the customer. The loss of more than 22 per cent of water carried in mains and pipes - more than 3.8 billion litres a day, enough to fill 48,000 baths - may add to water bills, the report warns. It puts the average cost of water at 50p per 1,000 litres, equivalent to 4p for a bath. The water industry has for months warned that the high costs of treating and supplying water may cause water bills to double in real terms by 2005. Some southern companies are insisting on fitting meters to houses to encourage customers to use less water, in spite of recent torrential rains and the industry's comments that the long southern drought has ended. Ofwat's report, compiled from the annual returns in July of the 33 water companies of England and Wales, shows for the first time that costs vary widely. The most expensive is South East Water at 86p per 1,000 litres and the cheapest Portsmouth Water at 33p. The report says a wide range of prices should be expected as companies responsible for sewerage and beaches bore a large share of the industry's capital spending. But Mr Byatt added: 'Those companies with high unit costs will need to convince me that their costs are justified.' Ofwat says some leaks are inevitable and it is not always worth the expense to find and plug them. The lowest leakage rate was 6 per cent in the Bristol Water, and in Bournemouth and West Hants, where the cost of treating water is high. The highest was about 36 per cent for North West. The Water Services Association and the Water Companies' Association - representing the 10 large water and sewerage companies and 23 water supply companies in England and Wales - said 'low costs do not necessarily signify the most efficient company'. They added that companies were already spending large sums in dealing with leakages and estimates of the cost were not precise. The Cost of Water Delivered to Customers 1991-1992.

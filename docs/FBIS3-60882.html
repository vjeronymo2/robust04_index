			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hans Moller and Mikkel Thrane: "New Arrest in </F> Bombing Case"]    [Text] Terrorism: At a closed hearing yesterday a  31-year-old Kurd was ordered held in solitary confinement for 13  days.    Security police in Copenhagen yesterday arrested a man  suspected of having participated in one of three attacks against  Turkish targets in Copenhagen on 4 November at 1130.    This attack apparently was carried out in coordination with  other terrorist bombings in different places of Europe.    The 31-year-old Kurd, who is a Turkish citizen, was arrested  Thursday [25 November] at the asylum center in Auderod after his  fingerprints were found on a lighter recovered near the Turkish  Economic and Trade Center on Borger street in Copenhagen. He  pleads not guilty.    On the day after the attacks a 19-year-old Kurd, who has  applied for asylum, was arrested, admitting to throwing rocks at  the Turkish Airline.    Having arrested the 31-year-old, the Danish police are the  only ones in Europe to have in custody two suspects who can be  connected to the wave of terrorist attacks.    No organization has stepped forward claiming responsibility  for the attacks attempted in Copenhagen and directed against the  Turkish Information Office, the Turkish Airline, and the Turkish  Economic and Trade Center.    However, the Kurdish rebel movement PKK [Kurdish Workers  Party] and the Kurdish Labor Party are suspected of being behind  it, because, among other things, the attacks in Copenhagen  coincided with the movement's attacks in a number of other  places in Europe.    Yesterday the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared  PKK  and 33 other Kurdish organizations illegal effective  immediately; however, the Danish minister of justice, Erling  Olsen, refuses to take such a drastic step.</p>

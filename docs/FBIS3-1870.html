Military officials from the two countries met for the first  time to exchange views on defense policies of the two countries  as well as the military situation in the Asia-Pacific region,  said Ken Sato, a defense councilor of Japan's Defense Agency.    Zhan Maohai, deputy director of China's Ministry of National  Defense Foreign Affairs Bureau, represented the Chinese side.    The Japanese side indirectly expressed concern over China's  military buildup and urged that China make military information  public in such forms as a defense white paper, noting that  China's neighbors have an increased interest in Chinese defense  matters, according to Sato.    The Chinese side reportedly said that the increase of its  defense budget was partly due to inflation and that China's  military is for defensive purposes only.</p>

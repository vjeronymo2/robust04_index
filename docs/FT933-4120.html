			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Met chief wants Pounds 20m force purge MR PAUL Condon, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, yesterday urged the government to abandon or modify much of the controversial Sheehy report and finance a Pounds 20m redundancy scheme in his force instead. The commissioner's formal response to the Sheehy report on police pay and responsibilities, presented to the Home Office yesterday, rejects proposals for fixed-term contracts for junior ranks; raising the retirement age for constables and sergeants from 55 to 60; increasing the qualifying period for full pensions; abolishing some ranks, and reducing starting pay. Mr Condon also rejects Sheehy's proposals for performance-related pay but he has offered to pilot-test Metropolitan Police proposals for a simplified system linking pay to individual performance. In a second move yesterday, Mr Condon announced proposals to reduce the senior ranks of the Metropolitan force by 450 - nearly 20 per cent of the total - by April 1995. He has asked the Home Office to finance the Pounds 20m scheme, which would otherwise have to be funded from reductions in operational services. The redundancy programme requires the approval of Mr Michael Howard, home secretary. It would be difficult for him to reject it as thinning senior ranks is one of the objectives of the government's police reforms. Mr Condon believes that the scheme would be quicker and cheaper than some of the Sheehy proposals. Under the redundancy plan the Metropolitan force would lose 260 inspectors and chief inspectors, 190 superintendents and chief superintendents and 14 posts in assistant constable grades. A chief superintendent with 30 years service retiring at 50 instead of 55 could receive up to Pounds 70,000. The scheme could begin this autumn. 'I have never hidden the fact that we must have fewer managers in the police service,' said Mr Condon. He did not oppose change, but the Sheehy recipe for performance-related pay would be a 'bureaucratic nightmare', while its recommendations for lower starting salaries and raising the retirement age were fundamentally wrong. Mr Condon was sharply critical of Sheehy committee member Prof Eric Caines, who has argued robustly for its proposals. 'My fear is that at least one member of the committee had a fairly jaundiced view of what policing is all about and what we are trying to achieve.' The home secretary is consulting on the report until the end of this month.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Lower provisions leave Britannia BS at Pounds 81m A fall in provisions for bad debts by Britannia Building Society, the UK's ninth largest society, was behind a 32 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 66.7m to Pounds 80.8m for the year to end-December. Capital and interest provisions were cut from Pounds 72.1m to Pounds 57.3m. Profits from Britannia Life, the life assurance and investment subsidiary, rose by only Pounds 700 000 to Pounds 15.1m, despite the increase in sales of investment products, such as unit trusts, in the market generally. Mr John Heaps, chief executive, said the strong performance showed that it could operate effectively despite the limited signs of improvement in the housing market. Its performance on arrears and possessions had shown a marked improvement, he added, and the situation could be expected to improve further with low interest rates and stable house prices. He highlighted Britannia's strategy of widening its distribution channels, following a programme of some branch closures and head office redundancies in 1992. Mr Heaps said that the size of Britannia Life's profits had been affected by actuarial calculations taking into account factors such as a fall in long-term interest rates and a discount based on the mix of people in the life fund. Group assets at December 31 were Pounds 12.9bn (Pounds 10.4bn) and retail balances rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 7.3bn (Pounds 6.9bn). Total mortgage lending rose by 25 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn (Pounds 1.1bn). Administrative costs remained steady, and the cost to income ratio, fell to 45.9 per cent (47.1 per cent).</p>

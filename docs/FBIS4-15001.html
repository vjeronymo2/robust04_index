			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Apr 06, BNS -- Latvia's Cabinet passed for  parliament consideration Tuesday [5 April] its proposals for  land reform and privatization laws, the Government Information  Agency reports.    Under the proposed amendments, legal persons registered in  Latvia may become owners of land beneath buildings and  constructions they acquired as a result of privatization and  land that is needed to build such buildings and constructions.    Physical persons who own land should be allowed to sell it  to  legal persons, the government said.    The above regulations could be operative until the adoption  of a special law on the use of land.    In addition, the government sent the Saeima (parliament) its  considerations regarding waivers for public transport users.  The new regulations cut the number of eligible passengers  considerably.    The group also commissioned the Latvijas Nafta  state-operated  enterprise to reduce by 4.6 million lats the debt of farmers for  fuel supplied in the 1992 spring and autumn season.    The government proposed the Saeima to fine 100 lats to 250  lats for neglect toward rules of non-cash transactions.    Finally, the Cabinet allowed the forestry service to auction  10,000 cubic meters of timber from state-owned felling sites.  The acquired resources would be used to reconstruct the Ligatne  paper mill.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zagreb, Feb. 11 KYODO -- The special U.N.  representative to the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, said  Thursday [10 February] that NATO air strikes against Bosnian  Serbs could escalate the Bosnian civil war and drag U.N.  peacekeepers into it.    NATO warned the Serbs on Wednesday that its warplanes would  bomb their heavy weapons located around the besieged Bosnian  capital of Sarajevo unless the guns are withdrawn or put under  U.N. command by February 21.    "The plus and minus impact (of air strikes) must be  carefully  considered," Akashi said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE  at the headquarters of the U.N. Protection Force in Zagreb,  Croatia.    "The military commanders of the U.N. Protection Force also  believe that air strikes could be useful to promote political  and diplomatic negotiations, but they see a number of  complicated questions involved militarily," Akashi said.    Akashi said the new cease-fire that U.N. mediators reached  in  Wednesday negotiations with the Serbs and the embattled  Muslim-led Bosnian government will soon be put into a written  agreement.    Its main points are both sides' pledge to honor the  cease-fire and to pull back their heavy artillery and mortars  from the area around Sarajevo and to place them under U.N.  control, he said.    Akashi said with regard to the quick conclusion of a lasting  cease-fire agreement, the NATO ultimatum could turn out to be a  "plus."    However, in negotiations with the Serbs it could also become  a minus factor, since the Bosnian Muslims took the NATO decision  as support for their stance.    "There remain difficult negotiations on both sides," said  Akashi, warning against too high hopes for a quick solution.    Dozens of cease-fires have collapsed during nearly two years  of fighting around Sarajevo.    Asked if he expects a settlement of the Bosnian conflict  within the 10-day NATO deadline, Akashi evaded a clear answer.  "As far as we are concerned, we can only say that we will  continue our strenuous efforts," he said.    He said the U.N. has not yet concluded who is responsible  for  the massacre of civilians at a Sarajevo marketplace last weekend.    The mortar attack on February 5 killed 68 people and injured  some 142. Investigation into the attack is extremely difficult  because the single firing of a mortar leaves few traces on the  ground, Akashi said.    The Serbs have denied they fired the mortar round and claim  that the Bosnian Muslims staged the incident to fan  international outrage over ostensible Serbian atrocities.</p>

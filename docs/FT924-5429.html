			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Letter: Hong Kong process to be fostered Sir, Hong Kong as part, probably an important part, of a prosperous democratic China after 1997, should be the objective. The Soviet Union renounced communism, but still lacks the infrastructure on which to base a prosperous economy. Hong Kong companies in their hundreds are now busy setting up joint ventures with Chinese partners to create just such an infrastructure as is necessary before communism can profitably be renounced. This should be encouraged and assisted in every way. Hallyburton Stretton, Apartado 10, Es Castell, Menorca, Baleares 07720, Spain</p>

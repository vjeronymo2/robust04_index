			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TOY-BASHERS SEARCH FOR BAD BUYS;  </P> <P> SAFETY: TESTERS FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONDUCT DIABOLICAL EXPERIMENTS TO BRING  OUT DANGERS THAT MAY LURK IN FUN ITEMS.  </P> <P> Even Scrooge, on his worst bah-humbug days, might have shed a tear at the  sight.  </P> <P> What appears at first glance to be a jolly Santa's workshop in this Washington  suburb is actually a torture chamber for Christmas toys that is worthy of the  Spanish Inquisition.  </P> <P> Working behind closed doors in a small room stacked high with Yuletide goodies,  Bob Hundemer, the Torquemada of the toy business, is gleefully wrenching the  nose off a cuddly teddy bear.  </P> <P> Nearby, a bespectacled helper is calmly dismembering a stack of dolls with  blonde tresses, yanking off their arms without a trace of emotion. At his elbow  are the shattered remains of dump trucks, airplanes and baby rattles, and bits  of stuffing from disemboweled toy animals.  </P> <P> They are working in the toy testing laboratory of the U.S. Consumer Product  Safety Commission, and their tables are crowded with diabolical devices  specifically designed to fold, spindle and mutilate -- or worse.  </P> <P> Clamps and torque wrenches are applied to the eyes of lovable toy monkeys.  Teething rings are dropped in pots of boiling water. Stuffed bears are battered  with finger-like probes.  </P> <P> Is this guy the Grinch who stole Christmas, or what?  </P> <P> "No, I feel more like the good witch of the North," says Hundemer, chief of the  two-man laboratory housed in the drab former barracks of an abandoned Nike  missile site about 15 miles northwest of Washington.  </P> <P> With extra help to cope with the Christmas rush, Hundemer and his assistant,  Garfield Jenkins, work full time testing about 900 toys annually for potential  safety hazards to children.  </P> <P> Hundemer estimates that more than two-thirds -- many of them mass-produced  imports from Mexico or the Far East -- flunk the commission's stringent  standards. They are either recalled for redesigning or banned from the market  as unfit for putting under the Christmas tree.  </P> <P> Last year, 245 toys were voluntarily recalled by manufacturers at the agency's  urging. Some of the worst offenders were displayed at a Dec. 1 news conference,  when the commission gave its annual Christmas warning to toy-buying parents.  </P> <P> By far, the biggest threat posed by hazardous toys, which accounted for 142,000  injuries and a minimum of 22 deaths last year, are small parts that children  can easily detach with their teeth or fingers and put in their mouths, causing  choking or asphyxiation.  </P> <P> Most choking deaths involve balloons, marbles and other small balls, says John  E. Preston, a mechanical engineer who designed many of the agency's toy-testing  procedures. But balloons and marbles are exempt from government safety  regulations because of their universal popularity as children's playthings.  </P> <P> "Can we tolerate the 10 deaths of children every year from choking on  balloons?" Preston asked. "On the other hand, we don't believe the world is  ready to accept a ban on balloons and marbles. We're perplexed about what we  can do."  </P> <P> Hundemer says he has "compelling reasons" for his personal interest in toy  safety as the parent of two small children.  </P> <P> The government can't begin to test all the 150,000 different toys on the  market, he said, "so don't depend on the government to provide you with  complete safety." Parents must play an active role in monitoring toy safety.  </P> <P> Look for durability and quality of construction, he says, and select toys  suitable for a child's age and skills. Avoid buying toys with small parts or  long cords for infants or toddlers.  </P> <P> Be particularly cautious about small balls and toys that shoot projectiles or  contain electrical heating elements. Consult label precautions and follow  instructions. Supervise children at play, and repair or discard damaged toys  immediately.  </P> <P> "Don't be fooled when a clerk says, 'We couldn't sell it if it weren't safe,' "  Hundemer said. "That's not true, and people who believe that are misguided."  </P></p>

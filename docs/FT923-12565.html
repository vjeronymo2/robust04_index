			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Norbain Electronics advances by 11% Having completed its restructuring, Norbain Electronics is benefiting from its clear focus on the security sector, said Mr John Nicol, chairman. That market continued to offer substantial opportunities for growth in the UK and Europe, he added. Reporting for the year to April 30, the first in which sales had been solely in security, he said turnover from that business rose 5 per cent to Pounds 12.8m, while last year's Pounds 14.5m included the disposed technology division. Pre-tax profit was up 11 per cent to Pounds 502,000 (Pounds 451,000) and in the current year trading was ahead of the comparable period in 1991, said Mr Nicol. The group had further improved its position as the leading distributor of industrial CCTV and access control equipment in the UK by the recent addition of new products. Gross profit margin fell following the disposal, but the margin for the security business was maintained. Earnings per share were 4.95p (4.1p). The dividend is raised from 0.7p to 1p.</p>

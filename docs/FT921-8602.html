			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / A giant humbled by its bad debts: A look at the troubles of National Westminster Bank None of the big English banks is proud of its financial results for 1991, which they all are about to disclose, starting with Lloyds on Friday. But the humiliation of reporting sharply lower profits - or possibly even losses  -is likely to be felt most keenly by National Westminster Bank, for much of the 1980s the biggest UK bank on most measures but now with a market value less than both Barclays and Lloyds. The seeds of decline had been planted by the time Lord Alexander became chairman at the end of 1989. But when interviewed earlier this month he refused to blame his predecessors: 'I am not prepared to judge the past.' Seated at his 'lucky desk' - which he has transported from job to job since his days as a leading barrister - he was on alert to stop himself making any statement that could be construed as a profit forecast. As a former chairman of the Takeover Panel, he was particularly keen not to be reprimanded by the Stock Exchange for disclosure of price-sensitive information. His anxiety was probably misplaced. It has been an open secret in the City for months that NatWest's results will be very bad indeed. The precise profit or loss seems relatively unimportant, since the downward trend will be so pronounced. Only four years ago, in 1988, NatWest made bigger profits - of Pounds 1.4bn before tax - than any UK bank had ever done before or has since. But two lacklustre years followed. Profits were depressed in 1989 by provisions against possible losses on loans to less developed countries and in 1990 by an increase in UK loan losses. Last year however the bad debt charge was so big - an estimated Pounds 1.5bn from its UK lending alone - that the bank is thought by some analysts to have made a small loss. In NatWest's defence, all UK banks suffered in 1991 from unprecedented levels of bad debts on their exposure to British companies and individuals. As the biggest lender to small and medium size companies NatWest was bound to be hit hard. 'This is the bottom-line judgment of the boom years of the 1980s', Lord Alexander said. Though NatWest cannot absolve itself of blame for the bad debts, he said that another measure of performance is NatWest's operating profit before bad debt charges, which in the first half of the year grew by 16 per cent, faster than both Barclays' and Lloyds'. However, other comparisons with Lloyds show a different picture. At the end of June, NatWest had total assets of Pounds 128bn. Lloyds' assets were less than half that at Pounds 54bn. Yet brokers believe Lloyds made more than Pounds 600m in pre-tax profits during 1991, a modest increase on the previous years' outcome. These analysts also expect Lloyds to make pre-tax profits greater than Pounds 700m in 1992, compared with around Pounds 350m for NatWest. In other words, Lloyds appears to be on course to make much bigger profits than NatWest in three successive years. This performance has also been reflected in the share prices of both banks. Since the beginning of 1988, Lloyds' share price has more than doubled, while NatWest's price is no higher than four years ago. As a result, Lloyds' stock market value - which is close to Pounds 5bn - is Pounds 200m greater than NatWest's. Lord Alexander plays down the humiliation of slipping behind Lloyds. 'We are not saying we need to be Number One'. However he also stresses that NatWest is not a 'semi-public institution . . . we run the business first and foremost for shareholders'. Lloyds has done better than NatWest because it concentrated its resources on its core UK business of supplying financial services to individuals. In the 1980s it reduced its involvement in international banking - which was a highly competitive market - and its investment banking has been kept to a minimum. NatWest, on the other hand, was intent on becoming a universal bank and on expanding around the world. Huge financial and management resources have been devoted during the past few years to reviving an ailing investment banking subsidiary, County NatWest, and to stemming losses in its US subsidiary, NatWest Bancorp. Lord Alexander still eschews Lloyds' strategy of concentrating the bulk of resources on one or other sector. 'There are and will remain twin pillars to the business, a retail pillar and a corporate pillar', he said. None the less he has initiated a reorganisation. He is reconfiguring the business into two separate banks, one serving individuals and small companies, the other big companies. This is similar to a reorganisation by Barclays last year. But NatWest has gone further in that its corporate bank, NatWest Markets, combines all its investment banking, treasury and corporate lending operations, whereas Barclays has kept the lending operations within its retail bank. Even before the changes take place, he is confident that County NatWest's long-troubled stockbroker is now in a position where 'it can be profitable in 1992'. A management reshuffle has accompanied the structural change. 'We need to keep a balance between the 'grey hairs' - good solid bankers in their fifties - and the younger generation with different management skills', he said. Thus Mr Derek Wanless has been appointed as a deputy group chief executive with responsibility for NatWest Markets. At the age of 44, he is seen within NatWest as a high-flier and possible successor to group chief executive, Mr Tom Frost, due to retire in August next year. Whether Mr Wanless becomes chief executive so soon probably depends on the performance over the coming months of Mr John Tugwell - seen as the other contender for the top job - who took charge of NatWest Bancorp in April when losses from these US operations seemed to be escalating out of control. NatWest executives say they are delighted by Mr Tugwell's performance to date and that the US operations are on course to return to profit in the current year. However Lord Alexander says he is 'keeping an open mind on the future of the US business over the medium term'. In other words, selling it is an option. In terms of the outlook for profits in the medium term, the most important appointment may have been that of Mr John Melbourn, formerly chief executive of corporate and institutional banking at the bank, as a chief executive in charge of credit risk. Part of his brief is to recover funds which the bank has already written off in bad debt provisions. One NatWest executive admitted that such recovered funds could be the single biggest source of the group's future profits growth. Nonetheless, when NatWest announces its results on February 25, shareholders will wish that the source of this future growth - the 1991 bad debt charge - was not quite so deep.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FORECAST OF UK BANK PERFORMANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------             Pre-tax profit (loss)      Net dividend                 Pounds million         Pence per share                    1991  1990          1991   1990                     est                 est  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Abbey National      625   582           10.5   9.5 Barclays            570   760           21.1  21.1 Lloyds              630   591           16.5  15.3 Midland            (135)   11            1.7   9.0 NatWest             (20)  504           17.5  17.5 Standard Chartered  190   150           20.0  20.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: S G Warburg  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

The working group, which is one of five established within  the framework of multilateral, Middle East, peace talks, will  take up issues such as the exchange of information on military  activities, maritime measures and communications.    Turkey is the adviser for the first issue, while the maritie  measures for search and rescue are prepared by Canada and  communications by the Netherlands.    Suha Umar, the Foreign Ministry deputy director general, who  briefed reporters, said that the group's first meeting had also  been held in Antalya last year and the second in Moscow last  November.    The working group sessions will continue for four days and  the results will be submitted to a general meeting of the  participating nations to be held in Doha in May.    "The reports that will be made at the end of the sessions  are  important both as new documents and as part of a larger whole.  I think it will be possible to draw up the general framework of  a general document on arms control and security in the Middle  East," Umar said.    The meeting is important in the sense that it brings  together  all the Middle Eastern states for the first time since the  Hebron massacre.    The participating states include Turkey, Netherlands,  Canada,  United States and Russia, as well as Jordan, Israel, Palestine,  Oman, Egypt, Qatar, Algeria, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia,  Tunis, Yemen and Kuwait.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Germans buy Hungarian tobacco unit REEMTSMA, the privately-owned German tobacco company, is to acquire Hungary's Debrecen Tobacco Factory, the Hungarian privatisation agency announced yesterday. The German concern beat three western rivals to take a stake of almost 85 per cent in Debrecen for an undisclosed sum. Reemtsma plans to supplement Debrecen's Symphonia brand, whose 35 per cent market share makes it Hungary's second-ranking cigarette, with some of its own products, which include the West brand. The move follows purchases in eastern Germany and Slovenia. It also completes the privatisation of Hungary's state-owned tobacco industry by Merrill Lynch, the US brokerage. In quick succession, British American Tobacco and Philip Morris, the UK and US tobacco multinationals, recently took control of their Hungarian licensees' plants. Merrill Lynch is also involved in the sale of a majority shareholding in Vegetable Oil Company, one of Hungary's top 10 industrial companies by sales. Announcement of the buyer is expected next week. It is understood that the deal would be worth more than Dollars 100m.</p>

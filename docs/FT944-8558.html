			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Labour attacks Major over EU finance bill Labour yesterday accused Mr John Major of playing games with the Commons by allowing Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to open a debate on the European Union finance bill a week on Monday. As Labour's parliamentary strategists pored over the two-clause bill, published yesterday, senior officials said Mr Tony Blair was 'surprised' by a Downing Street announcement that Mr Clarke would open the debate. Mr Major surprised rebel Tory backbenchers on Wednesday by threatening to call a general election unless the bill was passed 'in all its essentials'. However, both main opposition parties accused the government of causing confusion by failing to clarify whether it would accept amendments to the bill. The confusion deepened in the Lords on Thursday when Lord Henley, defence undersecretary, told peers that 'the whole bill must be passed without amendment'. Downing Street said Lord Henley's comments were in line with the prime minister's announcement. Labour officials said the party was considering abstaining on the second reading unless Mr Major clarified the status of the vote. Mr Chris Smith, shadow heritage secretary, said: 'It looks like turning into a charade aimed solely at providing John Major with the illusion of a short-term triumph. If that is all it is, we will have none of it.' If Labour did abstain, the Liberal Democrats would probably follow suit, leading to a farcical situation in which Tory MPs would be whipped through the lobbies to save the government while opposition MPs failed to vote. Both opposition parties support the principle of the bill, which will raise UK contributions to the EU in line with an agreement reached at the 1992 Edinburgh summit. But Labour is concerned that it might be 'suckered' into opposing the bill on the basis that it was an issue of confidence, only to be pilloried by the Tories for inconsistency. Mr Archy Kirkwood, the Liberal Democrat chief whip, increased the pressure on the government to clarify the position by tabling a written question asking Mr Major to list the essential elements of the bill. He said: 'The official responses from the prime minister still leave many questions unanswered. Parliament has the right to know exactly what these 'essentials' are before the key votes on November 28.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- China's chemical  industry has used loans from the World Bank (WB) and the Asian  Development Bank (ADB) to accelerate the construction and  improvement of fertilizer and chemical mining projects.    Liu Mingyou, president of the China National Chemical  Construction Corporation (CNCCC), said CNCCC has engaged in a  dozen projects involving a total volume of 500 million U.S.  dollars in loans from WB and ADB.    Of the total sum, 430 million dollars was granted by WB and  70 million by ADB, he said.    CNCCC is one of the four corporations in China responsible  for the utilization of loans from the World Bank. It has been  entrusted to invite bidding for procurement using WB and ADB  loans obtained by the Ministry of Chemical Industry through  China's financial ministry.    The WB and ADB loans were allocated for the power-saving  innovation of five large fertilizer factories,  product-restructuring in five medium-sized fertilizer factories,  the development of a phosphorus mine in Guizhou Province, the  development of phosphate in Hubei Province and agricultural  development in Hebei Province.    Liu said that CNCCC announced separate bidding, instead of  package bidding, for the projects to reduce the costs by nearly  10 percent.    Moreover, CNCCC also undertook projects using soft loans  from  Britain, Canada and Italy and introduced technology for  chemical, petrochemical, fertilizer, membrane electrolysis,  steel radial tyres and other projects.    In addition to importing technology and equipment, CNCCC  extended its business scope to cover import and export trade and  contracting foreign projects. Last year alone, the total volume  of imports and exports and project contracts amounted to 1  billion U.S. dollars.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Damage Done to Thailand Cannot Be Removed by a </F> Denial of the Charge"]    [Text] Thanong Siriprichaphong, Chat Thai Party MP of  Nakhon Phanom Province, showed his courage when he held a news  conference on 6 May to deny the U.S. charge that he was involved  in drug trafficking. By formally denying the charge--two days  after it was publicized and became a scandal worldwide, Thanong  has displayed his sense of responsibility.    Yet, Thanong's denial was simply aimed at self-protection  and  cannot clear up the damage done to the Thai parliament, which  represents the entire Thai people. His denial at the news  conference does not prove that the U.S. charge was unfounded.  In other words, there is no proof that Thanong's denial was the  truth.    A scandal involving a member of parliament naturally affects  the image of the whole nation, and, if it is not immediately  clarified, the charge would leave a scar on the nation--the way  it used to be in the past when our leaders never bothered to  correct the image of the country and let the world look at the  Thai as untrustworthy people when it came to the question of  narcotics.    As Thais who must share the blame, we therefore call on Mr.  Thanong, the Chat Thai Party, and the Thai parliament to jointly  take responsibility in solving this problem. Mr. Thanong, the  accused, especially must show his spirit and accept U.S.  inquiries to prove his innocence. In fact, nobody can charge  him guilty, neither the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration nor  the Office of the Narcotics Control Board, since there is not  enough evidence against him. But as a parliamentarian and  public figure, Mr. Thanong should make a sacrifice by answering  the U.S. charge to prove his innocence and thus to restore the  honor to the entire nation.    At this stage, we think most of the Thai people still hold  Mr. Thanong 100 percent innocent. However, when U.S.  authorities were seriously seeking cooperation from the Thai  Government to deal with the case, we cannot help having doubts  about him. Therefore, it is not enough for Mr. Thanong just to  deny the charge. Also, it will not improve the image of the  country if we treat it as a political game and use a delaying  tactic to buy time until the scandal dies down by itself.    We think that, under the present situation, Mr. Thanong  should challenge the U.S. justice and prove his innocence with  courage and dignity. Mr. Thanong should accept a full  investigation, instead of pursuing the case against the media  through his lawyer, since that would not help in clearing up  Thailand's image.</p>

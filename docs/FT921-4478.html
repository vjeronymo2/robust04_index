			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / World leaders praise Begin's peace role ISRAELI, US and Egyptian leaders praised Mr Menachem Begin, the former prime minister of Israel who died yesterday, for his role in forging an historic peace agreement with Egypt, as thousands gathered on Jerusalem's Mount of Olives to attend the simple Jewish burial ceremony he had requested. Foreign tributes praised Mr Begin, who was 78, for signing the Camp David peace agreement with Egypt, ratified in 1979, under which Israel gave up the Sinai Peninsula, captured in the 1967 Six Day War, and won in exchange an unprecedented peace treaty with an Arab state. They avoided mention of his more controversial past as violent underground leader against British rule in Palestine in the 1940s, his militant commitment to eternal Israeli rule over the other occupied territories or the bloody 1982 invasion of Lebanon, a debacle which contributed to Mr Begin's surprise decision to retire in 1983. His 'very courageous, foresighted role at Camp David' would never be forgotten, said US President George Bush, a sentiment echoed by Mr Jimmy Carter, president at the time of the accords and a vital catalyst in their negotiation. Egyptian leaders joined the praise, taking the opportunity to call on Mr Begin's successors to follow his path of giving up occupied territory in exchange for peace in the current Middle East talks. 'His understanding of land for peace paid great service to the peace process,' said Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, who took part in the Camp David negotiations on the Egyptian side, said he hoped 'that the new generation of leaders in Israel and the Arab world will have the same courage and political determination'. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the present Israeli premier and Mr Begin's successor as leader of the right-wing Likud party, led a large array of Israeli political colleagues and rivals who joined the Begin family at the graveside. But the burial according to Jewish religious practice, on the day of death, meant there was no time for mourners from abroad to arrive. Foreign governments were represented by the Spanish ambassador to Israel. Mr Begin died in hospital after a heart attack a week ago. He was buried alongside his wife Aliza and late fellow-fighters in the Irgun Zva'i Leumi, the Jewish guerrilla band he led in the 1940s. The mourners were led by his son Mr Ze'ev Binyamin Begin, a Likud MP who has already signalled his intention of one day succeeding his father as party leader.</p>

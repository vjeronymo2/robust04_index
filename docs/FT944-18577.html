			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Baris refinances and restates results Baris Holdings, the USM-traded building services company, plans a refinancing. The announcement accompanied restated results for its last financial year to include a Pounds 1.68m writedown on the Little Britain project in London. This follows settlement of arbitration proceedings against Wimpey Construction after the Baris results were originally announced in May and increased the pre-tax loss to Pounds 3.12m for the year to February 28. This compared with a reported Pounds 1.43m loss in May and a Pounds 351,000 deficit previously. Baris plans to raise Pounds 1.72m net, by way of a placing and 9-for-8 open offer of 7.99m new shares at 25p. In addition, the company is converting Pounds 2m of bank debt by way of a subscription for 5m convertible preference shares at 40p each, convertible into ordinary shares of 10p each on a 1-for-1 basis. The proposals are subject to shareholders' approval at an EGM, but Baris warned that if they were not implemented 'the company may unable to continue to trade'. The company has requested that the Stock Exchange waive the USM requirement and allow the placing and open offer to be made at a discount to the current share price of greater than 10 per cent. On Friday the shares fell 6p to 33p. Mr Arthur Morton, who is currently chairman of a number of quoted companies including Vistec Group, the computer systems supplier, but who at present does not own any shares in Baris, has undertaken to subscribe in full for those shares not taken up. After this he will hold a minimum stake of 15.8 per cent and a maximum 36.4 per cent.</p>

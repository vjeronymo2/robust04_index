			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo April 5 TASS -- One dollar will be exchanged  for approximately 10,000 rubles by the end in the year in  Russia, and the pace of inflation will heighten considerably  unless the Russian Government takes appropriate measures, Boris  Fedorov, chairman of the parliamentary subcommittee on the  monetary policy and the activity of the Central Bank of Russia,  former Russian finance minister, told ITAR-TASS. Today he left  Japan where he was staying for several days at the invitation of  the Japanese foreign minister in the composition of the "Union  of December 12" group of deputies.    Fedorov said that due to the lowering of the rate of  inflation in Russia to 9.8 per cent in February and 8 per cent  in March, the Russian Government now has a unique chance to  bring inflation under control and complete successful efforts of  many months for financial stabilisation. The Cabinet of  Ministers now has an opportunity to capitalise on the emergent  results on the policy pursued by the previous government",  Fedorov said. "However, the Chernomyrdin government has not  taken in the three and a half months a single step that could be  described as that of a reformer cabinet, and this gives rise to  concern".    If the present government continues to adhere to this stand,  the roll back form the economic milestones reached will become  inevitable in the weeks ahead", Fedorov believes. He said that  the initial sign of this will be the granting of large subsidies  to state-owned enterprises and the allocation of approximately  3,000 billion rubles to agricultural enterprises planned for  April. This step will thwart the opportunity of making in  Russia the most painless financial stabilisation in world  history, the opportunity which is real now, Fedorov said.    Fedorov expressed the opinion that the Chernomyrdin  government may remain in office no longer than autumn of this  year unless it switches from a passive policy to an active  course at reform. "If the cabinet does not take real actions by  autumn, the government will be at least reshuffled", the former  Russian finance minister said. He expressed the readiness to  enter a cabinet again if the necessary powers are granted.</p>

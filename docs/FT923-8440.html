			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Letter: Advice given in return Sir, I refer to Mr Onesimo Alvarez-Moro's letter (August 7) and his advice for Italians to wake up as soon as possible - I would like to know when the Spaniards woke up, if they did. The Spanish unemployment rate is at 17 per cent of the workforce; inflation will touch 7 per cent average rate in 1992 and only the government believes that the economic growth will be more than 2 per cent. Real economic indicators show the same results. In fact the Spanish government begged for special help at Maastricht, called the cohesion fund. Concerning the old tricks, I would advise Mr Alvarez-Moro to read the Spanish newspapers of the last months. Three or four years of good results, boosted by foreign investments, are nothing in the history of a company, even less in the history of a country. Ghino di Tacco, Via del corso 1, Rome, Italy</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (4): Relief at last from a poisonous legacy  -Poland's debt was a communist attempt to borrow their way out of unpopularity 'WE HOPE that this agreement will be once and for all', since 'the essence of this agreement is the fact that we will now be able to service the contractual debt.' This is how Mr Janusz Sawicki, deputy minister of finance and Poland's chief debt negotiator, describes the result of his labours: an unprecedented multilateral deal with the Paris Club of 17 official creditors for 50 per cent reduction of Poland's official hard-currency debt, a deal reached after prolonged discussion in March 1991 and ratified on April 19. That ratification followed directly on the heels of agreement with the International Monetary Fund to a three-year programme that will obtain total support of roughly Dollars 1.6bn. Mr Sawicki has reason to feel pleased with his labours, since Poland's Dollars 45bn external debt was a legacy quite as poisonous as the ruined environment bequeathed by the present government's communist predecessor. That debt was created by the communist government's attempt to borrow its way out of domestic unpopularity during the 1970s. By 1981, external hard-currency debt had reached Dollars 25.5bn. Thereafter, the debt grew virtually entirely through the accrual of unpaid interest, to reach some Dollars 45bn today - roughly Dollars 1,100 per head, two-thirds of gross national product and four-and-a-half times the value of 1990 exports in convertible currencies. The latter ratio is, according to the World Bank's World Debt Tables 1990-91, also about 50 per cent higher than that for the average of middle-income highly-indebted countries. It is no wonder that the two post-communist governments, have sought agreement with their creditors on a very substantial programme of debt reduction. In practice, Poland has not been servicing its official debts since 1981, which is why they have grown to Dollars 33bn. Because Poland's debt to commercial banks was serviced until November 1989, this has become relatively smaller during the 1980s and is now a little under Dollars 11bn, but it too is no longer being serviced. Naturally, a government wishing to integrate the Polish economy as quickly and as completely into the world market economy, wishes to reach an amicable agreement with its creditors and subsequently fulfil its contractual obligations. Only thus does it have any hope of attracting the inward investment and finance that will be needed. But, having decided that debt relief is essential, it wishes to reach agreement on the most favourable possible terms. If the terms are perceived as being too onerous, the country may still fail to obtain the inward investment it seeks. The government's demand was for debt reduction of 80 per cent. In the event, its creditors have granted multilateral agreement to a 50 per cent reduction in the net present value of the official debt. Within that total, creditors have a choice among alternatives. They can choose between: Writing off a part of Poland's debt; Accepting lower interest payments, while leaving the debt's face value unchanged; or Allowing a reduction of interest payments along with some roll-up of interest into capital. The debt relief is to be in two stages. The first stage, accounting for about 30 per cent of the reduction in net present value, is to cover the next three years and would involve a cut of 70-80 per cent in Polish payments. In this way the government has obtained the reduction it sought during the pivotal early years, with payments likely to average Dollars 600m (the precise figures depending here and throughout on exchange-rate movements against the dollar). Then, in the fourth year, the interest bill would rise, with concessions on the debt service bill likely to average 30-40 per cent. But the precise details of the debt service due from 1994 would depend on which options are chosen, and how big the agreed reductions in the net present value of the debt turn out to be. greater the relief on debt-service, the bigger the reduction in annual payments, but the larger the sum that needs to be found for the ultimate repayment. The reverse is true for reduction in the debt stock outstanding. According to Mr Sawicki, the government will seek packages that are overall compatible with Poland's expected annual cash flow. In addition, the Polish government regards the 50 per cent reduction as merely a minimum. There is the possibility of voluntary swaps of 10 per cent of the debt into zlotys for domestic expenditures, notably on the environment. But it also hopes that some governments will go further. The US, for example, has already agreed to cut Poland's debt by 70 per cent, but this has irritated some of its partners, notably France, and is unlikely to prove a precedent for many other creditors. French irritation is not unique. The entire agreement does, in fact, bear witness to the power of persuasion of the US. Justifying this unprecedentedly generous agreement (which many fear will become a precedent all too soon), Mr David Mulford, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, has claimed that Poland and Egypt are 'unique politically and economically'. Mr Mulford told the FT on March 18 that three principles underpinned the arrangement: Poland needed a deep cancellation on its debt; only a consensus among foreign governments in the Paris Club could achieve this; and the deal was made conditional on Poland's economic performance under an economic programme with the International Monetary Fund. But the US also has a large Polish ethnic community, and is owed less than 10 per cent of Poland's official debt. Other creditors (not to mention other debtors) remain unhappy. Japanese finance ministry officials, for example, have asserted that the Dollars 500m loan promised to Poland by prime minister Toshiki Kaifu has been blocked, following Poland's unwelcome deal with the Paris Club. Whatever the difficulties still to come in the bilateral negotiations, the agreement with the Paris Club is an enormous step toward resolution of Poland's debt problems. What remain are the commercial banks and the Soviet Union. Asked what he expects of the commercial banks, Mr Sawicki swiftly replies: 'To be reasonable. We have never had a reasonable word from the banks. We have not had an opportunity to negotiate with the banks. They say that they first want money up front to clear up past due interest of about Dollars 1bn.' The minister insists that the banks must accept a deal at least as generous as that agreed with the Paris Club, which is already better than the market value of the debt (about 30 per cent of face value, up from 18 per cent, because of the Paris Club deal). In fact, 'in the past we treated banks better than the governments, because we paid all interest due until the November 1989, and because of that we would even expect that they will go further.' What is out of the question, insists Mr Sawicki, is that the banks would benefit from the Paris Club agreement to get all they are owed. 'They can get as tough as they want, but in that case they will get nothing.' Much remains to be done, above all the bilateral negotiations with the Paris Club creditors and the negotiations with the commercial banks, but much has already been accomplished. There seems to be a good chance that Poland will soon agree to debt service of about Dollars 1bn a year over the next three years, and a reduction in the net present value of its total debt of 50 per cent or more. This will not end its difficulties. Indeed, it will have to pay contractually-agreed debt service for the first time for a decade. But the proposed levels of debt service are payable, provided the country sticks to its stabilisation and reform programme. With the Paris Club agreement, the plan to integrate Poland into the world economy has at least reached the end of its beginning.</p>

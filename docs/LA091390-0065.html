			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE HIS VOICE, NOT HIS ATTIRE  </P> <P> I was very disappointed with Nat King Cole Jr.'s comments in the Los Angeles  Times (Aug. 24) in which he criticized my performance in a singing contest  because I did not wear a necktie.  </P> <P> The advertisement we responded to was for a singing contest, not a beauty  contest.  </P> <P> We were told not to wear a tie if we felt like it.  </P> <P> I did not like the review that Mr. Cole gave me. I have sung in hundreds of  nightclubs and nightspots and have always been a hit. I have a good voice and  should have been judged for my voice -- not if I had a tie on or not. I am now  in the process of forming my own music company.  </P> <P> All of us contestants should have been judged for our singing, not for our  dress. I, for one, thought that everyone who performed that evening did an  absolutely wonderful job.  </P> <P> CHUCK HOWARD  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

The Wang-Koo Talks last April, involving the heads of the  non- governmental Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait (ARATS) of the mainland and the Straits Exchange  Foundation of Taiwan (SEF), ushered in a new era in the  relations between the two sides.    At the end of last year, a break-through was made when  leading negotiators from ARATS arrived in Taiwan and talked with  their counterparts with the SEF.    It was the first time since the People's Republic was  founded  in 1949 that members of the mainland non-governmental  organization landed on the island, bringing a New Year gift to  compatriots across the Taiwan Strait as well as overseas Chinese.    Even before the political detente, economic ties between the  two sides were improve greatly.    Taiwan businessmen are running about 10,000 companies and  enterprises on the mainland with a contract value of $10  billion. By the end of 1992, bilateral trade amounted to $29  billion.    Other kinds of exchanges have also become more frequent,  ending the grievous situation of no communication due to  military confrontation 15 years ago. Over the years, 1 million  people have crossed the Strait.    Relaxation of tension across the Strait began with the  mainland's publication of the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan"  on January 1, 1979.    At that time, the mainland had shifted its main task to  economic development. And the international status of China had  been greatly improved as the country set up diplomatic relations  with the United States on January 1, 1979.    The message says the Chinese mainland is trying to solve the  reunification issue by peaceful measures rather than by military  force.    The strategic message has formed the basis for establishing  a  new type of relation between the mainland and Taiwan, said Tang  Shubei, Vice-Chairman of ARATS, in the weekly magazine Outlook.    The mainland advocated direct exchanges of mail, trade, and  air and shipping services as well as those of personnel, culture  and sports across the Strait.    These proposals met the needs of compatriots across the  Strait and were welcomed by them, Tang said.    Jiang Dianming, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,  shares Tang's view. He said that publication of the message  showed the practical attitude of the mainland on the issue of  reunification.    Also, the message showed that the mainland respected the  status quo of the island and the will of its people. And the  mainland guaranteed that Taiwan would not suffer economically  after reunification, Jiang said.    Great changes have taken place in the relations across the  Taiwan Strait since the publication of the message.    In 1981, Ye Jianying, then Chairman of the Standing  Committee  of the National People's Congress, reiterated the mainland's  policy on Taiwan, stressing that Taiwan would enjoy high  autonomy as a special administrative zone of the People's  Republic after reunification.    Senior leader Deng Xiaoping perfected the policy with his  "one country, two systems" composition in 1984. Within his  framework, once the country is unified the mainland would  continue its socialist system while Taiwan maintains its  capitalism.    In response to the mainland's flexible measures, Taiwan  authorities announced in August 1987 that residents of the  island would be allowed to visit their relatives on the mainland.    It was a positive step, further relaxing the confrontation  across the Strait. Since then, thousands of Taiwan residents  have been swarming to the mainland to visit relatives or tour  places of interest. Such visits have promoted indirect trade  and investment across the Strait.    To reduce friction and disputes, the non-governmental SEF  and  ARATS were set up in 1990 and 1991, opening a high-level  negotiation channel across the Strait.    However, problems still hamper the growth of co-operation.    The indirect exchanges have proven time-consuming. And the  Taiwan authorities have placed many obstacles and restrictions  in the way of exchanges.    Another common task for both sides is to unswervingly oppose  those advocating the "independence of Taiwan" and oppose any  activities aimed at undermining the country's sovereignty. The  two sides should sit down to hold more talks concerning issues  related to reunification, Tang Shubei said.    On the premise of the one-China principle and on the basis  of  equality and common ground while reserving differences, there  are always solutions to the problems, said Tang.    Further contacts across the Taiwan Strait in the new year  are  needed to promote the progress of the peaceful reunification of  the country.    Lu Jiaxi, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the  NPC,  has urged the two sides to strengthen scientific co-operation,  especially in high and new technology.    This will be helpful for reunification and will benefit the  world on the whole, Lu said.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Strong sales in eastern Europe help lift Oriflame to Pounds 5.39m A strong performance in eastern Europe helped Oriflame, the cosmetics and toiletries direct sales company, to increase interim pre-tax profits by 29 per cent to Pounds 5.39m. The contribution from associated companies - including Oriflame's 25 per cent stake in Oresa, the eastern European cosmetics door to door retailer set up three years ago - more than doubled from Pounds 410,000 to Pounds 990,000. This helped the group offset the effects of weaker currencies in Sweden and Finland, which were estimated to have depressed profits for the six months to September 30 by about Pounds 500,000. Pre-tax profits were also helped by a sharp drop in interest payments from Pounds 803,000 to Pounds 432,000. Sales were 11 per cent higher at Pounds 40.9m. Mr Robert af Jochnick, the Swedish chairman, said the bulk of the profits increase came from the eastern European business. 'This year has been spectacular,' he said. In the last year Oresa's sales had increased from Pounds 20m to between Pounds 50m and Pounds 60m. Oriflame supplied products to Oresa, as well as receiving licensing and royalty fees from its eastern European counterpart. About 40 per cent of the profits generated by Oresa found their way back to Oriflame. The core direct sales division showed a 24 per cent increase in sales, with the strongest increase from emerging markets such as Portugal, Mexico and Chile. The UK, US and France remained difficult. Oriflame intended to relaunch in all three markets, and restructuring charges of about Pounds 350,000 were taken for changes in France and the US. Earnings rose by 24 per cent to 8.4p. The interim dividend is increased by 0.3p to 4.3p.</p>

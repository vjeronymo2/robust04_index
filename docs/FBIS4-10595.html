			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Avila] </F>   [Text] Guadalajara, 13 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The free trade  agreement that Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela are negotiating  is at a stalemate over Venezuela's disagreement with Mexico on  the matter of asymmetry, rules of origin, and government  purchases.    Venezuelan Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez said here  in  this western Mexican city that nevertheless, his country is  fully confident the pact will be finalized in the next months.  Interviewed within the framework of the 35th annual meeting of  the Assembly of Governors of the Inter-American Development Bank  (IDB), the Venezuelan official said that his country wants a  total commercial opening.    He explained that the diversification of markets should be  done in a just, equitable fashion so the three economies can  reap equal benefits from the trade pact without any one country  taking undue advantages.    "The southern part of the continent already has a common  market. This accord with Mexico and Colombia is meant to  establish a mechanism for opening with commercial exchanges that  reflect guarantees as if we were a single country," he indicated.    Sosa says Mexico must recognize that Venezuelan products are  at a disadvantage in the areas of basic industry and capital  goods.    Sosa Rodriguez declined to comment on the obstacles that  exist regarding the rules of origin and government purchases,  although he said that no progress has been made on those topics  because the negotiations have been delayed.    Sosa said that his country's oil will not be a subject for  negotiation in the free trade pact since Mexico is not willing  to do the same.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): From sludge to compost A method of turning sludge from sewage treatment plants into agricultural compost has been developed by the French company Leas, of Saint-Ismier. The first phase of the process is to extract the sludge and remove most of the water and then add this to bark, sawdust and household waste to improve the consistency and increase the proportion of carbon. Air is then circulated through the mixture to create oxidation so that the organic matter breaks down. The mixing and oxidation process is computer-controlled and can be remotely monitored using a modem and telephone line. Leas: France, 76 52 13 30.</p>

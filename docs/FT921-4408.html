			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Government of Jamaica sells stake in bank THE JAMAICAN government has sold its 39 per cent stake in the island's largest commercial bank to a local insurance company and a building society for the equivalent of USDollars 23m. The government had promised last year that its stake in the National Commercial Bank would be offered to the public this month, but Mr Hugh Small, the finance minister, said there had been a 'disappointing' response from financial institutions to underwrite the divestment. 'A partial underwriting could have led to a lack of confidence in the offer, causing us to discount the price below the market,' the minister said. 'The price we have negotiated is above the market and we are pleased with that.' The purchasers, the Mutual Life Assurance Society and Jamaica National Building Society, will pay half of the price in foreign currency and half in Jamaican dollars.</p>

All contracting activities and requirements offices shall maintain a record of any costs and/or savings brought about by metric conversion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Bulk (loose, unpacked) materials shall be specified and purchased in metric or dual units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Measuring devices, shop and laboratory equipment shall be purchased in metric or dual units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Shipping allowances, bills of lading and other shipping documents shall be expressed in metric or dual units. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=72 g=1 f=1 --> SUBCHAPTER C_SUBCONTRACTING METHODS AND CONTRACT TYPES <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 613_SMALL PURCHASE AND OTHER SIMPLIFIED PURCHASE PROCEDURES <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 613.103&hyph;70 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  [Amended] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 57. and 58.

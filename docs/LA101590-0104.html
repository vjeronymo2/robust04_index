			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SCORES ARE FLABBY IN PHYSICAL FITNESS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: ONLY 21% OF THE COUNTY'S FIFTH-, SEVENTH- AND NINTH-GRADE STUDENTS  REACHED OR EXCEEDED MINIMUM LEVELS IN THE STATE EXAMINATION.  </P> <P> Like their schoolmates statewide, the majority of Ventura County students who  were evaluated in a state physical fitness test are out of shape and unable to  meet the minimum standards, according to a report released today by the state  Department of Education.  </P> <P> Only 21% of the county's fifth-, seventh- and ninth-grade students reached or  exceeded minimum levels of fitness as measured in the five-part California  Physical and Health-Related Fitness Test, given last spring.  </P> <P> Intended to measure cardiovascular endurance, strength and general fitness, the  test included sit-ups, pull-ups, a mile-long walk or run and an exercise called  sit-and-reach, which gauges flexibility. The test is part of the California  Assessment Program.  </P> <P> Many county districts opted not to do the fifth portion of the examination, in  which a caliper measured loose skin on the arm and calf to determine the  percentage of body fat.  </P> <P> Some district officials said they did not have personnel who were trained to  use calipers properly. In addition, some teachers did not want to do the  skin-fold test, because it required touching students' bodies and raised the  possibility of being accused of sexual impropriety, officials said.  </P> <P> The skin-fold test was optional and did not count in the final results, state  education officials said.  </P> <P> Of the 23,375 Ventura County students who took the test, Moorpark Unified,  Oxnard Union High and Ojai Unified had the highest percentages of students who  passed the four physical-exercise sections.  </P> <P> County fifth-graders and seventh-graders scored below the state average, but  ninth-graders were slightly above average.  </P> <P> Ninth-grade students tended to perform better than younger students, although  the test took age and sex into account by requiring less of fifth-graders than  of seventh- or ninth-graders. It also set lower standards for girls than for  boys.  </P> <P> For example, ninth-grade boys were required to run or walk a mile in 7 minutes  and 45 seconds or less, while fifth-grade boys were given 9 minutes and 30  seconds.  </P> <P> And while ninth-grade boys were required to do four to five pull-ups on a  chinning bar, girls of all ages had to do only one pull-up to meet minimum  requirements for upper-body strength.  </P> <P> At Matilija Junior High School in Ojai, several girls who took the test said  they were unable to complete even one pull-up.  </P> <P> "Doing pull-ups was hard," said Shyle Ruder, 13, who passed the other three  fitness requirements. "I couldn't do one."  </P> <P> Dee Bennett, girls' gym teacher at Matilija, said her students do sit-ups as  part of a daily warm-up routine and run an average of a half-mile each day.  Girls also do gymnastics regularly for upper-body strengthening, she said.  </P> <P> "This test is definitely in our minds" on a daily basis, Bennett said.  "However, we feel that sit-ups and push-ups are always good."  </P> <P> Statewide, girls outpaced boys in the sit-and-reach exercise and in running,  while boys beat girls in pull-ups, state officials said.  </P> <P> County and state education officials said the overall poor showing is part of a  nationwide trend of declining fitness among America's youth.  </P> <P> "I think it is generally accepted that a lot of students are not as physically  fit as they used to be," said Gina McMillan, curriculum coordinator of the  Pleasant Valley Elementary School District. "A lot of students play soccer,  dance and do other physical activity after school, but a lot of them go home  and watch television."  </P> <P> Students in the Oxnard Elementary School District had the lowest performance in  the county. Only 8% of students who took the test passed, compared with 21% for  both the state and the county. Sixteen percent of Oxnard elementary students  did not complete even one of the four components.  </P> <P> Oxnard Supt. Norman Brekke said he had not seen the report, but said the  district was continuing efforts to review how physical education is taught  based on low scores from the 1988-89 school year, the first year the test was  given.  </P> <P> "There have been efforts made to strengthen the program," Brekke said. "There's  a continuing need to monitor what we're doing against what the state tests are  showing."  </P> <P> Although a relatively high number of students in the Oxnard Union High School  District passed the test, the district showed a slight decline from the  previous year in every area, said Bert Pearlman, director of curriculum and  assessment.  </P> <P> "This does concern us," Pearlman said. "We are presently redesigning our  physical fitness program to ensure that students are getting proper training  that will help them with their attitudes toward physical fitness, as well as  develop the body strength they should be enjoying in their youth."  </P> <P> The importance of diet and exercise, already covered in health courses, will  receive greater emphasis in gym classes, Pearlman said.  </P> <P> In Moorpark, scores were above state averages as well as up from the previous  year, particularly for seventh-grade students. A revamping of the physical  education program two years ago is beginning to pay dividends, said Assistant  Supt. Charles Smith.  </P> <P> The revised programs emphasize more calisthenics and aerobic exercises  beginning in elementary school, Smith said.  </P> <P> "We have not checked the staff for flab lately, however," Smith joked.  </P> <P> This is only the second year for the physical fitness test, and it is too soon  to tell whether regular testing will eventually improve fitness among  schoolchildren, officials said.  </P> <P> "We can't see any trend yet," said Susan Sundell, a state education programs  assistant in Sacramento. "We need three to five years to show improvement."  </P> <P> Because of budget cuts to the California Assessment Program, it is uncertain  whether the test will be administered next spring, state officials said. Some  districts said they may continue testing students on their own even if a  statewide comparison is not available.  </P> <P> "It's sad," said Robert Isenberg, director of special programs and testing in  the Simi Valley Unified School District. "To have it stopped now I think does a  disservice."  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY STUDENTS MEETING STATE PHYSICAL FITNESS STANDARDS  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.65IN:2.44IN:2.33IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4">

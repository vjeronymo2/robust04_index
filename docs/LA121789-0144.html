			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GULL HOPES ARE DEALT A SETBACK;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: KEVIN BRADSHAW LOSES HIS COOL AND USIU LOSES A GAME,  113-107, TO WRIGHT STATE.  </P> <P> Gary Zarecky, U.S. International coach, hopes he doesn't look back at Saturday  night's 113-107 loss to Wright State as the game that tipped the balance on  what he and the Gulls figure can be the second winning season in the 11-years  the school has played Division I basketball.  </P> <P> The loss was not only frustrating because USIU overcame a mysterious point  given to Wright State by the official scorer and a 17-point deficit with 9:30  remaining in the game.  </P> <P> No, what really made this loss hurt most was who was largely responsible.  </P> <P> Zarecky and the rest of the Gull team have made no secret that guard Kevin  Bradshaw is both the foundation and cornerstone of the USIU team.  </P> <P> Those weighty expectations and the fact he has been making a name for himself  with his 30 points per game average may have finally taken their toll on  Bradshaw, who joined USIU after three years in the U.S. Navy.  </P> <P> "He feels that it was not a fair situation," Zarecky said. "But he can't put  himself in the right or wrong position. He has to put himself in a position to  be above that. He's having a hard time.  </P> <P> "Some of the strategies -- pulling on the shirt, words that go back and forth  between players and down right physical abuse -- are not kosher. What they are  is psychological ploys to get a player out of his game."  </P> <P> USIU (3-8) kept pace with Wright State (5-2) and trailed 61-59 at halftime. But  then the Gulls began to fall apart in the opening minutes of the second half.  </P> <P> Wright State out scored USIU, 12-4, to start the half. And when Paul Wilson  scored twice to pull USIU within 73-67, but Bradshaw's frustrations began to  surface.  </P> <P> He was called for a foul under the basket and showed his displeasure with the  call by tossing the ball away from the referee.  </P> <P> Technical. And Wright State turns the mistake into a six-point play. Well,  actually they turned it into a seven-point play. For some reason, the official  scorer decided that somewhere there was a three-point shot scored by Wright  State despite the fact no player had taken a shot from outside 12-14 feet.  </P> <P> By the time USIU got the ball back, it was trailing, 82-67. Wright State scored  four more points and USIU was down, 86-67, and appeared to be out.  </P> <P> But the Gulls rallied after trailing, 99-82, with 9:30 remaining. USIU  outscored Wright State, 18-2 and trailed just 101-100.  </P> <P> Wilson later made two free throws to pull USIU within, 109-107 with 55 seconds  remaining. The Gulls got the ball back three seconds later on an offensive  foul, but Bradshaw was stripped and Wright State pulled away.  </P> <P> Wilson led USIU with 30 points and Steve Smith added 27. Bradshaw finished with  23 points but was seven of 26 from the field. Sean Hammonds scored 26 points to  lead Wright State.  </P> <P> "Kevin Bradshaw has to better deal with his position," Zarecky said. "He is a  target. He's getting a reputation as one of the better players in the region.  Kevin is feeling the pressure."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Sounding the Alarm: Diphtheria Epidemic Spreads </F> in Wilaya"]    [Text] All health sectors are now affected, with a total of  100 cases reported, including 40 bacteriologically confirmed,  and six deaths. The health services have also treated 80 healthy  carriers (infected, but not seriously enough to develop the  malady).    Patients are being hospitalized in the 30-bed "infectious  disease" ward. And to accommodate new cases, an additional 30  beds may be shifted from the "psychiatric" ward of the Tizi  Ouzou CHU [university hospital center]. Also, it was decided to  open isolation wards at Azazga, Draa El Mizan, Tigzirt, Ain El  Hammam, and Larbaa Nath Irathen. Healthy carriers are examined  and treated with antibiotics in their homes, thanks to mobile  disease prevention squads responsible for checking other members  of households where the disease has struck. The purpose of these  activities, according to Dr. Bourbia, director of pedagogical  and medical services at the Tizi Ouzou CHU, is to "diminish or  arrest transmission of the germ, which is directly communicated  -- this can't be repeated too often -- from person to person  (interhuman transmission)." It should be noted that cases have  been reported thus far in Beni Douala, Ain El Hammam, Ouacif,  Azeffoun, Ath Zmenzer, Boghni, Draa ben Khedda, and in the chief  town of the wilaya.    It has also been learned that the director of preventive  services has hurriedly dispatched a delegation from the Health  Ministry to Tizi Ouzou to confer with the antidiphtheria  committee recently formed in that town's CHU. Besides  participating in a day-long diphtheria public awareness program  to be held on 20 January at the paramedic school, the team from  the ministry "has given us assurances concerning regular  provisions of vaccines and serums," Dr. Bourbia said.    For example, a shipment of 5,000 doses of vaccine and  antidiphtheria serum has been delivered. It was also recommended  that diphtheria patients be referred to El-Kettar hospital,  which specializes in treatment of infectious diseases.    We note last that health personnel, patient associations,  and  the press have all been urged to work for the success of the  public awareness program this Thursday. Meanwhile, the dread  disease is gaining ground.</p>

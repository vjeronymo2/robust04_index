			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / People: Woodstock Leasor 'Ten years ago I was a tank commander based in West Germany. If anyone had told me that a decade later I would be swapping vodka toasts with Russian tax officials in St Petersburg, I would have said they were mad.' Now 36, Stuart Leasor hops round east Europe, helping governments spend European Union grants on public relations campaigns to persuade recalcitrant citizens to pay their taxes. He persuaded the Polish finance ministry that publishing a 100-page guide to the new tax laws for every household was not a great idea - Poland ended up gathering 7 per cent more VAT than it had hoped for; saved 450,000 Ecus by running a successful Bulgarian VAT pr campaign rather more cheaply than anyone imagined possible; and has made sure that all 89 oblasts in Russia now have a tax information office. His small pr firm - Woodstock Leasor, formed with Sarah Tubbs, formerly of Dewe Rogerson - now has people working throughout eastern Europe; clearly he thinks prospects are good. He must - he's planning to marry a Kazakh working in Kiev.</p>

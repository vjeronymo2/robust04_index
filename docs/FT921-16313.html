			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: How to profit from charity A CHARITABLE land trust has substantial tax advantages and can enable the owner to control the destiny of the land forever. If the preservation of your land is more important to you than leaving it to your heirs, or if an Inheritance Tax bill might force your heirs to sell the land, you might like the idea of setting up a charitable land trust. The Charity Commissioners cannot grant charitable status to every private land trust. The land must be of benefit to the public in some way. Typical examples of what the Charity Commissioners will accept as 'charitable' are the protection of the countryside, conservation of gardens of scientific interest or outstanding beauty, the preservation of the environment, the provision of agriculture or woodlands or the preservation of rare breeds of animals useful to humans. Of course the public must be able to enjoy the land. This is usually satisfied, where a building is concerned, by a commitment by the trustees to allow the public access for at least 90 days a year. Most landowners do not find this too onerous. What about people who have land or buildings which would benefit from being owned by a charitable land trust but is also their home or means of livelihood? Transferring the land into a charitable land trust does not necessarily mean they will have to vacate or find another job. If the land to be transferred is a house of national interest, the normal practice is for your charity to grant you a lease for exclusive occupation of a relatively unimportant part such as the servants' quarters or stable block. Of course, when the public do not have access you can then occupy the whole house. If the land is agricultural or a woodland, your charity can grant you a tenancy to farm or manage it for commercial rent. The fiscal advantages of setting up a charitable land trust are also substantial. This should not only enable you to transfer the land to the trust without selling it but also allows the land to be maintained in a cost effective way. The transfer to the charity, for example, during your lifetime is free from Capital Gains Tax and on your death is free from Inheritance Tax with no limit. This means that if you are a landowner (or you have inherited land within two years) and are concerned about the Inheritance Tax, a charitable land trust could be the answer. Furthermore, once the land is in the charity little or no further tax need be paid. Gains made in a charity are tax free: for example, if the trustees sell a farm cottage, the gain is free of CGT - provided it is applied for charitable purposes such as the further maintenance of the estate. A charity is also exempt from tax on income such as the rent paid by a tenant farmer and on all annuities and interest paid to it, provided in every case the money is used by the charity for charitable purposes. Also, other charities can make gifts to the trust without jeopardising their charitable status. One area of taxation which is not covered by exemption is trading. The most obvious example is running a shop or restaurant on the land. However this can easily be overcome if the charity sets up a company to run the shop. The company can then covenant its profits to the charitable land trust. The profits will be held according to the constitution of that trust, which you cannot change and by professional trustees over whom you have little control. However, if you set up your own private charitable land trust you can specify the constitution (subject to the Charity Commission's constraints) and you can appoint the trustees - one of whom could be you. You may be particularly concerned about an ancient woodland which you think should be preserved. This can be specified in the constitution and you can appoint trustees whom you believe will ensure this is done. A charity also goes on forever. This is unlike a private trust which can tie up your land for only two generations or so. The idea of keeping your land in trust forever may not particularly appeal to you. If not, you could grant your charity a lease, but the lease will have to be for a substantial period of time - the minimum acceptable is usually 99 years. The freehold can then be retained by the family. Caroline Garnham is a tax lawyer with London solicitors Simmons &amp; Simmons.</p>

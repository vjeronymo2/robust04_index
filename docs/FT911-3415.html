			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (5): A small but fierce competitor - The UK's privatisation process puts it at the forefront of changes in the industry: FT writers look at aspects of the new structure BEING SMALL has its advantages. As Napoleon, Tamburlaine, and countless famous others have found, it can strengthen the resolve. PowerGen, the smaller of the two electricity generating companies, has already proven both shrewd and assertive. Since the early days of its privatisation, it has come across as the friendly face of generation. But within the velvet glove the management is keeping a firm, if not an iron, grip on the newly created electricity market. There are few signs of a public sector mentality at PowerGen. Chief executive Mr Ed Wallis, who has been in the industry since he was fifteen, is no bureaucrat, but a sharp and direct, hands-on manager. Having got over the fracas when Mr Robert Malpas, the company's chairman, left the company just before its privatisation, the board is now a close-knit team. Although smaller than National Power, PowerGen is by no means small. It supplies around 9mMW hours of electricity, to 100 customers - on average slightly smaller customers than National Power - and has 21 power stations. It will make a pro forma profit before tax of Pounds 264m in the year ending 31st March 1991, and expects to pay dividends of Pounds 43m, according to the flotation prospectus. But it has done its best to capitalise on seeming small and approachable. 'The customer is king,' says Mr Wallis, and the company made a point of offering the regional electricity companies, its largest customers, customised packages of electricity. It has won other customers like this: Toyota was seduced with a tailor-made contract and was the first large industrial customer to sign to take electricity directly from a generator. But this accommodating philosophy did not stop PowerGen from competing fiercely with the regional companies to supply large customers, during recent bargaining rounds. PowerGen had been very aggressive, several regional companies reported, and was undercutting their offers. Not so, says Mr Roberts. 'We offered the same prices to the regional companies as we did to direct customers.' But PowerGen does not deny it is keenly interested in winning more large customers. The company's attitude to price is, similarly, hardheaded. Electricity is, Mr Wallis says, a commodity, and despite all the talk of customer relations there is no chance the company will forget the importance of competitive pricing. PowerGen has been equally vigorous in its approach to fuel purchasing and particularly in diversification away from traditional coal-fired generation. It was the first generator to commission a new combined cycle gas turbine power station, and has secured gas supplies for a 680MW station at Rye House in Hertfordshire, as well as the 900MW Killingholme station on Humberside - which will take all the gas from the North Sea Pickerill field in the first such single field deal. PowerGen's commitment to new gas technology is matched by its interest in the latest coal technology. It has invested in a British Coal project at Grimethorpe in Yorkshire, which is developing combustion technology to burn coal more cleanly, and has joined the US electrical power research institute, EPRI, which has made considerable investment in clean coal technology. The company has already invested Pounds 250m in flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) technology which scrubs the gases that leave coal-fired stations for its Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottingham. But PowerGen is also looking hard at importing foreign, low sulphur coal. Four out of its five large coal-fired power stations have easy access to coastal terminals, making it easy to import, as the company has pointed out. It is pursuing a policy of diversification away from UK coal. Whether innovation will actually help PowerGen compensate for its size is another question. It is already true that National Power has more control over the bidding which sets the electricity price in the pool, or spot market, simply because it has more power stations than PowerGen. This, however, may begin to change as more independent power stations come onstream.</p>

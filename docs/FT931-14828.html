			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Austrian banks ban Prague's old crowns AUSTRIAN BANKS have stopped exchanging Czechoslovak crowns following an unprecedented rush by Slovaks to change their savings into Austrian schillings and other hard currencies. Fears that their currency may be devalued once the common Czechoslovak crown is split into separate Czech and Slovak crowns later this year, appear to have encouraged many Slovaks to make the short journey to Vienna to change as much money as possible. Uncertainty about the future about the two countries' currencies has also fuelled foreign bankers' fears that they could be left with worthless banknotes. The old Czechoslovak crown is expected to be replaced with separate Czech and Slovak crowns by June, though currency dealers say the split could come much sooner. The Czech and Slovak central banks have both begun to stamp existing banknotes with their own emblem to prepare for the split, causing a rush to banks by anxious savers eager to deposit and safeguard their cash. Some bankers believe that the stamping of banknotes will inevitably lead to separate exchange rates even before the common currency is formally abolished. 'We don't know what will happen, and we have to be cautious. Once the currencies are stamped, the unstamped notes could become invalid; then we could be left sitting on a worthless mountain of paper,' said a senior Austrian banker. Meanwhile, strong demand for foreign currency from Czech commercial banks has already drained more than one third of the Czech central bank's foreign currency reserves since the start of the year. The central bank is obliged to sell foreign currency to the banks if they require it to cover liabilities. Since January 1, the central bank has sold almost Dollars 300m from its estimated Dollars 700m foreign currency reserves. Mr Martin Svehla, the Czech central bank spokesman, cautioned against over-dramatising the situation. He said it was 'normal' for the time of the month and year when companies make large payments.</p>

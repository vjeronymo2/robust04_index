			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Takashi Yonezawa, chairman of the Democratic </F> Socialist Party [DSP], by an unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN  reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Would you give priority to the  Social Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] return to the  coalition or to the coalition's cooperation with some members of  the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]?    Yonezawa: The first objective is to have the SDPJ and the  New Party Sakigake return to the coalition. Even if the SDPJ  comes back into the coalition, the number of the ruling partiy  seats in the House of Representatives is not enough. Therefore,  it is a matter of course for us to persuade some LDP members to  join us.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The opinion of the SDPJ is also divided  over the issues of returning to the coalition and submission of  a no-confidence motion against the cabinet.    Yonezawa: It is still uncertain when we will hear the  conclusions of their debates on the concept of taking power and  other matters. In a way, we are becoming impatient.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the SDPJ and the coalition  will be able to agree on the North Korean issue and the tax  system?    Yonezawa: The SDPJ signed the fundamental agreement before  the Hata administration was formed. Therefore, I am sure we can  reach an agreement if we confer with each other in a positive  manner.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Can you comment on the possibility of  forming a "coalition of the conservatives of the LDP and the  coalition?"    Yonezawa: Saying that would be too optimistic. It is the  same as saying that we need to find some LDP members who will  cooperate with us, because we do not have enough Diet seats.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How about a coalition with former Prime  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone?    Yonezawa: It would be an attempt to go against the current  of the times.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the idea of voluntary  en masse resignation?    Yonezawa: The coalition will loose its centripetal force as  soon as the Hata administration says it will dissolve the  cabinet. Using common sense, it is difficult to think that Hata  will be re-elected to the premiership after an en-masse  resignation. He will have to take his second and third best  measures, including major cabinet reform.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the opposition  parties' movement to submit a no-confidence motion against the  cabinet?    Yonezawa: It seems that this movement is heating up.  However, some people will also speak against it.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the SDPJ will submit a  no-confidence motion first?    Yonezawa: I do not think so. Submission of a no-confidence  motion is tantamount to saying that they will not join the  coalition.    [YOIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the Hata administration will  remain in power as a minori minority government and pending  issues will be settled during the next extraordinary Diet  session?    Yonezawa: Of course, we will be talking about these  possibilities if the opposition parties betray our hopes to  enact the bills to redraw the electoral districts and to pass  the budget related bills, at least. The lower house will be  dissolved if we have to start the autumn Diet session without  realizing our hopes.</p>

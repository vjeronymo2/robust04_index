			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Short sterling dips CONCERN that the govern-ment might be less willing than previously thought to ease UK interest rates led to weakness in short sterling yesterday, writes Peter John. Recent hopes that a half or even a one percentage point cut might be made before the November Budget were fuelled towards the end of last week by a rash of interest rate cuts throughout continental Europe. On Friday, the market ignored figures showing the UK recovery was still on track and continued to take the line that further easing was needed to revitalise the economy. But speculation in the weekend press that the Treasury and Bank of England felt there was no fundamental economic basis for a further reduction in lending rates dulled the optimism. 'The market was over-bought,' said one trader. 'It got carried away in sympathy with the Continental cutting.' Yesterday, the short sterling futures contract for December slipped 11 basis points to 94.60 as a more pragmatic reappraisal of the economy percolated through the market. German and French short-term interest rate futures were also weaker. The German contract for December eased 6 basis points to 93.91 and the French December was marginally lower on the day. UK interbank operations proceeded smoothly in spite of expectations that a large liquidity shortage might cause problems. Money market dealers anticipate shortfalls of more than Pounds 5bn this week as loans mature. That figure will be exacerbated by a record-sized Pounds 3.5bn gilts auction on Wednesday, half of which will have to be paid for this week. Yesterday's early forecast shortage of Pounds 1.2bn, later revised to Pounds 1.3bn, contained Pounds 1.83bn of bills for repurchase but was partly offset by Exchequer transactions which injected Pounds 900m into the system and a fall in note circulation which added Pounds 940m. The figure for note circulation is generally high on Mondays as the high street banks adjust to the high levels of cash they need to carry over weekends. The bulk of the shortage was taken out during the early round when the Bank provided Pounds 950m of bills at 5 29/32 per cent. This allowed the remaining assistance to be taken up in smaller lots of Pounds 125m and Pounds 225m both via band one bank bills at 5 7/8 per cent, bringing help for the day to Pounds 1.3bn.</p>

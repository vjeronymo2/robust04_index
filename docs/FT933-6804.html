			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Waiting for the Bundesbank THE dollar and D-Mark traded in tight ranges against most currencies yesterday, with dealers waiting to see what the Bundesbank would do with official interest rates tomorrow before deciding their next move, writes James Blitz. Tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting is the first since the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism led to widening of its fluctuation bands. A 25 basis point cut in the discount rate has been priced in by the market, which believes that the differential between money market rates and the German interest rate floor is too close. If the Bundesbank does not ease tomorrow, a short-term appreciation across the board for the D-Mark could be expected. Yesterday, dealers were hedging their bets, with the dollar closing at DM1.6815 from a previous DM1.6885. The French franc closed at FFr3.481 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.485. Sterling, however, suffered a sharper fall, dropping 2 pfennigs on the day to close at DM2.5175. Dealers were moved by a variety of factors: the pound broke through the Dollars 1.50 level against the dollar, triggering stop-losses across the board for risk averse traders. The currency closed at Dollars 1.4965 against the dollar from a previous Dollars 1.5025. For the major currencies, medium term factors need to be looked at when explaining performance. Some analysts believe that fund managers' operations  -as well as short-term interest rate differentials - may explain why the dollar is showing weakness against the D-Mark at this time. At a presentation in London yesterday, Mr Michael R, Rosenberg, director of fixed income research at Merrill Lynch investment bank, unveiled his latest survey of portfolio managers' global investments. This showed that they remain heavily overweight in dollars and underweight in the D-Mark. 'That may be why the dollar is having difficulty breaking through current levels against the D-Mark,' he said. However, he believes that the D-Mark is substantially overvalued against the dollar and most European currencies and is set for a long-term decline. He forecasts a rise for the dollar above the DM2.00 level over the next 18-24 months. Mr Rosenberg believes that investors are so substantially underweight in the yen that a break through the Y100 level is guaranteed. 'As yet, there has been no carry through by investors behind the exchange rate move,' he said. He sticks to the view that the yen will hit '95 in '95.' The yen closed yesterday at Y103.70 little changed on the day. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, economic adviser at Bank of America in London, also believes a break through the Y100 level is likely, but says that investors have been frightened by the success of recent US intervention in support of the dollar.</p>

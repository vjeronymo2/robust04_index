			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Personal View: Transparency the best regulator What should be the purpose of financial regulation? Too often, debate on this issue has contrasted the goal of 'consumer protection' with the need to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of the UK financial services industry and markets. Such a view is based on a false premise. The problem is not that the competition will be damaged by investor protection, but that there is not enough competition in the first place. The goal of regulation should be to introduce more competition in the industry. The best protection which any consumer can have is the existence of a clear and transparent market. The market for personal financial services may seem highly competitive with every local high street full of banks, building societies, brokers and insurance companies. But how does this competition work from the point of view of the consumer? The fact is that there is a wide variation of performance between companies on almost every measure, whether it is costs, investment returns, surrender values, lapse rates or salesforce turnover. Yet there is no clear dynamic in the market to force poor providers to improve their performance or to reward efficient companies. Consumers cannot see these differences because of the lack of disclosure, and companies can get away with flouting standards because of a lack of rigorous enforcement. So long as this continues, it is not even in the interests of the efficient providers to change the situation, since they gain extra profits from this. In the UK, companies gain customers not by out-competing their rivals in terms of providing better and more efficient products, but by owning and controlling distribution outlets (at times, regardless of cost, such as when companies were buying up estate agencies or tying with building societies). The consequence is that we have a market with many new entrants over the last few years as new distribution outlets are set up or purchased. On the other hand, there have been few exits. More sales people are chasing about the same number of customers. Customers gain little from these new entrants; few have come into the market with innovative products that offer something distinctive. The goal of regulation should be to break this log jam. What is needed is regulation that will enable the customer to distinguish between good and bad companies. This can be achieved by intervening in the market from two directions. On the demand side, the Treasury's recommendations on information provision and disclosure should be pursued with all speed. Attention should focus in particular on revealing the cost of the product and its value to the customer. Broader data on surrender rates, lapse rates and salesforce turnover rates should be placed in the public domain for debate by interested parties. On the supply side, there should be stronger intervention in order to raise the standards by which companies operate. Standards should not be determined according to what companies claim they can afford, but by objective criteria decided by the regulators. Regulation should not be constrained by a requirement to ensure the survival of existing companies. Disclosure and the creation of high standards go together, because they will force companies to become more efficient or go out of business while deterring potential new entrants unless they can offer something significantly new. Can self-regulation work in these circumstances? The evidence is that existing regulatory bodies have not established an autonomy from the interests of those which finance them and control their decision-making. Such bodies are unlikely to put in place measures which aim to increase competition to such an extent that some companies will have to leave the market. The sensible solution is to establish a form of state regulation now, rather than wait another few years for the Personal Investment Authority to fail. State regulation should have as its primary goal the creation of the conditions for ensuring a competitive market in this industry. Such a goal will bring benefits to consumers, as it will ensure disclosure and standards are achieved rapidly and fairly across the industry. In doing so, it will also bring advantages to those companies which are operating efficiently. The companies which will suffer are those which have not been operating efficiently, which have been winning market share through high-pressure sales tactics, but not offering good value products. Their exit will damage only themselves, while benefiting the industry. The author is lecturer in management at the Manchester Business School, the University of Manchester.

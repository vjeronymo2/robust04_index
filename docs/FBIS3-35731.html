Marakutsa thinks that the problems which have recently  arisen  are due to the trial of the "Ilascu group", whose six members,  supporters of the Moldovan Popular Front, were convicted by  Tiraspol (the capital of the Dniester republic) of committing  acts of terrorism during last year's military conflict in the  Trans-Dniester region.    According to Marakutsa, international organisations have  appealed to Tiraspol not to carry out the death penalty given to  Ilie Ilascu, the leader of the group. "We are not going to  insist" on the ultimate punishment, the republic's parliamentary  leader declared, "but the convicted have to be punished somehow".    According to Marakutsa, "the possibility of a new  independent  court investigation of the Ilascu group, as many international  organisations have proposed, has not been ruled out".</p>

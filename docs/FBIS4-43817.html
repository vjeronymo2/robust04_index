			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brussels, June 21 (AFP) -- France failed Tuesday  [21 June] to attract international military backing for its bid  to mount an armed intervention in Rwanda, though French troops  were already deploying along the bloodied nation's borders.    Member nations of the Western European Union (WEU) offered  logistical support to the proposed French-led intervention to  end the slaughter in the central African country, but Paris  failed to win pledges of troops.    French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur admitted Tuesday to  members of the National Assembly in Paris that "only" Italy in  Europe and "only" Senegal among African states were prepared to  commit troops.    Balladur stressed any deployment would require authorisation  from the United Nations. French officials, who had planned to  send 1,000-2,000 troops, said they still intended to press for a  Security Council vote on Wednesday.    The troops would be stationed in Zaire close to the border,  but not on Rwandan territory and their operations would be  strictly humanitarian, the premier was quoted as saying by a  leader of his parliamentary group.    Balladur also stressed that other countries would have to  send troops and that the force would "in no case" carry out  operations "in the heart of Rwanda."    "Most WEU countries are ready to provide logistical support  of one kind or another," one diplomat said after a meeting here  of ambassadors in the WEU, which includes all European Union  countries apart from Denmark and Ireland.    But the support was conditional on a new UN Security Council  resolution backing France and the WEU wanted African troops to  be part of the force.    In Ottawa, the Canadian foreign ministry said Tuesday it was  prepared to send 350 communications specialists to Rwanda within  weeks if requested by the United Nations.    At UN headquarters in New York, Secretary General Boutros  Boutros-Ghali reaffirmed his support for the French plan for  intervention in Rwanda, his spokesman said.    Boutros-Ghali is aware of members' concerns about the  proposed military mission to end the bloodbath that began April  6, but will not back down from his support for the plan, said  Joe Sills.    A French military "assessment" team of some 15 soldiers  arrived Monday in Goma, eastern Zaire, to prepare for the  planned intervention, sources in Kinshasa close to the operation  code-named "Turquoise" said.    But the French plan aroused bitter hostility from the mainly  Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which accuses Paris  of arming government troops and being indirectly responsible for  massacres carried out by extremist militias of the Hutu  majority. [passage omitted]    Paris wants to deploy the force until Boutros-Ghali succeeds  in a bid to boost the UN mission from just 495 men to about  5,500, mainly troops from Africa, which could take three months.</p>

The National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] did try for a  new postponement, but UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin  Beye did fall for it and he made the two delegations attend a  face-to-face meeting. Joao Ligio, the People's Television of  Angola correspondent in the Zambian capital, reports:    [Begin Ligio recording] Sources close to the Lusaka peace  talks have admitted the possibility that significant progress  may have been made during a plenary meeting on the issue of the  national police. The reason for that opinion is that this  morning UN Special Representative Blondin Beye turned down a new  UNITA request for the ad hoc commission's proceedings to go into  recess yet again. When it was thought that the commission would  be discussing the clarifications the government team made  yesterday concerning the organizational law of the national  police, the UNITA team once again proceeded to take up the rest  of the working hours this morning with new clarification  demands. This time, though, the UN special representative did  not fall for it. He hardened his stance and invited the Black  Cockerel negotiating team to turn up in the afternoon with  logical documents concerning defense principles and an analysis  of the first point. Blondin Beye expressed his belief that the  clarifications had been adequate, so he decided to continue  proceedings with the documents (?being viewed as finished).    The two sides have already begun discussing the general  principles of the document on the police force. That document  contains some 12 points, of which four have already been dealt  with. The meeting is to resume tomorrow with a discussion of  Point 5, whose content [words indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A.  </P> <P> As so often happens with the HOLLYWOOD sign, El Segundo's less-legendary UNSAFE  FOR JETS sign was covered up Thursday.  </P> <P> But Caltech pranksters weren't responsible. The El Segundo City Council was.  </P> <P> The sign was covered only because Los Angeles International Airport is  beginning a four-month experiment: Departing pilots will be required to delay  the start of their left-hand turns until they're about a mile offshore.  </P> <P> In the past, they could head south when they reached the shoreline, but El  Segundo officials claimed that the pilots often turned earlier -- and flew over  the city.  </P> <P> The cover-up of the hillside sign, which was unveiled in 1988, could become  permanent if the LAX policy becomes permanent, city officials said.  </P> <P> While UNSAFE FOR JETS might seem like an extreme message, it was muted compared  to others that were considered.  </P> <P> Among the rejects was:  </P> <P> TURN AT THE COASTLINE, STUPID.  </P> <P> The Lighting World convention opened this week, and you knew it had to happen.  </P> <P> Visitors at the L.A. Convention Center Thursday beheld a cornucopia of light  fixtures of every type and hue set out by manufacturers. And then the lights  went out.  </P> <P> "Everything in the place was dark for about 15 minutes," said publicist Ray  Rosenbaum.  </P> <P> Fortunately, several of the conventioneers were stocked with an older industry  innovation that got them through the power outage:  </P> <P> Flashlights.  </P> <P> The theaters at Fallbrook Mall near Woodland Hills were showing mostly  shoot-'em- and/or knife-'em-ups like "GoodFellas," "Pacific Heights" and "White  Hunter, Black Heart."  </P> <P> Up to the box office stepped a couple in their 60s.  </P> <P> "Do you have senior citizens' rates?" asked the man.  </P> <P> "We certainly do," he was told.  </P> <P> "Then two tickets please," said the man. "For Fantasia."  </P> <P> There were no grandchildren in sight.  </P> <P> While the controversy over smoking in L.A. restaurants continues, Milt Kagen of  Hollywood writes to say that it's time to begin a crusade for a new sanctuary:  </P> <P> Smoke-free rental cars.  </P> <P> Kagen fumes about climbing into stinky cars. He sees it as "smokers' revenge --  smokers who sit for hours on nonsmoking airplanes then light up as soon as they  are in the cars."  </P> <P> Incidentally, this is a nonsmoking column. Those who wish to smoke should turn  to the weather page.  </P> <P> Does it seem as though the days fly by faster every year? Well, writer Elliot  Zwiebach may have found some real supporting evidence. He reports he received a  subscription offer from Backstage Magazine, which declared that it publishes  "each and every week, 51 times a year."  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> Beverly Hills buys all of its water from the Metropolitan Water District, which  obtains its supplies from Northern California. Thus, even the tap water in  Beverly Hills is imported.  </P></p>

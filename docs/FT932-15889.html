Turnover was up from Pounds 130.5m to Pounds 181.6m but was swollen by the inclusion for the first full year of a women's wear acquisition. Mr Tim Dewhirst, chairman, said Marks and Spencer last year took more than 80 per cent of output. He added that the company 'had a long way to go on margins.' Earnings rose to 3.52p (2.71p). The final dividend is 0.68p for a total of 1p (0.72p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Lothar Ruehl: "Balance of Power"] </F>   [Text] Four years after the self-dissolution of the Warsaw  Pact, the broad mosaic of European security seems to be settling  into a pattern. The outline of the desired "security structure  stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok" is visible, but there  is still no final construction plan for a solid edifice.    The attachment of equal significance to the concepts of  "expansion" and "consolidation" in the European Union's [EU]  integration policy possesses a parallel in NATO's integration  policy. But no government has yet found a formula with which to  apply this equation, with all its unknown quantities, to East  Europe. The same applies to the yet-to-be-organized  military-political WEU [Western European Union] alliance  approved in 1954, which is supposed to assume the role of a West  European defense alliance within the framework of the Maastricht  Treaty.    The addition of new EU members to the ranks of the WEU has a  positive and a negative effect. The positive effect is the  expansion of the countries concerned within a political  framework of consultations. The negative effect is the  resultant distortion of the concept of joint security within  NATO, whose "European pillar" the WEU has only just been defined.    Frederick the Great's famous words "he who wants to defend  everything defends nothing," and "he who wants to be everyone's  friend has no friends in the end" fit the situation of the West  European allies in their three coalitions NATO, the EU, and the  WEU. The danger that they will take on more than they can  handle, overextend the strategic horizon of West Europe and the  Atlantic alliance, and later collapse under the growing weight  of their bloated security policy, now covering the whole of  Europe, has become very clear four years after the end of Soviet  power in East Europe.    Western politicians are now seeking safeguards in Moscow,  their former great enemy. Russia, on its part, is seeking  external support as consolation for its lost domination over  East Europe. These interests can be brought down to a common  denominator. But the latest Partnership for Peace offer will  not be enough for a partnership with Russia, just as the CSCE  and North Atlantic Cooperation Council, two auxiliary structures  of the interim period favored by Moscow, are not enough to  prevent an eastern expansion of NATO and guarantee Russia a  decisive voice in European security by means of a link between  the CSCE and the United Nations.    The wheel of bilateral relations, with NATO as a hub, will  only turn if it is connected by a fan belt to Washington and  Moscow. Otherwise the wheel will be out of gear, without  touching the ground of concrete reality. This necessity is only  now being realized in East Central Europe, which also includes  the Baltic countries, Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania, as well as  Hungary and Bulgaria. This feeling of reality is causing great  skepticism about Western policy vis-a-vis Moscow.    Politics with Russia requires a concrete accord on major  issues that transcends existing differences. Up to now, Western  politics has created a mainly negative image by rejecting  Russian demands: "No right to veto" an eastward expansion of  NATO, "no sphere of interests" for Russia in the "near abroad"  or anywhere else; "no condominium" between Moscow and Brussels  over European security; and "no strategic partnership" in the  sense of the present "Yeltsin doctrine" about Russian privileged  "special relations" with the United States, NATO, and Germany.  But even without a common security forum with Russia, no  "stability shift" to the East can succeed.    So if Russia is not to be "isolated," an active connection  in  accordance with the original Partnership for Peace offer must be  made. A security council will be required, in which a new  version of the "European power concern" can be formed in order  to look after the European scene. But because each country has  a different weight on the scales of power, a "balance of power"  [previous three words in English] will once again establish  itself in order to make the whole scheme work. The bigger  powers share a common concern over a balanced European setup in  order to reduce risks to security.    Of course, several conditions are to be fulfilled in order  to  reach an accord with Russia. They include a firm NATO link to  transatlantic partnership with North America and the inclusion  of the four countries of Central East Europe; a geographical  limit on the size of the EU, which cannot include the whole of  Europe; and a core alliance surrounding France and Germany that  includes Poland as quickly as possible and is supplemented with  close relationships with Great Britain, in order to lay a broad  foundation of security. In this way, the balance of Europe could  be kept.</p>

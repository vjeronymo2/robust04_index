			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Observer: Huw's next The loss of all those first class air miles is especially hard luck for Huw Evans, the affable 52-year-old deputy secretary for overseas finance at Her Majesty's Treasury. He takes over as UK executive director at the IMF and World Bank next February, replacing David Peretz. Evans was in the European Commission for six months in the early 1970s, and was the Hong Kong government's assistant economic secretary between 1973 and 1975. As under-secretary in the Treasury's overseas finance division, he was responsible for IMF and World Bank affairs in the late 1980s. But his real claim to fame dates back to his time as head of the Treasury's forecasting and analysis division between 1980 and 1986. He won the 'golden guru' award for sound economic forecasting - a plaudit that has eluded the Treasury in more recent years.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Democratic Socialist Party  (DSP) Chairman Keigo Ouchi said Tuesday he expressed opposition  to an immediate cabinet reshuffle in a meeting with Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    After emerging from a talk with Hosokawa at the premier's  official residence, Ouchi told reporters he called on Hosokawa  to discuss the fate of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura, the apparent focus of the planned cabinet reshuffle.    The DSP leader quoted the premier as saying a cabinet  shake-up is necessary to help tackle economic issues such as  strained trade ties with Washington and deregulation.    The premier also cited as a major reason for the plan  growing  complaints within the ruling coalition and from bureaucrats  about Takemura's work as the top government spokesman and chief  policy coordinator.    Ouchi, who serves as health and welfare minister, was the  third leader of a ruling coalition party to be consulted by the  premier concerning his plan to reorganize the seven-month-old  cabinet, following Takemura and Social Democratic Party Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama.</p>

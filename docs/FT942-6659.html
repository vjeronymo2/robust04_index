			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: First, go to a library . . . Where Federal Reserve-backed zero coupon bonds are bought in the US bond market by a UK investor, is the original capital cost in sterling indexed up from the date of purchase to the date of disposal, using the usual UK indexing factors? Assuming the answer to be yes, is the remaining gain regarded for tax purposes as a capital gain (eligible to be mitigated to the extent of the unused annual CGT exemption) or is it regarded as income and taxed accordingly in its entirety? First, you will really have to spend some time in a reference library. There, you should look at the income tax rules for deep-discount securities (as set out in paragraph 4 of schedule 4 to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988) in order to calculate the accrued income assessable under case IV of schedule D. You will find this information in one of the multi-volume, loose-leaf tax works such as the British Tax Encyclopaedia or Simon's Taxes. It is rather a pity, though, that you (apparently) decided to make this type of investment without investigating the income tax consequences beforehand. Once you have calculated the case IV figure, the capital gains calculation is relatively straightforward, as you will see from section 118 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. You simply deduct the case IV figure from the sale proceeds and then calculate the chargeable gain (or allowable loss) in the usual way. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

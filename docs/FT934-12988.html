			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / European stocks reach record highs as interest rates decline SHARE prices in the UK, Germany and France reached record levels yesterday as a spate of interest rate cuts in continental Europe boosted prospects for economic growth. France, Denmark, Spain and Ireland cut rates after Germany's surprise easing of monetary policy on Thursday. The moves prompted investors, especially from the US, to sell the D-Mark heavily in favour of the dollar and other European currencies. The dollar rose in London to DM1.6750 from DM1.6635, edging up to DM1.6775 in New York. Sterling slipped about half a pfenning against the D-Mark to DM2.4675 with little change in New York. The continental rate cuts also sparked speculation that the UK government may soon cut base rates, now at 6 per cent, although better than expected UK output figures yesterday may have persuaded the chancellor that further cuts are unnecessary. London share prices finished at a record level for the third successive day, with the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closing 10.7 higher at 3,199. The three-month interbank rate, which indicates market perceptions on base rates, fell about a quarter of a percentage point to about 5 17/32 per cent. The bourses in Paris and Frankfurt closed at all-time highs, both rising about 1.5 per cent on the day. The CAC-40 index of leading French companies finished at 2,231.86, up 32.14; the German DAX index closed 31.48 higher at 2,066.17. The Bank of France lowered its intervention rate, which sets the floor for French lending, to 6.45 per cent from 6.75 per cent. After the move investors switched funds into the French currency, which gained almost two centimes in London, closing at FFr3.4930 against the D-Mark with little change in New York. The Bank of France said yesterday's action 'takes into account the general downward movement in rates in Europe and the objective of internal and external franc stability'. The Danish krone rose against the D-Mark to DKr4.0120 from DKr4.0255 after Denmark cut its two-week CD rate by half a percentage point to 8 per cent. Spain followed the trend, cutting its main money rate by a quarter percentage point to 9.25 per cent. The move helped its currency rise to Pta79.98 against the D-Mark, from Pta80.02. The Bank of Ireland cut its short-term facility rate to 7 per cent from 7.5 per cent. French market hits high, Page 2 Currencies, Page 13 London stocks, Page 15 World stocks, Page 20 See Lex</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST EXECUTIVE MAY CALL SPECIAL HOLDERS MEETING;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: THE AILING L.A. FIRM DECLINED COMMENT. HOWEVER, FIRST BOSTON CORP.  WAS HIRED EARLIER THIS YEAR TO LOOK INTO A RESTRUCTURING.  </P> <P> First Executive Corp., the troubled Los Angeles-based life insurance holding  company, notified the Securities and Exchange Commission that it may soon call  a special meeting of shareholders.  </P> <P> In telephone interviews, however, company officials refused to say why. William  C. Adams, senior vice president for corporate services, said: "It wouldn't be  appropriate for us to make any comment." Securities analysts who follow First  Executive said they weren't aware of plans for such a meeting and said they  didn't know of specific developments that would warrant one.  </P> <P> First Executive held its regular annual meeting of shareholders on July 30.  </P> <P> A computerized index at the SEC's headquarters in Washington showed that  preliminary proxy material for a special meeting was filed with the SEC late  last week. However, preliminary proxy material normally isn't made public by  the SEC, and The Times was unable to obtain a copy late Tuesday.  </P> <P> One source close to First Executive said the SEC filing doesn't specify a date  for the meeting, and said it isn't certain that one will be called. "What it's  in relation to is tentative at the moment," the individual said, but declined  to elaborate.  </P> <P> First Executive is the parent of two large life insurance companies, Executive  Life, which principally serves the California market, and Executive Life of New  York.  </P> <P> The company invested very heavily in junk bonds during the 1980s and recently  has suffered severe losses as the junk bond market plummeted. The company has  said in public filings that it may soon have to stop making dividend payments  on several issues of preferred stock and warned that the parent company might  not be able to continue meeting its debt obligations because regulators are  preventing the insurance units from passing on profits to the parent.  </P> <P> First Executive earlier this year said it had hired the investment banking firm  First Boston Corp. to advise it on a possible restructuring, which sources said  might involve a sale of the company or of its junk bond portfolio. The company,  however, hasn't announced any specific plans.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Arakelyan report: "Harvest in Russia Ripens Faster </F> Than the Laws"]    [Text] Our agriculture is planning to get out of the  crisis. Last week the government presidium approved the latest  program for agrarian reform in Russia -- for 1994-95.    The government intends to use different methods to save the  countryside. First and foremost, to recognize the peasants'  legal right to private, joint-stock, and cooperative ownership.  Admittedly, our private owners will only be able to exercise  their right of land use under state control -- so as to prevent  any exploitation.    The government plans to protect the peasants not only from  exploiters but also from competitors. The program contains the  well-known demand for difficulties to be placed in the way of  foreign food producers entering the Russian market.    Naturally, farmers will continue to be helped out  materially.  Specific sums are not mentioned in the program (clearly so as  not to frighten representatives of other sectors at the outset)  but it is proposed to provide "selective support" for  stockraising and crop farming, as well as a number of other  "infusions." Admittedly, a few innovations are planned. As of  the second half of the year loans will, clearly, be issued to  the agro-industrial complex not on the basis of their promised  repayment, but on the basis of security -- land, real estate,  and so forth.    It is as yet hard to say to what extent all these plans and  intentions will be carried out. Agriculture Minister V.  Khlystun claims that 39 normative acts will have to be adopted  for the program to work -- including a new land code and a law  on agricultural production sharing. And it is well known how  such documents are adopted in our country. The fate of the  agrarian program itself is a graphic example -- the current  version is the sixth.    One thing can be said for sure. The latest program, like all  the preceding documents, does not answer the main question being  asked by the peasants and all Russians -- how does the state  intend to protect (and not just restrict) the declared right of  private land ownership? And will investments made by today's  "private owners" be lost in a future "dekulakization"  [expropriation of rich peasants] campaign?    The latest agricultural season will be starting in most  areas  in a couple of weeks. For the umpteenth time peasants will have  to sow without knowing exactly what awaits them.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Docklands chief lobbies DoE THE CHAIRMAN of the London Docklands Development Corporation yesterday called on the Department of the Environment to relocate its offices to Canary Wharf rather than to two other possible sites in Docklands. Mr Michael Pickard said relocation to Canary Wharf would help to secure the release of funding by the development's administrators. The funding would meet an initial Pounds 100m payment required by the government for work to begin on the Jubilee Underground extension. The corporation's annual report shows writedowns against falls in property values of Pounds 52.1m. There was a deficit of Pounds 52.9m against a pre-tax surplus the year before of Pounds 6.1m. Canary Wharf has cost the corporation up to Pounds 1m from the loss of mooring fees and certain development costs for which Olympia &amp; York, the developer, had pledged to reimburse it. Mr Pickard says the corporation is convinced that the administrators of O&amp;Y 'will resolve its financial situation in a way that allows the project to continue moving forward'. The corporation is negotiating with Customs and Excise over about Pounds 2m in VAT payments, and with the Inland Revenue over surplus tax of up to Pounds 27m. Mr Pickard adds that action has been taken to improve the reliability of the Docklands Light Railway.</p>

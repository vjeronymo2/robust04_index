			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Turkey (9): At the centre of an unstable region - Foreign policy, the strategic surroundings have changed beyond recognition During the four decades of the cold war, Turkey experienced economic transformation and many internal upheavals, but its only serious foreign policy problems resulted from the conflict in Cyprus and its consequently very difficult relationship with Greece. Otherwise it was a rock-solid Nato ally, maintaining cold but polite relations with its Soviet neighbour to the north and holding aloof from the quarrels of its Arab and Persian neighbours to the south and east. Since 1990, however, Turkey's strategic surroundings have changed beyond recognition. The Cyprus issue, though still unresolved, has become the least of Turkey's immediate worries as the country finds itself, in the words of its foreign minister, Mr Hikmet Cetin, 'at the centre of a region of instability and conflict'. In three neighbouring areas - Iraq to the south-east, the Caucasus to the north-east, and the Balkans to the north-west - conflicts have erupted from which Turkey finds it impossible to stay aloof. In the Gulf war of 1991 Turkey was an essential western ally. Without Turkish help, sanctions against Iraq would have been meaningless and the bombing campaign more difficult. Then, in the immediate aftermath of the war, Turkey was at the centre of a major crisis as hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees poured across its border. It was from Turkish territory that western forces entered northern Iraq in April 1991, to set up the 'safe haven' for the Kurds; and it is still from Turkish territory that that haven is protected by western air surveillance. Thus western strategy for containing President Saddam Hussein's regime remains heavily dependent on Turkish co-operation, under an agreement which has to be renewed every six months. Less explicitly, the west also relies on Turkish help in containing Iran, a state whose revolutionary ideology and politico-military ambitions are viewed with deep suspicion, especially in Washington. In both cases Turkey's ruling elite finds good self-interested reasons for co-operating with the west: it neither wants Turkey's secular democracy undermined by subversion from Islamic Iran, nor its problems in the impoverished and mainly Kurdish south-east exacerbated by a new Baathist onslaught on the Kurds across the border in Iraq. But the government has to be careful how it handles a Turkish public opinion which is strongly nationalistic, and dislikes seeing its country used as a springboard for western intimidation of neighbouring Moslem countries. Meanwhile, the break-up of the Soviet Union has 'liberated' eight new independent states along the Asiatic fringe of Russia, three of which are Turkey's immediate neighbours in the Caucasus, and five of which have national languages closely related to Turkish. Initially this was greeted with excitement, not to say euphoria, in Turkey, which saw itself cast as elder brother or guardian to this new 'Turkic' universe. That has now largely given way to a more sober appraisal, which stresses the responsibilities and pitfalls of guardianship as much as its joys and rewards. In the Caucasus especially, Turkish policy-makers fear being dragged into the bitter war over Nagorno-Karabakh, the mainly Armenian-populated enclave which has declared its independence from Azerbaijan, and has been fighting with some success to secure a land corridor linking it to Armenia proper. Turkish public opinion is strongly on the side of the Azeris, seeing them as fellow-Turks and victims of aggression. There has even been loose talk of military intervention against Armenia, whose denials of direct involvement in the conflict do not convince anyone in Turkey. But the government is acutely aware of the damage such a course would inflict on Turkey's image in the west, especially in the US and France where strong Armenian lobbies have kept alive the memory of the massacres of Armenians under the Ottoman empire, which they describe as genocide. It also fears a clash with Russia in what has traditionally been a Russian sphere of influence. So Turkey has done its best to maintain an even-handed approach, and to overcome the Armenians' traditional Turcophobia. Early this year it even supplied Armenia with up to 100,000 tons of wheat, from stocks earmarked for domestic consumption, as an advance on wheat promised by the EC which was late arriving; and Mr Cetin has been working with his Russian counterpart, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, to revive the flagging peace process sponsored by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). The Armenian victory at Kelbajar in early April, widening the corridor to between 30 and 40km, put this Turkish policy under acute strain. Turkey responded by halting relief to Armenia. But the presidents of both Armenia and Azerbaijan, meeting for the first time at the funeral of President Turgut Ozal in Ankara on April 21, agreed to establish a direct bilateral dialogue, with a 'hot line' between their capitals. The Turks also used the occasion to give the Armenian leader a firm warning. 'We made it very clear to him,' says Ozdem Sanberk, the top civil servant in the Turkish foreign ministry, 'that he should explain to his people that these so-called victories are not good for the future. Armenia is an enclave among Moslem countries and must live in peace with them. It should not rely only on support from lobbies in California. . . We can live without Armenia. They can live without Turkey, but in trouble.' Unlike Armenia and northern Iraq, Bosnia is not Turkey's immediate neighbour, and the war there does not affect Turkey's national security so directly. But in emotional terms it is easily the most sensitive of the three surrounding crises. As Mr Cetin says, 'Turkey is a Balkan country'. All of the Balkans were Ottoman territory until the 19th century - Bosnia and Hercegovina being lost finally in 1908. Turks have feelings of both kinship and responsibility for the Moslems left behind there, kept alive partly (but by no means solely) by the descendants of those who left and settled in Turkey: some 4m 'Bosniaks' are today Turkish citizens. These feelings have been fanned by Moslem religious leaders, and reached a peak in January this year when the bombing of Iraq was contrasted with western passivity towards the Serbs, with many bitter accusations of 'double standards'. This makes the secular and pro-western Turkish government very nervous, and it has done its best to pre-empt Islamic exploitation of the issue both at home and abroad. Turkey itself raised the issue at the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, with Mr Cetin talking wildly at one point of oil embargoes against the west. Turkey has also repeatedly offered to join in any UN or Nato-organised military intervention. As in other countries, however, the army is understood to be distinctly unenthusiastic about deploying troops on the ground, and unilateral intervention has been firmly ruled out. As long ago as August 8 last year, Turkey proposed an 'action plan' aimed at 'convincing the aggressor that the world means business'. It included the following elements: Establishment and enforcement of a no-fly zone; Limited military intervention in the form of selective strikes, with Serb heavy weapons as the main targets; and Lifting the embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian government. Mr Cetin notes sadly that the international community has now come round to at least part of this plan. But, he says, 'we fear it is too little, too late'. He worries that, 'if the Serbs succeed, they will be encouraged to do the same in Kosovo', where 90 per cent of the population are ethnic Albanians - also mainly Moslem. His officials fear that, if that happens, the fighting will inevitably spill over into Macedonia and perhaps involve neighbouring countries, bringing it ever nearer to Turkey's borders. Differences over the Balkans have become a new source of friction between Turkey and Greece, which last month refused to let Turkish F-16s pass through its air space on their way to help enforce the Bosnian no-fly zone. And Greek hostility continues to complicate Turkey's relations with both the US, where the Greek lobby keeps a lid on military aid to Turkey, and the EC, where Greece vetoes not only Turkey's eventual membership but also more immediate financial aid. Yet in spite of repeated rebuffs, Turkish ministers and officials remain convinced of the country's European destiny. They are busily preparing for the customs union with the EC (due at the end of 1995), and have eagerly taken up associate membership of the Western European Union, now officially enshrined as Europe's 'defence component'. So far from being distracted by their new regional role, they believe that it increases their value as an ally and partner, and that west Europeans will come round at last to the view that, without Turkey, Europe is incomplete.</p>

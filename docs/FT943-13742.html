			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (2) A powerhouse for the region - Three men will shape the destiny of South Africa: President Nelson Mandela and Deputy Presidents Thabo Mbeki and FW de Klerk / They talk to Patti Waldmeir and Michael Holman about national unity, economic development and the many difficult challenges which lie ahead Question: Why should Financial Times readers invest in South Africa? Answer: South Africa is potentially a rich country. . . with developed infrastructure, modern ports, a sophisticated banking system, a telecommunications system. It can be a powerhouse for the southern African region. Investors in this country are likely to derive maximum benefit, far more than investing in other areas. South Africa is far more advanced than any of our neighbouring states and therefore to invest in this country you will be helping to raise the living standards of not only the people in South Africa, but in the southern African region. Why invest in South and southern Africa rather than East Asia? We have taken precautions to ensure that investors have a maximum return for their investments. Nationalisation was a fundamental part of ANC policy. But in order to attract investments it was clear to us that we had to make a very significant shift; if we did not, we would not get investments. There will be no expropriation of foreign investments. Investors will be free to repatriate dividends and if an investor sells his business, he will be able to export those proceeds. We believe in keeping our tax rate low so as to attract foreign investment. That's a decided advantage. . . What are the prospects for a social contract in South Africa? I don't know if I would call it a social contract. But there is an agreement between labour, capital and the government. The harmony that exists between ourselves in the ANC and big business is striking. The support we have had from business, had it not been for that support. . . we probably would not have had such a landslide victory. Are you surprised at the degree of powers claimed by provincial premiers? Our own people are demanding some form of federalism. Whereas it was the Inkatha Freedom Party of Chief Buthelezi, the National Party of Mr de Klerk that was demanding it. Now it is our own people demanding independence from the central government. We are happy about that. All that we're concerned about is that there should be free movement of goods, services, capital and labour. Why did you decide on a government of national unity, and will it continue after the five years set out in the constitution? There is a long history here, starting from our experiences in prison. The moment we arrived at Robben Island, there was debate amongst Afrikaner warders, some saying let's treat these people harshly so they must respect white supremacy, others saying. . . we must treat them in such a way that when they win it should not be a government of retribution. We adopted a policy of talking to the warders and persuading them to treat us as human beings. And that is a lesson that one of our strongest weapons is dialogue. It has been a very powerful weapon. Our people accepted this, because throughout the history of the ANC, the idea of nation-building, of a non-racial society, has been uppermost. And we have now implemented that through a government of national unity. So far as continuing this government after five years, we have an open mind; we're very flexible. Could you articulate your vision of the RDP? Well, it wants to address the basic needs of the masses of the people: to ensure that our people lead a better life, to ensure that everybody has a job; that everybody lives in a decent house; that there is free, quality education; that there is electricity in every home; clean, healthy, running water; that there are sporting and recreation centres; that there are paved roads in our areas. But the RDP also addresses the question of nation-building. (Through the RDP) we are appealing to whites. Remain in our country, don't take away your skills. The RDP is intended not only to address the basic needs of the majority, it is actually to set the minority free, free from fear of retribution. It is a programme to transform the whole South African society. A Truth Commission in a country where the previous government still holds power is unusual. Do you worry such a commission might, as deputy president De Klerk has warned, prove divisive? The ANC has twice the combined strength of the IFP and the National Party, so if we wanted to we could just run the government, but we are not doing that. We are committed to making the government of national unity something which has got a substantive content. As far as the Truth Commission is concerned, we have made it clear that we have no intention of retribution. We are doing this in order to heal the wounds of the past. People must know what crimes were committed and that we have forgiven those crimes. Is the spirit of national unity strong enough to survive these pressures? Recently I went to the most powerful congregation of the Dutch Reformed Church in Pretoria. There was a time where if you went to the DRC, you would need a whole police force to protect you from being attacked. They needed a police force to protect me from the love of the people. You would think I was in Soweto. Everybody wanted to touch me. And the whole idea of national unity has attracted a positive response from all segments of the population. Aren't you in danger of not satisfying your (black) constituency at the end of your first year? This is a process. The people are justified in having these exaggerated expectations when they see whites enjoying rights and opportunities that are denied them. From inside the country, forces are being mobilised to enable us to start this programme. I can assure you, as we said during the elections, that we promise no miracles. We want you to understand that it is going to take time for us to mobilise the resources. . . But what is important is that a few days after a new cabinet was set up, the process of trying to address problems started, and I can tell you that the co-operation in the GNU is impressive. Don't you underestimate the role of the front-line states in ending apartheid? That, actually, I don't agree with. The people - men, women and children - inside South Africa who came out into the streets, called strikes; stayaways, who were shot and killed by the racist South African Police; they are the people who kept the fires burning, and eventually brought down tyrants. When do you think the NP finally realised that it was majority rule or nothing? You can't put a date and say on the particular day they realised; gradually, they came to accept that majority rule was unavoidable. But you must understand that it takes a long time for concepts to be accepted because even now, without in any way being discourteous to the NP, they still think that they are in the majority because they would like us to consult them on everything we do. But de Klerk is a man who means well and when we point out to him: 'Look, don't go too far, we are the majority party,' he accepts that.</p>

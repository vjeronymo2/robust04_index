			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Ofwat urges stand on EU directive THE National Customer Council, the water quality watchdog, yesterday called on the government to take a 'firm stand' to reduce the impact of the European Union's urban waste water directive. It said the cost of implementing the directive was far exceeding initial estimates. The council looks after the interests of water and sewerage customers. Ofwat has to set new water-price limits next year, and the council urged the government to instruct the agency to assume that the timetable for the directive would be relaxed.</p>

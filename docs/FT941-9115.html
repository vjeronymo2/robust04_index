			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Pilkington to reduce debt via Australian float Pilkington, the glass maker, is to float a 49 per cent stake in its Australasian operations on the Australian stock exchange. The sale will help Pilkington cut borrowings, which stood at Pounds 1.02bn, giving 87 per cent gearing, at its September half year end - before the Pounds 200m disposal of Sola, its spectacle lens business. Pilkington aims to cut gearing to 50 per cent by 1995, helped by disposals. The timing for a float is considered good, and profits of the business are recovering. However, Pilkington is not expected to recoup the Pounds 103m it spent in 1988 to acquire 50.3 per cent of the Australasian business from BTR Nylex. The flotation is expected to take place in mid-1994. Keeping a 51 per cent stake will enable Pilkington to consolidate 100 per cent of the Australasian subsidiary's profits, taking a minority charge after tax. Since 1988 Pilkington has taken severe action to improve its Australasian operations, which now include two float tanks and significant downstream operations such as glass toughening and automotive glass making. Heavy extraordinary losses were caused by the closure of a lossmaking curtain walling operation and the New Zealand sheet glass plant which was falling into losses. It is the only float glass maker in Australasia and has 70 per cent of the market. Profits in recent years had also been under pressure from recession and cheap imports from China and other parts of Asia. However, economic recovery and action to stop dumping have led to a recent revival in profits. Turnover of the Australasian business was ADollars 384m (Pounds 189m) in 1992-93, from which it is thought pre-interest profits were about ADollars 20m. Mr Geoff Marshall, chief executive of Pilkington Australasia, said the group would come to the market with 'a commercially viable balance sheet'. Potter Warburg, the stockbrokers, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand are advising Pilkington on the float. See Lex</p>

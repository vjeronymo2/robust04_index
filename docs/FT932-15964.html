			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Portrait fetches Pounds 551,500 AN EARLY double portrait by leading 18th-century Scottish painter Allan Ramsay doubled its estimate to fetch an auction record price of Pounds 551,500 at Christie's in London yesterday. Yesterday's price is in line with other portraits by Ramsay recently acquired for the nation by private treaty sale and now in the Tate Gallery in London and the National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. The three-quarter-length portrait marks the marriage of Sir Edward and Lady Turner and the launch of Ramsay's highly successful career in London. Another portrait, Sir Thomas Lawrence's half-length of Miss Juliana Copley, also exceeded expectations, selling for Pounds 102,700. The sale of British pictures realised Pounds 1,744,560 with 71 per cent sold by value.</p>

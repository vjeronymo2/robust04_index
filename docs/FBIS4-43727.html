			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lower Saxon Minister-President Gerhard </F> Schroeder by Wolfgang Kaden and Klaus Wirtgen; place and date  not given: "`Too Miserable'"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schroeder, almost exactly three  months after your election victory as minister-president for  Lower Saxony, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  suffered its worst setback in a long time in the European  elections. Do you have an explanation for this?    [Schroeder] I have two. The SPD did not manage to mobilize  all the voters who are within its reach and failed to make it  clear what the issues of work and social justice have to do with  Europe. Moreover, the election campaign left a lot to be desired  on substance and even more so aesthetically.    [DER SPIEGEL] What was it that you did not like?    [Schroeder] The election posters and the motifs were too  dull.    [DER SPIEGEL] You are probably referring to the man who....    [Schroeder] .... is sleeping in a boat, and who, when you  look at him, creates the impression: "Socialists do not really  want to work hard." I did not like the "mafia" poster, either.  After all, we cannot compete with the Christian Democratic  Union [CDU] as far as law-and-order slogans are concerned, let  alone -- thank God -- win the election.    [DER SPIEGEL] Scharping has decided that the SPD would  support a law that permits the bugging of private homes in  specific cases. He is obviously taking a different view on this  issue from you.    [Schroeder] I supported Scharping's positions on the bugging  issue and the asylum law. Yet I find it hard to understand that  the SPD should make a classic CDU topic its number one issue in  an election campaign. This criticism is not directed against  the person and the position of the chairman. We all made a  mistake here that we should have avoided.    [DER SPIEGEL] Whom are you referring to in particular?  After all, you are also a member of the Presidium, the highest  leadership circle.    [Schroeder] So they say. So what I have said can also be  understood as self-criticism. However, these decisions were not  made in the Presidium. Had I known about the posters, I would  have said: They are not good enough.    [DER SPIEGEL] You were speaking of the voters whom the SPD  could not "mobilize." How big a percent can the SPD win?    [Schroeder] Clearly more than 40 percent.    [DER SPIEGEL] So how do you explain that the SPD remained  below this level even in Lower Saxony and fell behind the CDU?  Were you not active enough in the election campaign?    [Schroeder] I did my job, but only 52 percent of the voters  turned out in Lower Saxony. Nevertheless, the SPD achieved 39  percent. Under the circumstances "also a nice result."    [DER SPIEGEL] With his focus on "work, work, work," will  Scharping be able to reach new groups of voters?    [Schroeder] Work and protecting jobs are government issues.  Only as head of government can one be present and helpful when  things are bad at the enterprise level. At the abstract level  of demands these issues are only very difficult to represent in  a credible way.    [DER SPIEGEL] So is this topic not suitable for the  Bundestag elections?    [Schroeder] For the presentation of the opposition in the  Bundestag the topic of jobs is appropriate only to a limited  degree. This is why the SPD must point to the successful work  done in this sphere by all its minister-presidents and use it as  proof of its specific authority in industrial policy.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you, in all seriousness, think that this  group of land leaders could beat Kohl?    [Schroeder] The fact that with Oskar Lafontaine a most  successful minister-president is responsible for the economy and  finances has certainly increased our competence. Everything is  fine in the Saarland....    [DER SPIEGEL] ...apart from the magisterial press law....    [Schroeder] ...apart from the press law -- and Lafontaine  only lost marginally in the election. It may make sense if we  treat the issue of "work" in the election campaign as concretely  as we minister-presidents are dealing with it.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are you insinuating that the SPD has so far  focused too much on Scharping and not presented itself as a team?    [Schroeder] I cannot put it like this because, owing to my  commitments in Lower Saxony, I am not available for the team.  Yet, maybe the SPD could make it clear that, although it has a  chairman and a candidate, there are a number of people next to  or behind him who also know a thing or two. In all modesty, I  do count myself among this group of people.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you, maybe, have the feeling that you are  not sufficiently respected by Scharping, who defeated you in the  poll held among SPD members a year ago?    [Schroeder] It is not a question of vanity. He who wants to  get more from me than I did -- with my people I won an election  in Lower Saxony -- has to tell me so. I want Scharping to win  the election because of the party and because of his person. We  used to be rivals, but we are not now.    [DER SPIEGEL] Many people do not quite believe you on that.    [Schroeder] The SPD decided about its leadership at the  grass-roots level in an exemplary way. To start a debate on the  leadership now would be the silliest thing that the SPD could  do. I will certainly not take part in such a debate, out of my  own understanding but also out of fear of a threat from my  friend Oskar, who said he would give anyone a thrashing who  started such a debate.    [DER SPIEGEL] Would you think it a good idea if the SPD  were to depict you together with Scharping and Lafontaine on one  poster?    [Schroeder] I would have absolutely no problem.    [DER SPIEGEL] What slogan would you recommend?    [Schroeder] "The Magnificent Three" I would write cheekily.    [DER SPIEGEL] "Negligence in our own club" is what Scharping  partly blamed the defeat on in the European elections. Do you  feel that this refers to you, too?    [Schroeder] Not at all. I have been most discreet, even on  issues -- such as the question of a statement in favor of an  SPD-Greens coalition -- where everybody knows that I am of a  different opinion.    [DER SPIEGEL] You do not have to pretend to appear to be  more harmless than you are. After all, you must have known that  your cheeky remark that the SPD should not constantly invent new  contenders -- you mentioned Federal President Herzog; Stihl,  head of the Federation of German Chambers of Industry and  Commerce [DIHT]; and the coach of the national soccer team,  Vogts -- was exactly aimed at your superior, Scharping.    [Schroeder] We do not have superiors, only a chairman. It  was not intended as criticism of him. After all, I could have  added a fourth one, who is not a contender either, namely myself.    I wanted to give an informal ad hoc interview. I am sorry if  the wrong impression was created. Still, we should not make the  mistake now of hiding the real problems behind the irritation  created by my interview, which was the only interview that I had  given in many months.    [DER SPIEGEL] The real problem: Despite the almost 4  million unemployed and extremely high state debt, the SPD has  not managed to strip the government coalition of its majority.  Can you still win the Bundestag elections?    [Schroeder] Yes. If Kohl had reacted in as cowardly a way  to setbacks in the last two years as my party has now, he would  long since be gone.    [DER SPIEGEL] So should Scharping defy all setbacks?    [Schroeder] Our message must remain the same. There is no  doubt that an upswing has set in. Yet, it is much too miserable  to say that this upswing has had an effect on the labor market.  We must become more precise and make it clear that only an  ecologically acceptable production of goods can create  additional jobs. We must make it clear to the people that, now  as then, the lowest third of wage-earners are financing the  costs related to unity in a ratio of 4:1. These messages,  combined with the results of the achievements of the  minister-presidents and an attractive election campaign team,  are the recipe for success.    [DER SPIEGEL] Even with a man at the top who has been so  badly damaged?    [Schroeder] It is most remarkable and it can terrify even a  man with a skin as thick as I have how quickly the "Hosanna!"  has turned into a "Crucify him!" The praise for our party  chairman is still ringing in my ears. Now it is painful to hear  how the same man is being turned into the opposite within a few  days or even hours, even though he has not changed his policy.  I cannot be had by such games. I do not think that we cannot  win the Bundestag election with Rudolf Scharping. On the  contrary.    [DER SPIEGEL] Scharping is seeking voters from the center.  Can they be filled with enthusiasm for ecological thinking?    [Schroeder] Certainly.    [DER SPIEGEL] Should Scharping now change to Schroeder's  course and come out in favor of a coalition between the SPD and  the Greens?    [Schroeder] No. It would have been fatal for Scharping had  he followed such public advice. The candidate must determine  the strategy to a great extent. Otherwise he cannot fight and  "campaign on the streets and squares...."    [DER SPIEGEL] ...You are now quoting Helmut Kohl....    [Schroeder] ...Those who now feel that they have to advise  Scharping to change his course to the one that Schroeder pursued  in Lower Saxony and endorsed last year are giving him bad  advice. A political strategy must fit a person and must show  continuity, even in the moment of defeat.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you, all of a sudden, also regard the  SPD-Green coalition as an inadequate perspective for power to  succeed the CDU/CSU/FDP [Christian Social Union/Free Democratic  Party] coalition?    [Schroeder] Not me. Yet the SPD has more than one option.  As is demanded by our federal party manager, Guenter Verheugen,  it can rely on several opportunities.    [DER SPIEGEL] Could you please explain what has so far been  the one option of your party?    [Schroeder] The SPD had the option to work in a coalition  with the FDP. After all, there is one constant factor in German  policy, namely the relentless opportunism of the FDP. If they  cannot avoid it, they will come crawling on their stomachs into  our hut to enter into a coalition with the SPD. The SPD's  strategy has tacitly built on this assumption.    [DER SPIEGEL] Was that the strategy of the SPD or Scharping,  who, in Rhineland-Palatinate, rules together with the FDP.    [Schroeder] These strategies are identical.    [DER SPIEGEL] But it was never your option, and you are SPD,  too.    [Schroeder] It is right that he who has been defeated with  his strategy sometimes keeps his mouth shut. After the election  we will opt for the one coalition with which we will most likely  be able to implement our reform program. For me the answer is  not difficult, while for others it is more difficult.    [DER SPIEGEL] At the party congress in Halle on Wednesday  [22 June], Scharping is to be nominated as the official  candidate -- in a secret ballot. Is that not somewhat risky?    [Schroeder] I thought that it was correct and noble of  Scharping to ask for a secret ballot. The SPD's collective  common sense will certainly be enough -- at least in Halle. The  delegates will realize that Scharping must not simply give in to  all these demands for change that he is now being confronted  with. Yet, the concept for victory also includes that we now  discuss in public what we can do better.    [DER SPIEGEL] Many people within the SPD suspect that  Gerhard Schroeder is only waiting for his chance to replace  Scharping at the very last minute. What answer have you  prepared for this interview to deny this?    [Schroeder] I do not have to deny anything, because I have  had one experience: Regardless of what I do or fail to do,  people will always interpret it as if I wanted something.    [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Schroeder, thank you very much for this  interview.</p>

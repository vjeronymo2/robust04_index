			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: Kleinwort to double size of China fund Kleinwort Benson is seeking to double the size of its China investment and development fund to Dollars 120m through a placing of new shares and warrants. The subscription period for the new shares, likely to be priced at a small premium to the Dollars 10.50 issue price of the old shares, will close in early October. The fund plans to pay its maiden dividend next year. Existing shareholders will not have pre-emptive rights in respect of the placing, but they will be rewarded with one free warrant for every five shares they hold. By contrast, new subscribers will have to pay for the warrants. The fund, which was launched two years ago, has now invested Dollars 54.6m in 10 unlisted Chinese companies.</p>

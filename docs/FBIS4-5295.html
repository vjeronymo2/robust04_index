			<p>BFN     [Text] In a bid to further promote liberalization [in world  trade], the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan  [Keidanren] has compiled a report. The report stresses that in  response to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT, both  the Japanese Government and the private sector should make  concerted efforts to cooperate financially and personally with  the World Trade Organization (WTO). Commenting on the  negotiations at the Uruguay Round, the report harshly attacks  the Japanese Government, saying, "Japan focused its attention  only on the rice issue and was utterly passive in the  negotiations." The report also appeals to corporations in other  nations "not to resort to trade methods such as managed trade."  The report, which is entitled "The Assessment of the Conclusion  of the Uruguay Round and Proposals for Future Tasks," has been  compiled by both the Trade Measures Committee and the Services  and Trade Committee of the Keidanren. It will be approved at a  meeting of the Keidanren chairman and vice chairmen scheduled to  be held on 11 April.    The report highly praises the reaffirmation of the  multilateral free trade principle achieved with the Uruguay  Round and the creation of the WTO as an international  organization to promote free trade. The report, however, points  out that the elimination of a clause on preventing roundabout  exports left room for the dumping of exports.    The report proposes that the Japanese Government provide  financial assistance to the WTO and make aggressive personnel  contributions to that organization. The report also emphasizes  the need for Japan to revamp its domestic laws to prepare for  the inauguration of the WTO in January 1995. In referring to  the United States' revival of the Super 301 provision, the  report urges the United States "not to take one-sided trade  measures, including the invocation of the provision," and it  says that the revival of the Super 301 provision runs counter to  the goal of concluding the Uruguay Round.</p>

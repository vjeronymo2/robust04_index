			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Zimbabwe wins Dollars 1.4bn from west WESTERN nations have agreed to provide Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 920m) of grants, soft loans and commercial loans to Zimbabwe next year, to help the country steer its economic reform programme through the worst drought in living memory. The package was agreed yesterday at a meeting of 15 country donors organised by the World Bank, to which Mr Bernard Chidzero, finance minister, outlined Zimbabwe's progress in slimming its bloated public sector, dismantling price controls and encouraging the growth of private enterprise. Western donors had feared that Zimbabwe would be unable to stick to the programme because of the drought and recession, and were understood to have set strict conditions for their help. The package meets all Zimbabwe's needs for outside finance over the next year. Of the total, 80 per cent is made up of loans and 20 per cent grants. Within this the government plans to borrow just under 15 per cent - Dollars 200m - on normal commercial terms, bridging finance to cover the period between aid allocation and payment. Mr Chidzero said the drought had forced the economy into unexpected decline this year, but stressed that the reforms were nevertheless going ahead as planned. 'The people understand what needs to be done,' he said. Government spending had been curbed from 53 per cent of gross domestic product two years ago to less than 47 per cent now. That includes the 18 to 20 per cent of GDP which the state will have spent this year on importing and distributing food to the drought-hit areas. 'So if you remove the drought, government spending comes even lower,' said Mr Chidzero. Spending had been cut in nearly all government departments, except for education, health and defence. Mr Chidzero hoped that recent South African incursions into Zimbabwean airspace would not hold up his plans for cuts in the defence budget.</p>

			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy So it looks as though there was nothing to worry about in average earnings after all. The apparent upward drift was just a blip caused by bonus payments to all those City folk who spend their time predicting the inflation rate. Moreover, the UK's productivity performance is still encouraging. Unit labour costs were up only 1.9 per cent in the year to April compared with 2.2 per cent in March. At some stage, as Mr Eddie George pointed out at the Mansion House last night, interest rates will have to go up again. On the basis of such figures he would have trouble arguing that it must be soon. If gilts initially reacted to the figures with a strong rally, equities seemed a little more grudging in their welcome. Perhaps the share market's concern is that the recovery may not be quite so strong after all. Certainly the sharp fall in the workforce during the first quarter is food for thought. Today's retail spending figures will provide a further pointer to the state of the economy. In turn, that may complicate the political debate over tax cuts. A faltering recovery and an absence of inflationary pressure might make tax cuts appear more acceptable. But with world bond markets still uneasy, the authorities have to worry about the ability of the gilts market to absorb new issues. It will not have escaped their attention that by yesterday evening gilts' positive mood on inflation was already giving way to nervousness ahead of tomorrow's auction announcement.</p>

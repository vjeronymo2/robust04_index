			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: Shielding investors from predators - The role of contingent value rights in a bull market Any revival of mergers and acquisitions activity in the US could renew interest in a family of financial instruments headed by CVRs - contingent value rights - which offer investors protection against a poorly performing stock price. While just a handful of contingent financial instruments were issued in the bull market of the late 1980s, interest could be stronger this time around the economic cycle. The company issuing the CVR targets a future share price and promises to pay the holder the difference between the target price and the actual share price at the exercise date, subject to an upper limit. Hence the company may face a substantial liability if its shares do not reach the target price. Alternatively, if the shares perform well, the CVRs expire worthless. In the US, CVRs were originally issued following the mergers which formed the pharmaceutical groups Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Marion Merrell Dow in 1989. For example, Dow Chemical will pay the holders of its CVRs the difference between Dollars 45.77 and the price of Marion Merrell Dow shares in September this year - up to a maximum payment of Dollars 15.77 or Dollars 1.5bn in total. Last week Marion Merrell Dow shares were trading at Dollars 34 per share, implying a Dollars 11-per-CVR, or Dollars 1bn, liability. However, Dow Chemical has the option of extending the deadline by one year, in which case the target share price rises to Dollars 50.23 and the maximum payment Dollars 20.23. The acquiring companies view the CVR liability as something akin to a deferred consideration, which is revealed in a note to the annual report and accounts. 'From the predators' perspective, these are instruments which offer a kind of earn-out to stockholders in the company which is being taken over,' said Mr Ben Krause, head of the capital markets group at the American Stock Exchange in New York, on which both the Dow and Rhone-Poulenc CVRs are listed. This type of profits participation role was even more obvious in an earlier issue of contingent payment rights for Eli Lilly. These instruments gave holders the right to profits participation following the Dollars 350m acquisition of Hybritech in 1986. In part, CVR issues were driven by an accounting loophole, which allowed the dominant partners in the merger - Rhone-Poulenc and Dow Chemical - to keep goodwill resulting from the transaction off the merged entities' balance sheet. This is particularly important in the pharmaceutical industry, where valuations of companies are well in excess of asset value, reflecting the future value of drugs still in the research and development phase. The amortisation of goodwill arising from mergers would severely depress the profits of the merged entity. The US accounting loophole has now been closed, but CVRs have not disappeared from the corporate finance scene. Contingent participation rights - whether based on profits performance or share price performance - could be used as a defence against takeover by guaranteeing holders a minimum return on investment. NCR, the US computer manufacturer, reportedly considered issuing CVRs as a defence against AT&amp;T's hostile bid. Consolidated Goldfields also considered making a CVR issue as a defence against Minorco. There certainly seems to be an appetite among international investors for instruments which offer some form of protection against a poorly performing share price. For example, Roche, the Swiss pharmaceuticals group, decided to issue unusual 'bull spread' warrants rather than ordinary equity warrants in a Dollars 1bn issue in April. Just like CVRs, the 'bull spread' warrant structure offers protection against a collapse in the share price over the next three years - but at the cost of limiting annual returns. The warrants were issued when Roche shares were trading at around SFr7,500. On the exercise date in May 1994, holders of the warrants can either take one Roche share, a cash payment of SFr7,000, or, at the companies discretion, a cash payment of SFr10,000. There certainly seems to be a future for contingent financial instruments in one form or other. However, the permutations are many and the risks to the issuing company could be significant. Corporate financiers make two points: The promise to compensate for poor share price growth, and therefore presumably for poor earnings growth, is only credible if the issuer is a strong company. Roche, Dow Chemical, Rhone-Poulenc and Eli Lilley are all solid blue-chip stocks. However, the roster of potential issuers is limited to larger corporations able to weather a downturn in performance. Only a brave company would target its share price in the current uncertain economic climate. The experience of convertible bonds incorporating a put option - which allows the holder to cash in the bonds early - may have been chastening.</p>

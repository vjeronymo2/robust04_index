			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Books: Double act that conquered Dublin - Anthony Curtis welcomes this history of the Gate Theatre and its famous custodians THE BOYS: A BIOGRAPHY OF MICHEAL MACLIAMMOIR AND HILTON EDWARDS by Christopher Fitz-Simon Nick Hern Books Pounds 17.99, 320 pages The Boys succeeded Lady Gregory and Yeats as the custodians of the Irish genius for theatre but neither Hilton Edwards nor Micheal MacLammoir was Irish. The story of these partners in every sense of the word for over 50 years, and the company they kept going in spite of chronic financial crisis, was well worth telling in detail. In this book Christopher Fitz-Simon, an Irish theatre director, who was for some years artistic director of the Abbey Theatre, gives most thoroughly the history of the great rival to the Abbey, the Gate Theatre. Dublin in the late 1920s, when the Gate began, was a very closed society. The Abbey - founded in 1904 - was still in the iron grip of the formidable Lady Gregory. Dennis Johnston, a Dublin lawyer of Ulster Protestant ancestry, sent the Abbey an expressionist play he had written about Robert Emmet. It came smartly back to him, rejected. As he opened the envelope he noticed that someone had inscribed in pencil on the back 'The old lady says 'No']'. It was under that title that the play was eventually put on in 1929 at the newly formed Gate Theatre in Dublin, directed by Hilton Edwards with Micheal MacLammoir, as the Speaker (Emmet), and it gave them their first sensational success with a new play. The Boys were variously gifted. Both frequently appeared on stage, MacLammoir, in major parts. London recognised his consummate acting when he appeared in Hedda Gabler with Peggy Ashcroft in 1954. MacLammoir, also wrote plays for the company and was a talented painter designing several of their productions. Edwards, while wheeling and dealing as the company's paternalistic artistic director and administrator, directed the majority of their productions himself. The Boys were both Londoners. Bobby Edwards was brought up in East Finchley, son of an Indian civil servant. As a young man he had minor parts at the Old Vic and was one of Ronald Frankau's Cabaret Kittens. Micheal MacLammoir, was born Alfred Willmore. Aged 12 he played the young MacDuff in Beerbohm-Tree's Macbeth and also appeared as a lost boy in Peter Pan the year Noel Coward played Slightly. The manner in which he learnt to speak Irish, gave himself a Celtic name and completely reconstructed his identity, claiming to have been born in Cork, is material for a wonderful play he never wrote. But someone should. I once met Micheal MacLammoir, after I had been to see the Gate's production in Dublin of St Joan with Siobhan MacKenna and I sampled his irresistible charm. He had played the Earl of Warwick, now he entertained both me and members of the company, with hilarious imitations of all the St Joans he had seen from a stentorian Sybil Thorndike to a tiny squeaky Ludmilla Pitoeff. Both he and Edwards learnt their job the hard way. They met as members of the touring company run by the legendary Anew McMaster (later Pinter's mentor). Orson Welles crops up at the Gate as a young hopeful aged 16, and then years later as director of the film Othello in which Micheal MacLammoir, played Iago (see his Put Money in Thy Purse). James Mason played Brutus there and there were appearances by Cyril Cusack, Jimmy O'Dea, Brian Friel (as one of their playwrights) and Eamonn Andrews. The stormy relations between the Boys and the Earl of Longford - older brother of the present one - are traced. Longford initially subsidised the theatre entirely out of his own pocket and was on its board of directors, but then formed his own company. The premises were shared, each company occupying the theatre building for six consecutive months - an unhappy arrangement that remained for many years. The story has a happy ending, financially, with the Gate receiving, under Charles Haughey's premiership in 1969, a government grant. Micheal MacLammoir, made his own fortune with the international success of his one man show about Oscar Wilde, and Hilton became first Head of Drama for Irish television. But money was never really important to either of them except as a means of furthering the work at the Gate. The only tiny mistakes I could discover in this most interesting book were: Barrie was not a bachelor and the Oxford bookshop is called Blackwell's. Nick Hern, publisher of this book, was the editor at Methuen responsible for their series of modern play texts that included the plays of Simon Gray, John Mortimer, Michael Frayn, Edward Bond, Harold Pinter. He did not start the series - that was the achievement of the late John Cullen way back in the 1960s - but he greatly developed it. Then when Methuen was taken over in 1988, Hern broke away to start his own list. Several of the playwrights, including Pinter, also left Methuen around that time; but they migrated to Faber who in the late 1980s took over as our main publisher of play texts for the ordinary reader. Meanwhile Hern has kept his own imprint as a specialist publisher of theatrical books and operates now from 14 Larden Road, London W3 7ST under the logo - NHB. This year he says 'marks the emergence into full independence of Nick Hern Books, the imprint I founded to publish all that's best in the current theatre - and a few other things besides'. Hern has formed an alliance with the Royal National Theatre and has published Tony Kushner's Angels in America: Millennium Approaches and Perestroika (the Aids epic currently playing to packed houses at the Cottesloe). Hern and the NT have also recently published, or rather re-published, 12 volumes of Granville Barker's Prefaces to Shakespeare at Pounds 4.99 each. Richard Eyre says in a foreword that he regards Granville Barker 'not only as the first modern English director but as the most influential'. Barker's comments on Shakespeare remain relevant today.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Judge's summing-up criticised in Guinness appeal THE Court of Appeal was told yesterday of 'consternation in the corridors' at Southwark Crown Court after the jury had retired to consider its verdicts in the Guinness trial last summer. Miss Clare Montgomery, for Mr Anthony Parnes, a City stockbroker, said that all counsel had been stunned when, in the closing minutes of his summing-up, Mr Justice Henry told the jury they need not deal with charges brought under section 151 of the 1985 Companies Act. From the time of the pre-trial hearings, the judge had consistently declined unilaterally to remove those charges from the indictment but had asked the prosecution to do so, because he regarded them as inconsistent with other charges under the Theft Act, Miss Montgomery said. Three defendants - Mr Parnes, serving a 2 1/2 -year jail sentence in Ford open prison, West Sussex; Mr Ernest Saunders, former Guinness chairman and chief executive, serving five years; and Mr Gerald Ronson, head of the Heron Group, fined Pounds 5m and released in February after serving just under half his 12-month sentence - are appealing against their convictions and sentences. Central to the appeals is what is claimed was Mr Justice Henry's misdirection of the jury on section 151, which makes it an offence for a company to give financial assistance for the purchase of its own shares. Defence counsel complain that the judge withdrew the section 151 charges from the jury after leaving it with the impression that there had been unlawful breaches of the section in an illegal share support operation mounted by Guinness during its 1986 takeover battle for Distillers. Mr Michael Sherrard, QC, for Mr Ronson, said the dishonesty posited by that direction tainted the other charges of theft and false accounting, which related to the payment by Guinness of indemnities and success fees to share supporters. Miss Montgomery said the jury must have considered the question of the defendants' honesty in relation to the other charges on the assumption that they had acted dishonestly in relation to the section 151 matters. Mr Anthony Shaw, for Mr Saunders, said the judge had described the section 151 charges as the prosecution's fallback position. In fact they and the Theft Act charges had been 'mutually destructive alternatives'. The prosecution could either establish that Mr Saunders had authority to bind Guinness, and so establish the section 151 charges, or that he lacked such authority, and so establish the theft and false-accounting charges. Mr Shaw said he would not after all be applying to introduce fresh medical evidence on Mr Saunders' appeal against conviction but only on the appeal against sentence. It had been suggested that Mr Saunders' symptoms were similar to those of a depressive illness, of which evidence had been given at the trial, Mr Shaw said. The appeals continue today.</p>

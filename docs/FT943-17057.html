			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / NZ surplus 'is beginning of virtuous circle' New Zealand recorded a budget surplus of NZDollars 527m (Pounds 201m) in the year to June 1994, its first since 1978 and the start of what Mr Bill Birch, finance minister, called the start of a 'virtuous circle'. As a result of the painful economic reforms of the past decade, New Zealand would now reap the benefits over the coming years, he said. 'The stronger growth we now have creates more jobs, which increases taxes, and the surpluses we will achieve will be used to repay debt, leading to stronger growth.' The surplus was a big improvement on the projected deficit of NZDollars 2.3bn forecast by the Treasury in last year's budget, although this was revised to a deficit of NZDollars 1.4bn last November. The improvement is due to higher-than-expected tax receipts as the economy grew faster than predicted at about 5 per cent of gross domestic product. This led to a rise in employment of about 86,000. Corporate earnings were up sharply, as many companies came to the end of tax loss, and started paying full tax. The government also kept a tight rein on its spending, while social welfare costs remained at a low level after the cuts of 1991. Mr Birch forecast that the budget would show a surplus of Dollars NZ730m in 1994-95, rising to Dollars NZDollars 2.5bn in 1995-96 and NZDollars 4.5bn in 1996-67. He said this would allow tax cuts. Meanwhile, New Zealand would have to continue to show restraint and the emphasis would be on repaying overseas debt. The better economic times meant the government was able to start repaying a 'social dividend' for those who had been hurt hardest during the reform period. Mr Birch said he would be spending an extra Dollars NZ450m over the coming year in various social welfare areas.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Essex man reflects anti-Labour mood - Council Elections LABOUR lost ground across southern England last night, surrendering seats to the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. Essex man delivered the most spectacular rebuff to Labour: the Tories won all 15 seats up for grabs in Basildon (one third of the council), and took control. Large swings also occurred in Milton Keynes, Welwyn Hatfield and Brighton, where Labour lost eight seats to the Tories but narrowly held control. Labour also lost control of Cambridge, where it won the Commons seat in the general election. Mr Bryan Gould, MP for Dagenham and a Labour leadership candidate, put a brave face on the party's poor showing, blaming 'voter fatigue', particularly among Labour supporters. No elections were held in London yesterday, but a BBC projection of the results across the whole region put Labour third behind the Liberal Democrats in share of the vote  - with only 21 per cent. However, Labour retained control of far more councils than the Liberal Democrats, and held areas such as Crawley, Harlow, Reading, Slough and Watford, all of which returned Tories in the general election last month. Liberal Democrats took comfort from gains in Bath, Portsmouth and Eastbourne  - which they lost in the general election. The Tories went some way to healing one self-inflicted wound by defeating rebel Tories in West Oxfordshire whose defection two years ago presaged the downfall of the poll tax  - and, indeed, its authoress. Earlier in the day, the Tories hailed the defection of a Labour councillor in Berkshire, saying it had been the second such defection since last month's general election. Mr Cliff Rayner, formerly a Labour member of Berkshire county council, joined the Conservative group, giving it exactly half the 76 county council seats, and increasing the prospect that the party can win back the council. Labour's attempts in Liverpool to shake off its problems with Militant backfired as its vote was split and the Liberal Democrats made 10 gains out of 34 seats contested, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. The Broad Left, fielding 22 candidates against official Labour ones, won only one seat. The Liberal Democrats, who were defending eight seats, ended the night with 18. Labour remains the largest party on the council but the numbers of seats are finely balanced. Labour has 40 seats, Liberal Democrats 37 and the Broad Left 18.</p>

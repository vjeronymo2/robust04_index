			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: AMP premium income slips to ADollars 8.2bn AMP Society, Australia's biggest insurance group, lifted the value of its total assets to ADollars 70.2bn (USDollars 54bn) in 1991, from ADollars 63.6bn a year earlier, but total premium income fell slightly. Mr Ian Salmon, managing director, announced a fall in total premium income to ADollars 8.2bn, from ADollars 8.5bn, despite a 36 per cent rise in the first full-year contribution from UK-based Pearl Assurance, acquired early in 1990 for ADollars 1.2bn. AMP's share portfolio, Australia's largest, rose in value to ADollars 30.1bn from ADollars 22.9bn, but the value of property holdings fell to ADollars 9.7bn from ADollars 11.8bn. Mr Salmon appealed to the Federal government to stop what he described as 'piecemeal changes' to superannuation policy. He said AMP had reduced costs by about ADollars 130m in the latest year and planned further savings.</p>

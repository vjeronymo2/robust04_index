			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim al-Amin] </F>   [Excerpt] Senior officials and government and party circles  in Lebanon have again been turning their exclusive attention to  the current negotiations with Israel under the auspices of the  United States. The failure of U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher's new tour heightened their interest further.  Christopher obviously leaned toward the Israeli viewpoint, which  is based on the following sequence: normalization, security,  and withdrawal. Syria insists on a comprehensive solution and  on the implementation of the international resolutions in a way  that secures the reverse order: withdrawal, security,  normalization.    In this regard, visitors quoted a senior Syrian official as  saying that the peace process is still faltering and that the  direct U.S. position is now more biased toward Israel. Some  White House circles, added the official, are working to disavow  the agreement reached between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill  Clinton in Geneva early this year, and various types of pressure  are increasingly being applied to make Syria, Lebanon, and  Jordan give in to demands for separate peace deals in which  Israel emerges as the stronger party.    The senior Syrian official stressed that Damascus cannot  accept the U.S.-Israeli proposals but will not try to obstruct  the negotiations. The Arabs should not try to stop this process  although it is crippled and running into major trouble, the  official said. Syria, he added, is preparing to confront every  form of pressure that Israel, together with the United States  and some European allies, may apply to force Syria to change its  position.    The senior official recalled before his Lebanese visitors a  conversation he had with a medium-level U.S. official and  political delegations. The foreign delegations asked about  Syria's strengths that make it reject the Israeli proposals and  resist political pressure. The delegations also asked how Syria  could face the possibility of war after the collapse of the  Soviet Union and China's failure to emerge as a new superpower.  They wondered how Syria could face that possibility when the  Arabs are walking away from it and the Palestinians are going it  alone in normalizing ties with Israel. The American delegations  also cited the deteriorating economic situation in the region in  general and in the Gulf in particular and the terrible collapse  of the political, popular, and official Arab positions that  Syria used to support.    The Syrian official said he told his American interlocutors  that war does not make peace and that Israel's traditional power  does not conceal its weakness in other ways. He said he  reminded the Americans of the Vietnam war. Although the  balances of power were in favor of the United States, the  Vietnamese people achieved a victory, one that still represents  an inferiority complex for the Americans. A more vital example  is formed by events in Lebanon in the past decade. Although  U.S., European, and Israeli armies occupied most of Lebanon's  territory, the popular resistance scored formidable victories.    The senior Syrian official added: With its current economic  situation, its reasonable stock of foodstuffs and energy, and  its relative self-sufficiency in the area of health, Syria can  hold out for years under pressure. The extensive development  plans will make Syria even stronger in the next few years--and  this is apart from Syria's conventional military power not being  as weak as many imagine.    The official stressed that Syria can face a great deal of  economic, political, and military pressure and does not find  itself compelled to offer new concessions on any level.  [passage omitted]</p>

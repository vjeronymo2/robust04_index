			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Main candidates chosen for Eastleigh Labour yesterday named its candidate for the Eastleigh by-election, completing the line-up of hopefuls from the main parties for the seat formerly held by Mr Stephen Milligan. The Labour candidate is Ms Marilyn Birks, 42, a further-education lecturer, who chairs the Eastleigh constituency Labour party. The Conservative candidate, Mr Stephen Reid, is a data processing manager and leader of Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council. He is defending a majority of 17,702. The by-election follows the death of Mr Milligan last month. The seat is widely expected to fall to Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat, a civil engineer and former local councillor. He came second with 21,296 votes at the 1992 general election. The party holds nearly half the seats on Eastleigh District Council, and recently won the last Conservative seat on Hedge End Town Council, in the heart of the constituency. The Liberal Democrats overcame similar large Conservative majorities to win by-elections at Newbury and nearby Christchurch last year. The Eastleigh by-election is one of five expected to be held in the next two months. The other four  - one in Rotherham and three in east London  - are regarded as safe Labour seats. The government is likely to hold the by-election on May 5, the date of local elections across Britain.</p>

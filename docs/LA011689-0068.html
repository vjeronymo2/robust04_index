			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUALITY OF CORPORATE, MUNICIPAL BONDS ERODED IN '88, FIRM REPORTS  </P> <P> The overall quality of both corporate and municipal bonds declined in 1988, a  credit-monitoring firm has said.  </P> <P> Based on preliminary data, a record 386 corporate bond ratings were lowered  last year, representing $171 billion of debt, according to Standard &amp;  Poor's Corp. The previous record was the 364 downgrades in 1986.  </P> <P> Conversely, 261 corporate bond ratings were raised last year, representing $158  billion in debt, S&amp;P said in a report released Friday. The number of  upgrades in 1988 far surpassed the old high of 188 in 1987, it said.  </P> <P> The number of ratings is greater than the number of companies issuing bonds  because differing types of bonds issued by the same company receive separate  ratings, S&amp;P said.  </P> <P> Several leveraged buyouts and recapitalizations, especially in the retail  industry, accounted for some of the lowered ratings, S&amp;P said.  </P> <P> Notable upgrades included Texaco Inc., Mobil Corp. and Ford Motor Co., which  together accounted for $42 billion of debt.  </P> <P> The company said a negative trend continued in the ratings of debt offerings of  financial institutions.  </P> <P> In municipal bonds, S&amp;P said large declines in the quality of housing,  utility and hospital issues more than offset positive trends in general  obligation and airport, port and college revenue bonds.  </P> <P> The firm said it lowered the ratings on 266 issues representing about $23  billion of debt, while it raised the ratings on 112 issues equaling about $17  billion of debt.  </P> <P> In 1987, 269 municipal issues representing about $16.5 billion in debt were  downgraded, while 153 ratings on $25 billion in debt were raised.  </P> <P> The number of municipal bond issues increased in 1988 as the market recovered  from the federal tax reform act, S&amp;P said. A total of 2,094 issues were  rated last year, of which 82 were taxable. In 1987, 1,817 issues were rated,  including 70 taxables.  </P></p>

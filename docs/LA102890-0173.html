			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROTESTERS BLOCK MOSCOW TANK DRILL  </P> <P> Local officials joined protesters Saturday to block tanks rehearsing for the  Nov. 7 Revolution Day parade in Moscow, the Soviet daily newspaper Izvestia  reported.  </P> <P> The demonstrators jumped in front of the tanks as they drove down Moscow's Ring  Road, which had been cleared of traffic for the overnight rehearsal.  </P> <P> One man, Lev Shemaev, a leader of the radical Moscow Voters' Assn., lay down in  front of the column of tanks. Neither he nor anyone else was hurt.  </P> <P> A Moscow military commander ordered the demonstrators to clear the road,  Izvestia said. They did so after about half an hour.  </P> <P> "We cannot put up with tanks rolling in Moscow," Alexander Osovtsev, a member  of the Moscow City Council, told Izvestia. The protesters also included  deputies from the Russian Federation parliament, the report said.  </P> <P> The radical Moscow City Council has refused to finance the capital's parade  this year, leaving the Soviet national Parliament to provide the money.  </P> <P> Revolution Day, which celebrates the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, is the most  important holiday on the Soviet calendar.  </P></p>

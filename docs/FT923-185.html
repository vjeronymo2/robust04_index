			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Brittan warning to energy sector: Brussels may force open markets THE European Commission will not fight shy of using special powers to open up EC energy markets to greater competition, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, warned yesterday. Sir Leon's comments were the first formal indication since the French referendum on Maastricht that Brussels will continue to challenge public monopolies, despite sensitivity about how such attempts might be interpreted by national governments. The Commission's controversial plans to liberalise energy markets are based on a gradual approach, with the eventual aim of giving users the ability to buy gas and electricity from anywhere in the EC. Proposals to push through directives without the approval of member states - using special powers under the EC treaty - were shelved last year, and even the watered down proposals have met strong opposition from energy producers. But Sir Leon told a Forum Europe symposium on energy liberalisation yesterday: 'We want to go forward and are prepared to use those powers if it proves necessary.' Brussels commissioners could face a more immediate test of their mettle today, when they are due to debate the long-awaited policy paper on liberalisation of the telecommunications sector. Publication of the paper - which proposes to open up cross-border telephone calls to competition - was delayed in July because of political sensitivity about the measures, particularly in France. EC officials said that the paper might still be withdrawn from today's agenda. Alternatively, it could be discussed, but not published. 'I tend to feel they (the commissioners) won't want to push it to a vote,' said one official. Commissioners will decide today whether to allow Du Pont of the US and Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK to swap chemical assets, or whether to impose strict conditions on the deal, as recommended by Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner, writes Andrew Hill. The deal would involve ICI swapping its nylon interests for Du Pont's acrylic business and Pounds 250m in cash. Under the plan proposed by Sir Leon, Du Pont would have to give up 12,000 tonnes of its annual capacity in nylon carpet fibre to a competitor. This third party would 'share' a Du Pont factory, as well as related research and development facilities and staff.</p>

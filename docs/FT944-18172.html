			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Japanese group to lift EU output Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese vehicle maker, is considering expanding production at a plant it is building in the Netherlands as a joint venture with Volvo of Sweden. This follows a decision by the European Commission to allow more Japanese vehicle exports to the EU. Mitsubishi Motors and Volvo will begin production of smallcars at Netherlands Car next year, to reach an annual capacity of 200,000 by 1997, Mitsubishi said. In the past year, the company has seen a decline of about 10 per cent in exports to Europe, which it blames in part on the sluggishness of the market and the strong yen. It aims eventually to make locally up to half the cars it sells in Europe. Michiyo Nakamoto, Tokyo. Fiat Auto plans to produce a small car similar to the Uno in Brazil for South American markets. Fiat will invest L1,000bn (Dollars 642.7m), mostly at its Bel Horizonte plant, to produce 1,000 units a day or 250,000 a year by 1996. AFX, Paris FLS Industries of Denmark, the leading global supplier of cement mills and machinery, said its US unit, Fuller, had won an order worth about Kr400m (Dollars 67m)to supply a 7,500 tonne-a-day production line to the Indian company Sanghi Industries.

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE: THE CARE AND ROASTING OF THE CORNISH HEN  </P> <P> There are a couple of points to bear in mind: Never salt the hens until after  they're cooked, because they may toughen and dry. And unless the hens are  accompanied by a cover-up sauce, you'll need to brush them with a browning  glaze.  </P> <P> ROAST CORNISH HENS  </P> <P> WITH MUSHROOM-  </P> <P> BULGUR PILAF  </P> <P> 1 cup coarsely chopped mushrooms  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1 cup bulgur  </P> <P> 1 3/4 cups chicken broth  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> 1/3 cup coarsely chopped pecans  </P> <P> 2 (1 1/2- to 2-pound) Cornish hens  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons liquid gravy browner mixed with 3 tablespoons water  </P> <P> Place mushrooms in butter in paper-towel-covered, microwave-safe 2 1/2-quart  casserole. Microwave on HIGH (100% power) 2 minutes. Add bulgur and broth.  Cover with casserole lid and microwave on HIGH 4 to 6 minutes until small  bubbles appear at edge of casserole.  </P> <P> Stir lightly, re-cover and microwave on MEDIUM (50% power) 9 to 10 minutes,  without stirring, until almost all liquid is absorbed. Let stand, covered, 5  minutes. Mix in salt, pepper and pecans.  </P> <P> Loosely stuff body cavities of hens, allowing 1/3 cup stuffing for each, then  skewer openings shut. Place remaining stuffing in lightly buttered 6-cup  casserole. Cover with foil and set in conventional oven set at 300 degrees.  </P> <P> Arrange hens, breast-side up, at least 1 inch apart in microwave-safe  bake/roast pan with drumsticks toward center. Brush each bird with gravy  browner glaze. Microwave hens, uncovered, on HIGH, allowing 6 to 8 minutes per  pound (combined weight). When legs move easily in hip sockets and juices run  clear, hens are done.  </P> <P> Brush hens again with browning glaze, then let stand, uncovered, 5 minutes  before serving. Accompany with remaining stuffing. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> CORNISH HENS  </P> <P> WITH BLACK  </P> <P> CHERRY SAUCE  </P> <P> 2 (1 1/2- to 1 3/4-pound) Cornish hens, halved lengthwise and wing tips removed  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 (1-pound, 1-ounce) can pitted dark sweet cherries, undrained  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon lemon juice  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons cornstarch blended with 2 tablespoons cold water  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons dry Port or Madeira wine  </P> <P> Dash black pepper  </P> <P> Brown hens, skin-side down, 2 minutes in 2 batches in heated butter in large  skillet on top of stove over medium-high heat. Transfer to microwave-safe  11x8x2-inch casserole, arranging skin-side-up, with meatiest parts toward  outside.  </P> <P> Cover with wax paper and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 15 to 20 minutes,  rearranging at half time, until hens are tender. When legs move easily in hip  sockets and juices run clear, hens are done. With slotted spoon, lift hens to  heated serving dish and sprinkle with salt. Cover with foil and let stand while  making sauce.  </P> <P> Skim fat from casserole. Strain liquid through fine sieve and reserve. Drain  cherry liquid into microwave-safe 2-cup measure and add enough reserved liquid  to total 1 1/4 cups.  </P> <P> Stir in lemon juice and cornstarch paste. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 3 to 3  1/2 minutes, whisking at half time, until sauce boils and thickens. Stir in  wine, pepper and cherries and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 1 minute. Spoon  some of sauce over birds and pass rest separately. Makes 4 servings.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG BEAT  </P> <P> Claudia Puig's puff piece, "Music to Someone's Ears," details how demographics  were molded to make a case for dumping the classic KFAC. Given the bottom-line,  throwaway mentality at work here, it sounds more like a dismal demonstration of  demonographics.  </P> <P> As if the air in Los Angeles isn't bad enough already, the Texas-based  Evergreen Corp. is now pouring its noxious audio fumes into our cultural  atmosphere.  </P> <P> Let's hope the grandiose pipe dreams of those who now own and run KKBT lead to  their speedy demise in a medium already up to its ears in noisome offal. It  would serve these carpetbaggers right.  </P> <P> ED JAMES  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

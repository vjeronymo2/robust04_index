			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (12): A paper mountain - India / Naazneen Karmali discusses antiquated procedures Inadequate custodial capacity is a significant road block to foreign portfolio investments in India's stock markets. The value of such investments, which have been permitted by the Indian government since January 1993, were Dollars 2.75bn at the end of September 1994. While this figure represents only a small percentage of the total market capitalisation of Dollars 100bn, it is expected to increase steadily. It is estimated that portfolio investments and Euroissues by Indian companies would amount to Dollars 6bn-8bn by March 1995. The number of foreign institutional investors registered with the Securities Exchange Board on India (Sebi), the regulatory authority, has increased from 136 to 229 since January this year. The entry of these large investors has put tremendous pressure on the few banks that provide custodial services. They find that their sophisticated systems cannot deal with India's antiquated settlement and transfer procedures. Transactions are heavily paper-oriented and require physical delivery of shares. Each share certificate has to be individually signed along with a transfer deed. What makes it more cumbersome is that marketable lots are small. The Bombay Stock Exchange, for example, which accounts for 70 per cent of the trading in the secondary market, recognises lots no larger than 50 or 100 shares. 'The problem in India is that there's paper, paper and more paper,' says Steve Page, senior manager securities services, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. 'It is a retail system that finds it difficult to cope with the demands of wholesale investors.' Last December, when foreign portfolio investment touched Dollars 1bn, custodians were overwhelmed by the masses of paper flooding through their doors. Confronted by a huge backlog in processing, they imposed strict trading limits on their clients. New business was turned away. To cope with the increased workload, custodians have been building capacity by hiring more vault space and staff. Hongkong Bank and Citibank, the two biggest providers of custodial services to foreign clients, have more than doubled capacity. Mr Page says that Hongkong Bank's vault space is 200 per cent larger and the number of people in his department has increased from 40 to 180. Some work has also been sub-contracted out. All this has only been enough to meet the demands of existing clients. Trading limits have been revised upwards, but still exist. Custodians are not open for new business as yet. Mr Page says that there is a direct correlation between the number of shares and the number of people necessary to process them. The infrastructure costs of a custodial service in India are inordinately high and have kept other custodians away. Now service providers are slowly entering the market. Deutsche Bank began operations last month and ABN Amro has announced that it will be in business shortly. Standard Chartered Bank's Equitor Group began in a limited way last week. It now concentrates on servicing a small group of 15 important clients. The banks put a bar code on every share certificate to track it at every stage of processing. Colin Beattie, regional head of custody, south Asia, says: 'We had to put such innovations in place before we reached a critical level. Bringing off-the-shelf systems are not any good for Bombay. Indian banks and financial institutions such as the Unit Trust of India and the Housing Development and Finance Corporation, are keen to establish custodial services. The State Bank of India, the country's largest public sector bank, has opened a securities services branch in Bombay that is custodian to some offshore, country-dedicated funds. The custodian with the largest capacity is the stock Holding Corporation of India, a company launched by Indian financial institutions in 1988. It could take on more business but is constrained by its small capital base of Rs210m from seeking foreign clients. The corporation's custodial assets of Dollars 23bn belong to domestic mutual funds and Indian financial institutions, Last year, it processed transactions worth Dollars 2.3bn and Mr R. Chandrasekaran, managing director, expects business of Dollars 5bn this year. He says that by the third quarter of 1995 a new depository will be constructed near Bombay with a capacity to hold 350m share certificates. This will have an automated storage and retrieval system on a par with international standards. The corporation is keen to collaborate with a global custodian as that will allow it to take on foreign clients. Morgan Stanley is a possible partner. Foreign custodians believe that solving problems is at best a temporary measure and does not address the more systemic issues. One way forward, they have suggested, is to introduce institutional board lots of 1,000 or more shares. While the idea finds favour with Sebi, fund managers and brokers have been resisting it. They fear that their holdings would become illiquid and this would result in the additional headache of having to split large certificates into smaller ones. To ease the paperwork, custodians were earlier allowed to introduce jumbo transfer deeds that covered each transaction. Companies have also begun issuing jumbo share certificates, though the Bombay Stock Exchange does not accept these as good deliveries. Sebi has recently approved the proposal that custodians trade institutional board lots between themselves. This would bring down the risk factor relating to bad deliveries which amount to 20 per cent at present. Delays in settlement, which occur eight times out of 10 would get eliminated. Mr Page says that in a few cases, shares are rejected by registrars and have to be sent back to the brokers. This increases risks to investors who have to wait six months before shares are registered in their names. A two-tier market would reduce problems all around. Custodians say that if the institutional market does kick off then it would lead to a paperless trading system and a central securities depository. The government is expected to introduce legislation on a central depository by the year end. The option of multi-depositories, one for each region, is also being considered. The stock-holding corporation would like to be appointed as central depository and is working towards it. Fund managers do not expect this to happen quickly.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Petro Symonenko, people's deputy and first </F> secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee, by  Yakiv Halchenko; place and date not given: "Communists Are Not  Going To Stop the Fly-Wheel, Yet..."]    [Text] [Halchenko] You are probably pleased with results of  the Ukrainian legislative elections?    [Symonenko] Basically yes, because we received 86  legislative  seats. However, there are other statistics. More than 10  million voters supported the bloc of leftist forces --  communists, socialists, and peasants -- which is, you should  admit, a large figure. Still, we are not euphoric.    At the same time, I would like to refute claims that  Communists brought pensioners into parliament. The average age  of the Communist deputies is 45. Only one is 60 years old. For  the most part, however, these are mature, able-bodied, dynamic,  and educated people, with vast life experience, who are ready to  tackle important state issues. All of them know what the  communist idea of old communists was all about and what they  should come up with today.    [Halchenko] With what intentions will you, as communist  deputies, participate in sessions of the newly elected Ukrainian  Supreme Council?    [Symonenko] We understand very well that very serious and  hard work awaits us in the Supreme Council. One needs to do a  lot of things which the old parliament failed to do. It stands  to reason that everything will depend on how constructive the  deputies' work will be. This is why we, the Communists,  actively participated in the preparations, and have focused our  efforts on resolving certain issues before the session formally  begins. From the very beginning, we want to show that instead  of idle chatter, the Supreme Council should engage in  constructive work and search for optimal solutions for emerging  from the crisis, with due regard for differences of the regions,  social groups, and everything affecting each voter, each of us.    We also understand that people who voted for our  representatives wanted to recover the social protection  guarantees they had when real communists were in power. This  makes us feel especially responsible. However, we realize very  well that it is extremely hard to resolve all the problems that  face us. We count on constructive work with all political  forces and representatives of various industries in the Supreme  Council. We will seek to find understanding of problems and a  correct way out of the situation that has taken shape.    [Halchenko] Still, are you going to raise political issues  or  will you focus on resolving state and economic issues?    [Symonenko] We see adoption of a new Ukrainian constitution  as the main political issue today. We will do our best to  encourage citizens to actively discuss the constitution and  advise the deputies as to what political system or, say,  national symbols our state should have. People should be  consulted on all important issues. This is a question of a  long-term perspective. Today, we should be guided by the  current Constitution, with all its changes and amendments, and  work on a new one.    We believe that economic problems need to be tackled from  the  very first session of the Supreme Council. After all, without  an economy, no one can even talk about Ukraine's independence  and sovereignty. Incidentally, this is something that Ukrainian  President L. Kravchuk has repeatedly emphasized. I am sure  there are millions of unemployed in our country right now.  Every effort must be made to boost production. Taxation  policies should be urgently brought in line with the interests  of manufacturers. The financial and credit system needs to be  revised, especially interest rates of the banks. The state  should reassume one of its major functions -- managing the  country's economic activities. We are for restoration of links  with Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and other republics of the  former Soviet Union. Only here we can find the market. It is  no use to look for it in the West, and one should stop fooling  the people in this regard. The Supreme Council should make a  decision on entering the CIS. No associate membership will ever  save us -- we will not be treated as an equal partner.    If the people support privatization, laws should also be  revised. If privatization, a change of ownership forms, does not  encourage production, one should find out why. We, the  Communists, are often criticized for our alleged opposition to  privatization. But we simply cannot approve of this wild  privatization. Many people buy out property through dummy  fronts, lining their pockets and cashing in on the national  wealth. Others are ready to sacrifice all of Ukraine. Instead  of canceling privatization, we should see who has what goals,  what legislation was approved, and why it prevents the staff of  a privatized enterprise from becoming its real owner.    [Halchenko] What is your attitude toward market reforms?    [Symonenko] There are neither market relations nor the  market  itself in our country. It is a different thing, however, that  some want to pull out their "idee fixe" -- to enter a formation  of a new social quality. Our position is: transition to the  market is a lengthy process. Under the slogans of  demonopolization and privatization, we want to implement the  theoretical goal pursued by the market -- manufacturing  competitive products.    There is no market in its pure definition in any country of  the world. State policies are everywhere. They are used as  guidelines for crafting a certain program that is financed by  the state and regulates those processes. In our country,  everything was farmed out to a certain circle of wheelers and  dealers.    [Halchenko] Will you uphold statehood of this country or  will  you press for a return to the Soviet Union? Many of our  readers, Ukrainian citizens, are worried about this.    [Symonenko] In our program, we have written: everything  should be done to make Ukraine prosper and develop. We see this  as our objective, because we realize that even though all Soviet  peoples formally achieved some political and economic  independence after the Soviet Union's breakup, life has become  worse. This is why we stand for a union of equal states. We  understand that this, too, is a lengthy process. At the initial  stage, we will uphold the principles of economic and defense  unions. And the process itself is the people's will.  Communists call upon peoples of the former Union to live in  peace, accord, friendship, and equal material conditions, so  that they help each other and preserve familial relations, as  they did in the past.    [Halchenko] What do you think about the Socialist Party?  Will your two parties remain united in tackling key issues for  the country?    [Symonenko] We have no disagreements with the Socialists.  All efforts to drive a wedge between us are in vain. This is  an attempt to split the entire leftist bloc. I am deeply  convinced that it will not succeed.    [Halchenko] What about the "Center" group?    [Symonenko] I have already felt the intention of setting up  two directions, which is a condition for setting up two centers  -- one of L. Kuchma and other of the Supreme Council leadership.  The Interregional Bloc for Reforms comes up with its own  program. Not everyone supports it. We are for a situation  where the parliament works in spite of all blocs and groups.    Of course, there are questions on which we cannot  compromise.  This is an issue of land issue. During examination of this  issue, we will say that the land is the people's property and  can by no means be sold or purchased. This is a fundamental  issue. We will reject opposite approaches. While some propose  wild capitalization today, we say: there should be national  state property. Private property is working property. If you  can sew or produce something, go ahead.    [Halchenko] In other words, you are for different forms of  property?    [Symonenko] Yes. But private property should only be working  property. The current private property is all distorted.  Governing structures and their heads are currently being bribed  and degraded. Hence comes the corruption, and this entire  vertical chain of command works not for the Ukrainian people,  but to line their own pockets. This is why not only we, but  also all working people protest against these kinds of  commercial activities. We say it straightforward: a parasitical  group has appeared that is making capital. We stand against  this kind of commercialization of our state.    [Halchenko] Are communist deputies going to raise a question  of revising any economic laws -- on privatization, for example?    [Symonenko] You cannot do everything in one fell swoop. If  the fly-wheel is wound up, its huge momentum cannot be stopped  right away. This is why everything needs to be examined, and  only then can one make a decision. The stalling of a number of  laws can only worsen the paralysis. Our main goal is that all  reforms must be reexamined with due consideration of the  interests of all people, and not of the 10-15 percent who are  pleased with those laws.    We will comply with the Constitution, which provides for  setting up parliamentary commissions. We will join them and  meet with the electorate, working teams, and consult with  experts; and only after that, we will propose revision of  specific legal acts. None of us will rattle the saber, as some  try to make it out. We will clearly and resolutely carry out  policies legally, in the interests of all people.</p>

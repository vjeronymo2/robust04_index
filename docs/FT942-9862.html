			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Refined taste for raw materials: FT writers examine the factors behind the recent surge in world commodities prices For much of the past five years, the coffee trading pit at the London Commodity Exchange has been a quiet backwater away from the hurly-burly of the bond futures and equity markets. But no more: with coffee futures prices rising by up to Dollars 150 a tonne over the past week, financial investors have proved eager to gain a foothold in a rapidly rising market. Coffee is not alone in attracting increasing investment activity this year as world commodity prices begin to recover from their recent depressed levels. Coffee has staged the most noticeable rise, with the futures price - at which buyers contract to buy beans at a set price at a set time - increasing by close to 60 per cent since the beginning of the year. But it is not alone. Copper has risen nearly 20 per cent since January and crude oil by 25 per cent since mid-February. The surge in the sector has pulled up prices for other commodities as diverse as aluminium and palm oil. The commodity price index of Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, which tracks movements in 20 commodities, has risen by 6 percentage points so far this year though, within the materials covered, there are wide fluctuations. Soaring commodity prices indicate that demand is picking up for the basic raw materials which are used in many industrial processes, from car panels to beverages. The strength of the markets is an early pointer to an improving world economy. But a jump in prices can often herald a return of inflationary pressures. However, it is too early to judge whether current price rises will contribute to global inflation. It takes about a year for rises in commodity prices to feed through into the underlying rate of retail price inflation as manufacturers first use up stocks bought when prices were lower. Further, prices are heading up from extremely low levels. Metals prices were at their lowest in real terms last November. Coffee prices have been depressed for five years and hit their lowest point since 1974 two years ago; oil prices are still Dollars 3 lower than this time last year. Price levels, particularly for oil, will thus have to go much higher before they have any significant effect on inflation. The likelihood of this happening is slim, according to observers. The surge is patchy: not all commodity prices are rising for straightforward supply and demand reasons and some are vulnerable to sharp price corrections because they have risen so fast. Seasoned market watchers are wary of drawing broad inferences from the upturn and concluding that raw materials will soon be in short supply. 'People are seeing a few commodities go up and taking it as a sign of a concerted bull market, but that's wrong: what we've got is a series of coincidences,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodity researcher at GNI, the London broker. Coincidences such as lack of available supply of coffee and oil, and rising demand for industrial metals such as copper, have convinced some investors that now is the time to buy all commodities. In addition, the increasing presence of large-scale buyers such as private, speculative US hedge funds, and pension funds can sometimes exaggerate price movements. 'Supply and demand fundamentals spark the initial rise and then you have all this hot money looking for a home,' said Mr Neil Bresolin, executive director of commodities at Goldman Sachs. Much of the activity by pension and hedgefunds is triggered by computer programmes which follow market trends. They often pay scant attention to data such as stock levels which can reveal the underlying health of a market, but are devised to generate short-term profits. This is one reason why metals prices in general have risen by an average of 20 per cent since the beginning of the year, even though warehouses used by the London Metal Exchange around the world are stacked with stock - and aluminium can be seen stored outside in car parks and on docksides. Generally, high stock levels of metals depress prices since they indicate that supplies are abundant. Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, and a director of the LME, said hedge funds too readily overlook the fact that prices 'are determined by the interplay of supply and demand, rather than by either side of the equation alone'. While such funds alone do not determine price rises, once markets are on the move they can push prices higher and generate a spiral which affects other commodities, Mr Eagles said. To some extent crude oil prices have experienced this effect, after having bucked the rising price trend in other commodities markets this year. Oil prices fell late last year as Opec production exceeded demand. The overhang of stocks was eventually reduced by exceptionally cold weather in the US earlier this year. The latest price rebound partly reflects a sharp rise in purchases by US refiners - and also the activity of hedge funds. But in spite of a big percentage increase in the price, oil at about Dollars 16 a barrel for the benchmark Brent Blend is still well below the Dollars 19 level this time last year. Many observers expect prices to firm gradually over the remainder of the year, but in the absence of a big supply disruption there appears to be little scope for further sharp surges upwards. Overall, world oil inventories are relatively high, while oil companies are uniformly cautious, with few executives expecting an early return to prices above Dollars 20 a barrel. Mr David Simon, chief executive of British Petroleum, indicated that BP would be happy with prices in the Dollars 18 to Dollars 20 a barrel range over the long term. The story is different in the coffee market, where speculative trading is not responsible for driving prices higher. Instead companies such as Nestle are scrambling to snap up beans to rebuild supplies. Five years of poor prices have seen a cycle of neglect set in on the world's coffee plantations, where producers have regularly let beans rot in the trees as it was not economic to harvest them. This practice has been coupled with steadily rising demand so that, as production began to drop off, consuming countries started to use up high stock levels. Low production has been exacerbated by a retention scheme set up by coffee-producing countries last October. The Association of Coffee Producing Countries decided to withhold up to 20 per cent of exports from the world market until the price rose to 85 US cents a pound. That level has now been reached and countries are considering releasing the 4m bags they have in store. The release of stored coffee will help to alleviate current shortages, but even with this extra coffee, supply is likely to remain constrained. Producers are beginning to plant more trees to try to reverse the deterioration in some of their plantations but it takes five years for a newly planted tree to yield a crop. The reason for the rise in coffee prices is, therefore, something of an exception to the current trend. Other commodities are rising on more speculative trading. When such temporary investors switch attention elsewhere, prices could fall sharply. 'Some time later this decade, we are likely to get a significant commodity bull run, but we're not there yet. We've got to see large drops in stock levels of most commodities worldwide before that happens,' said Mr Eagles.</p>

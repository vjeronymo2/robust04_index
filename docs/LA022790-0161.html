			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ALL DAY-O WAITING FOR LUGGAGE  </P> <P> Even stars have to wait for their luggage in airports. Just ask Harry  Belafonte.  </P> <P> Belafonte arrived Sunday at Indianapolis International Airport for a lecture as  part of Black History Month.  </P> <P> The globe-trotting singer-activist spent more than half an hour waiting for his  luggage.  </P> <P> "It's like this all over the world," he said with a laugh. "There are a lot of  people standing around, so I guess I'm safe -- so far."  </P> <P> The 62-year-old performer nearly went unnoticed by people passing through the  airport, but Jayne Hale of Oxford, Ind., recognized him and had him autograph  an airline menu.  </P> <P> "He was going strong when I was young," said Hale, 48. "I wasn't sure that was  him until I heard him speak."  </P> <P> But then, she has an eye for celebrity. On a flight earlier Sunday, she had  singer Tom Jones sign the same menu.  </P></p>

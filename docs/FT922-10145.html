			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: More colourful tax forms TAYPAYERS CAN expect simpler and more colourful forms from next year to ease the burden of calculating how much they owe the Revenue. The language will be simpler and clearer, the instructions more helpful, and the lay-out designed to help people fill in the blanks with figures as painlessly as possible. The basic personal tax return forms - P11, 11 (for the self-employed) and P1 (the simplified return) - are likely to be ready by the next tax year, in April 1993. Four others, including one for mortgage relief, are already coming into use. The Revenue launched a programme in spring last year with help from Wolff Olins, the design consultancy firm, to review more than 700 different forms it produces, including tax forms, instructions and advice slips. Bernie Hepplewhite, head of customer services in the Revenue's corporate communications office, says the main reason for the change is to help taxpayers by making the completion of their returns 'as undaunting as possible'. In addition, it will help save costs and make life easier for Revenue staff. 'There used to be a belief in the old bureaucratic tradition of the Civil Service that if people filled out the forms incorrectly, they were daft,' he says. 'Now we realise it's more likely that it's the forms that are daft.' He stresses that the Revenue has re-designed its documents on a less ambitious scale several times and has won Plain English awards for leaflets and forms. The new forms is more use more colour (orange and blue on white in the latest prototypes) to make them look brighter and more up-to-date. They are laid out in vertical columns, to provide a logical flow of information. The language has been simplified, the volume of notes on the form increased, and the questions follow a consistent sequence across the different forms.</p>

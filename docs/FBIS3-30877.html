			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Feb 8 (CTK) -- Slovak Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar said that attempts to remove him as the leader  of the government and of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS) are aimed at causing the HZDS to split and thus allow the  opposition political parties to fill in the space.    In an interview for today's Slovak government daily  REPUBLIKA, the prime minister also accused President Michal  Kovac of discussing the creation of factions in the governing  HZDS.    The prime minister was reacting to considerations that the  path towards the establishment of a broad government coalition,  which Kovac urged in his New Year's speech, could open up with  the HZDS's atomization and Meciar's dismissal from the posts he  currently holds.    "The attack now being waged against me," said Meciar, "has a  slightly different background than before. It is following a  line that, in case of elections, the HZDS without Meciar would  be a less dangerous partner or would not be dangerous at all.  What is also being reckoned on is that a possible removal of  the HZDS chairman would facilitate the creation of a number of  factions. The split of the movement, which now represents a  real political force, would in fact provide a space for the  Democratic Left Party (SDL) or would help improve the position  of the Christian democrats," Meciar said.    In his opinion, the creation of factions or the split of the  HZDS parliamentary group cannot be initiated from the outside.  "I am sorry," said Meciar, "that Mr. President (Kovac) is  negotiating this issue with some deputies and recommending  specific alternatives." At the same time, Meciar gave assurances  that the HZDS is a viable and democratic institution, which  "will decide what to do by itself."    Meciar also disagreed with "financial oligarchy" and  "powerful money" replacing human values. "You can see that  attacks against me are launched mainly from the circles of the  nouveaux riches. It is no use to hide it. The contacts and  links of many politicians to various interest groups are so  big," said Meciar, "that I do not know whether they always act  only out of their own will."</p>

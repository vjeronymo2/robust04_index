			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REFLECTIONS: 'I'M WHAT'S CALLED AN ECOIST, A PERSON WHO BELIEVES IN WORKING FOR  THE SURVIVAL OF ALL SPECIES, NOT JUST THE HUMAN SPECIES.'  </P> <P> Retired financier Norman Roberts, 68, once occupied a seat on the New York  Stock Exchange and founded his own brokerage. In San Diego, he has been a local  Republican Party mover and shaker since 1963 -- working on campaigns, going to  the Republican National Convention three times as a delegate and serving as the  San Diego County chairman for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign. But  the license plate on the Jaguar XJS parked outside Roberts' La Jolla home tells  of his true avocation: "NATRLST." Times staff writer Leslie Wolf interviewed  Roberts and Kenneth Lam photographed him.  </P> <P> </P> <P> I was born in San Diego and graduated from Hoover High School. My grandparents  on both sides of the family came to San Diego at the turn of the century.  </P> <P> I think I was 7 when I took my first trip down to Baja California. It was  pretty primitive then. I have been going down there ever since.  </P> <P> I enjoyed Baja so much that I decided to write a natural history of the  peninsula. I wrote about the reptiles first, and then I did the mammals, and  then the birds. But those manuscripts are not published because nobody wants to  buy them. Then, I decided I'd go with the plants. I have a degree in veterinary  medicine, so I had learned something about plant physiology and poisonous  plants in college.  </P> <P> My book, "A Field Guide to the Common and Interesting Plants of Baja  California" was first published in 1975. It turned out to sell pretty well, I  sold 10,000. I'm doing the final work now on an updated version, which should  be out in June or July. It will have a different cover and will be almost twice  as large, with 336 pages and 315 color photos.  </P> <P> I spend a lot of my time with the plants when I'm down in Baja, but I run into  a lot of people as well. I've met the mountain people, who are very reclusive  but very friendly. Most of them are descended from the families of soldiers who  came with the missionaries in the 1700s.  </P> <P> They use the agave a lot, which we call the century plant. The agave has a  stalk, which it puts up once every 25 to 30 years. They cut down the stalks and  roast them for a couple of days until it's tender enough to eat. They also dig  out the center of the agave and eat the leaves off.  </P> <P> They eat the barrel cactus, too, by breaking off the spines and scooping out  the insides with a machete. The inside is very fibrous but has a lot of water  in it. Sometimes it's pretty sweet. The exciting one to eat is the pitaya  cactus. The fruit is about golf-ball size, and it's red and it's delicious. You  can make great daiquiris with it.  </P> <P> California is getting very crowded, so Baja is a perfect place to get away to.  Besides the beaches, there are wonderful places to camp in the deserts and  mountains. It's a wonderful outlet for Californians and others who want to take  a primitive vacation and enjoy nature as it is rather than nature as it has  been tampered with by humans. There's just so much that people don't realize is  there . . . but sooner or later they will.  </P> <P> When I wrote the first book on plants, I estimated there were 10,000 people who  went to Baja consistently. Now there are about 50,000, and that estimate may be  conservative. Ultimately, Baja California will be ruined by people.  </P> <P> What's happening right now in Cabo San Lucas is they don't have any water, and  as a result they're having salt water infiltration in the fresh water. They're  continuing to build new condos on the cape, and the runoff from the mountains  is nowhere near enough to help them. Their only hope for getting water is  saline conversion, and that's very expensive. Until that happens, they're  heading for disaster.  </P> <P> I'm what's called an ecoist, a person who believes in working for the survival  of all species, not just the human species. I believe other species in the  world should live, because, when they die, we die.  </P></p>

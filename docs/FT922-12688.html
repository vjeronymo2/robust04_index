			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Letter: Open rather than free markets Sir, Bryn Jones (Letters April 15) gets it nearly all wrong in his critique of David Willetts' perceptive and clear article (April 13). Conservatives believe in open markets which are not the same as free markets (see Adam Smith). The essential target of good marketing is a satisfied customer. That is the Majorite Conservative objective and the Majorite Conservative/Citizen's Charter approach to improving education, the health service, the railways, local government etc. It may not be so cosy for those who are on the payrolls of these organisations. But that is what it is about. David Willetts understands this. Bryn Jones evidently does not. Humphry Crum Ewing, 63 Baker Street, Reading RG1 7XY</p>

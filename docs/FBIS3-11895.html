			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Marcelo Pontes: "Lula's Attempt To Isolate PT </F> Radicals"]    [Text] Luis Inacio Lula da Silva has a very peculiar  formula for escaping the moorings of the orthodox PT [Workers  Party] bureaucracy and its radical ideas. "I feel that we must  come up with a government program that is not `principlist,'"  says Lula.    The dictionary does not record the jargon used in PT  assemblies, but Lula provides the translation: "It is right for  a party to defend its principles, but in economics, the right  program is the one that is feasible."    A better translation is that Lula will defend the PT's right  to keep its dogmas but that when the time comes to formulate a  government program, the party will not be able to prevent him  from adapting those principles to the realities of the country  and those facing someone who needs to expand his range of  alliances in connection with the election of a president of the  republic.    In other words, it does the PT no good to put its ideal--its  dream of a revolutionary rupture--down on paper because if it  does come to power, it will do so not by force but by the free  will of the voters. The party must come down to the real world  and propose a government program that can actually be carried  out with the broadest possible support from society.    The foreign debt is a good example. The PT's outline of a  government program claims that when Lula becomes president, he  will decree a moratorium. The majority of the party's leaders  may even be conscientiously convinced that that is the best way  to deal with all foreign debt owed by Third-World countries. But  they will be demonstrating political blindness if they try to  impose that formula in the conditions now prevailing in Brazil,  which is making an effort to come to terms with the  international financial community.    Lula even says that "the foreign debt cannot be looked at  today the way it was in 1980, when there was an oil crisis and  interest rates rose from 6 to 21 percent." And he adds a basic  economic fact for consideration by the PT's orthodox members:  "There is a commercial debt, and Brazil must pay it."    The treatment Lula is imagining for the foreign debt is  political and, therefore, much broader than a simple choice  between the two solutions of pay or no pay. He recognizes that  every $1 billion leaving the country and going to creditors is  money taken away from the fight against poverty. But instead of  refusing to pay, he is thinking about uniting Brazil and the  debtor countries in a bloc that will negotiate with the creditor  countries. "You are going to argue using the political strength  you have," Lula says.    He feels that if they unite, the Third-World countries will  be strong enough to persuade their creditors to reduce their  debts. "Didn't they reduce Poland's debt by 50 percent? Why  don't they do the same for the other countries?"  <H5>  Magnifying Glass </H5>   Lula likes to say that the PT's internal disagreements are  viewed with a magnifying glass. "The problems are smaller than  they are depicted as being," he says.    According to him, the uproar over the government program  arose because a draft program had been made public even before  it was reviewed by the party's Executive Committee. The  Executive Committee is scheduled to meet on the 17th to approve  the program.    The program will then be distributed for broad debate until  the PT holds its national meeting on 30 April and 1 May, when  Lula's candidacy will be made official. At the same time, Lula  wants to open the program up for debate with the other parties.    Concerning the disagreements with the PT's federal bloc in  Congress, Lula says that the Executive Committee has not been as  hard on the bloc as has been reported. He points out that the  Executive Committee authorized the bloc to vote for the  Emergency Social Fund which Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso  needed so badly.    "The problem is that in constitutional revision, people are  just going through the motions. There are important things that  the bloc should be participating in, but the conservatives have  set a steamroller going to approve everything they want. There  is no way that the bloc is going to support that and pretend  that it is democracy," Lula says.  <H5>  Stalled </H5>   On the day when the Executive Committee meets to approve the  PT's government program, Lula will start another of his  caravans. He will tour Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and  Parana through 4 March.    Like everyone, he feels that the presidential race is sort  of  confused. "The fact that Quercia is a candidate again proves  that the Right has not yet found someone. If it cannot find  someone, it will do what it did with Collor: choose one to be  anti-Lula," says Lula.    The PT candidate does not believe that Antonio Britto will  be  the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] candidate.  "Getting elected requires a little professionalism. The big  professional in the PMDB is Quercia, who controls the party  machinery and a lot of money," he says.    Lula practically rules out the possibility of an arrangement  with the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]: "They are  expecting Fernando Henrique's star to rise. His economic plan  may actually work out two or three months from now, but it will  not make up for the losses it is causing."    To those who belittle his chance of winning the presidential  election on the grounds that he has stalled in the public  opinion polls, Lula responds with a smile: "Comical. I am at 30  percent. It is more likely that I will reach 50 percent than  that the runner-up will reach 30 percent. They only say that  Lula has stalled at 30 percent. No one is saying that Brizola  has stalled at 7 percent, Maluf at 12 percent, and Sarney at 10  percent."</p>

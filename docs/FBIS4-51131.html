			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 21 (CNS) -- China will start  construction on some 70 local railway lines across the country  in a decade to come measuring a total length of 7,000 kilometres.    The railway items which will be carried out in 12 provinces  and municipalities have already been included into the Ninth  Five Year Plan period which will lie between 1995 and the year  2000. There were 81 local trunk railway lines across the  country as of 1993 which ran for a total length of some 4,800  kilometres in 17 provinces, municipalities and autonomous  regions while nearly 20 others measuring a total length of 2,000  kilometres are now under construction.    Work on railway lines in localities proceeded at the  greatest  pace during the past ten years with the track laying of trunk  lines measured 2,460 kilometres. The gross spending was valued  at nearly RMB [renminbi] 4.6 billion, of which RMB 4.1 billion  was local capital while the Ministry of Railways accounted for  RMB 440 million.    The so-called local railway lines are constructed with the  use of capital shouldered by local governments which make them  different from the state level railway lines. Local governments  are either partly or fully responsible for the running of the  railway lines. Local railway lines which have already been part  of China's transport network have seen their development and  construction planning included into the local as well as the  state level programmes.    China has in recent years formulated a number of measures to  speed up construction of railway lines in a bid to alleviate the  tense state of railway transportation. Those measures included  encouragement given to local governments to raise capital for  the building of railway lines. Some preferential practices were  available such as the setting of transportation charge by local  governments, exemption of revenue tax, allocation of steel for  railway track replacement without payment and subsidiary loan  specially for local railway lines.    The central government also encouraged local governments to  bring in foreign capital to construct railway lines. The World  Bank, the Asian Development Bank, some Japanese financial groups  and Taiwan offered capital to fund some local railway lines  which are now under construction. Six local rail lines are  ready for introduction of foreign investment for construction.    State level railway lines rose from 22,000 kilometres since  1949 to 54,000 kilometres at present, a gain of some 30,000  kilometres. Among them there were 41 rail lines running for a  total of 3,100 kilometres which were handed over by local  governments to the state for management, some of them became  trunk lines.    Local rail lines will cover a gross length of over 8,000  kilometres across the countries and the handling capacity will  reach 100 million tonnes by the year 2000. [sentence as  received]</p>

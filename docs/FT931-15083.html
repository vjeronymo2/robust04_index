			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Pakistan fails to live up to expectations in 1992 - Economic problems remain Pakistani equities are expected to remain under pressure during the first quarter of this year, after a disappointing performance in 1992. In the first two weeks of 1993 the Karachi Stock Exchange index has recovered some ground on good company earnings forecasts, having ended 1992 some 26 per cent down on the year. Yesterday the KSE closed 5.95 lower at 1,256.57. In the first quarter of 1992 the market saw a strong rise amid expectations of improved economic growth and expansion of business activity after the government had announced new incentives to encourage fresh investments. Better than expected growth in cotton production also fuelled projections of improved profits in textiles. This strengthened textile shares, which comprise almost one-third of the market's 622 listed companies. But the buoyant trend which opened the year was quickly overtaken by reports of new taxes in the budget, large-scale damage to property and the cotton crop in last summer's floods, and fresh signs of political uncertainty. Although the government remained committed to large-scale privatisation and economic liberalisation, flood-related damage, estimated to cost Rs50bn (Dollars 2bn), overshadowed the prospects for development. This also raised new concern over spending which the government had earlier promised to reduce in line with targets recommended by international financial institutions. Political problems also weighed on sentiment. Concern over a split between the MQM (Mohajir Qaumi Movement), a regional ethnic party in Karachi, the country's commercial capital, and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government last summer led to fears that the administration had become more vulnerable to opposition-led attacks. The combination of economic and political difficulties brought about the largest fall in the market during the third quarter when the KSE index dropped 269.3 points between July to September. A campaign of street protests organised by the opposition alliance of Benazir Bhutto in November also kept prices depressed. Many brokers and investors now say that they are looking for new signs of strong business confidence before seeing fresh large-scale buying. But others are confident that, in spite of the downward trend, the KSE has become an important emerging market as market capitalisation grows and volume increases. Over the past 20 months equity market capitalisation has shot up to approximately Rs202bn from Rs104bn. 'In the last 20 months, the capital that has come in is equivalent to the market capitalisation of the previous 40 years,' says Mr Amin Umer, former vice-president of the KSE, who finished his tenure last week. He expects the index to reach the 1,400 level by the end of the first quarter in 1993 which, he says, would be an accurate reflection of share values. Another broker, Mr Nasir Bukhari, argues that while the index is not likely to rise significantly in the next couple of months, interest from foreign investors indicates the market's growing importance. He notes that the recent rise in market capitalisation includes a Dollars 300m investment from overseas institutions in response to foreign exchange reforms allowing free repatriation of capital and profits. Investors have also been encouraged by financial sector reforms during the past two years, but are cautiously awaiting fresh signs of economic recovery. One broker comments that reports that the public sector deficit for the year is expected to rise beyond the target of Rs65bn has raised new concern. 'Many investors and brokers want to know if the economy will remain trouble free, and if stocks such as textiles will grow, before making new commitments.'</p>

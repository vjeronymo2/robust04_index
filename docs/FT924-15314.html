			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Guyana's election rivals quarrel over divestment GUYANA'S presidential election gets under way today, placing the future of the country's major bauxite and sugar industries in the hands of the 385,000 registered voters, writes Canute James in Georgetown. The two long-time rivals contesting the presidency hold opposing views on the economy, particularly the divestment of state-owned economic enterprises. The People's National Congress, led by Mr Desmond Hoyte, the president, says it will continue its four-year-old divestment programme which plans to sell the economically important sugar industry. Dr Cheddi Jagan, leader of the main opposition People's Progressive party, has said the divestment of all state companies by the PNC administration will be reviewed if he wins the election. Dr Jagan says a PPP administration will have no obligation to any earlier divestment agreements.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Martin Hacthoun] </F>   [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- In what Ottawa views as "a  new page in its relations with Cuba," on Monday, Canada restored  economic aid to the island as part of its humanitarian foreign  aid program and to foster development.    The decision was simultaneously announced in the Canadian  capital by Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet and in Havana by  Christine Stewart, minister of state for Latin America and  Africa, who today concludes a two-day visit to the island.    While Stewart was meeting a full agenda of interviews with  ranking Cuban Government officials, in Ottawa, Foreign Minister  Ouellet announced the resumption of official economic aid to the  Caribbean island.    "The Cold War is over. The time has come to turn a new page"  in relations with Cuba, Ouellet said in reference to the  resumption of aid, which was suspended in 1978 when Cuba  provided military aid to Angola in response to South Africa's  aggression.    Despite that decision, ties between the two states continued  to develop, and they were expanded in 1989 when the two  countries decided to undertake a political dialogue with an  exchange of official visits.    According to the announcement, Canada will grant Cuba  $360,000 to feed the children this year and $720,000 in 1995.    Last night, Stewart inaugurated an international  businessmen's conference on business opportunities in Cuba. The  conference, which was sponsored by the magazine THE ECONOMIST,  was attended by more than 120 executives from Canadian, British,  U.S., European, and Latin American firms.    Earlier, Stewart had discussed the development of bilateral  relations, particularly economic relations, with Cuban Vice  President Carlos Lage and other ranking officials, including  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; National Assembly President  Ricardo Alarcon; Ernesto Melendez, minister president of the  State Committee for Economic Cooperation; and Jose Luis  Rodriguez, minister president of the State Committee for  Finance. A source from the Canadian delegation also confirmed  to PRENSA LATINA that the minister of state also held a special  meeting with President Fidel Castro.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Eduardo del Rey, spokesman  for the Canadian Foreign Ministry and a member of Stewart's  entourage, stressed: "This is an important moment in the  relationship between Cuba and Canada," which is based on  "frequent and honest dialogue." Rey added that the goal of  Stewart's visit is to broaden those ties and promote Canadian  investments.    At the inauguration of the businessmen's conference, Stewart  said her government supports increased investments in Cuba, not  only because it will contribute to Cuba's development, but also  because Canada will benefit.    Stewart expressed the Canadian authorities' resolve to  encourage an even greater flow of capital to the island, where  Canada currently carries considerable weight in foreign  investments in the mining sector. Canada does not only exploit  traditional nickel deposits, but it also has recently been  involved in prospecting for gold, lead, and copper, as well as  exploring for oil deposits. Furthermore, Canada is the leading  source of tourists to the island, where every year more than  120,000 Canadians enjoy their vacations.</p>

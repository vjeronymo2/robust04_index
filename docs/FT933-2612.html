			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pessimism over economic package depresses Nikkei PESSIMISM over the effects of the government's economic emergency package depressed sentiment, and the Nikkei average lost 2.1 per cent on profit-taking and arbitrage unwinding, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average fell 445.64 to 20,502.15 as investors sold ahead of the economic package's release after the market closed. The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 20,938.69 but weakened as doubts over the package mounted. The index dropped to the day's low of 20,501.95 just before the close. Volume totalled 261.2m shares, against 305m on Wednesday. Declines overwhelmed advances by 867 to 173, with 137 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks retreated 23.24 to 1,657.09. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 Index eased 0.03 to 1,268.82. Investors focused on gloomy news regarding the economy, and were discouraged by the annualised 2 per cent negative growth of GNP during the April-June quarter, announced on Tuesday. Speculation that the emergency package lacked measures which would have an immediate effect on the economy also disappointed market participants. Meanwhile, some institutional investors liquidated their portfolios to boost profits ahead of the September book closing, while the fall in stocks prompted margin liquidation by individuals. Profit-taking hit steels. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, fell Y10 to Y336 and NKK lost Y3 to Y282. Banks were lower on index-linked selling. Industrial Bank of Japan weakened Y30 to Y3,460, Sumitomo Bank Y60 to Y2,270 and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Y30 to Y1,460. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which had been higher on hopes about government investment in telecommunication infrastructure, shed Y15,000 to Y891,000. The stock fell below the Y900,000 level for the first time since July 28, as the likelihood that the plan would be included in the package diminished. Electric power companies lost ground in spite of the higher yen. The emergency package is expected to include measures to pass on the benefits of the high yen to consumers through a reduction of electricity and gas prices. Tokyo Electric Power slipped Y60 to Y3,420 and Kansai Electric Power Y50 to Y2,850. Shochiku, the movie production and distribution company, was one of the few bright spots of the day, rising Y20 to Y1,280 on reports that it would team up with Sega Enterprises, the video game company, to develop new multimedia software. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 248.06 to 22,715.91 in volume of 80.6m shares. Roundup THE LARGER markets on the Pacific Rim weakened yesterday. HONG KONG fell sharply on disappointment over the latest round of Sino-British talks. The Hang Seng index dropped 70.66 to 7,418.11, fin-ishing just 10 points above the day's low. Turnover was HKDollars 2.9bn. Among blue chips, HSBC declined HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 81, Hutchison Whampoa lost 30 cents to HKDollars 23.10 and Jardine Matheson shed HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 62. Brokers said property issues were hit hard on the uncertain outlook for real estate. Cheung Kong fell 30 cents to HKDollars 27, HK Land dipped 30 cents to HKDollars 17.10 and Sun Hung Kai Properties was down 25 cents at HKDollars 38.25. SEOUL declined for the third consecutive session in a day of lacklustre trading and the composite stock index finished 5.05 down at 686.39 in turnover of Won205.2bn. TAIWAN continued to fall back but closed off its intraday low. The weighted index, which had dropped more than 40 points at one stage, closed a net 17.09 off at 3,765.01, its lowest finish since February 11. Turnover was TDollars 11.3bn. MANILA advanced on heavy buying of blue chips and secondary issues and renewed interest in mines. The composite index rose 23.57 to 1,975.73. Turnover shrank to 593.8m pesos from Wednesday's 1.4bn pesos. Rises outscored falls by 84 to 22. AUSTRALIA remained weak, but with attention concentrated on Amcor, up 35 cents, or 4 per cent, at ADollars 9.24, following its announcement on Monday that it is to buy the paper manufacturing and distribution assets of North Broken Hill Peko for ADollars 415m. The All Ordinaries index closed 1.0 lower on balance at 1,902.6, after opening 6.8 up. Turnover amounted to ADollars 373.3m as the golds index jumped 52.4 to 1,796.2 after bullion prices improved.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Kabul welcomes Russian minister Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, arrived in Kabul yesterday on a mission intended to help heal the wounds of Afghanistan's 14-year war, Reuter reports from Kabul. He was greeted by representatives of the mujahideen who fought Soviet troops for a decade. He congratulated them on having thrown off 'communist totalitarianism' by toppling the once Soviet-backed government of president Najibullah last month. He made a plea for the release of Russian prisoners of war believed to be held by Afghan guerrilla groups since Soviet troops withdrew in 1989. Later, he won a promise that one Soviet prisoner of war would be able to leave with him for Moscow today. The prisoner was not identified.</p>

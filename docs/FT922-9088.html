			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Markets (At a glance): Housing market still gloomy Hopes for a quick recovery to the housing market still look far off as lending for house purchases continues to reveal a steady decline. Quarterly figures released this week were described by the Council of Mortgage Lenders as 'very subdued.' They show that net new lending by banks, building societies and other financial institutions for house purchases dropped in the last quarter to Pounds 4.6bn compared with Pounds 5.4bn in the last quarter of 1991. The Halifax house price index, also released this week, fell by 0.4 per cent last month. The building society said that, 'even adjusting for seasonality, the trend in house prices also remained weak.' UK house prices are now 5.5 per cent below this time last year.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ONCE-FAVORITE SON OF ORANGE COUNTY GOP;  </P> <P> EX-CANDIDATE'S PROBATION FOR FORGERY ENDS QUIETLY  </P> <P> The final chapter in one of the most bizarre political cases in Orange County  history comes to a close today as the 6-month probation of former Irvine City  Councilman C. David Baker, once a shining prospect in the local Republican  party, officially ends.  </P> <P> Baker, 36, has performed in excess of 500 hours of community service for  forging a $48,000 check during his failed bid for Congress last year. In  September, Baker pleaded guilty to one count of felony forgery. But Orange  County Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown later reduced the charge to a  misdemeanor, ordering Baker to perform an unspecified amount of community  service and placing him on probation.  </P> <P> With the court's receipt of letters confirming that Baker had fulfilled his  community service sentence, the probation order signed by the judge formally  expires today. Baker was not disbarred as a result of his legal troubles, and  he is reportedly considering several opportunities to practice law again in  private industry.  </P> <P> Since November, friends and associates say Baker has carried out his sentence  with an almost religious zeal. He has served hot meals to the elderly, coached  basketball at the Downey high school where he once starred as a student  athlete, and worked as an adviser and business strategist for a nonprofit  Irvine youth group.  </P> <P> Although Baker is described as happier and more outgoing these days, close  friends say privately that it may take him years to overcome the events that  last summer cost him his job with a prestigious law firm, a $400,000 lakeside  home in Irvine and a promising political future.  </P> <P> "Sure Dave has come a long way back from where he was a few months ago," said  one longtime friend and political ally in Irvine. "But nobody will ever know  how far gone Dave really was. At one point, he wasn't sure he wanted to go on."  </P> <P> Baker's life began to unravel in the final days of last June's Republican  primary in the coveted 40th Congressional District. He was the early favorite  in the race to replace six-term incumbent Rep. Robert E. Badham (R-Newport  Beach).  </P> <P> Badham, who retired, endorsed Baker, as did a number of other prominent local  GOP activists, giving the former UC Irvine basketball star a significant edge  in the primary. A primary victory would have been tantamount to winning the  seat because the district has one of the highest concentrations of Republicans  in the nation.  </P> <P> Despite the support of prominent Republicans and local officials, Baker found  himself locked in an unexpectedly tight race as the primary drew to a close.  With his campaign reportedly short of cash, Baker forged the signature of an  Orange County Superior Court judge on a $48,000 check, which was written on the  account of a local, nonprofit foundation that Baker headed at the time. Baker  made the check out to himself, signing it with Judge David G. Sills' name, as  well as his own.  </P> <P> Baker stopped payment on the check shortly after it was written.  </P> <P> When Sills and a handful of close friends discovered the forged checks just  days before the election, Baker admitted himself for hospital care for  depression and exhaustion. But his hospitalization was known to only a few, and  it was not until after the primary, which he narrowly lost to Newport Beach  attorney C. Christopher Cox, that news of the forged checks and Baker's  hospital stay surfaced.  </P> <P> Throughout the ordeal, Baker has steadfastly declined to talk about the  incident and its impact on his life.  </P> <P> Baker could not be reached for comment this week about the end of his  probation, and on Thursday, his attorney, Paul S. Meyer, declined to comment on  his client or to discuss Baker's plans.  </P> <P> What is known about Baker, based on court records and interviews with friends,  is that he immersed himself in his community service work. He served hot  lunches for Meals on Wheels in Irvine; helped coach the varsity basketball team  at Warren High School in Downey, his alma mater; and worked for American Kids  Sports Assn., the nonprofit arm of an Irvine-based youth sports organization  founded by former Olympian Bob Mathias.  </P> <P> Under terms of his sentencing, Baker was allowed to choose his form of  community service, but he could not be compensated for the work.  </P> <P> At Kids Sports, Baker served as a legal adviser and business planner for the  fledgling group, whose aim is to build self-esteem for children ages 5 to 12  through sports. One of its major events is an international Olympic-style  sporting competition for children scheduled for August in Tijuana.  </P> <P> Baker served as a liaison between the group and Mexican officials to help  arrange the event, said Chuck Foster, an executive with Mathias' operations.  Politically well connected, Baker also helped the group raise money, Foster  said, introducing officials of Kids Sports to prominent community leaders.  </P> <P> "We wanted to reach the right kind of people, to get them out and introduce  them to Bob Mathias' programs," Foster said. "Dave proved to be a vital link."  </P> <P> Baker was described by Foster as a "hard worker" who often labored through the  night. "There were times we'd leave the office late at night, only to return  the next morning and find Dave asleep in his chair or on his desk," Foster  said.  </P> <P> Foster believes that Baker "plunged into his work" to forget his troubles.  </P> <P> "Anytime that you have gone through something that is difficult, immersing  yourself in something you like is helpful," Foster said. "And Dave loves kids."  </P> <P> That is one reason Baker apparently called his former basketball coach at  Warren High last fall and asked if he could assist with the team. In a letter  to Judge Brown, Baker said he wanted to return to Warren High because his own  "character and values were forged" at the school. Baker was student body  president and valedictorian at the school, as well as an All-American high  school basketball player.  </P> <P> The school's varsity basketball coach, Jan Young, said he believes that Baker  came back to "see old friends and rediscover where he came from." Raised in a  working-class family, Baker rose quickly professionally and financially, and in  some ways, had taken his success for granted, Young said.  </P> <P> "Whatever Dave does in the future, I don't think he'll forget his roots this  time," said Young, a coach at Warren since the early 1960s. "Dave got a lot  awful fast. Maybe too fast."  </P> <P> From the first day of practice in November through the playoffs in March, Young  said Baker commuted almost daily to Downey to attend practices and games.  </P> <P> "When Dave came to us, he was at the depths of his emotions," Young said. "But  gradually, he came around. He found acceptance here. It was comfortable, like  being at home."  </P> <P> Since last fall, home for Baker, his wife and two sons has been a small  condominium in Tustin. Despite reports during last year's campaign that the  couple's marriage was strained, friends say that Baker and his wife are closer  than ever. During the holidays, Young said, Baker wrote a song about his  problems and regrets, and sang it for his wife, Patricia, on Christmas Day.  </P> <P> To pay for legal expenses and other personal debts, the couple were forced to  sell their Irvine home near South Lake in Woodbridge.  </P> <P> However, he still owes more than $90,000 to a number of political consultants,  printers and pollsters who worked on his congressional campaign.  </P> <P> Baker's plans are unclear. Last week, Foster said, Baker left Kids Sports, even  though the group has talked with him about a full-time, paid position. Foster  said Baker is considering several options, including some opportunities to  practice law again.  </P> <P> John Nakaoka, who managed Baker's congressional campaign, said, "The fact  remains that Dave was a good attorney, who was good at bringing people together  and reaching a settlement. Maybe he could serve as some sort of private  arbitrator."  </P></p>

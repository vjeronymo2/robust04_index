			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Capital Markets: CME penalises trader after alleged frauds The Chicago Mercantile Exchange has disciplined a former employee of a member firm for alleged fraudulent trading on its Globex after-hours trading system. The case is believed to be the first involving US computerised futures fraud. A CME judicial committee found Mr Steven Tropper, a New York-based foreign exchange trader, had defrauded LIT America, a CME member firm, of about Dollars 11,000 between March and June of 1993. The exchange barred Mr Tropper from Globex, and banned him from working for any CME member or member firm for three years. He has paid Dollars 11,000 in restitution to LIT America, and was fined an additional Dollars 14,000. Mr Tropper agreed to the sanctions without admitting or denying the charges.</p>

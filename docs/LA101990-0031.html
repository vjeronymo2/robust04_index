			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. AFRICA ENDS NATAL PROVINCE STATE OF EMERGENCY  </P> <P> President Frederik W. de Klerk, meeting a key demand of the African National  Congress, lifted the four-year state of emergency in strife-torn Natal province  on Thursday and declared the way clear for constitutional negotiations.  </P> <P> With his action, the president also met one of the five conditions necessary  for lifting American economic sanctions against Pretoria. Only two conditions  remain: the freeing of political prisoners and the repeal of all apartheid  legislation.  </P> <P> "The door to (negotiations) is now fully open, and I am appealing to all  leaders and all South Africans to accept the challenge of this open door," De  Klerk said at a news conference in Pretoria.  </P> <P> Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's press secretary, said De Klerk's action was  "yet another important landmark on the road toward full normalization of  political activity in South Africa." He added, "We believe that President De  Klerk deserves credit for his political courage and leadership."  </P> <P> De Klerk said conditions in Natal have stabilized "to such an extent that the  ordinary laws of the land are again sufficient to enable the government to . .  . maintain public order despite continuing sporadic violence."  </P> <P> The province of Natal, on the Indian Ocean coast, has been racked by three  years of internecine warfare that has killed nearly 4,000 blacks.  </P> <P> The fighting, primarily among Zulus, has pitted supporters of Nelson Mandela's  ANC against those of Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. But  it has been fanned by the region's poverty, scarce resources and a housing  shortage that has forced tens of thousands of blacks to live in shacks without  running water.  </P> <P> The ANC and Inkatha began peace talks in Natal a few weeks ago, and both sides  report substantial progress.  </P> <P> For months, the ANC and relief workers in Natal have complained that the extra  powers granted the police under the emergency have exacerbated rather than  eased tensions in the region.  </P> <P> "We didn't think (the emergency) was necessary, except possibly to make whites  feel more secure," said Paul Graham, director of the Institute for a Democratic  Alternative in Durban. "We could well have done without it."  </P> <P> Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said he does not intend to withdraw any of  the several thousand police or troops in the region.  </P> <P> "We don't have enough policemen there now," Vlok said. "We need more to ensure  there's not another flare-up."  </P> <P> At least 26 people have been killed in unrest in Natal this month, including  six blacks who died in a bus ambush. Three white men, two of them right-wing  extremists, have been arrested in that attack.  </P> <P> The ANC, in a statement issued in Johannesburg, welcomed De Klerk's move,  saying it will help create a climate for free political activity and peace.  </P></p>

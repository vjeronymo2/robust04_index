Rejecting especially  remarks made by Premier Vaclav Klaus, the Council said they  expected Klaus to "apologize" at a CMKOS meeting due in April,  Jurina said. Klaus described the March 22 rally as a position  taken by a group of people, adding that essential Czech policy  questions are not decided at rallies but in parliament. The  former was possible in February 1948, but "is not possible on  March 22, 1994," Klaus said, referring to the 1948 Communist  coup. Jurina said that in pressing for its demands (for better  terms for workers), the council would "harden its attitude in  collective bargaining." He said the Council intended to hold  regional demonstrations, put pressure on employers and deputies,  and conduct its own public opinion surveys. CMKOS will also  adopt a stricter line on defending employees "affected by the  employment law," Jurina said, adding that the Council warned  union members against allowing themselves to be manipulated by  political parties as part of the political game. Union members  should "reject all attempt to be drawn into unpremeditated and  pseudo-radical actions," Jurina said.</p>

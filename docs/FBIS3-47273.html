The journal DE ANGOLA carried the part on national  reunification and the part on foreign policy from the New Year  address.    National Radio of Guyana broadcast the New Year address  three  times, saying that President Kim Il-song in his New Year address  described the victory of the Korean people last year as a  victory of the revolutionary line of the Workers' Party of  Korea, a great victory of the singlehearted unity of the leader,  the party and the masses.    The Mozambican paper NOTICIAS quoted President Kim Il-song  as  saying that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be  settled through DPRK-U.S. talks and that pressure and threats  will have no effect on the Korean people and may invite  catastrophe, far from achieving a solution to the problem.    Newspapers, news agencies and radios of Italy, Egypt,  Ethiopia, China, Zaire, Peru, Poland, Nigeria, Austria, Laos and  Yugoslavia reported the gist of the New Year address.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK'S FILM PICKS BY TIMES CRITICS  </P> <P> DEAD CALM  </P> <P> Phillip Noyce's 1989 thriller is a spare, smart, seductive piece of real  movie-making, with (almost) every loophole covered, a superlative cast  andandough tension to keep us all hyperventilating for hours. Sam Neill and  Nicole Kidman are on an extended South Pacific voyage when they cross paths  with insinuating Billy Zane.  </P> <P> Sunday 10 p.m., Wednesday 11:45 p.m., Friday 10 p.m. Cinemax  </P> <P> ZELIG  </P> <P> This is a sweet, piercing, startlingly inventive film, a little rueful around  the edges, in which Woody Allen fakes a documentary about one Leonard Zelig  (played by Allen), who in his meteoric moment in the public eye stood somewhere  between Charles Lindbergh and Babe Ruth. What emerges amid considerable  technical brilliance and wit is a rather distanced commentary about the perils  of living a life in a goldfish bowl.  </P> <P> Monday 10 a.m. KCOP Sheila Benson  </P></p>

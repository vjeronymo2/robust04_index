			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Leonarda Andino] </F>   [Text] With tears in his eyes, National Human Rights  Ombudsman Leo Valladares yesterday presented his "Preliminary  Report on Missing Persons in Honduras From 1980-93." The  report, which is subtitled "The Facts Speak for Themselves,"  claims the Honduran state, the Armed Forces, and the Nicaraguan  contras are responsible for the forced disappearance of people  in the country.    The much awaited report contains a provisional list of 184  disappearances. This figure is higher than the 143 forced  disappearances registered in the files of the Committee of  Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras (Cofadeh).    Although names of people directly involved in these horrible  crimes were not revealed, the ombudsman pointed out the  importance of the state's acknowledgment of the existence of  forced disappearances. So far, the Armed Forces and other  institutions have refused to grant access to their 1980-93 files.    Valladares said: "The ombudsman did not want to find what he  did as he reviewed the sad pages of our recent history. We  would have preferred to tell the country that there were no  disappearances. We would have preferred to report that  officials of state institutions were never involved in  disappearances."    In a melancholy tone, he added: "We would have preferred to  say that torture was never practiced in Honduras. Nevertheless,  the reality we discovered was terrible. Regrettably, there were  indeed disappearances, and, unfortunately, civilian and military  authorities were responsible or remained silent."    This is an important moment in my life, Valladares said,  after presenting the historic document that had been handed over  on the evening of 28 December to President Rafael Leonardo  Callejas and on the morning of 29 December to President-elect  Carlos Roberto Reina.    The most revealing part of the document contains the  ombudsman's recommendations. The report states that in the  country there were disappearances because there were people  willing to carry them out. It demands that justice officials  start an investigation to clarify the specific responsibility of  all those mentioned in the report as masterminds and  perpetrators of the disappearances.    Based on this, commanders or officers in charge of staff  intelligence units, known as the G-2, must be investigated.  Special attention must be given to those units in charge of  fighting subversion between 1980 and the present. The  commanders and officers of Intelligence Battalion 3-16 also must  be investigated. Others who must be investigated include the  directors of the National Investigations Directorate (DNI),  formerly known as Department of National Investigation (DIN).  Officers and people in charge of interrogation operations, such  as the Special Operations Team of Intelligence Battalion 3-16  and the so-called Special Investigations Detachment of the  Public Security Force (Fusep), must also be investigated.    As for Armed Forces Commander Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, who  was not in the country on 29 December and is accused by popular  organizations of having been the head of the fearsome Battalion  3-16 during the time of the disappearances, the ombudsman  pointed out that Discua, as a soldier, is obliged to publicly  explain his actions before the Honduran people.    Valladares said: "The facts speak for themselves.  Nevertheless, even though Colonel Discua Elvir was chief of  Battalion 3-16 and Mayor Juan Blas Salazar was DNI chief, we  should not presume they are responsible, because we are not  judges. The ombudsman conducted an investigation that he has  presented to the authorities, and they are the ones who should  implement the proper measures."    The ombudsman said he will place the report in the hands of  the state prosecutor, adding that the Public Prosecutor's Office  will be urged to act within a year of receiving the document.    Valladares added: "Forced disappearances were at least  tolerated, whether through action or silent neglect, by the  country's political and judicial authorities. There is evidence  of responsibility of members of the Honduran Armed Forces and  the Nicaraguan contras in the disappearances, especially in  cases involving foreigners."    The ombudsman praised the work done by Honduran media,  because they were the only media in Central America that  denounced the disappearances in Honduras.    As for the Judicial Branch, Valladares said it was  characterized by its failure to fulfill its duty of protecting  Honduran citizens. "The impunity of the authorities, in the  absence of an investigation, was a factor that fostered these  crimes," he added.    In his report, the ombudsman also makes a number of  recommendations to the Honduran state, including its duty to  recognize damages done to the victims and their families and the  need to grant reparations via a special commission. It also  recommends the creation of a central registry of arrested people  that would be under the Public Prosecutor's Office and would be  open to everyone. The report also calls for the approval of a  special law on those arrested, specifying their rights and  responsibilities.    Valladares pointed out that the Honduran state must ask the  governments of the United States and Argentina to provide  information on the identity of people who were working in the  country at the time of the disappearances, and, if need be,  locate and extradite members of the Nicaraguan contras.    It also recommends the establishment of a commission to  locate clandestine cemeteries and the construction of a monument  bearing the names of all those who disappeared as a symbol of  Honduras' vindication before the international community.    When asked whether he felt any pressure or fear, Valladares  said absolutely not. He added: "I actually met with silence  and have felt lonely. I have no fear. This is the truth. If  not being afraid is a crime, there is no hope for our country."</p>

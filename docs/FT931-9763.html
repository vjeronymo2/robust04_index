			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: CS Holding takes 19.2% stake in Swiss Volksbank CS HOLDING, the parent company of Credit Suisse, has acquired 19.2 per cent of the equity of Swiss Volksbank, for which CS made a SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.04bn) agreed takeover bid. CS said in its offer circular yesterday the shares were acquired after its bid was announced on January 6. The acceptance period began yesterday and ends on March 15. The basis of the offer is three CS registered shares for every 10 Volksbank registered shares. It is conditional on Volksbank winning approval at an EGM on March 11 to convert itself from a co-operative into a joint stock company and then converting each of its co-operative shares into 10 registered shares. The offer will then be conditional on receiving acceptances from holders of at least 70 per cent of the Volksbank shares by March 15. If the offer is successful, CS said it would seek to delist Volksbank securities from Swiss stock exchanges.</p>

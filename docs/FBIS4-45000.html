			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sabina Sehgal Saikia: "Dalai To Make Bangalore </F> HQ"]    [Text] Dharamsala, May 7.    The Nobel peace prize winner, the Dalai Lama, has decided to  shift his headquarters from the hill town of Dharamsala. In all  probability, the spiritual and temporal head of the Tibetans  will move his base to the outskirts of Bangalore. This decision  follows a spate of violence, arson and looting which the Tibetan  community in Dharamsala has been subjected to in the last  fortnight.    The Dalai Lama made his decision known when the former BJP  [Bharatiya Janata Party] chief minister, Mr. Shanta Kumar,  visited him at his residence in the presence of this  correspondent. Mr. Shanta Kumar apologised for the violence  which followed the death of a Gaddi youth at the hands of a  Tibetan. The movement against the Tibetans has, much to the  embarrassment of the BJP, been spear-headed by the party's local  MLA [member of Legislative Assembly], Mr. Krishen Kapoor.    Later, in an exclusive interview, the Dalai Lama expressed  his deep hurt at the manner in which the Tibetans had been  stone-walled by sections of the local community. "I am very,  very sad that an individual incident has, unfortunately, been  allowed to be manipulated by local politicians and this makes it  very serious," he said. "Perhaps in a small town, the presence  of a few thousand Tibetans is conspicuous. My presence here and  that of the central administration, too, makes the Tibetans here  stand out. To avoid a conflict becoming a major problem in the  future, it is best that I move out of Dharamsala," he said.    Expressing his deep gratitude to the Indian government for  providing refuge to almost 100,000 Tibetans (of which 6,000 live  in Dharamsala), the Dalai Lama, however, clarified that the  choice of Dharamsala as his base was not one taken by him out of  choice. "It was at the insistence of the Government of India in  1960, when I was informed that Mussourie was only a temporary  arrangement, that I shifted to Dharamsala with reluctance. I  have always been in favour of being closer to Delhi," he said.    He added that on every subsequent occasion when he had  attempted to move out of Dharamsala -- to Simla in the '60s and  later in 1988 when his community felt that earthquake-prone  Dharamsala was unsafe for him -- the local community had  appealed to him not to shift his residence. "But this time I  have been faced with a human earth-quake -- I think the time has  come for me to move and, if possible, I will move to Bangalore,"  he informed.    The decision of the Dalai Lama has taken the local Tibetan  community, and his government-in-exile, by shock. For many, this  has been their only home since their flight from Tibet almost 35  years ago. But, as the elderly Ms. Kunga whose shop was looted  and attacked by an unruly mob, points out, "I have never felt  more intimidated -- not even by the Chinese."    The situation in the hill-resort has remained tense despite  section 144 being revoked on April 27. While there has been no  fresh spate of violence against the Tibetans, every new day  witnesses a fresh turn to the current impasse. Just yesterday,  Dharamsala awoke to pamphlets strewn all over the  Tibetan-dominated McLeod Gunj area which screamed in Hindi,  "This is a special warning to all Tibetans. If you people do not  leave Dharamsala by July 25, we will bomb you out..." This is in  addition to a series of memorandums and resolutions which the  local politicians have been regularly signing asking for the  immediate expulsion of Tibetans from Dharamsala.    Despite this, the local administration refuses to accept  that  there is any cause for concern. The deputy commissioner, Ms.  Manisha Sridhar, when contacted, said, "I do not think that this  is a big issue -- it can easily be sorted out. I think that the  press has unnecessarily blown it up." While admitting the  incidents of arson, violence and looting, Ms. Sridhar, however,  felt that it would be unwise for her to make any immediate  arrests against those who led the mobs as it might aggravate the  tension. She informed that 14 reserves of police force had been  placed on duty as a precautionary measure.    The local politicians -- both Mr. Kapoor of the BJP and Ms.  Chandresh Kumari of the Congress -- remain vituperative in their  attack against the Tibetans, accusing them of everything from  drug and arms smuggling to being condescending and insensitive  to the local population.</p>

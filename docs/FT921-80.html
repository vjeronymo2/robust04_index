			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Lab-Lab pact - Ballot Box After a series of attacks by senior scientists on the government's science policy, the Tories seem to have written off the laboratory vote. Save British Science, the scientific lobby group, has held two election meetings  -one at Manchester University last week and another at University College London yesterday. Labour and Liberal Democrat science spokesmen were represented at both debates, but the Conservatives did not send a speaker to either, despite what the organisers describe as 'two weeks of letters and intensive phone calls to national, area and local Conservative organisations.' Derek Roberts, UCL provost and former GEC research director, opened the London meeting by attacking the Tories' 'pathetic' failure to attend. 'I had believed that what Kenneth Clarke (education and science secretary) lacked in understanding he made up in bravery,' he said to loud applause from a hall full of angry scientists. The Conservatives put in an appearance of sorts half way through, when a messenger brought in a fax from Alan Howarth, the minister responsible for science. 'I don't propose to read it out, if they can't take the trouble to come themselves,' said Roberts.</p>

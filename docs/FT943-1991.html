			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Embassy move puts Guatemalan spice trade on the rack - Why cardamom growers are worried about losing friends in the Middle East The Arab-Israeli conflict has never been of great concern to the poor farmers who live in the department of Alta Verapaz, about 100 miles north of Guatemala City. But the welfare of about 250,000 Keq'chi Maya Indians who produce more than two thirds of the world's exports of cardamom is in the balance following President Ramiro de Leon's decision to move Guatemala's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Mr De Leon said last week he was moving the embassy 'for sentimental reasons', an explanation that convinced no one. About 85 per cent of Guatemala's cardamom exports go to Arab countries, principally to Saudi Arabia where cardamom is mixed with coffee to produce gahwa, a pungent, aromatic beverage traditionally drunk out of a brass pot with an elongated curved spout. The rest goes to Europe, in particular to Scandinavian countries, where cardamom is used to spice bread and pastries. It is also used in confectionery. In the past when other Central American countries have moved their embassies to Jerusalem, Arab nations severed diplomatic relations and imposed economic sanctions. But Mr de Leon, who appears to have taken his decision without consulting either his foreign minister or economy minister, says he is confident that the mood of reconciliation in the Middle East will ensure that exports will not be put at risk. However, Jordan's embassy in Chile has already criticised the measure, and exporters fear that other Arab countries will follow. 'If the Arab countries impose a boycott it will be a disaster for us and the thousands of producers,' says Mr Rodolfo Rivera, director of the chamber of cardamom exporters. 'The cardamom has nowhere else to go.' Cardamom producers had been looking forward to a record harvest of 13,000 tonnes. Normally they would hope to sell to exporters for around 250 quetzales a quintal (about Dollars 44 for a 100lb bag) and for agricultural labourers who earn less than Dollars 2 a day cardamom has proved an important source of income. The cardamom bean, a small ovoid green capsule about 2cm long, once picked is then sorted by colour, mostly by women and children. The bigger and greener the better, says Mr Rivera. Revenue was expected to reach about Dollars 50m for the cardamom season, which runs from October to April. Dried, it fetches about Dollars 5 a kilogram, but the market is on hold until there is an official response from Saudi Arabia. The spice arrived in the impoverished region of Alta Verapaz about 30 years ago, thanks to a quirk of history. A German immigrant, the late Mr Jacobs, brought the seeds over from India where it is indigenous. He had tried unsuccessfully to grow the plant in the Caribbean but the conditions around Coban, the departmental capital, an important coffee growing region at around 4,500ft, proved ideal. It grows almost wild, needing very little attention or fertiliser, near the coffee plantations. Guatemala quickly became by far the largest exporter in the world, accounting for about 70 per cent of the export market. Exporters have accused Mr De Leon of bowing to pressure from the Israeli government to link economic aid and military assistance to recognition of Jerusalem. The charge is denied by both the Guatemalan army and the Israeli government. Israel has enjoyed strong links with Guatemala since its creation in 1948. It was the Israelis who stepped into the breach to provide military equipment and intelligence training after the US cut off military aid to Guatemala in the 1970s because of its horrific human rights record.</p>

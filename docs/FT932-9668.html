			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Czechs to allow transfer of shares to Slovakia THE CZECH government has decided to allow the transfer of shares in privatised Czech companies to Slovak investors, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, said yesterday, reversing an earlier controversial decision not to hand over the shares. The shares were acquired by Slovak investors during last year's mass voucher privatisation before Czechoslovakia was split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia on December 31. Prague surprised investors in March by announcing that it would not hand out shares due to Slovak investors because of a dispute with Bratislava over the financial assets of the former Czechoslovak state. Mr Klaus then said the shares would be held as security against Czech government claims for compensation from Slovakia. The decision enbittered relations between the two countries, and the dispute over assets has still not been resolved. The move proved controversial and it caused widespread unease among domestic and foreign investors who had until then regarded investment in the Czech Republic as safe from political attacks. Large private investment funds were particalularly upset as it meant the long-awaited distribution of the shares was to be postponed indefinitely. After several delays the shares were to be distributed in April, and the funds have been waiting eagerly to start trading their shares. Czechoslovakia's voucher privatisation was the largest single programme of state asset disposal in the former communist countries. More than 8.5m investors bought shares indirectly in about 1,500 companies with an estimated book value of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn).</p>

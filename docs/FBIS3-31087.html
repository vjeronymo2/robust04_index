Agani said the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo would put  both warring sides into an approximately equal position, and  explained that "as long as the Serbs are holding dominant  positions there is no basis for a just peaceful solution."    Commenting on Albania's official offer of its airports for  NATO actions in Bosnia, Agani said briefly that "this is  Albania's obligation, as a member of the international  community," adding that similar offers had been made by Italy,  Turkey, and Germany.    Agani described DSK president Ibrahim Rugova's visit to the  United States as successful, in particular the contacts he had  with President Bill Clinton and representatives of the U.S.  Administration.

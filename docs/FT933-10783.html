			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Computer seller sets up UK 'superstores' SPECIALIST Computer Holdings, one of the UK's largest independent computer sales companies, is about to launch a nationwide chain of computer superstores. The privately-owned Birmingham-based group, with an annual turnover of more than Pounds 100m, plans to invest about Pounds 40m during the next two years on the venture, which it believes will transform the PC market. Three superstores, trading under the name 'Byte - The Computer Superstore', will be opened later this year in Newcastle, Birmingham and the City of London. SCH plans to have up to 14 stores open by the summer of 1994. Their main competition will be from Dixons, which earlier this year bought four 'PC World' superstores from Vision Technology Group for Pounds 8.5m. Computer superstores are common in the US, but the concept has yet to catch on in the UK. SCH is gearing its stores particularly to small and medium-sized businesses, which it believes are ill-served by current dealer arrangements. Mr Peter Rigby, SCH's chairman and principal shareholder, said: 'Barely 5 per cent of computer sales are currently through retail outlets; we believe it can reach 30 per cent fairly quickly, expanding the market significantly in the process.' SCH expects about 70 per cent of sales to come from small and medium-sized businesses, with a 'small but growing' private consumer market. The superstores, to be funded from retained profits, will mostly sell leading hardware and software brands such as IBM, Toshiba, Compaq, Apple, Microsoft, Lotus and Borland. They will also offer finance, training and maintenance packages. Romtec, the market research company, expects that 27 per cent of PCs will be sold by a retailer by 1995, creating a retail PC market almost as large as the entire UK PC market in 1990. 'Retail will be the fastest growing PC distribution channel in the UK over the next three years,' Romtec said in a recent report, which predicted that superstores could account for more than 40 per cent of sales by 1995.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Depression is in the mind: Governments must maintain financial stability and open markets to achieve recovery 'It still seems probable that we should be able to prevent serious depressions by preventing the inflations which regularly precede them, but there is little we can do to cure them, once they have set in. The time to worry about depressions is, unfortunately, when they are furthest from the minds of most people' - Friedrich Hayek, The Monetary Framework, The Constitution of Liberty If Hayek was right, the world economy is already doomed. For an inflationary reduction in the purchasing power of money has been a feature of the world economy since the second world war, while a depression is certainly not far from the minds of people today. On the contrary, many people write as if a global depression were a fact, not just a fear. The dangers were well described by the American economist, Irving Fisher in his analysis of debt deflation in the 1930s*. Over-indebtedness and asset price deflation can lead to debt liquidation, to the collapse of banks and the decline in bank deposits, to a fall in prices and to a rise in real rates of interest. If a fixed exchange rate system and an outbreak of global protectionism is added to the list, deflation can readily become global. Yet it is not at all obvious why a global depression should happen and quite clear that nothing like one has happened yet. The gross domestic product of the industrial countries as a group continues to rise every year. There is no resemblance between this and the Great Depression: between 1929 and 1933 US real gross national product fell by 30 per cent, while German GDP declined by 24 per cent between 1929 and 1932. Contemporary examples of comparable collapses are not to be found among the industrial countries, but in eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union. Helped by the decision to break the fixed link between sterling and gold in 1931, UK GDP fell by only 5 per cent between 1929 and 1931 and was back above 1929 levels by 1934. Thus the performance of the UK economy during the present recession does merit comparison with that during the Great Depression. But there is an important difference: with a decline in GDP of 4 per cent between the second quarters of 1990 and 1992, the UK has suffered far more than any other leading economy this time. In the Great Depression, by contrast, it suffered less than others. What this is not, therefore, or at least not yet, is a global depression, by which is meant a prolonged period of worldwide economic decline, with falling prices and collapsing trade. Between 1930 and 1932, for example, world trade in manufactures fell by 40 per cent. This time trade continues to grow. At the same time, the current recession is different from others since the second world war. As a consequence - argues Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve - recovery is also likely to be particularly slow. This slowdown, so far most evident in the Anglo-Saxon economies, has been both unexpected and consistently underestimated. At the end of 1989, for example, the OECD forecast fairly steady growth for US and the UK (see charts). It is true that most economic slowdowns are unexpected. But the last two - the oil-shock related recessions of 1973-76 and 1979-83 - were unexpected for a rather good reason. The combination of a sudden sharp deterioration in the terms of trade with a desire to lower rates of inflation in the industrial countries, which reached 14 per cent in 1974 and 11 per cent in 1980, explained both the recession and the surprise. But this time there has been an unexpected recession without a similar global surprise. The exception that seems to prove the rule has been Europe, where German unification has been one explanation for recent mediocre performance. It was partly an accident of history, but also a mistake by the politicians that made this the moment when the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System was treated as a modern-day gold standard. The rest is already history: a short-lived economic spurt in Germany; a boost to demand in the rest of Europe from the disappearance of the German external surplus, more than offset by the recessionary effects of the rise in German interest rates; slower growth in Europe; and, finally, the exit of the lira and sterling from the ERM and the devaluation of the Spanish peseta. German unification is not the only unexpected political event to affect current economic performance. The peace dividend, also caused by the end of the cold war, has important effects on the US. California, now expected to reject Mr Bush in the presidential election, is the most significant victim of defence cuts. Yet the story in the US, Japan, the UK, Canada, Australia and Scandinavia, economies that together account for two-thirds of the total output of the industrial countries, is rather different. It is one of asset price inflation followed by debt-deflation. In the 1980s, private citizens - from the humblest house buyer in Surbiton to Mr Paul Reichmann - chose to bet on inflation, something that the financial liberalisation of the 1980s made too easy and over-ambition or perhaps simple greed made too attractive. According to the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook****, the ratio of total private non-financial sector debt to GDP rose from below 0.8 to above 1.6 in the UK, from above 1 to above 1.4 in the US and from 1.3 to 2.2 in Japan between 1980 and 1991. Prices of residential property, deflated by consumer prices, rose by some 200 per cent in Japan between 1980 and 1991, by roughly three-quarters in the UK between 1980 and 1989 and by some 30 per cent in the US. Thereupon they plunged, with serious consequences both for debtors and financial intermediaries. The latter is not surprising: in the US 42 per cent of all outstanding bank loans was against property in 1991, while in the UK the proportion was 31 per cent. Provided the financial system does not collapse, depositors should feel little worse off as a result of asset price falls. But substantial net borrowers will. In the UK, for example, the ratio of mortgage debt to the value of the housing stock rose by almost 10 percentage points, to nearly 33 per cent, between 1988 and early 1992. As net worth declines, people try to save more. As the desire to save rises, economies decline, further undermining debt-servicing capacity. In the 1980s, real rates of interest - interest rates deflated by the prices of goods and services - were high, above the long-term rates of growth in most industrial countries. But to purchasers of assets, things looked different. Since asset prices rose far faster than the prices of goods and services in general, borrowing seemed a painless way of becoming rich. But the prices of goods and services, on the one hand, and of assets, on the other, cannot diverge indefinitely. Ultimately, the relative prices of assets must fall. If this is the main problem, what is the prognosis and what, if any, are the solutions? The Federal Reserve believes that the past two years have taken the US economy only about half way through the necessary balance sheet adjustment, following seven reductions in its benchmark rate of interest, the discount rate, taking it from 7 to 3 per cent. Some financial economists are gloomier still. By those standards, Japan has hardly begun its adjustment and the UK has also far to go, particularly in the personal sector. Low short-term rates of interest are simply a necessary condition for balance sheet adjustment. But they are not a sufficient condition for a strong recovery. Recovery demands a return to borrowing, precisely what debt-encumbered businesses and individuals will refuse. What could be more attractive to those responsible for debt-laden economies than another bout of inflation? If debt-to-GDP ratios are double what debtors desire, why not double nominal GDP? Only too aware of this danger, Hayek also wrote that 'the harmful effects of even small doses of inflation can be staved off only by larger doses of inflation'. One objection to a policy of default through inflation is that an uncontrollable flight from the currency would be certain. High inflation is also a recipe for civil strife and economic inefficiency. Moreover, this was precisely the policy tried in the 1970s, with disastrous consequences for the borrowing behaviour of the private sector in the 1980s. The legacy of past inflation also explains why the other obvious remedy for the pains of debt adjustment, a fiscal boost, is likely to prove ineffective. A large government sector is a bulwark against an economic collapse. But further government borrowing is no sure route to recovery. Knowing as they do the temptation to inflation inevitable in a highly indebted economy, investors demand high interest rates as the price for taking on more long-term debt. Unless a fiscal boost can be believably limited in duration, the resulting increase in long-term interest rates would tend to nullify the benefits of a more active fiscal policy. Far better than the scatter gun of inflation would be a conscious decision by government to substitute its own liabilities for a part of the outstanding private debt, but rather to shore up an enfeebled financial system than to protect borrowers from the consequences of their errors. Debt nationalisation has already occurred in the US in the case of the savings and loans institutions, as well as in the case of Scandinavian banks. Nobody can be sure that it will not happen, to some extent, in the UK and Japan as well. Not allowing the financial system to collapse is essential if asset price declines are not to create a depression. Governments must also keep short-term interest rates low enough to permit balance sheet adjustment. Equally important, however, is international co-operation, particularly over trade. An outbreak of protection, following a collapse in the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, would be almost the worst possible mistake. Governments must ensure the health of their financial systems and the openness of their economies. Recovery will follow in time, if not as soon as many hope. The worst mistake of all would be to panic. This is not yet a re-run of the Great Depression. Provided governments keep their heads, it should not become one either. * Irving Fisher, The Debt Deflation Theory of Great Depressions, Econometrica, 1933, pp. 337-57. **** Asset Price Deflation, Balance Sheet Adjustment, and Financial Fragility, in World Economic Outlook, October 1992 (IMF: Washington DC).</p>

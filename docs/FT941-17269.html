			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / New market measures start to converge A flurry of new equity indices has been launched in world stock markets. This week alone, there is a new index for the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and in Germany a 167-share version of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung's long-running 100-share index. Increasingly, indices look alike. Most are adopting the capitalisation-weighted approach, which is theoretically more accurate and harder to manipulate. This is desirable because investors want to trade futures based on stock indices that accurately reflect the underlying cash market. Indices with historical quirks - such as the unweighted Nikkei 225 index, heavily influenced by moribund companies - are too easily manipulated. There are still enough differences between major indices to trap the unwary. Take the new Amsterdam EOE index, the former European Options Exchange index newly adopted by the Amsterdam Stock Exchange to replace the old CBS Tendency index. From February 18 it replaces its old semi-fixed weightings with capitalisation weightings, but there will be a 10 per cent cap applied to Royal Dutch Petroleum and Unilever, which would otherwise take up nearly half the index between them. The main German index, the DAX, is unusual because its basic calculation measures an investor's total return - not just the share price appreciation but also the dividends. The FAZ newspaper is adding a similar type of index, the FAZ-Performance-Index, to its more conventional capital-value FAZ 100 index. The DAX now publishes a calculation based on the late-afternoon close of the IBIS electronic trading system, as well as the earlier close of the physical market. France, like the London market, now has a consistent set of indices. The CAC-40 index, the main real-time indicator, is a subset of the new SBF 120 index, soon to be calculated in real time. It, in turn, is a subset of the SBF 250, which replaces the old CAC General index. Italy's new Mibtel index, which now covers all 152 stocks traded on Milan's electronic system, is rebased to 10,000 each year. This used to be common in continental Europe, but has largely been discarded because it makes long-run comparisons harder. Canada's TSE 100, launched last year, uses as its key criterion a company's float capitalisation: the value of the portion of the equity that is available for trading. Many big Canadian companies have substantial portions of stock in the hands of controlling investors. This is excluded for the purposes of selecting constituents and calculating weighting. Finally, today marks the first publication of the new FT-SE Actuaries All-Share industry sectors. It is also relaunch day for the FT Gold Mines index, formerly of South African companies. It now covers 34 gold producers worldwide. Indicative figures will be published weekly during January, with daily publication starting in February.

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Forecasts for BA slashed British Airways (BA) fell sharply yesterday after the company announced disappointing second-quarter profits and analysts slashed their forecasts for the full year. The shares were the most heavily traded in London yesterday and tumbled 23 to 248p with 19m traded. The airline announced a profit of Pounds 227m in the half-year to September 30, up from Pounds 185m the previous year but below the analysts' forecast range. The lacklustre deadline figure was compounded by a veiled profits warning as BA said prospects for the second half of the financial year remain uncertain, even though it is carrying more passengers and cargo than a year ago, because stiff competition has maintained pressure on margins. The market's consensus estimate for the full year came down to Pounds 260m from above Pounds 300m with broker SG Warburg reining back to around the new level. BZW reduced by Pounds 65m to Pounds 285m arguing that it 'sees sentiment remaining against the company until February or March'. The investment bank also cut by Pounds 100m to Pounds 350m for the following year. However Lehman Brothers' European airlines analysts Mr Christopher Will argues that the real story is in earnings per share rather than profits. He says eps will benefit as the tax rate will come down and the share price had already factored in the low profits. He has turned strong buyer of the stock. Property placing A large placing took the shine off trading figures reported in line with expectations from Great Portland, as building group Costain sold its 3 per cent stake at a considerable loss. Gt Portland shares retreated 7 to 123p with huge turnover of 17m, shares, boosted by the Costain trade. The placing was carried out by Cazenove who bought the stock at 120p from Costain, which had paid 185p a share a year ago, and placed it with institutions at 121 1/2 p. Prior to this development, Gt Portland's figures had caused no great surprises, the maintained dividend helping the shares to hold steady, before tumbling as the Costain placing went through the market at around 10am. In common with most property groups, Gt Portland warned that its final dividend might be in doubt if the market deteriorates further, or if trading suffers further. Mr Graham Stanley at County NatWest commented: 'The dividend yield is offering the shares short-term support, but questions have to be asked if it is prudent to use all the group's cash flow to fund the final dividend when so many of its properties are in need of redevelopment.' Meanwhile, Costain shares edged 1 1/2 to 29 1/2p. C &amp; W pressured The steep decline in the Hong Kong market and a bout of nervousness ahead of tomorrow's interim figures produced a flurry of selling pressure in Cable &amp; Wireless shares (C &amp; W) The group derives well over 50 per cent of its profits from Hong Kong. At their worst yesterday the shares touched 633p before stabilising to end the session a net 9 off at 635p. Turnover was an unremarkable 2.6m shares. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped over 200 points yesterday in response to remarks made by the Chinese deputy prime minister regarding the transfer of power in Hong Kong to the Chinese in 1997. Dealers said the fall in the shares was a knee-jerk reaction to the strains between the UK Government and the Chinese but also reflected profit-taking after the recent strong performance of C &amp; W shares. Between early-October and mid-November C &amp; W shares rose over 20 per cent while the Footsie-100 rose some 10 per cent, mostly reflecting the steep rise in the dollar and news of the sale of a 20 per cent stake in Mercury, C &amp; W's telecoms division, to Bell Canada, the Canadian telecoms group for Pounds 480m. Analysts expect only a marginal rise in C &amp; W's interim profits. The range of estimates is from Pounds 350m to Pounds 365m. The interim is forecast to rise by around 10 per cent to 4.7p. Vodafone came in for some good support amid switching from Cable &amp; Wireless, with the former's the shares moving up 9 more to 379p ahead of interim figures pencilled in for next Tuesday. Analysts expect Vodafone to turn in profits up around 14 per cent at Pounds 160m with a similar increase in the dividend to around 3.3p. The market has given a good reception to last month's launch of Vodafone's new 'Lowcall' service which pre-empted Cellnet's 'Lifetime' launch of a similar service. BT also made progress, similarly sustained by switching activity, and closed 2 1/2 firmer at 395 1/2 p on 4.3m traded. BT partly-paid rose the same amount to 291 1/2 p on 5m. News reports that a sub-contractor in the Pounds 20bn Al-Yamamah defence contract between the UK and Saudi Arabia might want to by-pass lead contractor British Aerospace hit BAe shares. Shipbuilder Vosper Thorneycroft had apparently said it would like to deal directly with Saudi Arabia. However the company was unhappy with reports that it wanted to operate alone and stressed its continued commitment to the contract. BAe fell 4 to 133p while Vosper lifted 9 to 401p principally as a result of announced raised interim profits and an improved dividend. Speculation that Rolls-Royce might have been selling equipment for military use to Iraq plus a profits warning from a US competitor and analysts' forecast downgrades hit the shares. However, the company said that as regards the supply of equipment; 'We have to and do accept all the government guidelines' and added that it had a different range of engines from United Technologies. Rolls slipped 7 1/2 to 101 1/2 p on heavy turnover of 8.5m. A buy recommendation issued by BZW and a well-received presentation by the company to what was described as a sparsely-attended gathering of investment analysts provided the impetus for a strong performance by Standard Chartered. The shares were the pick of a generally sluggish banking sector, racing up 21 to a new high for the year of 555p; turnover was a hefty 1.9m shares. The stock is in the running to be included in the Footsie-100 list when the FT-SE steering committee meets to consider changes in constituents. Bank sector specialists said Standard had outlined its strategy and insisted it would not float off its Hong Kong operation, a move which had been mooted Burmah Castrol continued to drift easier as worries about the extent of the slowdown in German economic activity triggered renewed selling pressure. Burmah derives around 40 per cent of its earnings from continental Europe. Brokers have been reducing estimates for Burmah for the past couple of weeks. Burmah shares closed a further 5 off at 660p. Dealers noted a resurgence of activity in Calor with income funds selling the stock in special ex-dividend form around the 212p mark. At the close the shares were marginally off at 223p with around 1m shares traded. Paris theme park operator Euro Disney fell back for the second day running as investors continued to bale out ahead of tomorrow's interim figures. Steep losses are feared and Paribas yesterday reiterated its strong sell stance. The shares tumbled 35 to 983p. Forte continued its good run as Prudential increased its stake from 2.9 to 3.6 per cent, the shares running on 6 to 175p in turnover of 2.7m. Ladbroke added 7 to 175p in sympathy. Exhibitions organiser Blenheim tumbled after the company's joint broker Credit Laing Lyonnais crossed 2.8m shares at 420p. The shares were traded between one institution wanting to offload its entire 3 per cent stake and institutions. happy to pick up the stock The shares picked up from the low to close 25 off at 438p. Courtaulds tumbled 14 to 470p on nervousness ahead of half-year results to be announced today. Estimates range from Pounds 87m to Pounds 92m against Pounds 96.4m a year ago.

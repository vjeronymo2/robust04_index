			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Property: Frankfurt in favour - The EMI decision is a boost for the city The recent decision to locate the European Monetary Institute - forerunner of the European Central Bank - in Frankfurt is a small victory for the city's parlous commercial property market. But the greater battle still lies ahead: how to revive the country's depressed property sector. The EMI will employ about 250 people and occupy 5,000 square metres of office space, a fraction of the average 220,000 sq m leased in Frankfurt in each of the past five years. Yet, as Mr Robert Orr of surveyors Jones Lang Wootton in Frankfurt says, the EMI decision should inspire confidence at a time when the market is in the doldrums and the wider economy endures its worst recession in 50 years. 'The decision confirms Frankfurt's position in the financial world,' he said. 'Investors will be comforted by the knowledge that its future is secure. It will not lead to a rapid pick-up in the commercial property market but it will bring to an end the slide in values we have seen over the past 18 months.' Rents for prime properties in central Frankfurt have dropped by 21 per cent over the past 18 months, from DM95 a sq m to DM75 a sq m. The amount of commercial space likely to be leased this year will be about 200,000 sq m, less than the past five-year average but down from the 250,000 sq m leased last year and the record 320,000 sq m in 1991. Other commercial centres in Germany's strongly regionalised economy have suffered similar declines; the sharpest falls have been in Berlin and Leipzig, where rents shot up on the back of speculative trading in the aftermath of German reunification in 1990, before dropping back steeply. In cities such as Dusseldorf, Munich and Stuttgart, rents have also fallen but not so sharply. These cities will, for the immediate future, continue to suffer from the combined effects of regional economic weakness and a surplus of supply, as new buildings, commissioned before the downturn, come onto the market. The decision to base the EMI in Frankfurt, the most international of Germany's business centres, will accelerate the tendency for foreign banks and other financial institutions to raise their profile in the Finanzplatz. At the same time, financial houses without a foothold in Frankfurt are likely to seek one. This process is already under way: Reuter recently ann-ounced its decision to take three floors of the Messeturm, while JP Morgan is to take 8,000 sq m in the former Finanzamt building in the centre of Frankfurt owned by Mr Dieter Bock, the entrepreneur best known in the UK as a big shareholder in Lonrho, the international trading group. The securities house SG Warburg, Moody's, the credit rating agency, and AT Kearney, a US consultancy, have between them taken the bulk of the former Chase Manhattan building at Taunusanlage 11. Domestic groups have also played their part in absorbing some of the commercial property surplus in Frankfurt. Dresdner Bank has taken the whole of the 15,000 sq m Furstenhof development; Deutsche Bank recently celebrated the opening of its third skyscraper in the city, the 60,000 sq m Trianon, one third of which it will be using for its own purposes while the rest is to be let to BfG Bank and others. These lettings have removed some of the 350,000 sq m of complete and vacant property in Frankfurt city centre and its suburbs. In spite of this Mr Orr of Jones Lang Wootton still believes the vacancy rate in Frankfurt is likely to rise from 5 per cent at present to 6 per cent next year. This is low by international standards - London's West End has a vacancy rate of 9 per cent while the City suffers from a rate of 16-17 per cent - but is high in comparison with Frankfurt's historical average of 2-3 per cent. While this oversupply will continue to dampen the market's prospects in the short term, there are two factors which are working in favour of property markets in Frankfurt and in Germany's other leading commercial centres. First, interest rates. Following the latest of the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts, long-term rates are now at historical lows. A good quality borrower could obtain five-year fixed financing at an effective rate of 6.5-7.5 per cent. This compares with a peak of 9.5-10 per cent in 1991 and means that for the first time since the middle of the 1980s the yield on certain types of commercial property investments - particularly office developments in the suburbs of Frankfurt - exceeds the financing costs. While property yields on prime properties in the centre of Frankfurt remain at 5-5.5 per cent, an investor can expect yields of 6.75-7.5 per cent on suburban property, guaranteeing a positive cash flow on investment from the outset. Second, is the phenomenon of the German 'open-ended' property funds - an investment vehicle popular with private investors. The 14 open-ended funds that exist have provoked huge investor interest. In the first 10 months of this year investors poured DM11.5bn (Pounds 4.6bn) into the funds, up from DM6bn last year and DM2bn in 1991. Total assets have doubled to DM39bn in the past three years. The reason behind the popularity of open-ended funds, at a time when investors could have made more money in rising equity and fixed-interest markets, is perplexing market analysts: one suggestion is that the volatility of the securities markets has frightened Germany's more conservative investors into the stable world of property. The open-ended funds are legally obliged to invest in property: this alone is likely to provide support for the market. As Mr Michael von Zitzewitz of CGI, the Commerzbank property fund, explained to investors last week, the funds have invested nearly DM2bn in six months to July. The 'pressure (on open-ended funds) to invest' proved difficult to resist, he said, given sharply improved yields. The 'pressure to invest' is also making itself felt elsewhere. DGI, Deutsche Bank's property-fund, this month concluded the biggest property acquisition in the City of London in two years with the purchase of a long leasehold on One Exchange Square.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Danuta Waniek, newly appointed deputy </F> minister of national defense, by Aleksander Frydrychowicz; place  and date not given: "A Crazy Idea of Aleksander"; last four  paragraphs attributed to "ALF"]    [Excerpts] [Frydrychowicz] How did it happen that a  candidate for the government's plenipotentiary for women's  affairs became deputy minister at the most masculine ministry?    [Waniek] It was the crazy idea of Olek [Aleksander]  Kwasniewski. He came up with this idea as the ultimate method  of winning on a flank that was not easily accessible. I  received the first nomination among the candidates for deputy  ministers in the "presidential ministries."    [Frydrychowicz] Were you happy to move from one ministry to  another?    [Waniek] This is a much more difficult task than my previous  position. I have had an idea for several years of how the  Office of the Plenipotentiary for the Affairs of Women, Family,  and Young People should be organized. I fought for the  implementation of this concept with consecutive governments.    The post I am taking over today is something new in a way.  There are certainly people in the Ministry of National Defense  [MON] who have also dealt with these matters so far; however, my  task lies in steering a ministerial structure the position of  which will be different from the position to date.    [Frydrychowicz] What will be the range of your duties?    [Waniek] I will be the ministry's liaison with parliament  and the spokesman for civil rights. I will deal with the issues  of military courts and prosecutor's offices. The section dealing  with interventions will also be subordinated to me. However, I  must still thoroughly study the list of duties that has been  handed to me along with the nomination. After skimming it, I  can say that I will have certain remarks to make. I suppose  that I will have to hold some minor talks with Minister Piotr  Kolodziejczyk.    [Frydrychowicz] Is this a matter of broadening or narrowing  your powers?    [Waniek] It is a matter of making them more specific. I  would prefer to do this right at the beginning so that I will  not encroach upon anyone's powers and no one will encroach upon  mine. [passage omitted]  <H8>  * * * </H8>   "At the motion of the minister of national defense, on 26  April 1994 I hereby appoint you to the post of under secretary  of state in MON." Such a letter, dated 22 April, was signed by  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak late on the evening on 25 April.  On the following day, Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk presented it  to Democratic Left Alliance Deputy Danuta Waniek.    Asked by journalists whether, as a woman, she "feels the  military issues," Danuta Waniek replied: "I have had no  relations with MON; however, many males are in the same  situation."    Even though she was appointed deputy minister, Danuta Waniek  has no intention of giving up her activities in the  parliamentary women's group.    At a press conference, the newly appointed deputy minister  said that she had qualifications to fulfill the present  function. She is a doctor of parliamentary and constitutional  law and a graduate of a political science department in Vienna.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Vita blames fall on European recession THE COST of closing its lossmaking Spanish operations adversely affected British Vita, the plastics and foam company, which reported a 39 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the half year ending June 30. Profits fell from Pounds 26.8m to Pounds 16.3m on increased sales of Pounds 404.4m (Pounds 372.9m). The shares fell 17p to 243p. With about two-thirds of its revenues generated from continental Europe, Mr Duncan Lawton, deputy chairman, said the half year had been very tough. However, by exiting out of Spain Mr Lawton said the group had 'great confidence that there will be a turnround on mainland Europe. There is still some more sorting out to do but the worst is over'. The cost of disposing of the Spanish operation was Pounds 3.5m. It made an operating loss of Pounds 2m which was partly responsible for the group's continental European operations reporting a 27 per cent fall in operating profits to Pounds 12.4m. Sterling depreciation, which helped last year's results, was pushing up D-Mark denominated raw material prices, affecting the group's cellular operations. Operating profits from the UK side fell from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 6.7m. Profits from the international business rose to Pounds 427,000 (Pounds 317,000). The group plans to continue to cut costs; the workforce has already been reduced by 350 to 9,000. With net cash of Pounds 40m left over from last year's rights issue, Mr Lawton said: 'We are continuing to look at acquisitions but we are not used to paying high prices.' Mr Alan Jones, who worked for National Westminster Bank, joins the board as a non-executive replacing Mr James Ogden, who has retired. Earnings per share fell from 7.9p to 4p. The interim dividend is raised to 3.65p (3.5p). COMMENT With almost 70 per cent of revenues generated from mainland Europe British Vita is out of step with the UK chemical sector. While it is not unusual to have a high overseas exposure most UK chemical companies tend to weight it towards the Commonwealth or North America. British Vita is now paying the price for being different as its main markets slide deeper into recession. After closing its Spanish operations its main emphasis must be to control costs in Germany. The increase in the interim dividend is meant to underline the company's confidence in the future. However, with forecast annual pre-tax profits of about Pounds 35m, the shares look expensive - at least in the short-term - on a prospective multiple of 26.</p>

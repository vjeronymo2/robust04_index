			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Vilnius, Feb 28, BNS -- Lithuanian President  Algirdas Brazauskas said he was surprised by the Russian  parliament's decision to amnesty the leaders of the 1991 Soviet  coup and the hard-liners who fought against President Boris  Yeltsin last October.    At a press conference Monday, Brazauskas noted that the step  was premature because there has been no legal evaluation of the  actions undertaken by the organizers and the executors of those  events. "Maybe they would have been acquitted in court -- that  is a different question."    Commenting on Lithuanian-Russian relations, Brazauskas said  no changes have occurred lately. The president praised the  Lithuanian government's initiative to find out why Russia does  not send ratification documents to the agreement on the most  favored nation trade status. [passage omitted]    Brazauskas said he has not yet had a change to read the  Russian draft agreement on military transit through Lithuania.  The president said he expect the head of the working group for  talks with the CIS to acquaint him with the document this week.    In Brazauskas' words, misunderstandings over Russian  military  transit can be avoided by improving the currently existing order  of transit.    A system of permits must remain and must "function very  precisely," he said.    He said it is an "oddity" that having declared the need to  demilitarize the Kaliningrad region as soon as possible,  Lithuania suddenly suspends Russian transit through its  territory.    Brazauskas said Lithuania should create uniform transit  rules  for all countries in the future.</p>

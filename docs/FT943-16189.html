			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Baby Bells set for contest with judge Four of America's 'Baby Bell' local telephone companies are expected to launch a legal battle as early as today aimed at eliminating the immense powers wielded over them by a US district judge for the past decade. The case could play an important role in breaking down the complex legal and regulatory framework which prevents the Baby Bells from competing in the long-distance telecommunications market, or making telephone equipment. The Bell companies are expected to call on Judge Harold Greene to give up the oversight of the US telecommunications industry he has exercised since the early 1980s, when he presided over the court-ordered break-up of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph on anti-trust grounds. AT&amp;T's local operations were spun off into seven separate Baby Bells. Because each of these enjoyed regional monopolies, they were forbidden from entering the long-distance market, equipment manufacturing and information services (though the latter ban was lifted in 1991). AT&amp;T retained its long-distance operations, though these were opened to full competition. Since then, Judge Greene has presided over the so-called consent decree which established this framework, and both AT&amp;T and the Baby Bells must seek his permission for substantial changes in operating practices. Judge Greene has tended to interpret the consent decree conservatively and the telephone companies have grown frustrated at his court's long backlog of requests for waivers. Many industry observers argue that to vest such powers in a solitary judge, committed to a framework 10 years old, is seriously to impede the evolution of one of the world's fastest changing industrial sectors. The four companies pursuing legal action - Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Nynex and Southwestern Bell - are expected to argue that the consent decree has outlived its usefulness. The House of Representatives last week passed a telecommunications bill which would do away with the consent decree and eventually allow the Baby Bells into the long-distance market. But the legislation faces a tough fight in the Senate and the Baby Bells are evidently launching their court battle as a precautionary measure. Judge Greene seems likely to reject the call for him to relinquish his powers. If so, the four are likely to take the battle to the Supreme Court.</p>

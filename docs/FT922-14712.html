			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Out of Africa . . . IN WESTERN cities, where most of what we buy is machine-made, mass-produced and standardised, the hand-made products from countries that machines and quality controls have failed to reach often have a refreshing innocence. The fabrics, the jewellery, the artefacts used in daily life, remind us of simpler, happier days when dyes ran, seams came apart and sizes were not always what they purported to be but nonetheless, some spirit of the person who made them lingered on, imbuing them with character and charm. Neal Street East, which is finding the recession long and grey, has decided to bring a shaft of sunshine to Covent Garden with a selling exhibition of textiles, jewellery and crafts from different corners of Africa. It starts today and runs until the end of May. Although much of what will be on sale is contemporary all of it is made by hand and usually by traditional methods. Probably of most interest to most people is the jewellery from north Africa, such as the Berber dance necklace photographed right. Made from African 'silver' and amber (the resin copal), the necklace itself is Pounds 32.50 and the 'silver' Ethiopian Cross is Pounds 75. Much of the jewellery mixes old and new pieces - old millefleure trading beads, with the pattern going right through the bead, like seaside rock, are combined with silver or coral or African amber. Some of the Coptic crosses from Ethiopia are old, some contemporary. There are Berber bead nacklaces with gold smelted onto the beads, there are earrings, necklaces and bangle boxes made from enamelware and coral necklace with amulets. From Botswana there are baskets made from the fibre of the vegetable ivory palm tree. They are made mainly by the women of the Bayei and Hambukushu tribes. Though, sadly, today many of the baskets are made on coarser, broader coils, Neal Street East has made a point of seeking out the finest, most delicate work still being done. Prices will range from Pounds 25 for small open baskets and go on up to Pounds 150 for a large almost laundry-size one. Perhaps most enchanting, although harder to find a use for, are the African fabrics. The traditional mud cloth of the Bambara people of Mali, Bokolanfini, made from locally-grown cotton, traditionally combines a traditional dark, almost black background, and creamy geometric patterns. Sold by the piece, prices start at about Pounds 60. Use them as throws, curtains, wall-hangings. Enchanting in quite a different way is the Korhogo cloth from the Ivory Coast - embellished with strange animals (one half cat, half tiger), with fish and guinea-fowl, with goats and strange symbolic hunters and shamans. Once all these figures were imbued with meaning, based on age-old stories and traditions, today they are mainly produced commercially. This is not the sort of fabric to cut up and turn into clothes - buy it by the piece, use it for throws, cushions, wallhangings. Prices start at about Pounds 65. Neal Street East is at 5, Neal Street, London WC2.</p>

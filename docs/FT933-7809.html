			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: BICC The London stock market's euphoria could scarcely have contrasted more with the dour faces on display at BICC. Although there was an encouraging 54 per cent profits recovery in Australasia and an improving trend in the UK, BICC was consumed by the gloom surrounding lengthening recession in mainland Europe. Germany was particularly weak. Cable volumes in Spain fell 30 per cent. If, as seems probable, BICC's experience has broader implications for UK manufacturers, it was entirely lost on the overall market yesterday. Despite the 3 per cent fall after its figures, BICC's shares have still climbed 95 per cent from last October's trough. The theory is that even if trading remains grim, BICC's shares are underpinned by the yield, which remains at 6 per cent. But that presupposes that the dividend will be held. After the 27 per cent fall in interim earnings, this may be open to doubt. BICC has previously dipped into reserves to maintain its payment. Its earnings may barely cover the dividend this year too. BICC would then face the agonising dilemma of deciding whether to persevere with its pay-out policy or preserve cash to fund expansion. At this stage in the cycle, investors may have assumed such worries were redundant. But a further downward lurch in BICC's European markets may make them all too real. Chasing yield may be the latest fashion. But it is worth keeping an eye on earnings too.</p>

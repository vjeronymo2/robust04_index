			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Small is successful in a liberalised India: A new breed of entrepreneurs making the best of a more open economy 'Packaging is my first love. You can wake me up at two o'clock in the morning and I will talk about packaging,' says Mr Ashok Chaturvedi, a Delhi businessman who has made his fortune out of plastic bags. Mr Chaturvedi, who has three telephones on his desk and a radio telephone in each of his three Mercedes cars, lives and breathes packaging. His smallest bags are pouches for selling individual packs of tea, spices and shampoos. His biggest are zip-locked sacks strong enough to take a tyre. Flex, the group 38-year-old Mr Chaturvedi founded only 10 years ago, expects to see sales rise 70-80 per cent in the year to June from Rs1.4bn (Pounds 30m) last year, with a similar increase next year. Mr Chaturvedi says: 'There's no limit. This is going to be the biggest flexible packaging business in the world.' Mr Chaturvedi is one of a new breed of Indian entrepreneurs that has been quick to seize the opportunities created by the economic reforms started by Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former prime minister, in the mid-1980s, and greatly extended under his successor Mr P V Narasimha Rao. Free of the burdens which saddle many larger groups - such as over-manning, out-dated plant and bloated corporate bureaucracies - younger companies are showing how best to take advantage of liberalisation, notably in bringing new technology into India and searching out export markets. Mr Pradip Shah, managing director of Crisi, a credit rating agency, says the opportunities created by reform often suit smaller companies better since they require rapid responses. Mr Chaturvedi is more blunt: 'Reform can allow the fast to move faster, but it cannot bring the dead back to life.' The performance of small companies has yet to have much impact on national industrial production figures which show India remains stuck in a three-year-long recession, albeit with faint signs of recovery ahead. However, high-growth pockets such as the southern edge of Delhi, the engineering centre of Pune in western India, and the southern city of Bangalore are seeing much higher rates of increase. All have fostered strong communities of small companies. Nowhere is this more visible than in Bangalore, which has long been a centre for high-technology engineering, diversified into electronics and software in the 1980s and is now moving into other advanced industries. One such new-generation company is Biocon India, a biotechnology company supplying enzymes for use in brewing, food-processing, textiles and other industries. Biocon's founder is Ms Karin Mazumdar, a qualified master brewer who started the company at the age of 25 in 1979 after she failed to get a job in the male-dominated brewing industry. Like Mr Chaturvedi, she had little money of her own and began the business in a garage with an investment of just Rs3,000. She persuaded Biocon Biotechnology, an Irish enzyme maker, to take a stake in her company and to transfer know-how. Today Ms Mazumdar has annual sales of Rs165m, exports half her output and employs 105 people, 25 of them scientists with advanced degrees. 'India,' says Ms Mazumdar, 'is the most cost-effective place in the world for high-technology research. The salary of a good PhD-qualified researcher is only Rs10,000 a month - a fraction of rates in the US.' Ms Mazumdar says economic reform is bringing a big boost to her business because it is forcing customers to become more competitive and up-grade their products. 'Companies used to be so complacent. Now they are not.' If biotechnology is one of India's newest industries, leather is one of its oldest. But the opening of India's economy, especially the government's export drive, has created fresh opportunities. Mr Narayana Bhatt, a Bangalore lawyer, and his wife, Mrs Madhura Bhatt, noticed in the 1970s that most traditional producers were tanners making goods without paying much attention to fashion. Mrs Bhatt started making high-fashion handbags in her garage. As the business grew, her husband joined her and they diversified into leather coats and other garments. Their company, Namaste Exports, expects to see sales of more than Rs1. bn in the year to March, a 40 per cent increase on last year. Almost all the output is exported. Mr Bhatt, Namaste's chairman, says the biggest effect of reform has been to transform attitudes to making money. 'Before, if you went into business people said you were a selfish capitalist. Now we are free of that thinking.' Few Indian entrepreneurs can claim to have achieved as much as Mr Chaturvedi, Ms Mazumdar and Mr Bhatt in so short a time. Failure is almost as common as success among young businesses and many entrepreneurs spend their lives just trying to break even. Moreover, the penalties for failure in India are harsh - nearly every day, there are newspaper reports of self-employed businessmen beaten or killed by loan sharks. Yet, the odds are steadily improving in the entrepreneur's favour. Though Mr Chaturvedi, Ms Mazumdar and Mr Bhatt's businesses were started well before the latest phase of reform, the three founders agree that liberalisation has greatly improved their prospects. And they are all convinced that return to the pre-reform days of socialist bureaucratic overkill is unthinkable. As Mr Bhatt says: 'We will never allow things to go back. There are too many of us now.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Hong Wen (1738 5113): "Guard </F> Against Hong Kong Government's Move To `Spend Extravagantly'"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 27 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- This  Wednesday, the financial secretary is going to announce a fiscal  budget, the third since Chris Patten took up the governorship of  Hong Kong. Before this, the Hong Kong Government published the  part of the budget relating to public expenditures, which shows  that the total budgeted expenditures for the next fiscal year  will reach as high as HK$146 billion, representing a substantive  increase of 6.3 percent over the current year's budget, or  breaking the principle that the increase in expenditures must  not exceed the rate of economic growth which the Hong Kong  Government has pursued all along. In view of this, many people  in the community are worried whether the new fiscal budget to be  introduced soon will further deviate from the traditional  financial management principle of making both ends meet, and  whether money will be spent extravagantly for reasons other than  economic ones.    Judging from the newly released expenditure figures, this  worry is completely reasonable. Although the authorities have  argued insistently that the growth in budgeted expenditures has  slowed obviously, Legislative Councillor Lau Wah-sum, a former  financial official of the Hong Kong Government, argued that the  authorities do not include the operational funds in the  government expenditures because they attempt to "prevent" people  from seeing the limitations of a 5 percent growth in  expenditures.    As history unfolds, the original intention that government  expenditure should not be higher than the local economic growth  rate was intended to avoid stimulating inflation. However,  after Chris Patten -- a former politician -- assumed the  governorship, the first fiscal budget under his administration  leadership "discarded the old and introduced the new," setting a  precedence of allowing the growth in public expenditure to be  higher than the economic growth rate. What is noteworthy is that  the forthcoming fiscal budget probably will push the proportion  of public expenditure to another new height.    According to estimates by the Hong Kong General Chamber of  Commerce, the Taxation Society, and people from accounting  circles, the deficit in the new fiscal year will reach HK$10  billion. The huge deficit will be due mainly to the sharp  growth of many large infrastructural and capital expenditures.  It is believed that the government will continue to run a  deficit over the next four years. In other words, spending  extravagantly in the good days of the transition period may mean  bad days after 1997 and may lead the future special  administrative region into dire straits.    Although the government seems to be running an increasing  surplus, this sharp surplus increase -- in all fairness -- is  derived from the unexpectedly "satisfactory" income from the  sale of land and from the stock market boom. Unfortunately, it  is impossible for this kind of income to remain steady and  regular in the long run. Moreover, the policy of pushing up  land prices leads directly to a sharp rise in property prices  and to high inflation, making it indescribably difficult for  mortgage-paying residents and leading to a daily decreasing  quality of life.    The saying runs "one who does not look far ahead will find  himself face to face with immediate trouble." Faced with an  uncertain political environment in the remaining years of the  transition period, in view of the periodic fluctuations in  economic development and the possible influence on Hong Kong's  economy that the British side's obstinacy regarding the  political system will have, the Hong Kong Government surely has  the responsibility to consider the long-term interests of Hong  Kong people, bear future needs in mind, stick to the policy of  making ends meet, and retain a sufficient financial capability  to cope with contingencies. Otherwise, the prosperity bought by  spending extravagantly now may change into trouble for Hong Kong  people in the future, once they encounter an adverse situation.  In the case of welfarism, many Western countries have stumbled  over this, so it is important for the Hong Kong Government to  draw a lesson from this.    Generally speaking, sticking to the financial management  tradition of making ends meet is an important factor  contributing to the Hong Kong miracle. The Basic Law also  provides that the fiscal budget of the special administrative  region must uphold the principle of making ends meet. For this  reason, there is a need to warn the Hong Kong Government that it  should not play a game of figures by formulating a deficit  budget with expenditures much greater than income so as to  mislead the community.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Avesco incurs Pounds 2.3m deficit Avesco, the broadcast equipment and services group, which has been investing heavily in its VideoLogic multimedia technology division, yesterday reported a Pounds 2.32m first half pre-tax loss and announced a share placement to raise about Pounds 5m. The deficit for the six months to September 30 compared with a previous profit of Pounds 23,000. Turnover slipped to Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 11.2m). There were losses of 2.97p against earnings of 0.025p. There is no interim dividend. The directors stated that the lower sales reflected difficult trading conditions in Europe at a time when the group has yet to benefit from any sales of mass market products developed under the IBM/VideoLogic joint development agreement established last year. During the period the VideoLogic division incurred a Pounds 2.34m (Pounds 541,000) trading loss on turnover of Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 4.57m). Mr Richard Murray, chairman, said, nevertheless, that VideoLogic had met 'a number of important milestones in its product development programme, its expansion into Germany and France and in the recruitment of senior executives.' The group's AVS Broadcast television products division reported an increased trading loss of Pounds 572,000 (Pounds 310,000) on flat turnover of Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 1.73m), while all the businesses in the services division traded profitably but reported a reduced trading profit of Pounds 759,000 (Pounds 1.18m) on turnover of Pounds 4.58m (Pounds 4.72m.) In order to meet VideoLogic's short-term need for additional working capital, SG Warburg is underwriting a placement of 4.06m shares with investors at a price to be determined by demand. Meanwhile, the group is continuing to work on a timetable for spinning off VideoLogic.</p>

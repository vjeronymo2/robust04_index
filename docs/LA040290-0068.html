			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> N.Y. POLICE CLOSE 23 ILLEGAL CLUBS  </P> <P> Police slammed shut 23 more illegal social clubs early Sunday, hoping to  prevent a repeat of the blaze that killed 87 people last week in the Bronx.  </P> <P> The crackdown came as the bodies of 48 victims of the Happy Land social club  fire arrived in Honduras, the impoverished Central American country many had  left in search of a better life in the United States.  </P> <P> A special police task force has issued vacate orders to a total of 346 illicit  clubs since a sweep by the city began last Sunday, Officer Anthony Mazzola  said.  </P> <P> The New York Times, citing police records, reported Sunday that 52 of the 1,255  clubs listed as "nuisance" establishments were in properties owned by the city,  including two in Housing Authority projects. The records portray the city as  the largest landlord of such clubs.  </P></p>

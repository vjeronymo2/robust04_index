			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: IBC losses halved to Pounds 4.5m MR ROY WATTS, chairman of International Business Communications (Holdings), the specialist provider of business information, said the board was 'pleased' with the company's results for 1991, a year when pre-tax losses were reduced from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 4.5m. The company, which has almost completed disposals of all its non-core businesses, has undergone its second restructuring in 18 months. Previously in November 1990, IBC's banks were left with 75 per cent of the equity; as part of the restructuring announced in August 1991, 33 executives bought 15.2m shares (10 per cent) from the banks. Further transfers from the banks to the investing group of executives could reduce the banks' ownership of ordinary shares to 50.7 per cent. The new debt structure came into being on January 1 1992. Operating profits grew from Pounds 462,000 to Pounds 4.79m, on turnover of Pounds 50m (Pounds 74m). However exceptional charges of Pounds 126,000 (credit Pounds 718,000), net continuing interest reduced to Pounds 2.64m (Pounds 11.2m), accrued debenture interest 1996 of Pounds 2.3m (nil) and non-continuing interest payable of Pounds 4.23m (nil) caused the losses on the pre-tax line. Losses per share emerged at 2.9p (28.5p) and again there is no dividend,</p>

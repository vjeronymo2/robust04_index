			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Stores defend credit card interest rates STORE GROUPS accused this week by Labour of charging allegedly extortionate credit-card interest rates claim there are good reasons for higher rates than those levied by bank credit cards. Ms Elizabeth Stanton, director of the Retail Credit Group, which represents large retailers who offer credit, said that the average amount outstanding on store cards, at Pounds 163, was far less than the Pounds 420 typical of bank credit cards. Stores had to recoup their fixed costs over this smaller sum which was why rates were higher. Furthermore, holders of store cards often benefited from special offers  - such as discounts on goods - not available to holders of other credit cards. Also, those who paid their card accounts in full each month did not pay interest. The Retail Credit Group says that while sales on credit rose 11.5 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter of this year, the amount of outstanding balances fell 11 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn. Labour said on Thursday that the average margin over base rate charged on store cards had risen from 18 per cent in 1990 to 21 per cent. Labour said the most expensive store credit card was operated by Dixons, which charges 34.4 per cent to customers who do not pay their accounts by direct debit. Store cards represent only a small part of the consumer credit market. The total value of store-card transactions last year was Pounds 3.2bn, a survey by Datamonitor, a market-research group, found. This represents only 10 per cent of other credit cards. A few store groups dominate the market. According to Datamonitor the Marks and Spencer card accounts for almost a third of all consumer store-card expenditure. It adds that John Lewis, the Burton Group and the House of Fraser account for another 41 per cent. Cards are attractive to store groups because they encourage customer loyalty and provide valuable marketing information. A store group such as Marks and Spencer, which does not accept other credit cards, will save substantially on the fees it would otherwise have paid to credit-card companies. Nevertheless, the costs of running a store-card operation caused several retailers in the late 1980s and early 1990s to sell their credit-card operations to outside organisations who could run the business more cheaply. GE Capital, for example, bought the card operation of the Burton Group. And retailers have had limited success in selling other financial services to their card-holding customers.</p>

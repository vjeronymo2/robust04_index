			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Arts: Mounted in the Garden - Cabaret theatre 'Mounted in the Garden' could only mean that Kit and the Widow, that most scurrilous of double acts, have re-tied their bow ties, ironed their tails, and assembled a melange of songs, old and new, to subvert the nation. It is the perfect late night entertainment at the Donmar Warehouse and places a substantial whoopie cushion under the worthy Covent Garden Festival. Over the years the relationship between the two has shifted. Kit (Hesketh-Harvey) is still the masterful head prefect, but marriage has exposed a softer side, adding to the repertoire not only a double-edged love song, but also a nursery lullaby, an ABC of African animals. The Widow (Richard Sisson) still looks like a Victorian curate with flatulence but he now occasionally leaves the piano stool to tell, with studied diffidence, risque jokes. The basics stay the same - mordantly witty songs, performed with camp bitchiness. Thankfully some of the old faithfuls are retained - the old queens having a furious row on the way to Glyndebourne; the hundreds of Norwegians doomed to travel for ever on the Bakerloo Line with Peer Gynt; Kit resolutely refusing to get into bed with Madonna. But the poisoned pen has moved with the times. Let's hope the Queen never gets to hear 'Cheer Up, Marm'; it could convince her to call the whole thing off. There is also one of those cabaret songs that harks back to Duggie Byng and pre-war supper club days, 'Geoffrey Porlock the Warlock', whose Wednesday evenings at Datchett near Slough sound decidedly messy. What is remarkable about Kit and the Widow is that they manage to insult all the totems of their fans and leave them desperate for more abuse. The City types bay loudest at the pastiche of the Eton Boating Song which finds them dangling in the Old Bailey on fraud charges; the Sondheim freaks accept the total demolition of their god with well controlled hysterics. Kit is so much one of us, when he forgets to be one of them, that he provides the perfect escape for subversive thoughts. It may well be forgotten in the cool night air but for an hour or so we have smashed the establishment and had a smashing time, too.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Boots' sales fall 'someway short' of target BOOTS, the chemists chain and retailing group, yesterday reported that sales in the final quarter of 1991 had fallen 'someway short' of target. The news prompted a 3 1/2 p fall in its share price to 421p and a shaving of analysts' profits forecasts. Marks and Spencer, the food and clothing retailer, also confirmed the impression that Christmas had been slow for retailers. Although it did not issue a formal trading statement, the company said it had achieved single-figure sales increases in a 'difficult' December. Ladieswear and foods performed well although menswear continued to be slack apart from gift products, such as socks and pants. However, M and S said food sales had held up well in the face of Sunday opening by the big supermarket groups. 'There was no measurable effect from our opposition being open on Sundays. We beat our estimates,' it said. Sir James Blyth, chief executive of Boots, described the company's performance as a good result 'taking into account the tough economic climate and the very heavy discounting in the retail market place'. Sales from comparable space at the Boots the Chemists chain rose by 4.5 per cent during the period. Personal care products and food were said to have sold well although demand for electrical household goods and cosmetics was weak. In the retail division, Childrens World registered the strongest sales gains with a 13.6 per cent increase in like-for-like sales while Boots Opticians showed a 6.6 per cent improvement. Although continuing depression in the car market made trade difficult for Halfords, the car parts chain reported a 'very substantial' increase in sales of car alarms. 'People may not be buying cars at the moment but they want to hang on to what they've got,' the company said. Overall sales showed a 6.1 per cent increase. Boots' interests in the DIY market, which include Do-it-all - jointly owned with WH Smith - and Fads, suffered in a highly competitive market. Sales at AG Stanley, which takes in Fads, fell by 4.1 per cent while Do-it-all was 13 per cent down. Do-it-all lost sales by not participating in a price war being waged before Christmas between Texas Homecare and B&amp;Q. But Do-it-all has since started discounting, producing a noticeable uplift in sales. Analysts are now estimating annual profits from Boots to come in at about the Pounds 365m mark.</p>

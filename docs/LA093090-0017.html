			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'HARD WAY' CREDIT  </P> <P> Regarding Kari Granville's Sept. 2 article on our movie "The Hard Way":  </P> <P> Like many films, "The Hard Way" has followed a long, serpentine course to the  screen. It was originally going to be directed by Arthur Hiller, and Ted Danson  was set to star.  </P> <P> When John Badham and I came aboard, our first attempt was to team Kevin Kline  and Gene Hackman, with Chicago as the location, only to eventually arrive at  Michael J. Fox and James Woods and New York when all but the shouting was over.  </P> <P> In the case of the writers, the history was no less complicated. The original  script was written by Lem Dobbs and then rewritten by Daniel Pyne. Both scripts  were supervised by producer Bill Sackheim. It was the Pyne draft that got  Badham, myself, Fox and Woods to commit.  </P> <P> Because of Dan's obligation to his John Schlesinger picture, "Pacific Heights,"  also produced by Sackheim, he was not available to do the final polish. Badham  and I brought in Jeff Reno and Ron Osborne of "Moonlighting" fame, who ran the  final leg of the race.  </P> <P> Final credit is still being arbitrated by the Writers Guild of America.  </P> <P> I'm sure The Times didn't have enough column inches to explain all this.  </P> <P> A movie grows and changes like a Ouija board prodded by a thousand hands: It's  half talent, half voodoo -- but John and I would not have been able to do the  work we did without the fine foundation laid by Dobbs, Sackheim and Pyne, and  we wanted to set that record straight.  </P> <P> ROB COHEN, Producer  </P> <P> Universal City  </P></p>

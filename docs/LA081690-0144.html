And the city  may be home to the nation's top Babe Ruth team as well.  </P> <P> On Friday night in Carson City, Nev., a team from Oakland swept a doubleheader  from La Crescenta to win the Babe Ruth Western Regional and advance to the  World Series this week in Jamestown, N.Y.  </P> <P> The team of 13-year-olds from La Crescenta had entered the contest from the  winners' bracket and needed just one victory to advance to the World Series.  </P> <P> Oakland, however, won, 2-0, in the first game and came back with a 7-2 victory  to claim the title.  </P> <P> Championship drive: Two Glendale-area softball teams are competing in division  World Series championships this week at Kalamazoo, Mich.  </P> <P> The Centennial League all-stars (13-to-15-year-olds) advanced to the Senior  Division World Series by sweeping two games from Red Bluff, Calif., in the  Western Regional last week at Pinole, Calif.  </P> <P> Centennial lost to Georgetown, Mich., 1-0, Monday in an opening-round game at  the World Series. They played a losers' bracket game Wednesday, but results  were not available at press time.  </P> <P> The Liberty League all-stars (10-to-12-years-old) advanced to the series by  defeating Quito, Calif., 2-0, at Pinole.  </P> <P> Liberty played defending champion Naples, Fla., in an opening-round game  Tuesday. Results were not available at press time.  </P> <P> Homecoming: Cal Linam, a former cross-country and track standout at Glendale  College and Cal State Long Beach, has been named cross-country coach and  assistant track coach at Burbank High.  </P> <P> Linam, 28, succeeds Dave Kemp, 51, who coached at Burbank from 1974-86 and  1987-90. Kemp, Linam's father-in-law, will take over the sophomore football  program and continue to coach golf.  </P> <P> The Western State Conference runner-up in the steeplechase in 1983 for Glendale  College, Linam has a best of 9 minutes 4.4 seconds in the event. He was also a  member of the 1981 Vaquero cross-country team that placed third in the state.  </P> <P> Linam, who taught English at Hoover High last year, will teach freshman and  sophomore English at Burbank.  </P> <P> Kirby Lee contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Clash of the cans - Why the aluminium and steel industries are doing battle over the drinks market A fierce clash of the cans is intensifying in the UK drinks market as rival steel and aluminium manufacturers champion the respective commercial and environmental merits of their products. The conflict, which has simmered away for many years, has hotted up in recent days as the tinplate industry has launched a novel push-button 'Ecotop' opening system allowing a carbonated beverage can to be manufactured entirely from steel. Amid much publicity, the steel industry is promising full-scale production of a lightweight, environmentally-friendly container - known as the Ultimate Can - by 1994. 'It is the beverage can of the future made from recyclable, energy-efficient steel,' says British Steel Tinplate, which has spent more than Pounds 25m developing the new packaging technology. 'This is steel waging war against aluminium.' Not surprising, the aluminium can industry dismisses the threat almost disdainfully. It does so from a position of strength. Although the cost advantages of steel have allowed it to dominate the food can market, the aluminium industry has won an ever-increasing share of the more technically complex beverage drinks market in recent years. This year the Aluminium Can Recycling Association (Acra) believes it will capture 60 per cent of the market, forecasting a rise to almost 80 per cent next year as big consumer products companies switch to their material. 'We believe that steel technology is old technology. They are a long way behind and are now desperately trying to catch up,' says Alex Griffin, national manager of Acra. Part of the skirmish is being fought over the battleground of the environment. Through marketing campaigns - which are best described as canny  -the aluminium industry has succeeded in persuading the British public of its own environmental virtues. With 350 recycling centres, 1,160 supermarket can collection points and high-profile campaigns on the Blue Peter television show, the industry has largely succeeded in assuring shoppers that aluminium cans are 'green' by recording a recycling rate of 63 per cent. While such campaigns have big marketing benefits they also make sense for purely commercial reasons. Griffin says it costs between Dollars 8m to Dollars 10m a tonne to install and operate the plant capacity necessary to produce aluminium cans from primary materials but only Dollars 1m a tonne to produce them from recycled cans. The high intrinsic value of aluminium (with factory gate prices of Pounds 700 a tonne) has pulled the metal up the collection chain - in contrast to low-value bulk packaging materials such as paper which are more cheaply dumped in landfills. The recycling infrastructure is also in place with the Alcan Recycling plant in Warrington, big enough to re-use 80 per cent of the current aluminium UK can market. A lack of recycled materials, however, has so far meant that it has had to import cans from the US to run the plant at full capacity - a move which is of highly dubious environmental value. Yet the steel industry is quietly miffed that the aluminium industry has been able to parade its green credentials quite so effectively and is beginning to become more assertive about its own merits. BST argues that currently 'it takes 50 per cent less energy to make a steel can than an aluminium one' and points to the continuing environmental benefits of steel's development programme. It believes that next year it will be able to reduce the weight of steel beverage cans by 20 per cent with a further 10 per cent reduction possible by 1994. This will reduce the metal thickness from 0.27mm to 0.22mm. Unlike aluminium, steel cans are also easy to pull out of the waste stream by the simple means of magnetic extraction. In some towns - such as Edmonton and Coventry - this has led to recycling rates in excess of 80 per cent. The national average, however, is just 10 per cent because of the low number of local authorities that have yet invested in a Pounds 15,000 magnetic extraction line. BST concedes the industry still has a lot to do to promote the environmental benefits of steel. 'It is all about innovation and getting the consumer excited,' it says. David Knowles, director of the Can Makers trade association, says the battle between the two metals has been particularly sharp in the UK because the can market is comparatively big - accounting for 35 per cent of the European total - and both products are used on a widespread scale. 'The UK has historically used both aluminium and steel which is unusual. Other countries have been dominated by one metal or another,' he says. The US and Italy, for example, use mainly aluminium cans; Germany and France overwhelmingly use tinplate. The BST 'Ecotop' system marks an interesting development because previously the vast majority of steel beverage cans had to use ends made of aluminium, which can be easily 'scored' to produce the ubiquitous 'stay-on' ring-pulls. However, other companies, such as the Franco-British CMB, are experimenting with steel ends which they believe may yield considerable cost benefits. A previous trial of steel openings in Germany four years ago met with mixed success, but BST claims the 'Ecotop' system - which has been jointly developed with the Dutch Hoogovens company and the German Rasselstein group  -is a technically better product. The top will be used on 130m cans in the Netherlands this year and on a very small scale in the Spar grocery chain in the UK. Bill Stratton, marketing services controller of the Spar grocery chain, says the company is selling 100,000 cans of own-label lemonade with the new 'ecotop'. The experiment started in March; almost all the cans are likely to have been sold by the end of the month. 'Initially when it appeared in the stores people were saying that the can was not complete and the ring pull must have fallen off. But it is simply a case of educating the customer,' he says. Ultimately, it will be the consumer who decides the fate of the beverage can market in the UK by expressing their preferences via the buying orders of the drinks companies. But it should be noted that some environmental groups would rather 'educate' consumers out of using cans altogether, advocating the use of refillable drinks containers rather than 'one-way' systems.</p>

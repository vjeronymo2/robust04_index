			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 21 Apr--A 48-hour strike in all lignite  mines, organized by the Solidarity trade unions, began at 0700  hours. Four hours after the protest started, Miroslaw  Maksymiuk. of the national load-dispatching unit [krajowa  dyspozycja mocy], told a PAP journalist: "Nothing is happening.  We are meeting the entire demand for electricity. If it stops  coming from lignite-fired power stations, we still have other  sources of energy."    The extraction and consumption of lignite dropped in recent  years from 73.8 million tonnes in 1988 to 66.8 million in 1992.  Power and heat and power-generating plants located near lignite  mines are using approximately 98 percent of all extracted  lignite.</p>

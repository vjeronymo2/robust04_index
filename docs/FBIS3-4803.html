			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Japan's foreign exchange  reserves jumped 2.46 billion dollars in February to 98.43  billion dollars, posting the fourth consecutive month-to-month  increase, the Finance Ministry said Tuesday [1 March].    Market dealers said they had anticipated the surge as the  Bank of Japan was seen buying the dollar actively to stem its  plunge against the yen in the reporting month.    The foreign reserves include convertible foreign currencies,  gold and international monetary fund special drawing rights.    The official, as usual, declined to comment on details and  reasons for the change in the foreign reserves.    Market experts closely follow fluctuations in foreign  reserves as evidence of intervention by the Bank of Japan.  Dealers said the central bank bought billions of dollars in  February to stop the yen's rise, boosted by speculation over  U.S. comments tolerating a stronger yen after the February 11  failure of the Japan-U.S. "framework" trade talks.    The ministry official said the dollar started the month at  108.00 yen and ended at 104.30 yen, ranging from 101.90 yen  posted on February 15 to 109.16 yen marked on February 7.    Japan remained the world's largest holder of foreign  reserves  for the fourth month in a row, amassing 95.6 billion dollars as  of December, the most recent comparable figures with other  nations.    Taiwan came in second with 84.5 billion dollars as of  November.    In December, Germany posted 82.5 billion dollars, the United  States 74.9 billion dollars and Spain 41.8 billion dollars, the  official said.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Shortages and Vicious Circles"] </F>   [Text] As the Workplace Parliament becomes a more common  occurrence, more often than not the analysis does not stop at  the harmful effects of the financial imbalance, but goes on to  consider proposals concerning production, efficiency, the  functioning of the business system, and the serious problems  involved in stimulating work.    This qualitative change in the popular debate has occurred  because it has become apparent that it is the shortage of  supply, not an exaggerated increase in income, that has  essentially created the phenomenon of excess liquidity, which is  having serious economic and social repercussions.    People are becoming more and more aware that, although the  abrupt decrease in supply is associated with external factors  (the disruption of Cuba's economic and commercial ties with the  former socialist world and the reinforcement of the blockade),  the recovery of supply now depends above all on our ability to  develop internal capacities for revitalization and economic  growth.    And it is becoming clear that completely overcoming the  shortage is not something that can be accomplished merely by  manipulating certain variables that might reduce solvent demand,  such as prices, taxes, and other monetary factors. Rather, it  has to be accomplished by making positive changes in the most  concrete factor in the economy, the place where the production  of value is verified.    We must recall, to avoid harboring unfounded hopes, that any  financial measures that may be taken will not have an immediate  or absolute effect of boosting production or increasing supply,  because their function is to serve as a bridge to provide access  to revitalization.    And it should also be emphasized that it is unreasonable to  expect the elimination of the shortage to occur uniformly, all  at once, and equally for all citizens.    To understand this assertion, it is not enough to say that  egalitarianism is a tendency that we must banish; we have to  start from the notion that Cuba does not now have any external  financing that would enable it to put to work a broad range of  idle productive capacities in the short term, or to increase  supply and stimulate work through consumption, as was done in  the 1970's when external financing made it possible to create  the parallel market.    And that is the vicious circle that workers see when they  realize that the internal financial imbalance and low  consumption, equitably distributed, erode the motivating force  of wages, which is a factor that tends to weaken productive  efficiency.    To break this vicious circle, it is imperative that we  continue the policy of distributing available resources  appropriately to certain sectors of the economy where spending  will have the maximum multiplier effect. These sectors must be  given not only the necessary supplies for production, but also a  complement of consumer goods so that the workers can spend their  income and thus counter the pernicious effect of shortages.    We are talking, then, about a crucial measure that is in the  process of being implemented and should figure more prominently  in the deliberations of the Workplace Parliaments, even though  it is not on the agenda for the next session of the National  Assembly and is not strictly a financial matter.    But this is an economic policy that also requires a broad  consensus, given that our limited resources must be channeled  preferentially toward activities such as sugar, mining, tobacco,  coffee, oil drilling, biotechnology, the manufacture of medical  and pharmaceutical products, tourism, agricultural food  production, and others that directly generate foreign exchange  income or are essential for the country's economic functioning  and social life, such as public health and education.    Applying this policy in a consistent manner would promote  the  stabilization of those sectors, and would gradually create the  surpluses needed for the recovery of other sectors, which would  contribute to broader reproduction until the recovery of the  national economy and the normal development of society became a  reality.    In these priority sectors, which can play the role of  "engines" of the economy, in addition to greater stimulation of  work, the improvement of business practices must be established  as an extensible premise. These sectors must have enough  decisionmaking power and autonomy to ensure, without excuses,  reasonable levels and increases in economic efficiency.    But it is our contention that this viable solution requires  a  consensus, because the allocation of resources to these  multiplier activities is limited by the austere sacrifice  required of other sectors, which, for a time, cannot aspire to  the same levels of consumption.    This limitation, which is qualified by the national  commitment not to leave any sector of the Cuban population out  in the cold, makes it necessary to consider the decisive role  that moral, ideological, and political factors must continue to  play in the revitalization of the country's economy.    For that very reason, it is of vital importance that all  workers be able to understand thoroughly the complexity of our  situation, the viability of possible solutions, and the  orientation toward changes that will help us win, little by  little, the battle for efficiency and economic recovery.</p>

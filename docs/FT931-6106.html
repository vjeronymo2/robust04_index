			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Jobless may mix benefit with work to provide programmes combining temporary work with job-hunting - is being planned as a response to rising unemployment. Instead of offering simply a programme of community work - as happens under Employment Action - or a training course, new schemes targeted at the long-term unemployed and 18 to 24-year-olds and involving 'some element of compulsion' would offer a mix of three days a week on such activities with two days a week spent looking for work. Extra impetus has been given to work on the initiative by Mr John Major's remarks about workfare-type systems in his speech to the Carlton Club last month. Ministers also believe there is currently a cross-party mood in favour of ensuring that the unemployed are active, which makes it possible to move swiftly. An important element will be greater flexibility in meeting individual needs, already reflected to some extent in the Training for Work scheme, which will start from the beginning of April. This brings Employment Action and Employment Training into a single Pounds 972m programme with 320,000 places a year, intended to enable the Tecs to provide more individually tailored opportunities. The Tecs themselves would welcome the sort of initiative being planned. The programme would be announced in the December Budget and ministers believe it could take effect quickly. While the Tecs have assumed that they would be responsible for any new locally managed schemes, ministers are considering whether the task should be given to the Employment Service. This second stage would follow the immediate moves on unemployment signalled for the March 16 Budget. These include a slight relaxation of the rule on the number of hours that someone can study before becoming ineligible for unemployment benefit. Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, has already been to the United States to observe unemployment programmes there. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, is to make a similar visit this summer.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> THE OUTDOORS;  </P> <P> OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS;  </P> <P> BLUE MARLIN ARRIVING IN BIG NUMBERS OFF BAJA PENINSULA  </P> <P> One of the biggest blue marlins ever taken from the waters off the Baja  Peninsula highlighted the species' springtime arrival, which has spiced up some  of the best striped marlin fishing in years.  </P> <P> Striped marlin are apparently so plentiful in some areas -- basically from Los  Frailes to the Gorda Banks -- that hotel boats are averaging up to 18 hookups a  day.  </P> <P> Farther south, in the Cabo San Lucas area, boats are averaging just over two  billfish a day. "They're biting not too far away," Mario Gonzalez, a Cabo San  Lucas panga owner, said by telephone Tuesday. Gonzalez said fishermen aboard  his panga have been catching most of their fish two to three miles south of the  marina.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, boats from as far north as Rancho Buena Vista on the East Cape are  reportedly making the two-hour ride to the Gorda Banks area to get in on the  bite. "Conditions are just prime," John Doughty of Bisbee's Tackle in Newport  Beach said. "Some fishermen are seeing 100 fish a day."  </P> <P> Jack Haige, visiting from Norwalk, Conn., and fishing aboard the Juanita V near  the outer Gorda Bank, will take the one fish he caught June 23, a 959-pound  blue marlin that took him to hours to land.  </P> <P> Haige trolled a 15-pound dorado he caught earlier to attract the fish, which he  reeled in on 80-pound tackle.  </P> <P> Sport fishermen at the popular resort have yet to catch a blue marlin weighing  more than 1,000 pounds, but several have been close.  </P> <P> Jim Edmondson, Region 5 manager for the conservationist California Trout  organization, calls Crowley Lake "the black hole of fishery management" --  meaning that nobody really knows what's going on beneath the surface of the  Eastern Sierra reservoir.  </P> <P> With the balance of the Crowley catch shifting in recent years from brown trout  to Sacramento perch, the Department of Fish and Game wants to know what happens  to the 350,000 sub-catchable trout it plants in Crowley each year. In  collaboration with Cal Trout, the DFG has launched a fish-clipping program in  hopes of finding out.  </P> <P> Volunteers at the Fish Springs Hatchery near Big Pine recently clipped the fins  of 17,969 Kamloop, Coleman and Hot Creek rainbows -- a different fin for each  strain, so they can be identified when caught.  </P> <P> "We have to do 25% (of 350,000) to make it viable," Edmondson said, adding that  the purpose is "to determine which are best suited to survive."  </P> <P> Curtis Milliron, a fishery biologist and project leader for the DFG, said,  "We've had fin-clipped fish going into Crowley for many years," but not in  enough numbers to provide a solid analysis."  </P> <P> Fin-clipping is scheduled to resume this weekend and that of June 17-18.  </P> <P> Efforts are under way to save the financially troubled hyperbaric chamber on  Santa Catalina Island, one of the most popular diving areas in the country.  </P> <P> The chamber, operated by USC, has treated 591 divers since it went into  operation in 1974, and many feel that without it there would be a dramatic  increase in diving-related fatalities.  </P> <P> "We save lives," Director Andrew Pilmanis insists. "A lot of people would die  unless a chamber is close by . . . we've had people come in here in full  (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and they walked away."  </P> <P> Pilmanis said that during a busy summer weekend divers make anywhere from 2,000  to 3,000 dives off the Catalina shoreline. The next closest chamber is at  Northridge Medical Center.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County has provided funding since 1974, but because of budget  restraints it can presently cover only about half the operational costs,  according to report by USC's Hancock Institute for Marine Studies.  </P> <P> The rest comes primarily from private donations and diving-safety programs  offered by the volunteers at the Catalina Chamber.  </P> <P> Briefly  </P> <P> National Fishing Week will be observed June 5-11, with 27 states offering  residents a chance to fish without purchasing a fishing license. California's  "free fishing day" is June 10. . . . Proceeds from the first annual Santa  Monica Bay "Top Rod" Fishing Tournament, hosted June 4 by the Santa Monica  Yacht Club Anglers, will go to Heal the Bay, a non-profit organization  dedicated to a pollution-free Santa Monica Bay. . . .

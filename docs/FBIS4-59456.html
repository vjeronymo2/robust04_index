			<p>BFN     [Text] A Palestinian police force crossed the Jordan River  today to take control of the Jericho area on the West Bank, thus  marking the end of 27 years of Israeli occupation. The first  regiment was made up of 20 police; the rest will follow.    From King Husayn bridge, our correspondent Yusuf Faraj  reports:    [Begin recording] [Faraj] At 1300 today, a 20-man advance  party of the Palestinian National Security Forces crossed King  Husayn Bridge to Jericho on Palestinian territory, following a  five-day wait at a point close to the bridge. The crossing  followed talks between top Palestinian and Israeli negotiators.  The regiment will take up position at points already agreed to  by the sides.    [Jamil Tarifi, head of the Palestinian side to the Liaison  Committee with Israel] The first regiment will conduct joint  patrols with the Israelis in the Jericho area.    [Faraj] And the second regiment?    [Tarifi] The second regiment is scheduled to travel straight  to Gaza today to undertake security responsibilities in  conjunction with forces that crossed via the Rafah border point.  The forces due to cross tomorrow will handle security duties in  Jericho. We are slated to take over all civilian duties in  Jericho.    [Major General Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian  Security Forces] God willing, tomorrow will see us in complete  control over the southern region from the Gaza Valley in the  north to Rafah in the south. Then we will have control over the  northern part of Gaza, which, God willing, will be completed  next Wednesday [18 May].    [Faraj] How do you feel on this occasion?    [Yusuf] I am gripped by unusual feelings. The sight of our  kinsfolk celebrating is unbelievable. It is a historic,  unusual, special day. On this occasion, we thank our brothers  here in Jordan for the training facilities they made available  to us. We are particularly grateful to his majesty the king,  who yesterday visited and inspected the units and extended  further moral and material support. This country is ours and  its people our kinsfolk. We have always been family, and we  share a common future, God willing. [end recording]</p>

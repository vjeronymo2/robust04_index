			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries subdued as prices firm slightly IN THE ABSENCE of fresh important economic data, the US Treasury market remained subdued yesterday, although prices did firm slightly in light trading. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/16 at 102 3/32 , yielding 7.443 per cent. Prices at the short end of the market were also firmer, with the two-year note up  1/8 at 99 25/32 , yielding 4.725 per cent. The main feature of the session was short-covering by dealers, which gave prices at both ends of the maturity spectrum a modest lift. The only economic release of the day - a 0.3 per cent decline in business inventories  -was in line with expectations. Prices at the long end would have been higher but for the Tennessee Valley Authority's offering of Dollars 1bn in 30-year bonds. There was some modest selling of Treasury bonds by dealers. Short-dated French government bonds closed lower yesterday as the franc continued to come under pressure in the foreign exchange markets and short term interest rates edged higher. The Bank of France and the Bundesbank intervened to support the French currency, preventing it from breaking through the level of FFr3.42 to the D-Mark, dealers said. The Franc/D-Mark exchange rate was quoted at 3.4175 by late afternoon. Three-month money rates rose from a spread of 10-11 3/16 per cent to 10 7/8  11 5/16 per cent. Among short-dated issues, the yield on the 8 per cent bond due 1994 moved from 8.34 per cent to 8.38 per cent. Longer-dated issues ended unchanged on the day. The French Treasury announced that it would auction FFr14bn to FFr16bn of two and five-year notes tomorrow. REPORTS that Mr Bettino Craxi, leader of the Italian socialist party, is under investigation in connection with a political corruption scandal, sent Italian government bonds sharply lower yesterday, with long bonds losing a point. The May 2002 bond fell from a high of 93.80 to 92.75 while the futures contract tumbled from 93.99 to 92.93. Elsewhere in Europe, German government bonds edged up in thin trade, closing at the high of the day. The market paid little heed to comments from Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, who said he expected M3 money supply to grow more slowly in November and December, after October's figure of a 10.3 per cent annualised rise. Mr Issing added that German inflation was still high and unlikely to ease in coming months. THE RELEASE of better-than-expected economic data helped to depress UK government bond prices, and longer-dated gilts lost nearly half a point. Dealers said the producer prices and industrial production data released yesterday were stronger than expected, wiping out hopes of an imminent cut in the base rate. Producer output prices showed a rise of 0.3 per cent in November from October, and input prices showed a rise of 2.4 per cent. The Liffe gilt futures contract slipped from 99.28 to 99.18, while the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 fell from 109 1/32 to 108 19/32 . JAPANESE government bonds opened on a weak note, but the release of disappointing economic data helped to lift prices later in the day and bonds ended slightly firmer or little changed. Bond prices continued their downward drift early in the trading session with the futures contract falling from 107.46 at the opening to a low of 107.28. However, dealers said news that machinery orders for October showed a fall of 23.7 per cent year-on-year may have helped to support prices as the fall in orders was bigger than expected. The futures contract closed unchanged at 107.46 while in the cash market, the yield on the No 145 JGB moved from 4.645 per cent at the opening to close at 4.625 per cent.</p>

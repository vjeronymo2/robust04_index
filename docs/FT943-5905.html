			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: BBL posts 26% rise to BFr3.85bn at midway Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL), one of the big three Belgian banks, yesterday an-nounced a 26 per cent rise in consolidated net profits for the first half-year, of BFr3.85bn (Dollars 118m) against BFr3.05bn in the first half of 1993. Announcing the result, Mr Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer, chief executive, said that BBL's 'battle is won,' after the black year of 1992. BBL cut its dividend in 1992 after having to make heavy provisions for bad loans, and a bid to link up with Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch financial services group, collapsed. Since then, there has been a clean-out of the foreign network's loan portfolio, where most of the bad debts were lodged, and a much more rigorous assessment of credit risk, especially in lending to the private sector. BBL earned a BFr392m profit from its European subsidiaries in the first half, against losses for the whole of last year of BFr942m. Private sector loans, meanwhile, rose only 3 per cent in the first six months of 1994, compared with a 12 per cent increase in lending to the public sector. Provisions for loans and investments fell 28 per cent to BFr4.47bn, against BFr6.21bn in the first half of last year. Mr Cardon expected similar earnings in the second half, and total provisions for the year of the order of BFr5bn, half 1992 levels.</p>

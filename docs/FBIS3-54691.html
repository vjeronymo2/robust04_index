			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with cosmonaut Valeriy Baberdin by Sergey </F> Turchenko; place and date not given: "Unemployment in the  Skies"]    [Text] Our country has always been a great space power.  No one can, or ever will, dispute its pioneering role in space.  Admittedly, this applies to the "accursed communist past." The  blessed "democratic" present has relegated the state to the  backwaters of space research. The year now ending -- the year  of the triumph of Yeltsinism -- has been particularly dreadful  in this respect. State programs for the development of  cosmonautics have totally withered away. The "Energiya" Science  and Production Association, that major achievement of  contemporary civilization, is on the verge of bankruptcy. There  is unemployment among cosmonauts. The end of the year has  brought a further extremely cruel blow directed against the 21st  century: the signing by U.S. Vice President Gore and  Chernomyrdin of what is for Russia a shackling agreement on  creating a joint orbital station that will be the biggest ever.  This was the subject with which we kicked off our conversation  with cosmonaut and researcher Colonel Valeriy Vasilyevich  Baberdin.    [Baberdin] If you look no further ahead than today, the  agreement seems to be to Russia's advantage. The economy is in  such a plight that the state is unable to properly subsidize the  space industry. Our superhigh-technology production units are  coming to a standstill or are on the verge of shutting down, and  tens of thousands of highly professional specialists are  threatened with unemployment. And now the Americans are  offering $400 million to build the "Alpha" orbital station, as  they call it. This may breathe life into our space complex for  a while. But the question is the price we will pay for this  temporary revival. Let us try to weigh up everything.    The development of cosmonautics in the USSR and the United  States took different routes. The Americans got carried away  with the shuttle and did not develop orbital stations. Now they  have realized how necessary these are for research activity.  They have calculated, pondered, and reflected: It is too  expensive to start from scratch, it is considerably cheaper to  utilize Soviet experience and potential, which are now available  to them.    First, America does not have the technology for constructing  stations in orbit. Only we have it. Second, the Americans have  not developed sufficiently cheap and at the same time efficient  carrier rockets to take the components and modules of a station  into orbit. We still have the world's best fleet of such  rockets. Third, they have no methods for training cosmonauts for  long stints in an orbital station. Their missions last two  weeks, ours last six months, a year, or even more. All these  unique technologies and methods will go to them as a free gift  together with the station we have contracted to build.    [Turchenko] But "Alpha" is intended as a joint venture, so  we too will use the station....    [Baberdin] I'm afraid there's a lot of eyewash here, just as  there is with the numerous commercial joint ventures that have  proliferated in Russia. It's not a matter of my own misgivings.  Many specialists in Zvezdnyy [Gorodok] and the "Energiya"  Science and Production Association are voicing serious fears in  this regard. I received confirmation of them the other day from  a conversation with a U.S. TV journalist specializing in space  topics. He was frank. The United States is telling taxpayers:  Look, Gore managed to reach agreement with Chernomyrdin and we  have saved a lot of money. In the long term control of "Alpha"  will be transferred to Houston, and missions to it will mostly  be flown by shuttles on U.S. programs.    [Turchenko] So do we risk entering the 21st century with  our main flight control center in Houston and an auxiliary one  in Kaliningrad outside Moscow?    [Baberdin] It is even possible our center may become merely  a museum, like the Cosmonaut Training Center. According to this  project of the century, which will take practically all our  space resources, Houston will also train our payload  specialists, as the Americans call them. The point is that in  the shuttle there is an upper deck housing the crew and a lower  deck for the "passengers" -- the payload specialists who are  being taken to work at the station. I am afraid we may all find  ourselves on the lower deck of the U.S. craft in both the  literal and metaphorical senses.    [Turchenko] Well, we are going to pay all too high a price  for these $400 million. Incidentally, the figure is noteworthy.  That is precisely the size of the contract that was being  readied with India for the sale of carrier rocket technologies.  But the Americans twisted our government's arm and forced it to  abandon this contract.    [Baberdin] Correct. From that same conversation with an  American TV journalist I learned that the United States is using  "Alpha" to harness us to it mainly in order to prevent the  spread of space technology. Obviously we lost nothing as a  result of the Indian option, we merely gained, including that  same sum of 400 million, whereas now.... There is also  something else that is clear to me as a cosmonaut awaiting his  turn for a mission: The "Alpha" project promises even more  persistent unemployment among Russian cosmonauts.    [Turchenko] To what extent is that a factor at present?    [Baberdin] I cannot give precise figures, but I can offer a  broad estimate. t present among cosmonauts alone there are  around 15-16 people awaiting their turn for a mission. But  there are also sizable reserve groups of specialists who have  completed the training course. I will mention just a few. A  detachment of women cosmonauts was once created on the basis of  the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems. The intention  was to put an "all-female crew" into space. Economic problems  made all this a remote prospect. A group of young scientists  underwent training for research work in space. They too are no  longer wanted. The military department designed its own "Almaz"  orbital station. A subunit of military engineers was trained to  work on it. Just a handful of them went into space; the rest  had no luck. There are doctors in a similar position. The Test  Flight Institute picked a subunit made up of the best test  pilots and trained them for two years on "Buran" and...a halt  has now been called. So just estimate how many space unemployed  we have, so to speak. At the same time we have been forced to  sell places in craft and the orbital station to foreign  cosmonauts.    [Turchenko] But Russia at least has access to the results of  their research?    [Baberdin] No. All materials are stored on diskette and our  foreign colleagues take the experimental data with them. The  only plus is that they usually leave us the research apparatus  they have used in token of gratitude. Moreover, in preparing  this apparatus for missions, our specialists acquire skills in  using it.    [Turchenko] The year 1993 is drawing to its end.... Our  country always used to proudly sum up the results of the space  year, which were usually truly impressive. What about nowadays?    [Baberdin] There is a certain amount of momentum from past  achievements and successes. As is well known, for several  months know Vasiliy Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov have been  working selflessly in orbit. But this year there was an  incident that could not have happened before. Viktor Afanasyev,  Yuriy Usachev, and Valeriy Polyakov were supposed to go up to  the "Mir" station back in the fall. But the carrier rocket was  not ready. The "Progress" plant had made the casing, but the  engines.... The Samara Engine Plant had ceased producing them  because it was on the verge of bankruptcy, like "Progress,"  incidentally. Now they have found in store Russian State  Committee for Hydrometeorology carrier rockets designed to  launch "Meteor" satellites. Attempts are being made to adapt  one of them for a manned craft. But it is capable of placing  only a two-man crew in orbit. We have been forced to postpone  the mission until 1994. A search for a solution to the problem  is now under way.    [Turchenko] Yes, this is indeed a new chapter in our  cosmonautics. What are your forecasts for the future?    [Baberdin] Until we grow a little wiser, we will build a  station in order to develop American space travel. Such is the  lot of a state that has suddenly decided to kiss goodbye to its  own great history and to the status of a world space power and  is voluntarily following in the wake of foreign interests.</p>

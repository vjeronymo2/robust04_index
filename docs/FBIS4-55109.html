			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 9 May (MTI) -- Hungarian people wanted  something different than what the Federation of Young Democrats  (Fidesz) stands for," was how Fidesz chief Viktor Orban saw the  worse-than-expected results of his party in the first round of  national elections.    To reporters on Monday, Orban said the Central European  trend, whereby the first freely elected government is unable to  grapple with the economic inheritance of the past, is  continuing. He said the Polish scenario happened in Hungary,  and the strategy of the Young Democrats to prevent this was  unsuccessful. He was confident that the voting public wanted  radical change, and change in the political elite, which is why  the parties that did not promise this fared more poorly than  expected.    According to Orban, liberal cooperation can be upheld in the  second round of the elections, but will not have a marked  impact, partly due to the poorer results of the Young Democrats.  Orban said he would not resign, but the Fidesz's congress this  summer will be able to implement personnel changes, although his  mandate originally runs for two years, until 1995.</p>

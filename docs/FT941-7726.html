			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Macy in rescue talks to block Federated R H Macy, the US department store group that has been operating under chapter 11 protection from its creditors for more than two years, yesterday said it had started talks with General Electric Capital and Fidelity Investments about a possible rescue. The rescue could block a rival move by Federated Department Stores group, owner of the Bloomingdale's department stores, which has procured a slice of Macy's secured debt with the aim of taking over the company. GE Capital, an investment subsidiary of General Electric, is already one of Macy's principal shareholders, while Fidelity Investments, a company that takes stakes in potential bankruptcy turnrounds, holds Dollars 490m worth of Macy's bank debt. Late yesterday, Macy won a four-month extension of the time during which it has the exclusive right to come up with a reorganisation plan. A federal bankruptcy court appointed Mr Cyrus Vance, a former US secretary of state, to mediate. Macy is now expected to continue discussions with GE Capital and Fidelity in the hope of engineering a rescue that will preserve the group's continuing independence under the existing management. Federated has made clear it wants to merge Macy's 111 stores with its own. Its position as a creditor gives it the power to veto any rival scheme - but if Macy and its allies come up with a plan that pays off Federated's debt, Federated will cease to have any role in the proceedings. ConAgra, which for years financed acquisitions with stock, says it is more likely to pay cash, Reuter reports. Mr Stephen Key, executive vice-president and chief financial officer, yesterday told analysts that ConAgra, the nation's largest independent food company, would be comfortable with acquisitions exceeding Dollars 1bn, combining cash flow and debt capacity.</p>

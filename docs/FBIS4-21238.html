That is what greeted the government's long-awaited drug  policy review yesterday.    There is inadequate financing. The government does not  seriously come to grips with the stress strategy used by the  police. Control is not scaled down. There are no new ideas  here.    These harsh words came from treatment providers, drug  addicts, doctors, and several politicians when the health,  social affairs, and justice ministers presented the government's  long-awaited report yesterday.    There was especially harsh criticism of the lack of  financial  support for the initiatives.    Among other things the report says that home communities  will  be compelled to finance more county treatment slots ``in such a  way that it does not lead to additional total public  expenditure.''    ``That is pure pyrotechnics. A dead addict is the cheapest  addict for municipalities. Additional treatment will always cost  more--even if efficiency is increased. If money does not  accompany the initiatives they cannot amount to anything,'' said  Peter Ege, a welfare doctor in Copenhagen.    The Medical Association is also disappointed:    ``The financial support is inadequate. It is necessary to  spend money to ensure better living conditions for drug addicts.  The government has repressed the idea that not all drug addicts  can be made drug-free, with or without methadone,'' said Medical  Association chairman Torben Pedersen.    The government plans to get its ideas funded in the upcoming  economic talks with the counties and municipalities. But the  Progress Party and SF [Socialist People's Party] do not believe  in that solution:    ``The state itself should earmark an amount in the  billion-kroner class to go directly to treatment centers,'' said  Tom Behnke, drug policy spokesman for the Progress Party. SF  also thinks the state should lead the way.    In addition to financing, the control policy was sharply  criticized.    ``If control efforts are given a lower priority many drug  addicts will have a more tranquil and stable life while society  will have less crime and unrest,'' the chairman of the Medical  Association maintained.  <H5>  Confrontation With Stress Strategy </H5>   His attitude was supported by a broad circle of treatment  providers and judges BERLINGSKE TIDENDE spoke to.    ``The police effort should be changed so that they no longer  focus on individual addicts. This has not produced results,''  said Hans Henrik Brydensholt, a judge at Eastern High Court.    But he also thinks the report sets the stage for a  confrontation with the stress strategy later on.    ``The report is a big step in the right direction. After 25  years of emphasizing control, I think the politicians have  realized that the drug problem must be solved through treatment  and prevention,'' said Brydensholt.    Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social Democrat) himself  wants  to change the effort on the street, but said this can only  happen gradually--in parallel with stepping up treatment.    Conservatives and Liberals expressed moderate support for  the  government's report.    But the parties think the police effort should be increased  and that stronger steps should be taken against hashish smoking  among young people.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Suchard in Hungary deal JACOBS SUCHARD, the Swiss foods group, is acquiring Csemege Confectionery, Hungary's largest chocolate producer. Suchard is buying the company, with an annual capacity of 15,000 tonnes, to take a dominant position in the growing Hungarian bar and tablet chocolate market. The Swiss company, a subsidiary of Philip Morris of the US, will modernise the plant. Executives at Suchard would not disclose financial details. Suchard acquired Csemege from Stollwerck, the German food company. Stollwerck earlier this year won control of BEV, Hungary's largest confectioner and parent of Csemege. BEV had been producing Suchard's Milka brand under licence. Suchard also took over Csemege's coffee-producing joint venture by buying out BEV's shareholding.</p>

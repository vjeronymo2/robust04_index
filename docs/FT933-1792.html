			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Coal to be split up for sell-off: Government decision goes against management wishes BRITISH COAL is to be offered for sale as five regional businesses, contrary to the wishes of its management, which wanted to keep it together. Announcing preliminary details of the privatisation yesterday, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said that structure was most likely to attract buyers. But he emphasised that a purchaser could bid for any number of parcels, so British Coal could still be sold in one piece. 'We want to give purchasers the opportunity to decide the best way to purchase these assets,' he said. A privatisation bill will be put to the next parliamentary session so that the sale can be made by early summer 1994. The five regions into which British Coal will be divided for the sale will be Scotland, Wales, the north-east and the central coalfield, which will be divided into two parts based on Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. The businesses will be offered to trade buyers, but government finance is also available to help management and employees put together buy-out teams. All bids will be assessed 'on their merits', Mr Eggar said, although he declined to specify the criteria the government would use. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman, said: 'It will be interesting to see, following their assessment of the business and the various risks involved, whether prospective purchasers will be seeking combinations of sale packages when they submit offers to the government.' Mr Eggar said he had already received expressions of interest reaching into 'double figures'. Several small and medium-sized UK mining companies confirmed that they would be bidding. 'This structure is just what we wanted,' said Mr Richard Budge, chief executive of RJB Mining. Trade unions are also preparing bids. The UDM, the breakaway miners' union, said it was working on a bid together with East Midlands Electricity and an unnamed foreign partner. A threat to the sale emerged yesterday, however, when Nacods, the mining supervisors' union, was allowed by the courts to challenge a radical overhaul of health and safety regulations, which is essential to privatisation. Nacods said Mr Justice Popplewell, a High Court judge, had granted leave for a judicial review because the reforms might conflict with the health and safety law principle that changes must not lead to a deterioration in safety rules. The reforms, which have already been enacted and are due to take effect on October 1, abolish the function of deputy, the supervisory workers represented by Nacods. They also replace some statutes with codes of practice and give mine managers more discretion over applying safety rules. Mr Peter McNestry, leader of Nacods, said: 'We think we have an arguable case and we can prove it to the benefit of everyone working in the industry. These changes are not as good as the present regulations.' British Coal said it would have to go ahead and implement the changes, although they would not be ready by October 1 in certain pits.

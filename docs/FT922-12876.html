			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's warns on top two Norwegian banks CHRISTIANIA Bank and Den norske Bank (DnB), Norway's two biggest banks, were not likely to break even in 1992, according to a report by Moody's Investor Services, the US-based debt rating company. Last year Christiania was acquired by the government when its share capital was wiped out. DnB also received a massive state cash injection, but is still at risk to a government takeover because of high losses. Moody's says although the government's measures would be vital in sustaining the banks' debt ratings, in the near term they did not insure that Christiania and DnB would 'find it easy to bolster basic financial fundamentals and begin to restore equity'. Christiania has senior debt obligations rated A3 by Moody's and DnB senior at A2. Last year Christiania suffered net losses of NKr9.17bn (Dollars 1.4bn) against NKr1.85bn. Credit losses more than doubled to NKr5.99bn from NKr2.68bn. DnB saw net losses swell three-fold to NKr4.32bn, as credit losses ballooned by NKr1.77bn to NKr5.58bn. To qualify for state support, both banks agreed to seek a break-even result, after credit losses, in 1992. They are also subject to more regulation.</p>

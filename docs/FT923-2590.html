			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / A turbulent day in Whitehall: How ministers tackled a crisis that threatened to spiral out of control THE DAY which ended with sterling on the edge of a precipice and the government's economic strategy in tatters was full of frantic comings and goings in Whitehall and elsewhere. It set the telephone lines humming between Westminster, Frankfurt and Paris as the crisis threatened to spiral out of control. Its last rites were performed amid gathering gloom at 7.36pm when chancellor Norman Lamont emerged into the Treasury's circular courtyard, folded his hands behind his back and announced tersely that Britain had decided to suspend its membership of the exchange rate mechanism. 'Today has been an extremely turbulent and difficult day,' he said flanked by advisers. For once, nobody in the assembled scrum of reporters and cameramen was in a mood to contradict him. The morning had begun early with a conversation between prime minister John Major and his chancellor to discuss the mounting pressure on sterling. This ended in time for Mr Major to attend a 9 o'clock meeting with a group of senior ministers comprising Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip. The subject matter was nominally Maastricht. This inner circle would meet repeatedly during the course of the day as the crisis grew. At about 10.30am, with the pound wilting, Mr Major telephoned Mr Lamont  - who was accompanied virtually throughout the day by Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England - and agreed to a 2 percentage-point increase in base rates to 12 per cent. This was announced over the newswires shortly after 11am. The gathering broke up at about 11.30am. At each crucial juncture as the day progressed, Mr Major made a point of consulting these senior colleagues, thereby invoking the principal of collective responsibility. An hour later - with the first interest rate hike having failed to bolster sterling and huge sums still being expended to prop it up - the group of ministers met again and consented to a further interest-rate rise to 15 per cent. As the afternoon proceeded, Mr Major spoke both to Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and twice to Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister. At 5pm, with the pound still oscillating weakly around its ERM floor level, the group met for a final time, with Mr Lamont and Mr Leigh Pemberton also present. It was at this gathering that ministers decided to bite the bullet and suspend ERM membership. It was also agreed to dispatch Sir Nigel Wicks, second permanent secretary of the Treasury, to Brussels. At 6.23pm the delivery of a scarlet dispatch box told reporters outside the black gates of Admiralty House that an important announcement was imminent. At 7pm the word went out that a statement was expected at the Treasury. It was about half an hour later that Mr Lamont made his hastily-arranged entrance into the building's tranquil courtyard.</p>

Regarding economic cooperation, Comrade Premier Kang  Song-san himself expressed the determination of the Korean side  to do its utmost to cooperate with the Lao side to bring about  fruitful achievements. At present, the DPRK has sent a number  of experts to Laos to collect information on climatic and other  fields in order to facilitate fruitful achievements in the  economic cooperation between the two countries. We are convinced  that the cooperation will be favorably developed in the future.

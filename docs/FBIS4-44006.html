			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by ND: "PDS Wants To Compete With SPD and Alliance </F> 90/Greens"]    [Text] Berlin -- The most important goal of the Party of  Democratic Socialism [PDS] in the Bundestag elections on 16  October and in the future parliament is the replacement of the  Kohl government. Despite all the material differences and its  criticism of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], PDS  deputies would "in no event prevent" a change toward an SPD-led  federal government. This was stressed on Tuesday [21 June] in a  comprehensive election analysis by election campaign head Andre  Brie, obtained by NEUES DEUTSCHLAND.    The party's main opponents will be right-wing extremist and  rightist populist groups, Brie affirms. The PDS has "developed"  its election campaign strategy "not from the viewpoint of  conflict with the SPD, but proceeding exclusively from its own  goals and strengths." The PDS competes with the SPD and the  Alliance 90/Greens for the most consistent representation of the  interests of the downtrodden of society and the east Germans,  for the most far-reaching self-representation of the citizens,  and for the most decisive steps toward a democratic, humanistic,  and ecologically oriented society. "In contrast to voting for  the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens," voting for the PDS "means  not only voting for a change in government but for political  change."    Brie assesses the results of the European and local  elections  of 12 June as a nationwide signal that the PDS is not "on its  way out," but has political prospects as a socialist party that  is critical of the system, is "unmistakably to the left of  Alliance 90/Greens and the SPD," and will again enter the  Bundestag with more than 5 percent or more than three direct  mandates. While the PDS is still a zero-point-something party  in western Germany, in the new laender and in East Berlin its  prospects for local and land policy "have been secured for the  foreseeable future. Only the PDS itself could destroy them."    Brie says that the PDS failure to get 5 percent in the  European elections is due to the fact that in Brandenburg, where  local elections were not held at the same time, the party was  not able to sufficiently mobilize its potential voters.</p>

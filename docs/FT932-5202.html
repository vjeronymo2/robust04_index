			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (5): The pattern varies / A look at the property market THE availability of industrial and commercial property has risen to worrying heights during the recession, but there are signs that inward investors are beginning to show more interest in moving to the county. At first glance the property situation looks grim. Mid Glamorgan, with some 3.8m square feet of industrial floorspace on the market, has the highest level of availability since 1983. Alarmingly, the amount of floorspace is continuing to rise - there has been a 500 per cent increase in industrial property available since the lowest figure reported in 1989 of 600,000 square feet. The latest level represents a 10.5 per cent vacancy rate for the county, which is significantly higher than elsewhere in south Wales. However, the pattern varies substantially across the county, and the news is by no means all bad. Mr David Swallow, private funding director of the Welsh Development Agency, which is responsible for 70 per cent of the industrial and commercial development in the county either by itself or in partnership with private companies, is optimistic. 'Throughout the recession we have maintained the 20 per cent of UK inward investment coming into Wales, and we think this will continue.' 'What we have seen recently is a big reduction in speculative development as elsewhere and an increase in bespoke schemes ...the level here has been maintained very well. We have started to see a definite improvement since Christmas in the level of inquiries.' The greatest take-up levels of industrial property during the last year have been in the smaller size ranges, with a net decrease in availability of property below 5,500 sq ft. An analysis of property demand carried out by the Mid Glamorgan economic development unit of the county council confirmed that demand continues to be highest for properties within the smaller size bands. This demonstrates the growing importance of the small companies sector in the local economy, particularly in the former coal mining valleys. There has also been steady demand for premises along, or near to, the M4 corridor. This has prompted the Welsh Development Agency to enter into joint venture agreements with various developers to ensure that sufficient space is available when demand increases. Both WDA and Brunswick clearly expect demand for commercial and industrial property to increase, and around 150,000 sq ft of floorspace is being built on the site, including two 25,000 sq ft factory units. The Llantrisant area, which also has a business park, has proved to be a popular location with both public and private sector developers, because of its excellent road communications and full development area status. This allows investment projects securing employment to apply for a range of incentives, including regional selective assistance. The other flagship development is at Nantgarw, south of Caerphilly and Pontypridd, where the 100 acre development on the site of old coking works is a joint venture between the WDA and Spen Hill Properties. Many units have already been let and a planning application make by a Hong Kong based electronics company seeking to build a 160,000 sq ft factory which would create 1,000 jobs. If this goes ahead it would be one of the biggest projects to go to south Wales since Sony completed its television factory at Pencoed near Bridgend last year. Mr Rhys James, a director of DTZ Debenham Thorpe, local agents for Spen Hill, admits the Nantgarw experience has been exceptional. 'In general it has been a very difficult time. There have been signs of a slight recovery in 1993, although companies are understandably very cautious and are only moving when they feel they have got a particularly good deal.' In general, the area close to the M4 and the area in the west of the county around Bridgend have survived the recession reasonably well, helped by the smart new Sony factory and more developments by Ford. The local industrial estates are accessible and well established. It is the towns in the former mining valleys that have found the going tougher, and it is in this area that infrastructure improvements are now planned to attract inward investment. There are plans to redevelop the town centre at Merthyr Tydfil and to continue the A470 dual carriageway west of the town to link up with the heads of the valley road, giving much easier access to the M50 and the Midlands. 'We see this potentially as a great benefit to the whole of the north of the county,' says Mr Swallow. Other initiatives in the pipeline are the redevelopment of town centres and retail areas in Abercynon, Caerphilly, Pontypridd and Tredegar. Ironically, the improved road links from the valleys down to the excellent shopping facilities of Cardiff have adversely affected retailers in the valley towns, and the town centre developments are aimed at reversing this trend. Mid Glamorgan and the industrial valleys have undoubtedly benefitted greatly in attracting inward investment in recent years from development and assisted area status, but there is apprehension that this advantage might soon be weakened, if the status is changed in the new lists to be published shortly. Loss of government and European Community aid would make the attempts to cure the continuing employment blackspots much harder to achieve.</p>

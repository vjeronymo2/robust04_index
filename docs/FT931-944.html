			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Growth at 4.7% in fourth quarter MR RON BROWN, the US Commerce Secretary, yesterday hailed final figures showing real growth at an annual rate of 4.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year as confirmation that 'the begin-nings of a meaningful economic recovery are at hand.' But he warned that increased consumer confidence and business profitability had yet to be translated into higher levels of investment, employment and personal incomes. Mr Brown praised Congress for passing President Bill Clinton's deficit-cutting plan but urged it quickly to approve the associated Dollars 16bn package of short-term measures to stimulate the economy. Growth at an annual rate of 4.7 per cent in the fourth quarter was marginally slower than an earlier estimate of 4.8 per cent growth. However, it was the fastest rate of expansion since the end of 1987, when the 'Reagan boom' was still under way. The expansion was led by consumer spending which grew at an annual rate of 5.1 per cent in the fourth quarter. It was the seventh successive quarter of growth in the US after a brief contraction in the autumn and winter of 1990/91. The figures also confirmed a revival of corporate profits. After-tax profits were up 9.2 per cent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter and by 10 per cent during last year as a whole compared with 1991.</p>

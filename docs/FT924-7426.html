			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Canada forced to protect currency A BURST of gloomy reports on Canada's economic prospects has sent the Canadian dollar reeling, forced interest rates higher and raised fresh concern about the sputtering business recovery. The Canadian dollar sank by almost half a US cent in early trading yesterday, falling below 79 US cents for the first time in almost five years. The Bank of Canada responded to the fall by pushing up short-term interest rates. Commercial banks followed suit, lifting prime rates by three-quarters of a percentage point to 8.25 per cent. Economists are concerned that the jump in interest rates will rub out signs of an end to the unexpectedly long and deep recession. With inflation running at an annual rate of little more than 1 per cent, real long-term interest rates are now at an unusually high level of about 8 per cent. Describing the most recent rise in money costs as 'very dangerous', Mr Warren Jestin, chief economist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said yesterday that Canada was teetering 'on the lip of deflation'. 'Given the weakness in the economy, the betting is that the Bank of Canada has leeway to raise interest rates, but not much leeway,' Mr Jestin said. Financial markets' nervousness is ascribed to worries about deteriorating federal and provincial government finances. The federal government indicated late last week that its budget deficit for the year to March 31 1993 could reach CDollars 35bn (Pounds 18.3bn), compared with the original estimate of CDollars 27.5bn. Several provinces are also battling to contain deficits in the face of slumping tax revenues and rising public spending demands, especially on social security. Although Mr Donald Mazankowski, the finance minister, has affirmed his determination to rein in the deficit, calls are growing on the government to stimulate growth.</p>

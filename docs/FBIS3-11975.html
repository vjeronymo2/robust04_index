			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Briceno] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus has demanded the  Nicaraguan Government stop collecting tolls in La Trinidad,  across from the mouth of the Sarapiqui River, on the San Juan  River, because that zone is protected by provisions of the Canas  Jerez Treaty.    The Sarapiqui River flows into the San Juan River, and  according to treaty stipulations Costa Rica has the right of  free commercial navigation.    Niehaus said the government has contacted Nicaraguan  authorities at that location but has yet to receive a  satisfactory answer.    The minister sent a note to Nicaraguan Ambassador Alfonso  Robelo stating, according to information available to the  government, a toll is being collected.    Niehaus has said he instructed "all Costa Rican authorities  at the border area to try before Nicaraguan authorities to solve  this problem while ensuring full respect for Article 6 of the  Canas Jerez Treaty."    The Costa Rican Foreign Ministry has stated the constant  problems stemming from the use of the San Juan River were  discussed by the bilateral technical group of a cooperation  agreement signed by the two governments during a meeting in San  Jose on 14 January.    The ministry has added no satisfactory answer has been  received, although misunderstandings had apparently been cleared.    Niehaus contacted his Nicaraguan counterpart, Ernesto Leal,  this week to voice his concern over this problem, but Leal told  him Nicaragua is charging no toll along the waters of the San  Juan River, which are shared between both countries.    Relations with Nicaragua have been tense this week; in fact,  Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo has denounced the fact Costa  Rica's Agrarian Development Institute (IDA) is distributing land  to peasants in Nicaraguan territory.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The Bundesbank's application of the brakes on all three of its key interest rates - completed last week with a fixed securities repurchase rate of 4.85 per cent for the duration of its four-week holiday - left plenty of options open for the autumn. Mr Gerhard Grebe, chief economist at Bank Julius Bar, suggested it also presented a risk. In the case of another bout of dollar weakness, intervention would be the only counter-measure at the bank's disposal, he said. That apart, the Bundesbank council left for its vacation in an unusually comfortable situation. Money supply is not half as bad as the bare figures suggest; inflation is still on the down-track, and the economy is beginning to fire on more cylinders. If these conditions persist, the bank could resume its monetary easing at any time after the break. While some are betting on further moves before the October federal elections, there is also a school of thought which suggests the Buba will wait until later. This would avoid any accusations of political motivation, and give more time for M3 to settle down and the bank's reputation to recover from its recent shaking. On the other hand, as Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum hinted last week, the bank could decide to sit pat and do nothing.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / O'Reilly buys into S African publishing Independent Newspapers, the Irish publishing group controlled by Mr Tony O'Reilly, has announced it is to take a 31 per cent controlling stake in Argus newspapers, the largest newspaper group in South Africa, in its second overseas acquisition within a week. The deal will be financed through a share-swap, and the price - estimated at about IPounds 20m (Pounds 19m) - will be calculated on the average share price of the first 28 days of trading of Argus Newspapers when the group is floated in April this year on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Independent is purchasing its stake from the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company and the Anglo-American Corporation. The deal will give the two companies around 4m new shares in the Independent group, equivalent to a 5 per cent stake. Independent will have effective control of Argus with its 31 per cent stake. Mr O'Reilly, who is also chief executive officer of Heinz, added that the smoothness of the transaction confirmed the commercial sense of doing business in South Africa. A team from Heinz was evaluating partnerships with local companies. Last week Independent Newspapers acquired a 24.99 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing in the UK which publishes The Independent and Independent on Sunday. It also owns 20 per cent of APN, the Australian regional newspaper group. In 1992 it failed to acquire the Fairfax publishing group in Australia, and later failed to buy Mirror Group Newspapers in the UK. Argus Newspapers turned in pre-tax profit of R53m (Pounds 10m) on sales of R685m in 1993. The group's interests include the Star and the Sowetan, the country's most popular daily newspapers, as well as publications in Cape Town and Durban. Mr O'Reilly's ties with South Africa go back to his first visit in 1955 as a member of the British Lions rugby team. He shunned investment in South Africa during the apartheid era, but cultivated close links with Mr Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, and then Mr Nelson Mandela. His commercial activities in southern Africa have been restricted so far to Olivine Industries, a joint venture with the Zimbabwe government.</p>

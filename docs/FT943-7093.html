			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television It seems that those of us who choose our ice cream by taste are in a minority. Haagen-Dazs is chosen because of its sexy advertising and Ben and Jerry's because of its 'caring' image: eat a cornet and save a rain forest. The last in the current series of The Business reports on the ice cream war (7.30 BBC2). The BBC1 tabloid science series QED reports on another war: the one between Bruce Silcock and his neighbours. Mr Silcock wants planning permission to develop the world's biggest maggot farm in Essex (8.30). The BBC2 series Under The Sun screens the first of three programmes on the lives of Hamar women in Ethiopia. It seems they have a creation myth which is rather more attractive than the Adam and Eve version: in the beginning two people were created, one smiled and became a woman and the other kept his mouth shut and became a man (9.30). BBC Proms 1994 is a recording of the second half of last Saturday's Brahms' Night, with Carlo Maria Giulini conducting (10.00). Can the One Day International produce cricket as exciting as that in the third Test? (BBC1 11.00).</p>

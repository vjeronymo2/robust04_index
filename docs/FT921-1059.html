			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Gloomy Kingfisher declines by 10% KINGFISHER, the property and retailing group encompassing the Woolworths and B&amp;Q chains, yesterday held out little hope for the anticipated increase in consumer spending this year as it reported a 10 per cent decline in annual profits. Mr Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman and chief executive of Kingfisher, warned that 1992 was likely to be difficult. 'My overall impression is that there is no significant indication of any upturn in consumer confidence. I think it will remain tough going for the rest of the year.' Last year pre-tax profits declined from Pounds 252m to Pounds 227.7m on turnover 5 per cent higher at Pounds 3.4bn. The profits fall was cushioned by lower interest payments of Pounds 11.8m, down from Pounds 30.1m. An exceptional profit of Pounds 20.6m on property disposals was offset by a higher than expected Pounds 14.7m charge for restructuring Comet electrical chain and closure of the Title video rentals business. The Pounds 5.9m net gain compares with Pounds 37.2m last time. Mr Mulcahy said the charge was also expected to cover the current year's closure costs relating to Comet. At the trading level, the retail division increased profits by 2.2 per cent to Pounds 205.4m. The star performers were Woolworths, which revealed a 13 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 71.4m, and Comet, which increased its contribution by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 9.1m. B&amp;Q increased its share of the competitive DIY market, said Mr Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher director, from 12 per cent to 14 per cent. The overall market had advanced just 2 points last year. Nevertheless, B&amp;Q suffered a Pounds 5.4m decline in operating profits on sales 14 per cent ahead to Pounds 1.1bn. The division had suffered a 3-point drop in margins in the second half. Mr Mulcahy said the group would not try to boost profits through increasing gross margins. Growth would come from improved efficiency. Profits at Superdrug were flat at Pounds 34.6m. The property division, Chartwell Land, suffered a Pounds 9.7m fall in development income. Investment income fell less sharply from Pounds 42.8m to Pounds 37.2m. Fully-diluted earnings per share, before the exceptional gain, rose from 30.9p to 31.6p. The final dividend was increased to 9p, from 8.4p, for a total of 13p, up from 12.2p. Lex, Page 28</p>

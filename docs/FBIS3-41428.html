			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The residual fuel from the Kozloduy Nuclear Power  Plant can be processed in Russia if we form a joint enterprise,  Power Engineering Committee chief Nikita Shervashidze announced.    ``We will propose this to the Russians at the next talks,''  he explained. Bulgaria can carry out construction work in  Russia, in return for which they could accept our waste nuclear  fuel at a more acceptable price.    The Russians refused to accept radioactive waste in 1988,  since when we have been stockpiling it in a temporary store.  According to our contract with the former USSR, they should  take back the fuel free of charge as long as we have nuclear  plants. They have agreed to accept the fuel at a price of  $1,016 per kilogram, which will cost us $22 million per year.    An alternative is to store the waste fuel in special  containers near Kozloduy. These containers would cost us $20  million until the year 2000.    So far, the most acceptable offer that we have received for  storing the waste in Bulgaria is $60 million, which was offered  by the U.S.-French consortium Framatom-Nuclear Pacific.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Healthcare reform manages a few steps through Congress After weeks in which the Whitewater affair has seemed to drain all vitality from President Bill Clinton's legislative agenda, Washington looked up this week to discover that several steps had been taken towards the president's number one goal of healthcare reform. Late on Wednesday night, the first complete healthcare reform bill was voted through by the health Ways and Means subcommittee, chaired by Congressman Pete Stark of California, which has primary rights over the tax aspects of the plan. That draft is likely to be substantially rewritten by the full Ways and Means committee, and then hammered some more to fit with the drafts of other House of Representatives committees. The same process is under way in the Senate, and the final shape of the bill will be determined when the two chambers get together to reconcile their different versions. The Stark committee's vote, by only a 6-5 margin, offers, nevertheless, a first symbolic victory for some central elements of the Clinton plan: universal health coverage ensured by requiring employers to offer insurance to their employees and pay for 80 per cent of its cost. That requirement would begin in 1996 for businesses with 100 or more employees, and two years later for smaller employers. To finance the bill's broader health coverage, however, the subcommittee voted to raise the cigarette tax from 24 cents a pack to Dollars 1.49, much more than the 75 cents increase proposed by Mr Clinton. Congressman Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the full Ways and Means committee, warned that he was likely to pass out a much more conservative bill than Mr Stark's subcommittee. Another important version of the bill is circulating in the House Energy and Commerce committee, chaired by Congressman John Dingell of Michigan. That version would preserve universal health insurance, but eliminate two controversial elements of the Clinton plan: mandatory government-run health insurance purchasing alliances, and for businesses with fewer than 10 employees, the requirement that employers provide insurance for their workers. White House officials are now stepping back to leave most of the detailed work on healthcare reform to such congressional heavyweights as Mr Dingell and Mr Rostenkowski. Republican members of the Ways and Means subcommittee engineered a symbolic defeat for the White House by forcing a vote on the un-altered Clinton plan: with Democratic members abstaining, it lost. But this procedural manoeuvre seems unlikely to have done very much to clarify the Republican strategy on healthcare reform. As Congressman Bill Thomas of California, senior Republican on the subcommittee, lucidly explained: 'Please listen to me, because I don't want anyone to think that what we're doing is what we're doing.' Beneath their continued hostility to the Clinton plan, most Republicans have now accepted the goal of universal coverage. Many acknowledge privately that it will be very difficult to achieve that goal without also adopting large portions of Mr Clinton's bill, or something even less palatable.</p>

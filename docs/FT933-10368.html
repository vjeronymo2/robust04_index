			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Piech qualifies VW profits target VOLKSWAGEN will not reach its break-even target for this year if turnover falls by more than 5 per cent, according to Mr Ferdinand Piech, group chairman. Mr Piech seemed to moderate his claims that VW would break even or possibly show a profit this year after heavy losses in the first half in an interview published yesterday. He said the group's earnings expectations were based on a fall in worldwide deliveries of 10 per cent to 12 per cent and a 15 per cent drop in Germany. He reckoned on a 5 per cent fall in group turnover to about DM81bn (Dollars 47.6bn) including a 10 per cent decline at the German parent to about DM48bn. 'It is clear that our earnings forecast cannot be attained if the drop in sales is larger,' he added. Mr Piech, talking with officials of the Egon Zehnder, consulting group, repeated that cost savings of DM8.7bn were mostly implemented. They would help the group attain the net return on sales of more than 3 per cent estimated as necessary for a break-even result for 1993. He expected return on sales to reach 5 per cent to 7 per cent in five years. Rapid progress was necessary because voluntary Japanese quotas would only help for two more years. If the European car industry could not match their performance within that time 'we would have lost anyway', he said. VW intended to attack the Japanese in the same way as the Swiss watch industry had: value-for-money Swatch at the bottom end of the market and good design at the top end. 'The Japanese can be beaten, and we at Volkswagen have the tools to do it,' he said. Within six years at the latest, he added, all group factories had to be able to break even working at 70 per cent of capacity. The current ratio was between 85 per cent and 90 per cent, he claimed, after 100 per cent and more last year. Audi, the group's quality car division, would reach 68 per cent by the end of this year.</p>

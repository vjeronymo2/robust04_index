			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Israel looks to peace dividend: Optimism over growth MR Avraham Shochat, Israel's finance minister, predicts the Israeli economy will grow by 4 per cent a year over the next five years but could expand considerably more if the economic dividends of peace come through. Mr Shochat said latest government figures showed economic growth for 1993 at 4 per cent after last year's record growth of 6.9 per cent. The government, he said, had successfully tackled the twin problems of unemployment and inflation, with both expected to drop into single digits early next year. Nearly 90,000 jobs will have been created by the end of the year, he said. Mr Shochat, who took over the Finance Ministry after last year's Labour election victory, said the government was committed to rolling back further state intervention in the economy through continued privatisation and cuts in public borrowing through budget deficit reduction. The sale of the country's government-owned banks, already under way, would be completed by early 1995, Mr Shochat said, earning the Treasury Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.26bn) which would cover the budget deficit and leave the money markets open to the private sector. Trade barriers would continue to be cut back as the Israeli economy was opened to greater foreign competition. The government, he said, had been considerably helped, especially in its expanded infrastructure programme, by the Dollars 10bn US loan guarantees. Mr Aharon Foegel, the ministry's director general, was yesterday concluding negotiations with a consortium of New York banks led by Salomon Brothers on the second tranche for 1993, of Dollars 1bn. 'If you take the reduction in unemployment, increase in industrial exports of 12 per cent, firm growth and good investment in industry, the performance of the economy is looking good,' said Mr Shochat, who leaves Israel tomorrow to attend the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington. He said economic performance could be even better if a comprehensive peace accord with Arab states was reached. In the short term, Israel's economy would benefit from the huge external aid package planned for the Gaza Strip and West Bank, particularly in the supply of construction materials. An immediate benefit to the economy would be a rise in tourists, now 2m a year. In the longer term Israel could benefit from foreign investment, the relocation of headquarters of multinational companies to Israel, and trade with Arab states.</p>

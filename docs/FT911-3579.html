			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Treuhand may breach borrowing limit AN OFFICIAL in Bonn yesterday suggested that the Treuhand, the east German state-backed privatisation agency, was likely to breach its borrowing limit for 1991, possibly by DM3bn. The agency, originally set a limit of DM25bn, is under pressure to extend its financial safety net as the unemployment unleashed by its restructuring programme becomes more controversial in the east. The suggestion from Bonn came as the Treuhand confirmed plans to launch the largest D-Mark commercial paper programme since the market opened at the beginning of this year. The DM2bn facility, arranged by Dresdner Bank with Deutsche Bank as co-arranger, will cover the agency's short and medium-term requirements. D-Mark commercial paper has only been allowed since the beginning of this year, when the Bundesbank put aside its previous objections and a change in law removed the constraint of seeking ministry of finance approval for each issuance. In addition to the Treuhand programme, six programmes are already in place including DM500m for Daimler Benz, Germany's biggest industrial conglomerate, DM500m for BMW, the car manufacturer and DM250m for Sudzucker, the sugar company. Daimler Benz kicked off the market in mid-February and outstandings already amount to just under DM1bn. Much of the paper has been issued at the very short end of the market from seven days upwards. The Treuhand has said it will tap the market in maturities between seven days and two years. Yesterday's programme marks the first incursion of another bank as arranger into a market which to date Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest, had managed to keep to itself. On four of the other six deals Deutsche had acted as sole dealer as well as arranger. JP Morgan and Westdeutsche Landesbank are both appointed dealers for the Treuhand.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Haisheng (0060 3189 3932)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, vice  premier of the State Council and foreign minister, held talks  with visiting Angolan Foreign Minister Angola Venacio da Silva  Moura at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse today. The two sides  exchanged views on bilateral relations and international issues  of common concern.    Qian Qichen said: The Chinese and Angolan peoples have  enjoyed a traditional friendship. Since the two countries  established diplomatic relations, their relations have developed  smoothly. China is willing to further enhance friendly relations  and cooperation with Angola. China has always paid close  attention to Angola's peace process, and supports the Angolan  Government's policy of national reconciliation and the efforts  it has made to achieve that goal. China sincerely hopes that  the peace talks in Angola will produce a final agreement at an  early date and will help realize domestic peace and stability.    He said: China has never interfered in Africa's internal  affairs and has done all it could to contribute to Africa's  development. China hopes that African countries will realize  peace and stability and develop good-neighborly and friendly  relations.    Qian pointed out: Big countries, instead of interfering in  Africa's internal affairs, should let African nations build  themselves according to their own situations. If big powers  really care about Africa, they should not fill out a  prescription and force Africa to accept it. They should offer  aid to Africa to promote its economic development.    Moura briefed Qian Qichen on the current situation in  Angola.  He expressed his thanks for the long-term political and  economic support that his country has received from the Chinese  Government and people. He said: During Angola's struggle for  national independence, the Angolan and Chinese people stood on  one side. Following major changes in the international  situation, the two peoples have continued to stand together.    Moura reaffirmed that Angola firmly adheres to its stand  that  there is only one China, and that it will never develop any  official relations with Taiwan. He expressed the belief that  economic relations and trade between the two countries will be  further enhanced after Angola has realized peace.</p>

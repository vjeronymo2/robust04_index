			<p>CSO     [Text] The National Defense Secretariat [SEDENA] announced  that the Mexican Army and Air Force, besides discharging their  constitutional duties in the Chiapas conflict, are pursuing  activities to combat the constant threat of the drug traffic. He  indicated that this demands the expenditure of major human and  material resources.    The department submitted a final report on the action taken  by 9,700 troops in Regional Operation I-94 against the drug  traffic during the past 25 days. It was conducted on the Pacific  strip, where the areas with the greatest incidence of drug  growing are situated.    The report notes that over 19,000 poppy and marijuana plant  crops were destroyed, commenting: "It should be explained that  the SEDENA is keeping a permanent campaign in effect against the  drug traffic. Known as the `Canador [marijuana-poppies] Plan,'  it includes all the operations being carried out by Army units  activated by the military zonal and regional commanders,  depending on the local problems. In other words, they are based  on growing cycles and the available information, which determine  the need for an operation at any given time.    "In addition, the Mexican Army and Air Force are conducting  periodic special operations against the drug traffic, called  `National Operations' and `Regional Operations.'    "As part of this, the regional operation now concluding was  begun on 10 March, when the National Defense Secretariat  deployed troops comprising a force of 1,700 men in Sonora,  Chihuahua, Sinaloa, Durango, Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoacan,  Guerrero, and Oaxaca. These states contain the areas with the  highest incidence of drug trafficking in the Mexican Republic."    It adds that the participating forces were backed with 250  vehicles, 17 helicopters, and seven small planes from the  Mexican Air Force.    The document concludes by stating: "The Mexican Army and Air  Force, besides performing their constitutional duties, including  the deployment of troops garrisoned in the vicinity of the  principal towns affected by the armed conflict in Altos de  Chiapas, are still participating in activities aimed at  combating the constant threat of the drug traffic. This demands  the expenditure of major human and material resources on the  part of this office."</p>

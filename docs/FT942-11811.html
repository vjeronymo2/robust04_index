			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Arts: Today's Television Edith Wharton, the American turn-of-the-century novelist with a literary style similar to that of her friend Henry James, has finally been discovered by the movie people. The Age of Innocence was a blockbuster, but while Ethan Frome is a much more powerful novel, or rather novella, its economy of character and place hardly merits the Hollywood treatment, and it gets the BBC2 touch (9pm). A story of thwarted love in the frozen wastes of New England, it stars Liam Neeson in the title role. The RSPCA is one of the UK's favourite charities and it should receive more windfalls after QED's Casualties of the Wild (BBC 1, 9.35pm), which looks at the work of the RSPCA's first purpose-built wildlife hospital in Norfolk. This soft-centered alternative to Casualty features infected seals, abandoned fox cubs, young deers knocked down by cars, and shot buzzards. Veterinary manager Ian Robinson, who tends the wounded, may yet become the most popular man in the country. Arsenal play Parma for the European Cup Winners' Cup tonight (ITV, 7.10).</p>

			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / As They Say In Europe: As rare as a Brandenburg olive I POPPED over to Brussels for the New Year to see my Luxembourg friend, Jean-Peter Martini. He is still at the European Commission, running the new Language Harmonisation Programme. I showed my alarm when I heard about it but he said that I need not worry. 'It isn't one of those 'intrusive' programmes that you British go on about it's just to clear things up at the edges. To gain uniformity in common usages.' He slapped a Dutch newspaper in front of me. A headline read, De zonnebloem zake. 'You see that was about the oilseed row with the US. It is a joke, but incomprehensible to the British.' 'Dutch jokes normally pass us by.' 'That is not the point,' said Jean-Peter heatedly. 'It means 'The sunflower case' - a reference to the Tintin books. The character you call Professor Calculus is Professor Sunflower.' In my amazement, or apathy, I emitted an expletive. 'That is another problem - differential swearing. Do you know that in 1992 two German-speaking correspondents in London could not translate the simple English word 'bugger', which was essential to their articles? Bernhard Heimrich of the Frankfurter Allgemeine did a piece on the British honours system and how the initials were vulgarised - KCMG stands for 'Knight Commander of St Michael and St George' and becomes 'kindly call me God' and so on. Well, when he got to Order of the British Empire, or whatever OBE stands for, he wrote, 'Other buggers' efforts', which can't be correctly translated into high German.' Charles Ritterband in the Neue Zurcher Zeitung quoted George V's dying words 'Bugger Bognor' and has to render them as 'To hell with Bognor'.' I agreed that was a problem. 'But we are making progress in other areas,' said Jean-Peter. 'We are trying to establish a fixed system of cliche exchange that would enable politicians to be immediately understood. People often take each other literally and the misunderstandings are dreadful. You must come to 'Eurocliche '93' in Essen in March. It's going to sort these things out. Britain is making a huge contribution.' He pointed to a board on which was written, 'You can't kick start the economy by moving the goalposts on a level playing field.' 'As it stands that sentence is quite incomprehensible, except in Greek. It gives our interpreters enormous problems.' Elsewhere I saw other country's contributions. The French offered Nous n'allons pas nous noyer dans la morosite du bouc-emissaire a la derive. 'Hmm.' I said, ''We aren't going to drown in the gloom of the rudderless scapegoat.' Not bad.' 'But what does it mean?' shouted Jean-Peter. 'Look at this - Wir sehen im Fass ohne Boden die Reflexion des wiederaufgebauten Hunnen-Schreckenbildes.' 'That's okay. 'We see the reflection of the reconstructed Hun shock-picture in the bottomless barrel.' It's about the new Nazis in Germany.' Jean-Peter tore it up, not wanting to waste time on anything sensible. His plan is to compile a list of phrases in each language which could be appropriately adapted - 'words which can move across national frontiers as easily as a 40-ton truck.' 'But the trouble then,' I mused, 'is that you will end up with things like 'We must implement appropriate computer software management modalities.' All familiar and all in English.' 'If we stopped there you might be right. That phrase is no good - it should incorporate actually existing reality.' 'I say, that's not bad. 'Actually, exist . . .' '. . . ing reality. Precisely. I used the phrase advisedly. We have developed, 'The leitmotiv of actually existing reality is to be seen in the sine qua non of the acquis communautaire.' That refers, of course, to the evolution of the post-Maastricht ratification process of widening and deepening the Community.' Jean-Peter paused a moment, gave a faint leer and said, 'A thirsty teetotaller prefers a pastis to a pickled herring.' 'I beg your pardon.' 'That's one of our new cross-border proverbs and sayings. Delors is going to use it next week. I hope you won't break the embargo on it. Perhaps you can help, on a freelance basis. We pay for new sayings.' 'I'll have a go.' 'And don't waste time like a Spanish waffle-maker or turn it all into a Pomeranian paella, these things are as rare as a Brandenburg olive . . .' 'I won't fail - I'll wager all Lombard Street to a China orange on it.' 'Hey, that's good. I'll add it to the list.' James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

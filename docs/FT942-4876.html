			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Clinton promises US backing for stronger Europe President Bill Clinton yesterday appealed to the western allies to stay the course they had set themselves in trying to bring peace to Bosnia, and promised US backing for a stronger Europe. In his first speech to a European parliament, he told the French national assembly that 'America will remain engaged in Europe and, despite troop reductions, will keep a strong force here'. Seeking to dispel traditional French suspicions of US motives, he said that 'America wishes a strong Europe, and Europe should wish a strong America', and the entire transatlantic alliance benefited when 'America and Europe stand together'. French MPs gave his speech a standing ovation that seems likely to reinforce recent improvements in the long-fractious relationship between Paris and Washington. On Bosnia, Mr Clinton counselled patience. While 'we must understand that we do not have total control over events in every nation', it was 'important to recognise what has been done there'. He paid tribute to France's leading role in the UN peacekeeping force that had enabled humanitarian aid to get through. The US backed yesterday's UN proposal for a four-month ceasefire, and with Russia's recent 'very positive' diplomatic help hoped-for results. As the first US president to address the French parliament since President Woodrow Wilson did so in 1919, Mr Clinton took a broad historical sweep to contrast how western democracies had initially failed to check fascism in the 1930s, but had held together in the face of Soviet communism. After the latter's collapse, 'we have now arrived at this century's third point of decision'. 'We must set our sights on a strategic star', he said. 'Let that star be the integration and strengthening of the broader Europe'. He said he had strongly welcomed the Nato decision in January 'to let Nato assets be used by the Western European Union' arm of the European Union, which France is keen to build up. The spread of market economics was another essential means of integrating the wider Europe, Mr Clinton said. He appealed to western Europe to open its markets to goods from the east, because 'if our new friends are not able to export their goods, they may instead export instability, even against their own will'. France has in fact modified its opposition to eastern European imports, partly in deference to its close ties with Germany a relationship which Mr Clinton also described as the linchpin of west Europe unity. More daring was Mr Clinton's praise of the Gatt agreements, before a parliament that less than 18 months ago unanimously denounced US agricultural demands in the Uruguay Round negotiations. 'France played an absolutely pivotal role' in the negotiations, the president said. 'I know it was difficult, I know it required statesmanship,' he said, but it had now opened the door to economic growth. Reuter adds: French presidential elections will take place on April 23 and May 7 next year, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua said yesterday.</p>

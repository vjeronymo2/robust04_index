			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Record early autumn cold penetrated the north-central part of the nation, while  frost warnings were in place in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky, where the National  Weather Service expected that the first significant frost of the season could  put an end to the growing season. The chill was blamed on a cold Canadian  high-pressure system, which generated near-cloudless skies and temperatures in  the 20s. Record lows included 24 at Duluth, Minn.; 22 at International Falls,  Minn.; 22 at Marquette, Mich., and 27 at Minneapolis-St. Paul.  </P></p>

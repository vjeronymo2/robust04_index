			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report" by Ekkaphum Wittayayut: "Who's behind the </F> bomb attacks in the Kingdom?"]    [Text] The sound of bomb blasts reverberating throughout  the nation does not seem to be instilling fear into the hearts  of the populace as might be expected. It appears they have  become familiar with the situation and are nonchalant despite  the bomb attacks recently made on the residences of the Interior  Minister and an opposition party leader. An attack made  recently on a locomotive traveling on the southern rail line  only succeeded in terrorizing the train crew.    The people of the South have now become so familiar with the  bombings that as opposed to feeling that they are living in the  shadow of fear it is quite to the contrary. If there were no  bombings it would be beyond the realms of normality.    Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut seems unperturbed  by the bomb attack directed at his home, saying he would not  allow the attacks to intimidate him wherever they may occur.    Despite this statement, the bombings are a genuine cause of  concern for Chuan Likphai's coalition government. No matter  what group is responsible for the attacks, if they are allowed  to continue unabated, they are bound to undermine the confidence  of the people in the government's ability to maintain law and  order.    If apathy is allowed to set in, when considering the  attitudes of the citizens of the country and the government to  the bombings, there would seem to be little hope of locating  those responsible and stamping out the attacks for good.    One confounding factor in the bombing issue is that the  identity of the group responsible for the attacks is unknown and  no demands have been made. At this time the attacks would seem  to be pointless.    It is possible that Gen Chawalit believes he has received  up-to- date information from his advisers on the issue but there  is one point he may have failed to consider.    The group responsible for the bombings may be politically  motivated with an ultimate intention of causing political chaos  and disruption in the nation. Recent reports that foreign  terrorist groups planned to attack the Israeli embassy in  Bangkok were probably unconnected to the bombing incidents that  have already been carried out in the capital, as attacks on  local politician's homes are unlikely to gain anything for  Middle Eastern terrorist groups, who would seem to be the most  likely perpetrators of any such attack on the embassy.    Let's consider the probable intentions of the group  responsible for the bombings:    A desire for political chaos and to create disruption in the  country, and to make the government appear to be unfit to carry  out the task to which it was elected because it is unable to  maintain stability.    To increase pressure on the government at a time when  parliament is in disarray with an intention of making it look  incompetent in the eyes of the general public. It is possible  this could lead to the dissolution of parliament.    Prior political forces in the country might be able to  return  to power in this way. If the government is left alone to carry  out its duties unhindered, the chances of any forces of the past  returning to power would diminish.    Some observers say the planting of the bombs can clearly be  seen as the dying throes of a spent political force but these  are few and far between.    They can be narrowed down into two categories -- democratic  and dictatorial.    Democratic political parties, or those who profess to be,  come in several forms. Power swings to and fro depending on the  opinions of the electorate during general elections.    Before the formation of the National Peace Keeping Council  (NPKC), the Chatchai administration maintained a grip on power.    Coming from self-imposed exile in the United Kingdom to  successfully defend himself against allegations of corruption,  former Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan's Chat Thai Party  failed to get reelected in the last general election. Chat Thai  have now been relegated to assume the role of opposition party,  but are eagerly waiting in the wings for a final banana skin to  bring down the government for good. All the opposition parties  will have an opportunity to return to power, courtesy of the  democracy system which necessitates the holding of free general  elections.    Political parties have no need to carry out terrorist acts  to  pressure the government. Their use of criticism during  parliamentary sessions is usually adequate.    Opposition parties are unlikely candidates for the  suspicions  of those investigating the bombings.    Dictators who have fallen from the privileged position of  political power are the most deserving for the focus of  suspicion as they have the most to gain.    With the democracy system now firmly in place they are  unlikely to be voted back into power by the electorate and their  only route would seem to be one of violence with an aim of  creating chaos -- an atmosphere in which they might be able to  seize power again.    It is imperative, however, that the government quickly trace  those responsible for the attacks if they wish to maintain an  impression of competence.    The right-wing group of Gen Thanom Kittikhachon would be a  good place to begin investigations although some observers have  said that these groups are incapable of carrying out the attacks.    Does Gen Chawalit know who the culprits are?</p>

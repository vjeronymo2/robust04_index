			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Australians in gold-mine deal with Russia THE Russian government yesterday approved a ground-breaking deal letting foreigners into the country's jealously-guarded gold mining industry. Strengthened by his survival of the Russian congress's attempts to sack him, Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, finally signed a resolution allowing Lenzoloto, a state-owned Siberian gold producer, to team up with an Australian consortium, Star Technology Systems. The deal is the first to involve a foreign company directly in the flagging Russian gold industry since Stalin brought in western know-how for a brief period starting in 1927. The now-independent republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are also entering partnerships with foreign gold mining companies. Under the long-debated deal, Star will obtain a 31 per cent stake in Lenzoloto in return for an injection of cash and technology to develop its prime Sukhoi Log mine and reduce waste in existing alluvial, open pit and underground operations. The Russian government and the local authorities of the Irkutsk region will also hold minority stakes, with Lenzoloto's management retaining control of operations spreading over a territory of 105,000 sq km, along the Lena River. Star, which includes two listed Australian mining companies and unnamed private investors, has been working on the deal for more than two years. The final agreement appears however to have been well worth the effort. Star will be entitled to a third of the profits from sales of the gold, which will go exclusively to the state at a price to be determined by the government. Although figures for the size of Lenzoloto's reserves were not immediately available, one foreign executive described them as being 'elephant-sized'. The deal has run into strong opposition from Mr Valery Rudakov, the powerful head of Rossalmazzoloto, the central gold-producing authority, who believes Sukhoi Log should be put out tender 'if it has to be given to foreigners in the first place'. Russia is believed to have produced around 240 tons of gold last year - the world's third largest producer after South Africa and the US. The neighbouring Irkutsk and Yakutia gold mining regions together account for more than a fifth of Russian gold output.</p>

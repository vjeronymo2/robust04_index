			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Economic Watch: Norway's unemployment falls Norway's unemployment rate in September fell to 4.8 per cent of the workforce compared with 5.6 per cent the month before, the Norwegian Labour Directorate said yesterday. The decline was in line with market expectations because state employment schemes and job training programmes, which remove the jobless from unemployment statistics, start in September. In Italy, the unemployment rate reached 11 per cent in July, up from 10.3 per cent in July 1993. West German engineering and plant construction orders were 16 per cent higher in real terms in August against August 1993. In the June to August period orders were 18 per cent above the same 1993 period. New business registrations in eastern Germany totalled 13,630 in July, down 7.9 per cent from a year earlier. In the first seven months of the year, 103,747 businesses registered in eastern Germany, a 9.7 per cent decline from the same period last year.</p>

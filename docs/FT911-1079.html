			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Jobs: The problem without any clear remedy - Britain's middle classes have been taken aback by what they saw as favourable events HOW'S about this for a snapshot of the times in Britain? A reader dwelling in west London writes: 'My regular bridge evening this week brought together four people all in their early 40s who have held down senior positions in areas as diverse as market research, quantity surveying, investment banking and financial control. We have presently one further thing in common: we are all near to or in unemployment with families to support, mortgages and in some cases school fees to meet.' Yes, there can no longer be any doubt about it. In redoubled, the British middle classes are feeling the squeeze. Unemployment, which they hitherto regarded as largely a working-class preserve, has proved upwardly mobile. And lest the Jobs column be accused of finding amusement in others' misfortunes, it had better be known that I'm fairly closely affected. Of my four sons and a foster son, aged between 25 and 35, two at the older end have seen their career paths disappear, and a third has had to take a 20 per cent cut in salary. As too often happens, I didn't twig the reality of the development until it struck close to home, although I had long seen it coming. For instance, it is well over a year since I heard the first of several chiefs of large companies confiding that he was regretfully going to take an axe to the group's middle ranks, where it was heavily overstaffed by the standards of competitors abroad. In which case, since overseas readers in executive and higher specialist work have presumably gone through the fire before, they may think I'm making undue fuss on behalf of the newly burned Brits. But, although it may seem like special pleading, people raised in the central layers of society on the Continent and in America are not quite the same as their counterparts over here. Since at least the 12th century, when master craftsmen such as architects began to break free of the feudal yoke and sell their services for money, we have been differentiating ourselves from the workers. With the exception of agricultural small-holders, individual shopowners and such, we've traditionally shunned physical hands-on activities, being employed as traders, august professionals and more lately managers. Indeed - probably to a worse extent than our equivalents elsewhere - whatever we have been educated for, it is not to make things for sale. Now, ironically, just as the collapse of east European regimes has confirmed our assurance that Marxism was no threat to us, we stand menaced by influences such as market forces and computers we'd thought were on our side. But there is clearly no point in apportioning blame, let alone in nostalgia. The fact seems to be that more and more of us will need to find uncustomary ways of earning our keep, which is a problem even knottier than it may at first appear. I say that on the evidence of a survey of an activity being taken up by many of the managers and staff specialists ejected from companies' ranks. It is to continue doing broadly what they did beforehand as independent consultants. The study has just been published by the GMS consultancy, one of 10 concerns in Britain that act as go-betweens on such independent operators' behalf. One stark finding is that, during 1990, the number on the books of GMS alone rose from a bit under 2,100 to over 3,100. The minimum, maximum and average gross earnings of the 337 thereof who took part in the survey, are shown in the table below. Surprisingly, says GMS - with its eyes on the overall 1.1 per cent rise in earnings over 1989 - the market for independent consultancy has held up well. Even so, as the table's lower lines show, conditions for different broad specialisms have been distinctly patchy, and that is not all. The differences between individual consultants within the same specialism are often huge, the survey report says. Even in the averagely depressed fields of personnel, computers and general management, the most successful people are doing extremely well. Indeed, in the highest growth field of engineering as well as the others, a few such exceptional operators hoist the averages to well above the earnings of most folk involved. A lot are hard put to make enough to live. Moreover for them, the remedy seems unlikely to lie in the optimism shown by their 1991 forecasts even if demand for their services picks up. For GMS says it has often met upper rankers propelled or persuaded out of company hierarches who 'thought that a move into independent consultancy was going to be no different than life before. So many failed to make the grade.' Worse still, to judge by other research evidence on such matters, not only is doing something successfully on a self-employed basis different from doing same on someone else's payroll, but a lot of us lack what it takes to make the change. While the Jobs column wishes it knew of a cure for such cases, even if only for family reasons, it simply does not. And although numerous middle-class Brits who have been caught unprepared - including the reader quoted at the outset - seem to be looking to government for a remedy, I cannot share their hopes. All I can say, which doesn't help much, is that the ruling party would be foolish to think it can survive the upwardly mobile upheaval unscathed. Anyone who doubts it need only read Roy Lewis's and Angus (later Lord) Maude's The English Middle Classes, published by Penguin in 1953. It shows that its subjects have been through upheavals before. The last came after 1945 when they found the Labour government they'd been instrumental in electing, was citing the national interest in imposing sacrifices on them that the working classes were not made to share. The eventual result, even if not morally justified, was that the Labour party remained out of power for 13 years. What's the betting that the Tories, who've been in it for the past dozen, will soon be doing the same?</p>

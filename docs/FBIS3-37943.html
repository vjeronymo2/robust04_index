Meshkov and representatives of the Union of  Entrepreneurs of Crimea [SPK]. Crimean business is actively  establishing closer ties with the new authorities. Actually,  they looked pretty good sitting at the same table during this  meeting--the president of the Republic of Crimea, Yu. Meshkov,  and the president of the Union of Entrepreneurs, A. Dudko, a  gifted economist and the same kind of "generator of ideas."    From the first minutes of the meeting a completely friendly  atmosphere was established (to be sure, after a time of tense  anticipation: The president was detained), and then it was  reinforced by assurances of mutual support.    A. Dudko gave a short briefing to the president of the Union  of Entrepreneurs, which unites 14 regional divisions and more  than 2,000 enterprises with hundreds of thousands of workers  and, together with the leasing collectives, it is larger than  the state sector. In addition to enterprises, the SPK includes  banks and funds (including the recently created imeni E. Memetov  insurance fund for fighting terrorism), and social  organizations, and the Crimean Institute of Economics and  Business Law, which it founded. The union maintains close  business contacts with a number of far- abroad countries,  particularly the Bavarian Academy of Management, where Sergey  Shuriga and Aleksandr Dudko defended their doctoral  dissertations. At the present time, the SPK is faced with the  task of reorganizing itself to meet European standards in order  to gain the opportunity to conclude tariff agreements with  unions of employers of Europe.    Regarding the current economic situation, A. Dudko noted  that  the entrepreneurs were especially alarmed by Ukraine's  forthcoming monetary emission of 30 trillion, which can be  advantageous only to the military-industrial complex of the  continental part of the state and could bring complete ruin to  Crimea. It will be pointless to do planting in the spring,  because the production cost of agricultural products will rise  so high that it will be much less expensive to deliver them from  abroad. As immediate measures the entrepreneurs asked the  president to issue edicts that would make it possible to  stabilize the financial situation in our republic to a certain  degree.    SPK members who spoke at the meeting-conference expressed  ideas and proposals aimed at economic improvement of Crimea.  Naturally, the first thing all of them mentioned was the urgent  task of reforming the tax system. They also spoke of the need  for all- around support for small and medium-sized business in  the situation of practically complete collapse of industry that  has developed. The entrepreneurs are prepared to suggest to the  president the corresponding programs and a package of normative  documents.    They also discussed concrete assistance to our republic,  which can be provided because of personal contacts with  entrepreneurs in Russia. In particular, P. Sukholeyster, a  member of the council of the League of Entrepreneurs and  Cooperators of Russia, reported that there is an agreement with  the Republic of Komi for the delivery of 250,000 cubic meters of  timber to Crimea.    An original idea was expressed by Professor N.M. Pavlenko,  first vice president of the International Intergovernmental  Organization of Grapes and Wine. As he sees it, flower growing  could be a real Klondike for Crimea. Half of Holland's economic  prosperity is based on this branch. And what do they have that  Crimea does not? A warm climate, a good scientific base--the  Botanical Garden--and a large airport. President Yu. Meshkov  liked the idea and, incidentally, he reported that there is a  preliminary agreement on the creation of the Crimea-Russia  airline company, which has been backed up by the delivery of  aircraft fuel. Briefly, there will be technical possibilities  of showering Russia with tulips, carnations, and Crimean roses.    Those in attendance were very excited over the presence of  the chairman of the republic Unity trade union, Ya. Reznikov.  This time he not only spoke about his pet idea of tripartism,  but also mentioned that there is a unique plan of "crazy fans  from Alushta" to hold the Olympic Games in Crimea. Delirium?  But no Winter Olympics has ever been held with a view of the  sea. It is also possible to show off with the hypothesis that  the legendary Atlantis is not far from Crimea. But to consider  practical things, hosting the Olympics could bring Crimea the  kind of investments that would make it a center of international  tourism and a flourishing health resort for all time. Of  course, one is almost automatically reminded of New Vasyuki....  But sometimes absolutely improbable things happen in real life.  And indeed, why not? If there were the desire and enthusiasm.  At least this idea seemed to evoke enthusiasm from the  president, and he has proved to us through action that the  person capable of original thinking will win.    Yu. Meshkov expressed his readiness to consider attentively  the prospects for entrepreneurial activity proposed by the SPK  and their vision of changes in the areas of economics, law, and  state structures. He emphasized that the Bavarian contacts of  the Union of Entrepreneurs and the proposed rate agreements were  especially valuable to the republic.    The president also stated that strict steps would be taken  to  subdue mafia structures, which are not halting their activity.  Honest entrepreneurs have a right to count on reliable  protection from the state.</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / North America proves the right connection for an on-line future: Tim Burt explains why Reed Elsevier's purchase of Mead Data Central marks a move away from print Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group, will today celebrate its listing on the New York Stock Exchange by announcing that North America has become its most important market. Its arrival on Wall Street has coincided neatly with news that Reed Elsevier has agreed to pay Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 950m) for Mead Data Central - the distributor of on-line legal and business information - in a deal likely to contribute Dollars 612m of sales and profits of about Dollars 75m next year. The move followed six months of talks with Mead Corporation, the US paper and forest products group which announced plans in May to sell MDC, whose on-line publishing operations include Lexis and Nexis. Despite the protracted negotiations, Reed Elsevier only found out at the weekend that it had beaten rival bids by Times Mirror, the US media group, and Thomson of Canada when Salomon Brothers, its US adviser, telephoned its executives at the Grand Canyon, where they were taking a break from meetings with US investors. 'We heard we that were the prefered bidder as we watched the sun go down,' said Mr Nigel Stapleton, finance director. 'We were expecting to be outbid, but we obviously made a knock-out offer.' For Mr Pierre Vinken, the group's Dutch co-chairman, the acquisition marks an important step in a strategy first launched 15 years ago, when Elsevier - which merged in 1993 with Reed International of the UK - targeted North America as the world's most lucrative publishing market. The group's sales in North America rose 24 per cent to Pounds 1.04bn last year - 37 per cent of the group total - while operating profits grew to Pounds 194m. While predicting MDC would boost those figures next year, Mr Vinken admitted the group would be unable to make a similar sized acquisition in the near future. He hinted, however, that it was considering smaller deals to expand its presence in the region. Its attention is focusing on parts of Ziff Communications, the world's largest publisher of computer magazines. 'We are researching Ziff as if we had not acquired Mead. If there are parts of the business to go for, we have the capacity to buy them', he added. The group also outlined plans to increase spending on its electronic publishing businesses by Pounds 10m a year to Pounds 30m. Mr Vinken said the increased investment would probably be matched by a slowdown in resources devoted consumer publishing, its lower margin magazine, books and newspaper business. Imminent disposals are unlikely, but expansion of regional newspapers and magazines such as Woman's Own and TV Times has also been ruled out. Reed Elsevier's investment plans have centred instead on three higher margin publishing businesses: scientific and medical, business and professional. Of those, MDC will be integrated into the professional sector. Its maiden contribution next year will signal a shift from the group's dependence on hard copy publishing to increasing use of on-line information. Electronic publishing is expected to grow from 10 per cent of turnover to more than 20 per cent next year, and Mr Vinken has ambitions to expand it further. He hopes MDC's technology can be adapted to offer Reed Elsevier's scientific journals and enhance its extensive medical database. 'We have acquired a massive electronic warehouse and the possibilities are enormous. Overnight, we have turned into a state-of-the-art electronic publisher.'

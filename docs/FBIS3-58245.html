			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister today announced limited  ministerial changes in the House of Lords following the  resignation of the Earl of Caithness as Minister of State,  Transport, after the death of his wife.    Mr Major has contained the changes so as to disturb as  little  as possible the ministerial structure in the Lords.    Lord Caithness's portfolio will be undertaken at the lower  level of Under-Secretary, by Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish,  promoted from the Whips' Office.    Lord Mackay, 55, as Mr John Mackay, sat in the House of  Commons from 1979 to 1987, first as MP [Member of Parliament]  for Argyll and later for the redrawn constituency of Argyll and  Bute.    The resignation also gives Mr Major an opportunity to  promote  Lord Strathclyde, 33, from Under-Secretary to Minister of State  at the Department of Trade and Industry.    Lady Denton, 58, becomes Under-Secretary Northern Ireland,  swapping jobs with the Earl of Arran, 55, who becomes  Under-Secretary, Environment. Downing Street declined to give a  reason for this exchange of posts.    A new whip, to replace Lord Mackay, will be announced later.</p>

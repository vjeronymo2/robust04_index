			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAKKER RULED 'SANE'; TRIAL GOES ON;  </P> <P> HAD PANIC ATTACK ON REALIZATION OF SITUATION, DOCTOR SAYS  </P> <P> A federal judge today ruled Jim Bakker competent to stand trial after a  psychiatrist testified that the TV evangelist was not mentally ill but merely  had a panic attack when he finally grasped his downfall.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Robert Potter said the fallen evangelist's trial on charges  of fleecing followers of his PTL ministry will resume later in the day.  </P> <P> The ruling came after a hearing for which Bakker was brought to court from a  prison psychiatric unit in leg irons and handcuffs. He was committed for a  psychiatric evaluation there Thursday after his personal psychiatrist reported  he was hallucinating and cowering in a fetal position under a couch.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called Competent  </P> <P> During today's hearing, Dr. Sally Johnson, a psychiatrist at the Federal  Correctional Institution at Butner, testified Bakker is competent to stand  trial and "has the capacity to get through it."  </P> <P> She said Bakker suffered a panic attack last week after a witness collapsed  during defense cross-examination.  </P> <P> "For the first time in three years, the whole situation came home to him, and  he began to cry," she testified. "The weight of all these things began to  coalesce, and he began crying. It was a powerful emotional reaction and  release."  </P> <P> Potter asked Bakker to rise and answer questions before he released him from  the custody of U.S. marshals.  </P> <P> "Do you understand what you are on trial here for?" the judge asked.  </P> <P> "Yes, sir," Bakker responded quietly.  </P> <P> Asked if he was able to assist his lawyers, Bakker said, "I'm very tired, but I  believe I can."  </P> <P> His wife, Tammy Faye, said as she left court, "This should not be allowed in  the United States of America."  </P> <P> Potter did not immediately rule on a defense request for a mistrial but said he  expected the trial to resume later in the day.  </P> <P> Bakker, who resigned from the PTL ministry in 1987 in a sex and money scandal,  went on trial Aug. 28 on conspiracy and fraud charges. Prosecutors said he used  nearly $4 million in ministry funds to live in high style.  </P> <P> He could receive 120 years in prison and be fined more than $5 million if  convicted.  </P> <P> Bakker showed little emotion during today's hearing, which was attended by his  wife and other family members.  </P> <P> Tammy Faye Bakker arrived with defense attorney George T. Savis shortly after  her husband this morning and brought him a suit, shirt, tie and shoes. He was  wearing gray pants and a sport shirt as he entered the building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mistrial Request  </P> <P> Defense attorney Harold Bender filed the mistrial request Tuesday, maintaining  the jury might blame the defense for the collapse of government witness Steve  Nelson last week during grilling by Bakker's lawyers.  </P> <P> Johnson said she did not detect any signs of mental disease. "It's not abnormal  for someone to be experiencing those symptoms in a trial situation, especially  if it comes on the heels of a major disruption in a person's life," she said.  </P> <P> She described Bakker's symptoms as "moderate depression" and "situational  anxiety" and detected "dependent features in his personality" and narcissism.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> PACIFIC SYMPHONY HAILS BERNSTEIN;  </P> <P> DIRECTOR CARL ST. CLAIR PAID TRIBUTE TO HIS RECENTLY DECEASED MENTOR AND  TEACHER.  </P> <P> With emotion audible in his voice, Pacific Symphony music director Carl St.  Clair prefaced the second half of the orchestra's concert Wednesday at the  Orange County Performing Arts Center with dedicatory remarks to the memory of  Leonard Bernstein, his mentor and teacher who died on Oct. 14.  </P> <P> St. Clair said he selected works on his first two programs this season with the  Pacific that he strongly associated with Bernstein.  </P> <P> It seemed surprising, then -- or was the personal meaning too great? -- that  the new music director offered an expressively muted reading of Tchaikovsky's  expansive and triumphant Symphony No. 5.  </P> <P> This was a no-nonsense, no-heart-on-sleeve, almost anti-Romantic account. St.  Clair drew compacted, driven, strongly pulsed lines. He refused to indulge in  swooping, sculpted or blossoming phrasings, and so dampened the composer's  expressive range.  </P> <P> The orchestra, which continues to sound more unified and purposeful in  ensemble, offered energetic climaxes but failed to respond with lushness and  precise attack. James Thatcher played the horn solo of the second movement with  uncharacteristic dryness.  </P> <P> The conductor forestalled premature applause by barely pausing between the  first two movements. But the clap-happy audience found opportunities to express  approval between the second and third movements and again after the pause  before the final grand march in the last. Other audiences have similarly been  misled, despite the pause on the dominant chord.  </P> <P> St. Clair opened the second half of the program with "Greeting," a portion of  Bernstein's last work, "Arias and Barcarolles." Carla Connors brought a creamy  soprano to the low-lying tessitura of this gentle, four-minute lullaby.  </P> <P> Bartok's Viola Concerto, completed from sketches after the composer's death by  Tibor Serly, formed the centerpiece of the first half. The dazzling soloist was  Donald McInnes, who holds the William Primrose chair in viola at USC. (Primrose  had commissioned the concerto from Bartok.)  </P> <P> McInnes commanded a range from big, full-bodied tone to spectral, filigreed  lightness, and tossed off the challenges with ease. He proved lacking only in  the demonic Hungarian folk accents in the final movement. St. Clair accompanied  with mesmerizing attentiveness.  </P> <P> The conductor opened the program with a jaunty, if at times boomingly  percussive, account of the Overture to Rossini's "La Gazza Ladra," a  not-very-satisfactory replacement for the originally announced Prelude to  Wagner's "Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg." Again, a Bernstein connection was  offered as the reason for the change. St. Clair had conducted the Rossini in  joint concerts with his mentor on tour in Europe in 1989.  </P></p>

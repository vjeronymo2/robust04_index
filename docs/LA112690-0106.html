			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> DEFUSING A TIME BOMB  </P> <P> The stock market has been taking no prisoners among financial stocks for about  a year now. The assumption by investors is that every financial company is just  a time bomb of decayed assets waiting to explode.  </P> <P> In the ranks of alleged bombs that have yet to go off is Broad Inc., the Los  Angeles-based life insurer and annuity giant. While the stock has been cut down  to $3.875 a share now from $11.625 early in the year -- a 67% drop -- Broad  last week reported fourth- quarter net income of 29 cents a share, up 16% from  a year ago.  </P> <P> For the full fiscal year ended Sept. 30, Broad earned $33.4 million, or $1.02 a  share, compared to $26.1 million, or 80 cents, in its shortened (10-month)  fiscal 1989.  </P> <P> So at $3.875 a share, Broad stock sells for just four times annual earnings and  just 39% of stated book value per share -- the theoretical value of its assets  if all debts were paid off.  </P> <P> Wall Street can't argue with Broad's business. Through its nationwide  SunAmerica subsidiary, Broad continues to do a brisk trade selling  conservative, tax-deferred annuities, a retirement savings vehicle that's  caught on big with baby boomer investors.  </P> <P> But that sales success, and the earnings it has produced, continue to take a  back seat to investors' paramount concern: How healthy is Broad's portfolio of  investments -- the things it has purchased with its annuity investors' dollars?  </P> <P> Broad argues that 50% of its $9.4-billion portfolio carries little or no credit  risk. That half is invested mostly in U.S. Treasury securities and securities  of U.S. government agencies.  </P> <P> Another 38% of the portfolio is in investments that Wall Street still considers  of high quality, including top-rated corporate bonds and mortgages.  </P> <P> The market's worry is about the 9.6% of Broad's portfolio invested in more  speculative assets, including junk bonds and real estate. If that $911-million  chunk of the portfolio were to become completely worthless, it would more than  wipe out Broad's capital, leaving the firm bankrupt.  </P> <P> But not even the most pessimistic analysts expect every junk bond and every  piece of real estate to become worthless. Far more realistic is that some  percentage of the investments will fail, and that even those failures will pay  back some of what they owe -- perhaps 30 cents on the dollar.  </P> <P> What Broad is trying to show Wall Street is that the firm has been aggressively  setting aside reserves for potential problems, and that it will continue to do  so in 1991, to the tune of $40 million. Most significantly, even with those  reserve set-asides, Chairman Eli Broad promises that his company will show net  income growth of 20% to 25% in fiscal 1991.  </P> <P> What's more, Eli Broad believes that he will have reserved enough by the end of  1991 to fully insulate his portfolio from whatever other problems may develop  after that. "We do not want to go into 1992 having to provide anything  additional" to reserves, he says flatly. If he makes that goal, Broad Inc.  could be well on its way by 1992 toward annual net income of $2 a share or  better.  </P> <P> At age 57, Eli Broad is no newcomer to the business of balancing risk and  reward. He has been a savvy player in high finance for decades, and engineered  the 1989 separation of Broad Inc. from home builder Kaufman &amp; Broad Inc.  Yet Wall Street obviously doesn't completely trust Eli Broad's instincts, or  Broad Inc. stock wouldn't be selling for a mere four times earnings per share.  </P> <P> Investors clearly are concerned that Broad Inc.'s assets will deteriorate far  more than what Eli Broad sees. And certainly, anything could happen if the  economic slump deepens. Eli Broad says his firm has been "cherry-picking" the  loan portfolios of troubled banks, buying solid commercial mortgage loans from  banks in need of money. But a solid mortgage today might turn into a problem a  year from now. There's no way to be 100% sure.  </P> <P> Even so, many institutional shareholders in Broad Inc., such as  Strong/Corneliuson Capital in Milwaukee, owner of 600,000 shares, say they've  looked over the portfolio, and they're on Eli Broad's side. Yet, as Bill  Corneliuson admits, "You ask yourself, 'Are we missing something, or is the  market seeing something that all of we mortals don't see?' "  </P> <P> One of Broad Inc.'s biggest problems is simply that it is based in L.A., home  also to insurers First Capital Holdings and First Executive -- both of which  were major junk bond investors. Broad "is being painted with the same brush,"  says Carl Lindberg, vice president at Wilmington, Del.-based Brandywine Asset  Management. Lindberg says Brandywine has stuck with its 1.4 million Broad Inc.  shares because "we've looked at it every which way" and concluded that the  market has drastically overreacted. "We've torn our hair out on this," he says.  </P> <P> If the market is right after all, no one will lose more than Eli Broad. He  holds the bulk of the firm's non-traded Class B shares and this year has bought  550,000 more shares of the common stock as it has sunk. Says analyst Frederick  Wise at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New York: "I think Eli Broad is a rational  man. I don't think it would be in his interest to just throw money down the  toilet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BROAD'S ROUGH SAILING  </P> <P> How shares of Broad Inc. have fallen over the past year, as worries about the  financial system have jumped.  </P> <P> Weekly close, New York Stock Exchange trading  </P> <P> Friday: $3.88, up 13 cents  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Monrovia, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Liberia's interim  government Friday [21 January] criticised the United Nations for  deploying 300 military observers across the country without  waiting for the arrival of the full West African peacekeeping  force.    The deployment, which began on January 14 but only revealed  Thursday by the United Nations, was "improper" and a  contravention of last July's Cotonou agreement and UN  resolutions, the government said.    Under the Cotonou accords, the UN Observer Mission in  Liberia  (UNOMIL) is to supervise the disarming of the warring factions  by the Nigerian-led ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]  force.    The accords were signed by Charles Taylor's National  Patriotic Front of Liberia, which began a bloody insurrection in  December 1989, the interim government, the remnants of  assassinated president Samuel Doe's army and the rival United  Liberation Movement.    Taylor's NPFL had refused to disarm to ECOMOG, as agreed  last  year, arguing that it did not trust the Nigerian-led force in  its original form.    Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe agreed to send some 2,550  troops to boost ECOMOG, which first began operations in Liberia  in August, 1990, but only 900 have so far arrived.    "The deployment of UN observers should be done in  collaboration with ECOMOG which is responsible for the security  of UNOMIL throughout the country," the government said.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / George warns against cut in interest rates: Governor-designate highlights fears on inflation A STRONG though veiled warning against imminent cuts in interest rates was delivered last night by Mr Eddie George, who will soon be governor of the Bank of England. Mr George, the current deputy governor who steps up to the top job next month, said in a speech to business leaders in Cambridgeshire that inflationary pressures were far from dead in spite of Britain's long recession. While he cast doubt on the notion that further cuts in base rates would stimulate any significant economic activity, he also signalled that they might spark rising prices, which would hold back any sustainable recovery. Mr George's speech was set in the context of a long-term vision of how he would like to control monetary policy, an area where the bank at present advises the Treasury. However, it was given special resonance by the revelation yesterday that Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, has secretly pushed the idea of giving the bank independence to remove politicians from interest-rate judgments. The governor-designate said there was a worry that 'bringing interest rates down too far would increase the risk of the re-emergence of inflationary pressures'. That 'might make lower interest rates difficult to sustain', he added. He said Britain had a 'solid platform' for future growth, with unmistakeable signs of recovery. But he said that with long-term gilt yields relatively high at 8 per cent, as opposed to base rates of 6 per cent, financial markets were still unconvinced that Britain had got on top of inflationary pressures. Sounding a warning against any further loosening in economic policies, Mr George said that if people had the confidence that inflation would remain low, 'then relatively low and relatively stable interest rates will tend to follow'. He said it was wrong to opt for lower interest rates and assume that inflation would also remain low. In an apparent swipe at those arguing for fresh cuts in base rates, held at their present levels since January, Mr George said that even if borrowing costs were lower people would not necessarily spend or borrow more. That was because of the 'bitter experiences of the late 1980s', in which many individuals and businesses took advantage of relatively low interest rates to step up loans and expenditure, only to find themselves in financial difficulties when the recession began to bite a few years later. In a further distancing by the bank of any goal to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism, Mr George said exchange rate stability, though a useful goal, could not be achieved at the expense of a 'distortion of domestic (economic) policy'.</p>

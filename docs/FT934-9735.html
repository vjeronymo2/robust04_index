			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Canadian borrower's CDollars 1bn offer dominates issuance A CDollars 1bn offering of five-year global bonds from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp (CMHC) dominated a relatively heavy day of issuance in the international bond market yesterday. The offering is designed to establish a benchmark for the government-owned issuer's initiative to lend directly to social housing projects. CMHC plans to raise CDollars 2bn a year over the next five years in order to refinance existing mortgages. Syndicate managers said that CMHC's bonds were snapped up by investors because of their premium of 15 basis points over the yield on underlying Canadian government bonds. Around 80 per cent of the issue was placed equally in North America and Europe and the remaining 20 per cent was sold into Asia. Non-Japanese investors in Asia were particularly keen buyers. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened to 12 1/2 basis points. The volume of new Eurobond issues is expected to remain high for the rest of this week. Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, the central bank for the savings banks in that German state, is likely to launch a Dollars 500m five-year offering today. The bonds, via Goldman Sachs, are likely to be priced to yield between 20 and 25 basis points over US Treasuries. Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, which has a high double-A rating, has done some small Eurobond deals in the past year but they have been targeted mainly at retail investors. Today's offering is seen as the start of an international borrowing programme. There is a growing trend among German banks to shift the emphasis of their funding away from the domestic German bond market. For example, Depfa, the German mortgage bank, has been active in the international bond market in recent months and is likely to tap the French franc sector this week. BAT Industries, the Anglo-American conglomerate, is widely expected to raise Dollars 500m through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds today. The bonds, via CSFB and Goldman Sachs, are likely to be priced to yield around 70 basis points over underlying US Treasuries. Among yesterday's other new issues, the FFr1.1bn seven-year offering from Electric Power Development Co (EPDC), the rarely-seen Japanese government agency, sold more quickly than the FFr1.3bn 10-year deal from Andalucia, the Spanish autonomous region. Syndicate managers said that the rarity value of EPDC enabled it to achieve a relatively tight yield spread of 20 basis points over underlying French government bonds. When the bonds were freed to trade the spread remained intact. By contrast, Andalucia's bonds remained in syndicate overnight to allow time for the bonds to be marketed in the Far East. It was widely thought that last week's French franc offering from Catalonia had stolen the thunder from Andalucia. Elsewhere, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, announced that it was buying back up to Dollars 150m of four outstanding Eurobond issues which are close to redemption. The repurchase programme was designed to enhance value for holders of the high-coupon bonds since they were trading at a substantial premium to par. The move also allowed the IFC to extend the maturity of its debt and to re-finance old, high-coupon debt with cheaper, current-coupon paper.</p>

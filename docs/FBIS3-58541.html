			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bela Anda and Kai Diekmann: "Was He the Super </F> Spy?"]    [Text] Whenever something happened in Bonn, he was  present, and he knew all the state secrets -- Karl Wienand (67),  Social Democratic Party [SPD] floor leader from 1967 through  1974, is suspected of having worked not only for the Stasi but  also for the KGB. Wienand was questioned all day yesterday in  the Federal Prosecutor General's Office in Karlsruhe. The SPD  politician continues to reject strictly all charges. According  to information obtained by BILD, a new witness has incriminated  Wienand so seriously that the federal prosecutor general will  formally indict him next week. If the grave suspicion were to  be confirmed, the Wienand case would be the greatest case of  treason in the Federal Republic's history.    It was for years a great mystery in Bonn. Who is the super  spy? Defectors from the East had provided leads time and again.  Stasi Chief Markus Wolf also made vague indications following  the change.    Now the formerly powerful SPD politician, Karl Wienand, is  in  the focus. He was in the center of power more than anyone else  and was Herbert Wehner's closest confidant. Hardly anything  happened in Bonn without him.    The question: Did he have secret contacts with the East in  order to be of use to the people in both German states? Or what?    Karl Wienand was talked about time and time again --  sometimes for having received money as adviser for the  "Paninternational" airliner, sometimes in connection with the  bribery affair around Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Deputy  Julius Steiner, who, in the no-confidence vote against Willy  Brandt, voted for the SPD chancellor for 50,000 German marks.    What does Karl Wienand have to do with the Stasi?    Since August 1993, the federal public prosecutor general has  investigated the SPD politician because of suspected  "intelligence activities." For a salary of 10,000 German marks  per month, he allegedly collaborated with the Stasi. The Stasi  kept him under the cover name of "Streit." This is what  Wienand's former control officer, Stasi captain Alfred Voelkel  (cover name "Krueger"), claims.    Having been confronted with Wienand, the Stasi man withdrew  his testimony. Wienand also disputed all charges.    According to information obtained by BILD, another former  Stasi officer has now spilled the beans and reiterated the  espionage charges against Wienand. The investigations are  completed. Wienand will be indicted next week.    How important was Wienand for the Stasi?    On behalf of Herbert Wehner, Wienand held strictly secret  talks with the GDR leadership in 1970 to establish "a  continuous, unofficial political contact, in addition to the  official negotiations."    In a secret Stasi document, it says: "Streit (alias Wienand)  repeatedly stressed the absolute confidentiality, because  otherwise, the SPD leadership would get into a lot of trouble."  Nor must the Free Democratic Party [FDP] as a coalition partner  "be informed under any circumstances."    What did Wienand have to do with the KGB?    According to information obtained by BILD, Valentin Falin,  the former Soviet Ambassador to Bonn, met with Willy Brandt in  the latter's Bonn office in the second half of March 1992.  According to confidants, Falin hinted that Karl Wienand was a  KGB agent.    Brandt informed the Federal Intelligence Service in  Munich-Pullach.    Asked by BILD, former Ambassador Falin denied the meeting  with Brandt: "There was never a talk with Brand on any Wienand  contacts with the KGB."    What is strange, however, is that, asked by BILD, Brandt's  widow, Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt, remembered the Falin-Brandt  meeting in the second half of March 1992 very clearly....</p>

Tkachenko: "Preliminary Results: One Year </F> After Kim Yong-Sam Took Office as South Korean President"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Big hopes were placed on a new  policy in Seoul regarding North Korea and reducing tensions on  the peninsula. The president conceived the idea of a gradual  convergence between North and South resulting from joint efforts  to overcome animosity and mistrust, broaden cooperation, and  ensure mutual coexistence and prosperity. The key feature of the  new ideas was that the convergence was to be voluntary and  democratic, i.e., the majority of the population in the North  and South would agree to live together at the same standard of  living in two parts of a unified country.    Nonetheless, in spite of the proclaimed declarations  relations between North and South have noticeably worsened in  the last year. The euphoria caused by the sensationalized  agreements reached in 1991-1992 on reconciliation and reducing  tensions, was replaced by a deep pessimism. Contacts in  humanitarian and cultural spheres that had been maintained even  during sharp confrontation were broken off.    The cause for stagnation in inter-Korean relations involved  a  nuclear arms problem on the peninsula, MAGATE [IAEA,  International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections of both DPRK  nuclear sights and military bases in the North and South, and a  bilateral agreement on a nuclear-free zone. No agreement was  successfully reached on these issues during inter-Korean  negotiations, and now a dialog is underway between the U.S. and  the DPRK.    There were no major events that transpired last year in the  development of Russian-South Korean relations. A feeling of  dissatisfaction arose in connection with Russia's failure to act  as a bridge between North and South Korea when a sharp political  crisis followed the DPRK's decision in March to withdraw from a  nuclear arms nonproliferation agreement. However, what bearing  could Russia have had on the situation after relations became  paralyzed between Russia and the DPRK for ideological reasons?  The role traditionally belonging to Russia as a peacekeeper and  guarantor of security in Korea has now gone to China, which is  now skillfully performing these duties to its obvious benefit.    No boom in economic relations has taken place between Russia  and the Republic of Korea. The exchange of goods between them  has not even exceeded the 2 billion dollar mark, that is, it has  remained at the same level as our trade in 1988 with North  Korea. Not one of the 23 projects for economic and  scientific-technical cooperation submitted for review to the  South Korean government by Russia has been realized. The problem  of Russia repaying 1.5 billion dollars in credit extended to us  by the Republic of Korea, has also not yet been resolved.    This year Kim Yong-Sam will visit our country. Now is the  time for tallying up results, studying prospects for  strengthening cooperation between our countries to our mutual  benefit, and preparing new terms and agreements. The  Russian-Korean summit meeting, as expected, will allow for  making our relations more dynamic and purposeful. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> DOWN AGAIN LAUDED AFTER VICTORY  </P> <P> Don't ever speak badly of Down Again in front of Richard Cross.  </P> <P> After the 6-year-old mare had ended a 10-race losing streak, at 16-1, in  Wednesday's $83,950 Monrovia Handicap at Santa Anita, her trainer sprang to her  defense.  </P> <P> "I keep reading she lacks the will to win, but she's now won 10 races and  earned more than $550,000," he said after Down Again's half-length victory over  11-1 shot Sexy Slew. "I can't find many horses that have won 10 races."  </P> <P> Down Again was timed in 1:13 for about 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf.  </P> <P> Despite Cross' observations, the mare, owned by Bruce McNall, owner of the  Kings and one of his employees, defenseman Larry Robinson, has been content to  settle for minor prizes more often than not in this country. She won only twice  in 15 starts last year while finishing second or third in eight others.  </P> <P> Perhaps the key Wednesday was the return of jockey Corey Black. He was in the  saddle for Down Again's last three victories.  </P> <P> "This isn't meant to be a reflection on the ability of other jockeys, but she  runs for some and not for others," Cross said. "She had just a perfect trip.  Some days, she would put her head in the air when she made the lead, but she  won with it today.  </P> <P> "I don't know why she ran so bad last time (fifth of six Jan. 31). The only  thing I figure is that in a short field, she couldn't get as much cover and she  went too fast, too soon. When she gets cover and they go fast up front in a big  field, she seems to fire."  </P> <P> Black was careful not to go too soon with Down Again.  </P> <P> "She was cruising on the turn and I was worried she'd pull me to the lead too  soon," he said. "She tends not to do her best if she hits the front too early.  She only has a short run in her and she's not much for the stick. If you get  after her, she tends to sulk.  </P> <P> "When I asked her, she went. This is the most willing she's been in the races  I've been on her."  </P> <P> Sexy Slew finished a neck ahead of Hot Novel, who was a head better than a  troubled Survive. Stormy But Valid, the 5-2 favorite, was a much-troubled  fifth.  </P> <P> "She had a terrible trip," said Gary Stevens of Stormy But Valid. "I was  sitting where the winner was at the start of the left turn. I was afraid of  clipping heels and checked her. I moved out to go around one horse at the  (main-track) crossing and that horse moved out at the same time and carried a  lot of us out.  </P> <P> "I was way out by the grandstand. I could have grabbed a hot dog. She had a  right to get beat 10 lengths."  </P> <P> Readying for her scheduled rematch with Bayakoa in Sunday's $300,000 Santa  Margarita Invitational Handicap, Gorgeous worked five furlongs in 1:00  Wednesday at Hollywood Park. The clockers termed the drill breezing for the  4-year-old Slew o' Gold filly, who coasted in winning the La Canada Handicap  Feb. 3.  </P> <P> Gorgeous and Bayakoa's other meeting was in the Breeders' Cup Distaff and  Bayakoa won by a length and a half. In the Santa Margarita, Bayakoa must carry  127 pounds, two more than her younger rival.  </P> <P> The other possible starters in the 1 1/8-mile Santa Margarita are Luthier's  Launch, runner-up in the El Encino and La Canada; Kelly; Nikishka, Invited  Guest, Dreaming Mimi and Carita Tostada.  </P> <P> In his first day as a regular on the local circuit, Kent Desormeaux drew a  blank with five mounts.  </P> <P> The best the Eclipse Award-winning jockey could manage was a distant second on  17-1 shot Strogien in the fifth race.  </P> <P> "I feel good," he said. "I wasn't nervous. I had good trips all day and the one  horse was just second best."  </P> <P> Desormeaux will be busy today and Friday. He is named on seven horses today and  has six calls Friday.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Johnny Longden turned 83 Wednesday. . . . Trainer Gregory Vartanian was fined  $300 by the stewards after Kamakhalyn, who finished second in the first race  Feb. 1, was found to have an excessive level of butazolidin, a painkiller.  </P> <P> Despite several double-digit winners, there was one perfect ticket in the Pick  Six and it was worth $216,061.60. . . . Lickety Splitter became the  longest-priced winner of the meeting when she won the ninth at $150.40. Ridden  by Luis Jauregui, the 5-year-old mare hadn't been out since finishing seventh  at Fairplex Park Sept. 30 and hadn't won since April.  </P></p>

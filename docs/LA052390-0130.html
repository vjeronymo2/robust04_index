			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> TWO CITIES APPROVE 'BLINDER RACKS'  </P> <P> The Santa Ana and Costa Mesa city councils this week approved ordinances that  require news racks displaying pornographic newspapers to be partially covered  with "blinder racks" to prevent minors from being able to see sexually explicit  material.  </P> <P> The blinders must cover at least two-thirds of the front page of pornographic  publications.  </P> <P> Only publications sold on sidewalks will be affected.  </P> <P> In 30 days, Costa Mesa will send notices to news rack owners explaining the new  ordinance. They will have 30 to 60 days to comply before the city begins  issuing citations, City Manager Allan L. Roeder said.  </P> <P> Non-compliance in Costa Mesa will be a misdemeanor with a potential fine of  $200 and time in jail. In Santa Ana, punishment for the misdemeanor is stiffer,  with violators facing up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000.  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa ordinance will give that city the opportunity to beef up  enforcement of an existing code that bans news racks not permanently installed  on sidewalks. City workers found that much of the adult material was being sold  from news racks chained to permanent racks that have permits from the city.  </P> <P> The owners will be advised to apply for permits for permanent status. Roeder  said that the city issues those permits on a first-come, first-served basis and  does not consider whether the racks will display sexually explicit  material.MARY ANNE PEREZ and GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

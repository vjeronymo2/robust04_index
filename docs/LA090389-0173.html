			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VICTIM OF GANG SHOOTING DIES; 5 OTHERS HURT  </P> <P> A gang member wounded last month in a shooting has died from his injuries, and  five people were injured in two gang-related shootings late Friday night and  early Saturday morning, authorities said.  </P> <P> Police said Valente Orosco, 20, died Friday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of  wounds he suffered in an Aug. 18 shooting in Los Angeles. Orosco was shot while  standing in the 2900 block of West 14th Street in the mid-city area, police  said.  </P> <P> In one of the latest rounds of gang violence, two suspected gang members were  shot and wounded in an unincorporated area near Gardena as they walked out of  the Barbary Coast club in the 143000 block of South Western Avenue about 10:30  p.m. Friday, police said.  </P> <P> Four men emerged from behind the building and asked the two victims, "What's  up, cuz?" an expression used to determine gang affiliation, said Sgt. Edward  Allen of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> One of the suspects opened fire with a 9-millimeter pistol, and then the four  men fled, Allen said.  </P> <P> The two victims, identified as Harrington McFrazier, 22, and Daniel Stapleton,  23, both of Watts, staggered to a nearby fast-food restaurant, where employees  called paramedics.  </P> <P> Both men were taken to Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. McFrazier,  who suffered wounds in the stomach and a leg, was listed Saturday in serious  but stable condition, Allen said. Stapleton, who suffered wounds in a leg and a  hand, was in good condition.  </P> <P> No arrests had been made Saturday, Allen said.  </P> <P> In the second shooting, two youths and a man walking near 3rd and Center  streets in San Pedro were wounded shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday, when three men  in a passing truck yelled "Waterfront Pirus," the name of a local gang, and  opened fire, said Police Lt. Richard Gonzales.  </P> <P> The victims -- ages 15, 16 and 21 -- were struck by shotgun pellets, Gonzales  said. Two rounds shattered a window of a nearby apartment but no one inside was  hurt, he said.  </P> <P> Two of the victims were taken to San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, and the third  was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. All three were listed in  serious but stable condition Saturday, Gonzales said.  </P> <P> The suspects, believed to be gang members, had not been arrested, Gonzales  said.  </P></p>

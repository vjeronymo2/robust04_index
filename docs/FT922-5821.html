			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Observer: Rough ride It is somewhat ironic that on the very day the Cadbury report on corporate governance was published, Rolls-Royce should have been given a rough ride from shareholders. Instead of getting a warm send-off for piloting the company during the last seven years through privatisation, doubling its sales and orders and expanding its market share, Lord Tombs faced stiff questioning at yesterday's annual meeting from shareholders and former employees on the company's handling of its voluntary redundancy scheme. Like its US aero-engine competitors, Rolls-Royce has been forced to make extensive job cuts. But this has clearly left a bitter feeling among many employees and small shareholders who voted against a resolution to amend the directors' executive share option scheme. Not that Rolls-Royce directors earn extravagant salaries. Tombs's own pay was reduced last year, and the outgoing chairman pointed out that Rolls-Royce was in the bottom 10 per cent of the UK directors' salary league.</p>

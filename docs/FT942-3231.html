			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (4): Still a Cinderella sector - Mobile Data Services Mobile data remains the Cinderella of the telecommunications industry. Although there is almost universal agreement that mobile data services will eventually grow into a substantial market, for the moment they are overshadowed by the spectacular growth of cellular radio voice communications. The failure of mobile data to live up to early expectations has already prompted some suppliers to re-assess their strategies and reconsider investments. In the UK, for example, Hutchison Mobile Data ceased marketing its fledgling dedicated data service last autumn and is now expected to offer mobile data services on its recently launched Orange digital Personal Communications Network later this year. Ovum, the market research organisation, noted in a report on mobile data published last year that early users of mobile data services have experienced 'the very real and measurable benefits from mobile data in terms of reduced costs, increased efficiency and improved customer service. Furthermore, they have usually achieved a rapid payback.' The report conceded however that, 'despite services being available on cellular and public data-only networks, the market has been slow to develop. Data-only networks are facing an uphill struggle to attract subscribers and the number of data users on the cellular network is in the region of 2-5 per cent of the user base.' By the end of last year Ovum estimated that there were just 325,000 users of mobile data in North America and Europe with organisations using the services falling into two main categories, vertical markets, particularly the service industries, and early horizontal markets involving industries with a significant service element in some aspect of their business. Typical applications involve transferring engineering, customer or product information to and from portable computers, or retrieving information from mobile data terminals such as meter readers. Other applications include keeping track of truck fleets or railway wagons. Despite this relatively slow start Ovum, like most other forecasters, believes that mobile data will soon take off - 'by the year 2000 there will be more than 9m users of mobile data services in North America and Europe. This will represent a Dollars 7.6bn market for terminal equipment, network infrastructure, systems integration and airtime revenue.' Ovum says the driving forces behind the increased adoption of data services are a more mobile workforce; real user-benefits; a growing demand for computing and communications on the move, and a growth in data communications generally. It suggests, however, that the market is constrained by factors including customer concern over competition between mobile data services technology and the availability of networks, price of equipment and excessively complex and expensive applications, lack of market understanding and belief that perceived risks outweigh cost benefits. Two of these factors, customer concern about which service to buy and the availability of networks, are crucial. The mobile data market, while developing competing technologies, is conspicuous for its lack of standards, making potential customers nervous. This situation is exacerbated by the bewildering array of data delivery systems. In the UK, excluding pager traffic, mobile data services are offered by cellular telephone network operators, dedicated mobile data network operators and private and public access mobile radio networks - all using incompatible standards and equipment. All of the options have their attractions and drawbacks. For example, it is possible to transmit data over an analogue cellular telephone system such as the Cellnet or Vodafone networks in the UK, but this is generally more difficult, slower and considerably more expensive than transmiting data over the fixed public switched telephone network. As a result, relatively few business customers use cellular telephone systems to transmit data. For analogue cellular customers who require data communications, one solution is to to use a cellular modem. For example in the UK Vodafone's mobile data service uses a cellular data link control (CDLC) modem enabling customers to transmit and receive error-free data over its network. It is also possible to use a cellular line interface (CLI) with a standard modem and some mobile phones. Data transmission over the new generation of digital cellular telephone systems, such as the GSM and PCN services in Europe which have just started up, should be simpler, faster and more reliable. The GSM specification includes a facility which will eventually allow any terminal - for example, a portable facsimile machine or a notebook computer  -to be plugged directly into the handset. In the US, analogue cellular network operators led by AT&amp;T's subsidiary, McCaw Cellular Communications, are upgrading their networks to accommodate a new 'open' technology called cellular digital packet-switched data (CDPD). CDPD enables data to be sent in blocks over existing networks using the 'spaces' between voice traffic. Because it provides the advantages of digital transmission without the need for expanded system capacity, it is very cost-effective option. For customers who require voice and data communications from a moving vehicle, a two-way public access mobile radio service such as the UK's National Band Three (NB3) is soon to be available. NB3 customers buy their own communications equipment and then pay a fixed monthly subscription. They do not pay call charges. Meanwhile in the US, Nextel, a six-year-old New Jersey radio dispatch service company, has been using digital technology from Motorola to create a nationwide network offering voice, data and paging as well as its established dispatch services. Nextel's services are expected to compete with the high speed and low cost wireless data links provided by dedicated packet-switched data networks such as Ardis - a joint venture between IBM and Motorola - and Ram Broadcasting in the US. Similar packet-switched mobile data networks, mostly based on Ericsson's Mobitex technology, have been built or are planned throughout Europe. In the UK where there are three surviving mobile data networks, Cognito, Vodafone's Paknet and Ram Mobile Data - a joint venture involving US-based Ram Broadcasting and BellSouth, France Telcom, Swedish Telcom and Bouygues. Although subscriber growth has been slow, Mr John Jarvis, Ram Mobile Data's chief executive, says interest is accelerating - 'we are beginning to see an industry with mass market characteristics in terms of size and potential,' he says. However, he acknowledges that although there is an increasing understanding that mobile data can make a strategic difference to competitiveness, 'senior managers still require education on how to apply the technology to their businesses and derive commercial advantage.' If the mobile data market does finally shed its Cinderella image, the competing technologies will need to work hard for custom.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Ukraine nears accord on currency RUSSIA and Ukraine agreed provisionally yesterday on how a Ukrainian currency could be introduced without disrupting the rouble zone. The agreement between senior officials could signal a breakthrough in relations between the former Soviet republics, although it has still to win approval from the respective governments. But Mr Volodymir Hryniov, deputy president of the Ukrainian parliament, said: 'We have no doubt this document will be taken as the framework for the introduction of our currency.' Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, deputy chairman of the Russian parliament, said he was sure the deal would be signed. The delegations were among 11 from post-Soviet states at a conference to discuss how best to organise trade and monetary policy. It was part of an attempt by the European Commission, the Soros Foundation, the Centre for European Policy Studies and the London School of Economics to sponsor as common an economic space as possible among the republics. The 'code of conduct' agrees: It is the right of all sovereign states to issue currency; Substitution of old currencies should be 'quick, complete, and non-discriminatory'; All roubles collected should be remitted to the Russian central bank; Monetary assets of other rouble zone residents will be treated in a way which minimises damage to all parties; The country issuing the new currency will inform rouble zone central banks of its programme, subject to confidentiality on the exact date and rate of substitution. AP reports from Kiev: Ukraine took control of a Soviet air force division yesterday, three days after a group of pilots 'defected' to Russia, Tass news agency said. Ukraine's Defence Ministry could not confirm the report, which Tass said was the first time a strategic force under the Commonwealth of Independent States had withdrawn from central command. Reuter reports from Madrid: Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's deputy premier, and Mr Claudio Aranzadi, Spanish industry minister, said Spain would release the remaining Dollars 1bn of a Dollars 1.5bn credit line extended to the Soviet Union in November 1990 for three years.</p>

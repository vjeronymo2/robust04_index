As a result,  the demands by creditors have almost doubled to about 30 billion  German marks [DM]. This was announced by the Federal  Statistical Office in Wiesbaden on Friday [25 February].    In western Germany alone the number of bankruptcies rose by  30.5 percent to 12,821. Most bankruptcies were registered in  the service sector, with 3,574 (plus 27.5 percent). Trade was  also heavily hit, where 3,161 companies (plus 28.7 percent)  threw in the towel. The highest increase in company  bankruptcies occurred in the processing industry, with a plus of  38.4 percent, reaching 2,528 cases.    Including the bankruptcies of persons and of decedent's  estates, there were 17,537 bankruptcies and composition  proceedings in 1993. Thus, the previous year was exceeded by  24.2 percent. The damage to the creditors, which amounted to  DM23.5 billion, was more than twice as high as in 1992 with  about DM11 billion. Despite the strong increase, the cases of  bankruptcy and composition proceedings did not reach the record  levels of 1985 and 1986, when there were about 19,000 cases of  insolvency and overindebteness each year.    In eastern Germany there were applications for total  execution for 2,327 companies in 1993. The total number of  insolvencies, 2,761, more than doubled -- rising by 133 percent  -- compared with 1992. Demands by creditors were fixed at DM5.5  billion (previous year DM4.3 billion) by the courts.</p>

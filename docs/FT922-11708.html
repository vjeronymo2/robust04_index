			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Technology: Viewers take the starring role - Compact discs for television go on sale in Britain on Monday Whether you are a couch potato or prefer to spend your leisure time in the garden, the television set is likely to feature prominently as a source of entertainment and information. But in spite of all the advances made in television technology over the years, one thing has remained the same - watching TV has always been a passive experience. Philips, the Dutch electronics group, hopes to remedy this by bringing an element of 'interactivity' to the television screen through a new entertainment system called Compact Disc Interactive. CD-I, which has been sold exclusively in the US since November and is being launched in the UK on Monday, is a multimedia system combining animation, graphics, text, video and audio on a compact disc. The machine which plays the programmes is similar to a standard audio CD-player but is connected to the television instead. It can also be connected to a stereo system to achieve superior sound. What differentiates CD-I from other entertainment media that use the TV screen, such as video recorders or laser disc players, is that CD-I enables the viewer to manipulate the material using a remote-controlled device. Instead of a programme running from beginning to end as it would on TV or video, CD-I discs have several layers of material hidden behind what is shown on the screen. This can be tapped into using a remote control unit similar to a mouse used for computers. It can move easily from a drawing of an engine, for example, to a textual description and on again to a still photograph of the engine. The images can also appear on the screen at one time. CD-I is a digital system that uses memory chips and a powerful microprocessor which acts as its 'brain'. Like a computer, a CD-I disc and player can: Store and process an enormous amount of information. The five-inch 650 Mbyte CDs can store up to 250,000 typed pages of text, more than 7,000 photographic quality images, 19 hours of speech and four planes of visual effects. Provide instant access to material anywhere on the disc. Unlike video tapes, which are analogue, digital discs allow random access to the material contained in it. Just as users can move from one track of a CD to another without going through the tedious fast forward sequence of a tape, it is possible to move instantly from one part of a CD-I programme to another. Present different types of information, from text to video, simultaneously. CD-I is a multimedia system in which a video picture can be combined with a text and a graphic illustration of a related subject on the screen at the same time. Proponents of multimedia say that this simultaneous presentation of material is closer to the way we use our various senses to perceive the world around us. Allow the user to alter the material on the screen. The microprocessor 'brain' that runs the CD-I disc sion. For example, in certain programmes users can choose the colour of the graphics. In a music programme a particular musical piece can be heard on piano, violin or flute. CD-I is thus one of the earliest products that brings together computers and consumer electronics, a convergence that the electronics industry has been anticipating for some time. But what, by bringing computer elements to the TV, does CD-I offer that other media do not? To some extent, it combines the functions of pre-recorded video tapes and laser discs. Karaoke, video and computer games, music lessons and children's educational programmes are among the programmes Philips has lined up. Philips, however, sees the attraction of CD-I primarily in being an entirely new entertainment experience because it gives users greater involvement in and control over the software. For example, in Treasures of the Smithsonian, a programme organised as a tour through the 13 Washington museums and the National Zoo, the user can spend as much time in any one part of the museum as they like and browse or navigate through the museum at their own pace, much as they would in real life. They can also jump from one room in the museum to another room at the other end of the complex, in an instant. Additional information on each of the exhibits can be called to the screen by using the remote control unit. One thing CD-I does not do is to provide full-motion video, which would bring feature films on compact discs. Currently video is restricted to a small portion of the screen but Philips is bringing out a version capable of transmitting video over the full screen later this year. Future applications could bring interactive films and magazines which might even be linked to real-time television programming. But by being so many different things at the same time, the system risks confusing its audience. Multimedia has been described as a technology looking for a role. Philips' biggest challenge in selling its multimedia system may be to convince people why, on a lazy Sunday afternoon, they should want to interact with their TV anyway.</p>

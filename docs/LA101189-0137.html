			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOUSE ADDS RAPE AND INCEST TO CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ABORTION  </P> <P> The House narrowly voted today to add cases of rape and incest to the  circumstances in which poor women can have government-funded abortions,  approving language that President Bush has vowed to veto.  </P> <P> The emotional debate came during action on spending bills for the Labor and  Health and Human Services departments and the District of Columbia, both of  which have been threatened with vetoes over abortion questions.  </P> <P> The Senate now must act on the compromise bills that worked out differences  between House and Senate versions of the legislation  </P> <P> The key abortion vote came on a motion by Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae)  asking the House to reverse itself and go along with the Senate on the  Labor-HHS bill by adding to the standard "life of the mother" cases incidents  of rape and incest. She prevailed, 216 to 206. In a second vote, Boxer won, 212  to 207.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Franco Foresta Martin: "The European Biology </F> Laboratory -- Italy Must Be Given More Importance"]    [Text] The conditions of Italy's participation in the  European Molecular Biology Laboratory [EMBL] in Heidelberg have  become the cause of a conflict that is dividing our scientific  community, stirring up opposing initiatives of solidarity and  objection to the work of University and Research Minister  Umberto Colombo.    It is necessary to provide the background information before  giving an update on a situation that has become incandescent.  At the end of December, the Italian Government, at the  initiative of Minister Colombo, decided to denounce the  agreement under which our country belongs to the EMBL by  protesting about the disproportion between our financial  contribution (16 percent) and the number of Italian researchers  present in Heidelberg (1 percent). According to the statute a  member country must give a year's notice of its intention to  leave. Therefore, if there are no new developments, Italy will  leave this research organization in January 1995.    Prof. Alfonso Maria Liquori, a biochemist, reminded us on  these same pages (23 January 1994) of the historical roots of  the Heidelberg laboratory, the benefits that Italian molecular  biology had gained from it, and the damage that would result if  Italy should leave. Prof. Riccardo Cortese and other scientists  who have sent letters of protest to Minister Colombo are of the  same opinion. "Italy's withdrawal from the EMBL would damage  both the European scientific community and that of Italy, and in  particular it would reduce the opportunities for exchanges to be  made between young Italian researchers and their European  colleagues."  <H5>  Intolerable Situation </H5>   A large part of the biological community opposes these  vehement requests and expresses appreciation of the action  launched by Minister Colombo, stressing that this, rather than  an irreversible abandonment of the Heidelberg laboratory, is the  only way we can protest against a situation that has now become  intolerable. ICGEB (International Center for Genetic  Engineering and Biotechnology) Director Prof. Arturo Falaschi in  Trieste is a supporter of this position. "The EMBL," explains  Falaschi, "conducts basic research into molecular biology and in  particular it deals with the study of viruses, the cell cycle,  the structure of proteins and the genome. The spin-offs from  this research can be considerable for the vaccine and  pharmaceutical industry in general, and for agriculture and food  production."    "The importance of this laboratory for Italy, where nothing  exists of a comparable size, is not in question," he stressed.  "What appears to be unacceptable is the continued tolerance of  the disadvantageous conditions under which Italy is  participating." Falaschi shows some tables in which the figures  speak for themselves. In the past few years, out of a total of  about 300 researchers there have been less than 10 Italians,  while there have been about 100 Germans, 70 British, and 30  French. Nevertheless, today Italy is the third supporter of the  EMBL, after Germany and France, with a contribution of about 10  million German marks [DM].  <H5>  Small Nuclei </H5>   "I would be the first person to be sorry if Italy were to  leave the EMBL," confirms Minister Colombo. "Last fall, when  the president and the managing director of the EMBL visited  Italy, I expressed unease about the fact that our country,  despite its contribution of DM9.7 million, was below the quota  both as far as personnel and scholarships were concerned; and  because it had not even acquired, like the other major  contributors, an outstation, that is an important  EMBL-affiliated center, in its own territory. Therefore, we  agreed that our proposal to set up about 10 small EMBL research  nuclei in Italy, at the same number of universities, instead of  a single outstation, would have been discussed at the next  council meeting. The council has reduced the offer to just four  nuclei. This has led to our protest action."    The denouncement of the agreement, Colombo persists in  stressing, has a double function; that of making us stronger in  the negotiations that we will face to obtain more dignified  conditions for our country; and that of requesting clarification  from our researchers, because if the number of our people at  Heidelberg is small this also depends on internal reasons. "I  hope," concludes Colombo, "that I will soon be able to announce  a favorable solution to the crisis."</p>

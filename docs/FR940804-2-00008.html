			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Absence of De Jure Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The respondents in this investigation have submitted a number of documents to demonstrate absence of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de jure  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> control, including three enactments indicating that the responsibility for managing enterprises ``owned by all of the people'' is with the enterprises themselves and not with the government. These are the ``Law of the People's Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April 13, 1988 (``1988 Law''); ``Regulations for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved on August 23, 1992 (``1992 Regulations''); and the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration of Export Commodities,'' approved on December 21, 1992 (``Export Provisions'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1988 Law and 1992 Regulations shifted control from the government to the enterprises themselves. The 1988 Law provides that enterprises owned ``by the whole people'' shall make their own management decisions, be responsible for their own profits and losses, choose their own suppliers, and purchase their own goods and materials. The 1988 Law also has other provisions which support a finding that enterprises have management independence from the government. The 1992 Regulations provide that these same enterprises can, for example, set their own prices (Article IX); make their own production decisions (Article XI); use their own retained foreign exchange (Article XII); allocate profits (Article II); sell their own products without government interference (Article X); make their own investment decisions (Article XIII); dispose of their own assets (Article XV); and hire and fire their employees without government approval (Article XVII).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Export Provisions list those products subject to direct government control. Coumarin is not included in the Export Provisions list and does not, therefore, appear to be subject to the export constraints of these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existence of these enactments indicates that Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native are not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de jure  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> subject to governmental control. However, there is some evidence that the provisions of the above-cited laws and regulations have not been implemented uniformly among different sectors and/or jurisdictions in the PRC (see ``PRC Government Findings on Enterprise Autonomy,'' in Foreign Broadcast Information Service-China-93&hyph;133 (July 14, 1993)). Therefore, the Department has determined that an analysis of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> control is critical to determining whether respondents are, in fact, subject to governmental control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Absence of De Facto Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department typically considers four factors in evaluating whether each respondent is subject to de facto governmental control of its export functions: (1) Whether the export prices are set by or subject to the approval of a governmental authority; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements; (3) whether the respondent has autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management; and (4) whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding disposition of profits or financing of losses (see Silicon Carbide and Sebacic Acid).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have each asserted that (1) it establishes its own export prices; (2) it negotiates contracts without guidance from any governmental entities or organizations; (3) its management operates with a high degree of autonomy and there is no information on the record that suggests central government control over selection of management; and (4) it retains the proceeds of its export sales, and has the authority to sell its assets and to obtain loans. In addition, questionnaire responses indicate that company-specific pricing during the POI does not suggest any coordination among exporters ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the prices for comparable products differ among companies). This information supports a preliminary finding that there is a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> absence of governmental control of export functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have preliminarily met the criteria for the application of separate rates. We will examine this issue in detail at verification and determine whether the questionnaire responses are supported by verifiable documentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two additional issues relating to governmental control that we will consider further for purposes of our final determination. First, Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have indicated that the appointments of their general managers are subject to approval by the local Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureaus (local Bureaus). Second, each of the responding exporters has reported that they are ``administratively subject to'' the local Bureaus. While the significance of the involvement of the local Bureaus is unclear, the respondents have reported that the local bureaus do not control the key functions of the enterprises. However, we will examine at verification the precise nature of the authority that the local Bureaus exercise over the enterprises.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Nonmarket Economy Country Status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PRC has been treated as a nonmarket economy country (NME) in all past antidumping investigations (see,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Sebacic Acid and Silicon Carbide). No information has been provided in this proceeding that would lead us to overturn our former determinations. Therefore, in accordance with section 771(18)(c) of the Act, we have treated the PRC as an NME for purposes of this investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

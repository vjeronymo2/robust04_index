			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S -- FROM NOUVELLE TO ANYTHING GOES  </P> <P> In 1980, fancy food was French, pizza was proletarian and salads contained  iceberg lettuce. Most people hadn't heard of California Cuisine. Raw fish was  considered fine fare for the seals at the zoo. Had you said "tirami-su" most  people would have replied, "God bless you." Open kitchens were found in diners,  grazing was an activity common to cows and blackened was just a nice way of  saying burnt.  </P> <P> Things changed. The '80s were an era of restaurant madness when we all learned  about Cajun cuisine, graduated from spaghetti to pasta and found out that the  waiter was our friend. It was a time when every upscale eater would learn sushi  Japanese, taco-stand Spanish and all the Thai words for noodles. Chefs became  celebrities. We discovered that vegetables were best as babies and that all  olive oil should be virgin. We developed a passion for pepper, an aversion to  salt and learned to love chiles.  </P> <P> And that was just for starters.  </P> <P> How to Name a Restaurant:  </P> <P> For a dog (Tosh, Orso, Checkers)  </P> <P> . . . a plane (DC 3)  </P> <P> . . . a wine (Le Chardonnay, St. Estephe)  </P> <P> . . . a dance (Cha Cha Cha)  </P> <P> . . . a wife (Rebecca's)  </P> <P> . . . a chemical process (Patina)  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS: THEN AND NOW  </P> <P> Ubiquitous Waiterspeak:  </P> <P> 80: The waiter as friend: "Hi, my name is Eric . . .

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chris Yeung in Beijing and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Excerpts] Beijing has boosted its defence budget by 20 per  cent in an apparent bid to expedite modernisation of weaponry.    While addressing the National People's Congress (NPC)  yesterday, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said the State Council  had earmarked 52.04 billion yuan (HK$46.2 billion) for national  defence for 1994. The percentage increase this year was the  highest since 1979, when patriarch Deng Xiaoping launched his  economic reforms, one of whose tenets was to curtail military  spending and devote more resources to the economy.    China's military outlay takes up 9.59 per cent of its total  governmental expenditure, as compared with 23 per cent for  Taiwan, 24.3 per cent for South Korea and 17.6 per cent for the  United States. A total of 43.25 billion yuan was spent on the  People's Liberation Army (PLA) last year, slightly more than the  original target. About 42.5 billion yuan had been set aside for  national defence in last year's budget, which represented an  increase of 14.8 per cent over the 1992 figure. [passage omitted]    "The PLA is pumping funds and resources into developing  nuclear-powered submarines as well as medium-range missiles that  could be launched by them," a military source said. The source  added that priority was set after the top brass decided late  last year to scrap the plan for building aircraft carriers.    "China's five existing nuclear submarines are old Soviet  models that are terribly antiquated," the source said. "The PLA  is testing a submarine-launched missile that has a range of  around 400 kilometres."    Western military analysts said the PLA's Second Artillery  Unit was aggressively developing medium to long-range ballistic  missiles, including the Dong Fang 25 and the Dong Fang 31  models, which had ranges of respectively 1,700 km and 8,000 km.    At the same time, emphasis is being put on churning out a  new  generation of solid-fuel Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles.    The analysts said the PLA had to spend more money developing  its own weapons systems partly due to the stalemate in efforts  to procure Russian military technology. They added discussions  on buying another batch of SU27 jet fighters from Moscow -- as  well as a co-production agreement to turn out MiG aircraft on  Chinese soil -- had bogged down because of Russian reluctance to  part with top-of-the-line know-how.    However, with the revival of military co-operation with  Europe and even the United States, the top brass is again  hopeful of acquiring sophisticated hardware from the Western  world. "In view of the recent 30 odd per cent devaluation of  the yuan, the 52.04 billion yuan budget is not much to play  around with," a Beijing diplomat said.</p>

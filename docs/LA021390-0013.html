			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL LOCKOUT  </P> <P> If the baseball owners attempt to close down our national pastime with their  lockout, the big losers will be baseball fans like me.  </P> <P> It would appear that since the players will be unilaterally denied their  ability to work, their contracts could be declared invalid, making them free  agents.  </P> <P> In addition to the players, the stadiums and their cities, their  concessionaires and workers would be shutouts too.  </P> <P> All that is needed is a few entrepreneurs like Donald Trump to ride to the  rescue. They could put together a new baseball league, signing up the available  players. The stadiums, cities, workers, and especially the fans, would be  saved.  </P> <P> Only the curmudgeonly owners would be locked out. The American pastime would be  saved by the free enterprise system.  </P> <P> LAURENCE D. WELLIKSON  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 14 Jan -- Ion Butnaru, Moldova's acting  foreign minister, today ended a visit to Moscow that lasted  three days. In the course of the visit, I. Butnaru held  intensive talks at the Russian Federation's Foreign Ministry  with Andrey Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Krylov,  deputy foreign minister and head of the Department of CIS  countries. He also talked to Michael Emerson, the head of the  European Union's delegation in Moscow.    A wide range of issues on Russian-Moldovan relations and  assistance to Russia in the settlement of the Dniester problem  were the main topics at the talks with Andrey Kozyrev held on  Thursday [13 January].    This is a most complex process, and the main thing for us,  Andrey Kozyrev told journalists at the end of the talks, is to  persuade both sides -- the Moldovan Government and the Dniester  leadership -- to seek ways of achieving political accord and  political solutions. He described the conversation that took  place as a useful and informative conversation which proceeded  "in a professional and business-like manner."    Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Andrey  Kozyrev said that the Dniester problem would be examined at the  Russian-U.S. summit, which is currently taking place in Moscow.  We are conducting a dialogue with the United States and other  countries since the region is a matter of concern for the CSCE  and United Nations. At all bilateral meetings, we are seeking  to expand the range of countries involved to enhance our efforts  in resolving similar problems.</p>

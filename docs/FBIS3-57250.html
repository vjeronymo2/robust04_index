During the talks Sensenbrenner reaffirmed the continued  support of the U.S. Congress and Administration to the Latvian  sovereignty. The guest underlined that the U.S. Congress had no  differences concerning the fast withdrawal of the Russian troops  from Latvia. He reminded that aid to Russia was closely linked  to security issues. If Russia threatens any neighbouring  country, the congress would immediately cancel the aid  programme, he said.    Gorbunovs thanked the United States for support and added  that Latvia was concerned about the recent remarks by the  Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. He voiced the  necessity of international control over the removal of the  Russian troops from Latvia, especially concerning the future of  the radar base in Skrunda, as Russia rejected the term of three  years proposed by the Latvian Government. The Latvian  parliament could consider other suggestions only if concrete  international guarantees were provided for.    The U.S. ambassador to Latvia assured that the United States  would not regard the Russian presence at the Skrunda base for a  definite period of time as a proof that Latvia was within the  Russian sphere of interests. He said that a U.S. delegation  would arrive in Latvia at the weekend to discuss further  bilateral military cooperation.    Sensenbrenner also said that he was willing to meet a  delegation of Latvian legislators that could visit the United  States at the end of February to study the lawmaking practices  at the U.S. Congress.</p>

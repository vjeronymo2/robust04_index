			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Allegheny International Inc. filed a revised reorganization plan, saying it may  sell its flagship Oster and Sunbeam home appliance divisions to help bring the  company out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Pittsburgh consumer products concern  said it has signed a letter of intent to sell the Milwaukee-based appliance  unit, as previously disclosed, for $260 million to Black &amp; Decker Corp., a  maker of household appliances based in Towson, Md. But Allegheny International  did not say how the rest of its estimated $700-million debt would be paid. The  plan would leave the company in the possession of its own stockholders.  </P></p>

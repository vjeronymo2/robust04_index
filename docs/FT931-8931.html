			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Government reaches first surplus for a year HIGH CORPORATION tax revenues, coupled with relatively low government spending, contributed to a higher-than-expected Pounds 3.83bn surplus in government finances in January. It was the first monthly surplus for a year. About Pounds 1bn of the surplus was due to a new system for collecting value added tax from big companies on a monthly basis. This brought forward to January receipts which would normally be paid this month. The large surplus recorded for January is likely to be countered by big deficits this month and in March. These are expected to push the public sector borrowing requirement for 1992-93 to about Pounds 37bn, after a Pounds 13.7bn deficit in 1991-92. The Treasury and Central Statistical Office said yesterday that the PSBR for the first 10 months of the year came to Pounds 21.6bn, compared with Pounds 6.5bn at the same stage in 1991-92. The deficit has increased as the recession has reduced tax receipts and pushed up spending on unemployment. Receipts last month were boosted by a Pounds 5.27bn payment of corporation tax. Another factor was relatively low central government spending in January of Pounds 20.15bn, only slightly higher than the comparable Pounds 19.46bn last year. Total central government receipts last month came to Pounds 23.0bn, compared with Pounds 23.33bn in January last year. The surplus for January last year was Pounds 3.78bn. Privatisation proceeds last month came to just Pounds 4m.</p>

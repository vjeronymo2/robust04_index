The forces are comprised of military  trucks, artillery pieces, and infantry troops in an attempt to  drive toward the liberated zones of Democratic Kampuchea. On 17  January, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea and the  people attacked and destroyed these attacking forces at Pongro  and Ta Pen along Route 68 below Samraong. Over 20 soldiers were  killed and a number of others wounded. The remaining troops  fled the battlefield and returned to their villages because the  majority of the puppet soldiers were forcibly drafted from  villages where people were harvesting crops.</p>

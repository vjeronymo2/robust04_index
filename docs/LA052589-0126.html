			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROOMMATE SAYS RAZO PROBABLY WAS AT HARVARD DURING HOLDUP  </P> <P> A Harvard University basketball player testified Wednesday that Jose Razo, his  former roommate, was on the Cambridge, Mass., campus the day that one of the 10  Orange County holdups that Razo is accused of committing occurred.  </P> <P> However, under cross-examination, Neil Patrick Phillips acknowledged that he  could not be positive that Razo, the alleged Ski Mask Bandit, was at Harvard on  Feb. 1, 1987. Phillips testified in Superior Court in Santa Ana that to "his  best recollection," Razo was still in Massachusetts on the date in question.  </P> <P> Students at Harvard were taking a few days between semester finals during late  January and early February, 1987, Phillips said.  </P> <P> "I'm practicing (for the Harvard squad) during those winter months, and that  day was the only opportunity I had to play basketball with Joe. He was very  good, and we made notice of it," Phillips testified.  </P> <P> Phillips, who is from Germantown, Md., roomed with Razo in 1986-87 during their  sophomore year at Harvard. Phillips' testimony came during the 3rd day of the  defense portion of Razo's trial, which began May 5 in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The prosecution has charged Razo with committing 10 robberies, netting about  $27,000 during his vacations and summer breaks from Harvard. Razo, 22, who was  a football star and honors student at Anaheim's Servite High School, won an  academic scholarship to Harvard and also played football there.  </P> <P> In June, 1987, Razo confessed to La Habra police that he had held up about a  dozen stores in Orange and Los Angeles counties. All of the robberies coincided  with times that Razo was known to be in California except for the Feb. 1, 1987,  holdup.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravinder Mehta said Wednesday that it was possible that Razo  flew back to California during the brief lull between semesters at Harvard in  early February, 1987.  </P> <P> Razo, who spent his third day Wednesday on the witness stand, has repeatedly  denied committing any of the robberies to which he has confessed. He said he  was deranged from taking PCP -- phencyclidine and usually referred to as "angel  dust" -- when he made the 1987 confessions. All of the crimes were committed by  a childhood friend, Richard Longoria, Razo testified. Razo said Longoria told  him the exact details of each robbery.  </P> <P> In testimony on Wednesday, Razo said he falsely accused himself of robberies in  1987 because he felt guilt for being successful while many of his Chicano  friends were not.  </P> <P> "In hindsight I now see that I was feeling very guilty about my Harvard  experience -- my comfortable life style," Razo said. "I was feeling alienated  from my family at home and Mexicans in general. I wanted to be accepted in a  normal, everyday type of way in terms of the neighborhood and friends I had  known.  </P> <P> ". . . I was wanting to truly identify with Richard (Longoria). I wanted to  feel like him, like his type. . . There was a time I did believe I was the  robber, and it didn't seem absurd to say that."  </P> <P> Mehta has said outside of court that he believes that Razo "was reaching for a  scapegoat" by naming Longoria as the real Ski Mask Bandit.  </P> <P> Mehta said that investigators are trying to locate Longoria and that he may be  subpoenaed to testify.  </P></p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Finance and the Family (Currencies in Crisis): Shedding a light on murky times - What they say - and what they mean Economist Giles Keating gives an infallible guide to the future . . . PRIVATE investors, not to mention professional ones, may well be confused by the events of the last few days. This guide to the events of the next few weeks will help to shine a light through the murk. Ireland, Portugal, Denmark and France issue vehement denials of any intention to devalue: Get a large bank loan in punts, escudos, krone or French francs and invest it all in D-marks. The French narrowly vote No in tomorrow's referendum: Other people may be selling, give them a little time to drive down prices, then move in and buy (some) UK stocks, buy gilts, buy European equities. A No vote would destabilise what is left of the ERM and force the French franc out of its band. John Major could pretend that the whole thing was a D-mark revaluation, not a sterling devaluation, and pop the pound back into the ERM. Even Schlesinger would be happy enough to cut interest rates. Result: UK interest rates fall, though not very far, and the political crisis is defused. The losers are companies heavily dependent on UK domestic demand, because interest rates on this scenario would come down less than in a free float. The French vote Yes: France might get away without devaluing - Major and Lamont will have lost their chance of slipping sterling quickly back into the ERM behind the fig-leaf of a general realignment. The pound will go its own way for months, if not years. The UK can set interest rates mainly to meet domestic needs. So buy equities, but do not get too enthusiastic. The government is still keen to tackle inflation, so the interest rate cuts will not be very generous unless the economy turns down further. One of the UK's largest and oldest car plants shuts down with massive job losses: Buy shares in Toyota, Honda and Nissan. Old factories with 1960s-style working practices would be uncompetitive even if the rate was DM2 to the pound. The Japanese plants in Britain would be profitable with sterling at DM3.50. Sterling rejoins the ERM, but the Germans do not cut interest rates: The chancellor has already said this is unlikely, and he is right. Even at a parity below DM2.95, why should ERM membership be any more sustainable than before? Sterling did not leave the ERM on Wednesday (sorry, get 'suspended') because it was in at the wrong level. It left because of whispering by the Bundesbank about realignments, and because the increase in UK rates was not matched by a cut in German rates. The same can happen again, unless German rates fall sharply, or unless (not very likely) the ERM rules are changed to force the Bundesbank to support sterling properly at times of crisis. The Chancellor announces a big support package for the housing market: Sell your house. You will have to slash the price. Then move into rented accommodation. There has just been a private meeting at No 11 Downing Street at which the chairmen of the biggest building societies told the Chancellor how bad things really are. Even if base rates are cut by 1 or 2 per cent, house prices will still go down, because consumer confidence is so low and debt burdens so high. Remember the last attempt to stimulate the housing market, by suspending stamp duty in late 1991 and the first half of this year? The government gives in to Tory backbencher demands for much, much lower interest rates: Yet another U-turn, so this is quite likely. Buy equities, but do not hold them too long; but above all buy into dollars, D-marks and yen, in fact anything you can lay your hands on that is not sterling. In spite of the UK's deep recession, a big enough fall in the pound will generate some inflation. So a few index-linked gilts might be a good idea, too. You might even consider buying a house . . . Unemployment rises and retail sales fall sharply in both the UK and the US: In this case hold only big blue chip shares, and even then try to chuck out the ones with too much domestic business. There is not going to be a 'normal cyclical upswing' - at best it will be weak in the UK, the US and Europe. The only areas of the world set for good growth in the next year or so are places like South China and Mexico. You do not have to buy directly into their stock markets; instead go for the big global corporations that have operations in those areas. The French vote No by a wide margin and the whole ERM collapses: The TV screens are filled by economists saying how good flexible exchange rates are, but investors should be very cautious. This is a signal from the big European nations of a complete inability to co-operate, which is very dangerous at a time of high debt, high unemployment, and creeping protectionism. If you want a scenario that points towards a new Great Depression, this is it. Giles Keating is director of economics at Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> ROBINSON SAYS ELLARD CAN PLAY AGAINST BROWNS  </P> <P> Ram receiver Henry Ellard, who was held out of last week's game with a sore  right hamstring, is healthy enough to play this Sunday's game at Cleveland,  Coach John Robinson said.  </P> <P> But Robinson also said that Aaron Cox, who started in Ellard's place Sunday but  had to leave with a sore hamstring, probably won't be ready for the game  against the Browns.  </P> <P> Finishing up the sore hamstring news, Robinson said he wasn't sure whether  starting tight end Damone Johnson could play. Cox and Johnson are listed as  questionable and Ellard is listed as probable.  </P> <P> The Rams signed linebacker Bruce Klostermann to take the special teams duties  of linebacker Greg Clark, who was placed on injured reserve after breaking a  bone in his right leg last Sunday.

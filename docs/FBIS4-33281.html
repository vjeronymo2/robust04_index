			<p>BFN     [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the  National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], is  attending the fourth special session of the provincial People's  Government in the City of Bayamo. The main goal of the meeting  is to discuss and approve the progress report which Granma  Province will render to the ANPP session in July. It was  ratified at the meeting that the document will be enriched by  the people in meetings to be held in every district in the  province. Granma's progress report includes a broad overview of  the work conducted between 1985 and 1989, as well as the intense  and productive effort of the entire population between 1990 and  1994, years within the special period marked by a great spirit  of sacrifice and commitment to solve the problems created by  acute material shortages.    Granma's delegates and deputies stressed that the food  program is in need of joint efforts, to increase the seed banks,  the organic planters, and to use the scientific potential to  quickly satisfy the people's food needs in a controlled and  intelligent manner.    The fourth special session of Granma's government is also  being attended by Commander of the Revolution Guillermo Garcia  Frias; Adolfo Diaz, vice president of the Council of Ministers;  and Alfredo Enriquez Pina, first secretary of the Communist  Party of Cuba [PCC] in Granma. The session also discussed the  proposed shield of the province in which the principal and most  significant elements of the glorious historic and revolutionary  endeavors of the province are represented.</p>

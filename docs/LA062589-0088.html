			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOSEF YEHUDAI; POLICE CHIEF IN JERUSALEM  </P> <P> Jerusalem police chief Yosef Yehudai, who walked a fine line trying to maintain  order while not overreacting against the Palestinian population, died Friday of  a heart attack, officials said. He was 42.  </P> <P> The Romanian-born Yehudai emigrated to Israel in 1961 and had served with the  paramilitary border police and regular police since he was 17.  </P> <P> Yehudai, appointed commander of police forces in Jerusalem three years ago, had  confronted frequent outbreaks of violence in the disputed city since the  Palestinian uprising broke out in December, 1987.  </P> <P> The soft-spoken, pipe-smoking Yehudai was often seen commanding his forces  during Palestinian stone-throwing clashes with police in east Jerusalem,  annexed by Israel after the 1967 Middle East war. The city is populated by  Jews, Muslims and Christians.  </P> <P> Yehudai is survived by his wife, also a police officer, and two daughters.  </P></p>

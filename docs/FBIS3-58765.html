			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed S.R.: "Government Cautious About Recovery"] </F>   [Text] Discretion was the word of the day yesterday in  government circles, following the meeting of an  "interministerial committee" devoted to economic policy and to  possible supplementary measures for reviving the economy.    Officially, Edouard Balladur and three of his ministers made  a wide-ranging "survey" of the country's situation for more than  an hour, thus making it possible to confirm "the encouraging  prospects of the economy," said Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy.  "We did not adopt anything," summed up tersely another  participant at the committee meeting, Alain Madelin, the  minister in charge of businesses.    So, for now, the government is sticking by its projected  growth figure of 1.4 percent for this year and is awaiting the  full effect of recovery actions taken since its arrival in power  in March 1993. [Economy Minister] Edmond Alphandery repeated  this yesterday: "We agreed to say that nothing justified  calling into question the government's economic scenario for  1994."  <H5>  Choices To Be Made Known on 3 February </H5>   The economic minister once again left the door open to  measures for encouraging consumption. "More specifically, we  will see what can be done within a few days, when the figures  for the end of 1993 and January show are released and when we  know what the sales and Christmas period [le blanc] yielded," he  said without further clarification. It is true that too much  talk of possible supplementary recovery instruments, "just in  case," could end up having the opposite effect to the one  desired: Consumers might hold off their purchases while  awaiting new incentives. The short statement made by Edmond  Alphandery two weeks ago about possible measures to boost the  automotive industry put the government and the manufacturers in  a awkward situation.    Yesterday's meeting was the first in a series of three  "interministerial committees" organized by Edouard Balladur to  redefine the government's economic and social strategy. A  second committee meeting on social security issues is planned  for today, while the third -- which is to concentrate on  employment -- is scheduled for next Tuesday [25 January].    The work will be summarized during a government seminar on 3  February, at which time the prime minister will make his choices  known, i.e., with regard to the essential recovery of the  economy and the reduction of social security deficits.    In the meantime, the entourage of ministers is putting the  emphasis on the last survey from the Bank of France, which notes  a slight improvement in the economic prospects of business  leaders.    Yesterday, another indicator heartened the economic analysts  at Bercy [Finance Ministry]: Industrial production rose in  November, even though it has been dropping continuously since  summer. It rose by 0.6 percent compared to October, using data  corrected for seasonal variations.</p>

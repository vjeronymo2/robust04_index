			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Chairman Qiao Shi of  the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC)  and visiting Canadian Governor General Ramon John Hnatyshyn had  an hour- long discussion on furthering Sino-Canadian friendship  and cooperation here today.    Qiao said that Hnatyshyn's visit provides a good opportunity  as well as a forceful push for the deepening of the traditional  relations between the two countries.    Hnatyshyn told Qiao that he has had fruitful talks with  President Jiang Zemin and acting Premier Zhu Rongji since his  arrival yesterday.    China's highly successful economic reform has won the  Canadian people's admiration and praise, he said, adding that  Canada has great interests in expanding cooperation with China.    Qiao briefed the visitor on the NPC's efforts in improving  the legal system for a socialist market economy in China.    Qiao said that in its law-making process, the NPC has drawn  experience from other countries.    He stressed that to continue to expand Sino-Canadian  cooperation in various fields is not only the common desire of  the two sides but is also very promising because conditions are  available. China is ready to work towards this end, he added.    Qiao and Hnatyshyn agreed that the NPC and the Canadian  Parliament should have more exchanges with a view to deepening  understanding and promoting cooperation.    After the meeting, Hnatyshyn was escorted on a brief tour of  the Great Hall of the People, which is the seat of the NPC.</p>

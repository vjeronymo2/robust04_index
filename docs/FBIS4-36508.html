			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sana' al-Imam from Damascus] </F>   [Text] The Russian delegation led by Mikhail Petrovich  Kolesnikov, the Russian Armed Forces chief of staff, left  Damascus today. President Hafiz al-Asad received the delegation  for two full hours.    The Russian Armed Forces chief of staff signed with his  Syrian counterpart, Lieutenant General Hikmat al-Shihabi, 12  documents related to cooperation in the technical military field.    Mikhail Kolesnikov, head of the Russian delegation, termed  this as a new starting point in Russian-Syrian military  cooperation.    These documents were signed against the background of the  agreement on military cooperation in the technical field that  was signed in April between Syrian Defense Minister Lieutenant  General Mustafa Talas and Russian Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets.  This agreement has paved the way for the resumption of military  cooperation between the two countries, especially since the USSR  was the main exporter of arms to Syria before its collapse.</p>

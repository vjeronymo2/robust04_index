			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A San Diego police review board established by voters two years ago should be  strengthened to become more independent and have greater authority to  discipline police officers, San Diego City Councilman Wes Pratt said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Pratt said the mood is right for a stronger review board following the  overwhelming citizen vote Nov. 7 to create a powerful review board to oversee  the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> He said he will recommend to the city's Rules Committees that the City Council  put a City Charter amendment on the November 1992 ballot that would strengthen  the board.  </P> <P> The sheriff's review board, which passed by a 2-to-1 vote, will have subpoena  powers to compel witnesses to testify, much like the county grand jury. Members  will be appointed by the County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> The Citizens' Review Board on Police Practices, which voters approved two years  ago, has no such power and has been criticized because its recommendations  carry little weight.  </P></p>

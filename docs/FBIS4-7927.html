			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 7 (CTK) -- The Slav Union (SU), a  citizens' association in the Czech Republic founded in 1992 to  promote the idea of Slav solidarity, wants to establish contacts  with the Union of the Slav Nations, presided by Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, SU chairman Alexej Pludek told journalists today.    Pludek said the SU considered the fact it had not been  invited to the Slav congress held in Moscow early April a wrong.  As a result, next week it will send a letter to the Union of  the Slav Nations informing about its activities. The Slav Union  should become an important member of this international  organization, he added.    The Slav Union, which unites some 3,000 members, is a non-  political organization designed to promote Slav solidarity, said  Pludek, a writer highly praised by the former communist regime.  The idea of the Slav solidarity is part of the struggle for the  Czech national existence, threatened by the "Pan-German Drang  nach Osten," (Drive to the East) said Pludek, author of a novel  called "Vabank" (1974) considered by some observers anti-semitic.</p>

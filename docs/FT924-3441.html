			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Letter: BBC's finances under control and no programmes cancelled Sir, I have read reports in your newspaper of a BBC apparently out of financial control ('BBC says TV budget overran by Pounds 60m', December 4). As this is not the case, I would like to give the context in which the audit committee of the board reported on the budgetary performance of Network Television in London. In 1991-92, the income of the BBC from licence fees and profits from BBC Enterprises was Pounds 1,399m. We spent Pounds 1,390m - Pounds 9m less than the income and Pounds 39m less than we had planned to spend in the year. The television problems in London, which we have made public as part of our determination to be more accountable to the public, were more than absorbed by underspendings elsewhere. No programmes had to be cancelled or productions stopped. In 1992-93, our expected income from licence fees and our profits from BBC Enterprises will be Pounds 1,478m. Our expenditure is forecast to be Pounds 1,475m - Pounds 3m less than our income but Pounds 13m (0.9 per cent) more than we have so far budgeted to spend. We have therefore made a small number of adjustments to our television transmissions and productions including moving some into next year. We make almost 6,000 network programmes a year. We are also incurring exceptional expenditure on major structural change as we reduce our resource base and staffing levels - more than 3,000 jobs have gone in the last 20 months. The cost of these changes, including redundancy costs, is being met from reserves and by borrowing within limits agreed by parliament. I hope that licence payers will be reassured by the BBC's overall record and its continuing commitment to provide a full range of radio and television programme services within the income they provide. The recent National Audit Office report should give similar assurances on the proper use of grants from general taxation to finance the World Service.

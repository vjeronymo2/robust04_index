			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Pakistan Share prices yesterday fell for the third day, triggered by a renewal of political uncertainty, writes Farhan Bokhari in Islamabad. The KSE-100 index finished 71.49 weaker at 2,237.63. The index has fallen by almost 7 per cent since Sunday following last week's violence in Karachi which led to the death of at least 20 people. Analysts noted that investors were also becoming cautious ahead of next month's annual budget. COLOMBO, after four days of recovery, began heading back towards its 1994 lows again. The CSE all-share index retreated 23.61, or 2.3 per cent, to 1,023.95 as turn-over dropped from Rs124.6m to Rs82.9m.</p>

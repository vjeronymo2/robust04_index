			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / US Money and Credit: Yields continue to fall towards 6% THESE ARE the best of times for US bond market investors. It is difficult to imagine how conditions could be much more favourable to holders of government securities. Inflationary pressures are almost totally absent from the economy. Because of that, monetary policy is on hold with interest rates near record lows. The Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee meets later this week and the expectations on Wall Street are that the FOMC will vote to keep the bias of policy neither inclined to an easing nor to a tightening. Inflation will probably stay low because the economy is growing so slowly. Recent economic data have painted a picture of an economy still struggling to break out of its post-recession blues. After a short burst of growth in the final quarter of last year, output has dropped significantly this year, and there is little sign that the economy will pick up until at least next year. Supply conditions favour the long end of the market. Just over Dollars 11bn in 30-year securities were sold at auction last week, but because of the Treasury's decision earlier this year to try to lower the cost of financing the federal deficit by cutting the supply of bonds and shortening the maturity of the national debt, the final bond auction of 1993 is already out of the way with only two-thirds of the year completed. The political environment is also favourable to bonds. President Bill Clinton's first budget was passed by Congress 10 days ago, and in spite of its tax increases, it was warmly welcomed by fixed-income investors. This is primarily because most bond economists expect the deficit-reduction package to slow economic growth over the next year or so. Also, the bond market likes the budget because it is regarded as the first attempt (albeit a flawed one) by a modern US administration to tackle the huge federal deficit. Even the foreign exchange markets have been boosting bond prices, although only indirectly. Recent turmoil within the European exchange rate mechanism and cuts in interest rates across Europe sent investors scurrying into the dollar as a safe haven. When foreign investors seek the security of dollar assets, many buy US government securities. It should be no surprise, therefore, to see bond yields at historic lows. As of Friday afternoon, the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue had dropped to 6.34 per cent, the lowest since 1971. This is all the more remarkable considering less than three months ago bond yields were at 7 per cent and rising. The market's rally has stunned economists. In the Wall Street Journal's survey of forecasts last December, no less than 44 top economists predicted that long yields would be at 7.44 per cent by the end of June this year. That they were more than 100 basis points out is mostly due to their failure to forecast economic growth accurately. At the end of last year the economy was growing at a healthy pace, and economists were forecasting continued strong growth, resurgent inflation, and a tighter monetary policy. They were wrong on all three counts, because the strong growth recorded during the final quarter of 1992 proved to be a temporary blip on the screen  -a short, unsustainable burst of economic activity tied as much to the election of a new president as it was to any fundamental improvement in consumer and corporate sentiment. How far can bond yields fall? If inflation remains as subdued as it is now ('core' consumer and producer prices both rose a meagre 0.1 per cent in July), if monetary policy remains on hold, and if the Clinton budget has a dampening effect on economic activity, then bond yields of below 6 per cent by the end of the year are not out of the question.</p>

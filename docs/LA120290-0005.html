			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> USE PRIVATE INSURANCE TO PROTECT DEPOSITS  </P> <P> As a financial crisis spreads from U.S. savings and loans to commercial banks,  extraordinary measures must be taken to stop the hemorrhage of funds from the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s insurance fund. Nevertheless, federal  regulators continue to look at only one solution to shore up the fund: raise  the premiums paid by institutions.  </P> <P> Ironically, such a solution could make the problem worse. A 62% increase in  bank premiums -- announced by the FDIC for next year -- could further  jeopardize the survival of many institutions, adding fuel to a cycle of  commercial bank failures.  </P> <P> What is required is a fundamentally new approach that focuses attention on the  asset side of a bank's balance sheet by using private insurance on individual  loans in bank portfolios. Such a plan would shift the risk of insuring bank  deposits -- at least in part -- from taxpayers to the insurance industry.  </P> <P> Unlike the government, insurance companies are structured to assess risk and  provide insurance services at a profit. In the process, the costs of insuring  individual loans ultimately would be passed on to borrowers, where the  responsibility most properly belongs.  </P> <P> Under current government policy, banks are required to insure deposits by  paying premiums to the FDIC's insurance fund. Those premiums are calculated on  a flat rate determined solely by the size of the institution. The fund has  deteriorated rapidly, just at a time when its exposure to significant new  losses is higher than ever. At the end of last year, the ratio of the insurance  fund's reserves to deposits had fallen to the lowest point in its history --  0.7%.  </P> <P> The prospect for the fund achieving the minimum reserve ratio of 1.25% by 1995  under new federal rules "is not good," says Charles A. Bowsher, U.S.  comptroller general.  </P> <P> Regulators have considered instituting a risk-based premium rate for commercial  banks, depending on the type of loans they make. Insurance premiums under this  plan would be calculated by a variety of factors, including the type and risk  of loans made by the institutions. Banks with portfolios in predominantly  low-risk categories would pay lower premiums than institutions with higher-risk  portfolios.  </P> <P> A shift to a risk-based system makes sense. It is more consistent with the ways  insurance premiums are typically priced in policies ranging from autos to  health. But still, taxpayers ultimately would carry the burden of replenishing  the fund to cover bank failures.  </P> <P> Private insurance of individual loans represents an important departure from  existing regulatory policy. Under this practice, bankers would solicit  insurance policies similar to private mortgage insurance, or PMI, for  individual loans. Insurance companies would evaluate the risk on a loan-by-loan  basis and determine when they would provide coverage. Banks, in turn, would pay  reduced premiums to the FDIC, depending on how much of their loan portfolios  are reinsured by private carriers.  </P> <P> This approach would "lay off" a portion of the risk on private insurance  companies and yield a number of benefits. The first source of repayment of a  loan would be the borrowers, while the second would be the insurance company.  That would help defray the number of claims against the FDIC deposit fund.  Private insurers, in turn, would transfer the cost of insurance to borrowers.  </P> <P> Is this approach politically and economically viable? A number of objections  could be raised.  </P> <P> First, it could be argued that the plan would discriminate against some  borrowers. Only borrowers with high qualifications capable of meeting insurance  criteria would be able to obtain financing. This differs significantly from the  current system, which is indiscriminate in relation to borrowers and operates  on a "blind pool" insurance basis.  </P> <P> Second, bankers may object that the plan could give insurance companies too  much influence in bank loan underwriting criteria. This plan, however, would  force banks to re-examine their loan underwriting policies to meet the  requirements of insurance companies -- ultimately benefiting institutions and  reducing their losses. Standard &amp; Poor's underwriting criteria, now used in  commercial real estate lending, might be modified for use by banks.  </P> <P> Insurance companies would need to establish some type of loss experience model  in developing a premium schedule that was realistic and viable. This would  involve research and maintenance of a loan-loss database and model. Both would  be easy to develop. Federal and state agencies maintain comprehensive  statistics on actual losses incurred by every financial institution in the  country. This data would provide a solid foundation for establishing criteria  to assess loan risk.  </P> <P> In the end, insurance companies are better positioned to take on the risk of  insuring loans. For these companies, insurance of commercial banks would  represent only one line of business, with risk dispersed nationally. An  insurance company that insures against the collectibility of a loan would be  able to quantify risk on a loan-by-loan basis. This makes more sense than  quantifying risk based on the overall operations of a financial institution,  which is the current practice.  </P> <P> In the event that private insurers were unwilling or unable to provide loan  coverage, the federal government could offer coverage through an insurance  company it established to provide these policies. This too would represent a  better approach to managing risk in loan portfolios than simply changing the  FDIC insurance premium schedule to rebuild the fund, or asking Congress to  approve an emergency appropriation.  </P> <P> By private insuring of individual loans, the basis for managing risk would be  more fairly assessed, in the process protecting the FDIC's insurance fund from  further erosions and banks against greater threat of failures.  </P></p>

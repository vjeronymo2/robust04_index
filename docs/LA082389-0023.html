			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. CLOSES LOOPHOLE IN SUN VALLEY DENSITY PLAN  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to close a potential loophole in a  policy passed in February to lower the density of development in Sun Valley  foothills.  </P> <P> The action, which becomes part of the Sun Valley Community Plan, limits the  development and grading of land that has a slope of at least 15%. The area of  Sun Valley affected by Tuesday's vote is in rural La Tuna Canyon south of La  Tuna Canyon Road.  </P> <P> The policy approved Tuesday calculates the slope of the entire parcel of land  that is being developed. The earlier council policy would have allowed the  slope to be calculated for portions of a parcel, which the planning staff  feared could allow for denser development than intended.  </P> <P> Arline DeSanctis, chief deputy of Councilman Joel Wachs, said that the council  was confused by the February motion and that the discrepancy was not discovered  until later.  </P> <P> The new restrictions apply to lots zoned for one house per 40,000 square feet,  for one house per two acres and for one house per five acres. Lots that fit  those zoning categories cannot be given exemptions from the limits if they have  a slope of at least 15%. In addition, no grading of principal ridgelines is  allowed.  </P> <P> A similar measure restricting hillside development in a larger area of the  northeast San Fernando Valley -- including Lake View Terrace, Sunland-Tujunga  and Shadow Hills -- is to be considered by the city Planning Commission later  this month.  </P> <P> Residents of the foothill communities have turned out in large numbers at  meetings to discuss the proposal.  </P></p>

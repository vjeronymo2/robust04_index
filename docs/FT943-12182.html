			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: American Express hit by weakness at Lehman After-tax profits at American Express fell 14 per cent in the second three months of the year. It blamed lower profits at Lehman Brothers, the investment bank which was spun off during the period. Had it not been for Lehman, the US financial services company's earnings would have advanced 19 per cent, to Dollars 359m, on the back of higher spending on its charge cards and similar products. Lehman, which last week revealed that its second-quarter results had suffered from poor trading conditions in financial markets, was accounted for as a discontinued item. American Express reported net income of Dollars 357m, or 69 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn, compared with Dollars 416m, or 83 cents, on revenues of Dollars 3.3bn a year before. The growth in earnings from continuing operations was driven by a 12 per cent rise in spending billed to the company's cards, to Dollars 34.6bn. The total number of cards was 5 per cent higher than a year before. Despite this, card fees fell slightly, to Dollars 431m, reflecting competition between issuers. On the other hand, revenues from fees charged to merchants, which have been under pressure in recent periods, rose 9 per cent to Dollars 983m. American Express also reported continued profit growth at its IDS Financial Services subsidiary, up 21 per cent to Dollars 109m. The subsidiary's name is to be changed to American Express Financial Advisers at the beginning of next year, the company said. The move reflect's chairman Mr Harvey Golub's desire to retain only those businesses which add to the overall brand image of the group. For the first six months, net income was up to Dollars 710m from Dollars 659m the year before.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Grand Met chief awarded life peerage in honours list Sir Allen Sheppard, the chairman of Grand Metropolitan, and Lord Owen, one of the principal peace brokers in the former Yugoslavia, are among the most prominent figures from industry and politics to receive awards in the Queen's birthday honours list, announced today. Sir Allen, who has transformed his organisation from a hotels and brewing group into one of the leading food, wines and spirits companies in the world, is one of only three life peers created in today's list. He heads a group of city figures who are honoured, including Mr Brian Pitman, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank, and Mr Robert Evans, the former chairman of British Gas, both of whom are knighted. Lord Owen, the former British foreign secretary, is made a Companion of Honour after his efforts to bring peace to Bosnia. Among other political figures to receive awards are Sir Christopher Prout, the leader of the Conservatives in the European parliament, and Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, both of whom become privy councillors. There are knighthoods for three Tory MPs: Mr Andrew Bowden, MP for Brighton Kemptown, Mr Kenneth Carlisle, MP for Lincoln, and Mr John Gorst, MP for Hendon North. Among the leading public servants who are knighted are Mr Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, and Professor William Stewart, the government's chief scientific adviser, who was one of the main drafters of the government's recent white paper on science policy. There is a knighthood, too, for Professor David Tweedie, the chairman of the accountancy standards board, who has pushed through major changes in the profession. There will be particular interest in the knighthood for Mr Paul Newall, the Lord Mayor of London. The government caused a minor storm in the City last autumn by not knighting him when he was appointed to the post, as is traditional. Figures from the academic world are also well represented. Professor Sir David Phillips, a leading biophysicist, is another of the life peers created in the list. The third - after Sir Allen Sheppard - is Sir Randolph Quirk, one of the world's leading English literature professors. Professor Laurence Martin, director of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, is knighted. Sir Alec Guinness, the actor, becomes a Companion of Honour. Miss Diana Rigg, the actress, becomes a dame. In the world of sport, Mr Bobby Charlton, the former Manchester United and England footballer, is knighted. Among cricketers, Mr Viv Richards, the former West Indies captain, becomes an OBE. Today's list marks the latest attempt by the prime minister to broaden the range of people in public life who receive honours. Around a third of those in today's 1,000-strong list are voluntary and charitable workers, and there are around 300 women. Sweep of awards embraces great variety, Page 6</p>

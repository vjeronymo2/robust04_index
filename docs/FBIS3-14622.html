As President Lamine Zeroual continues his dialogue contacts  with the political parties -- yesterday he met with  representatives of the National Liberation Front [FLN] and Hamas  [Islamic Society Movement] -- the prime minister, the interior  minister, and the secretary general of the Trade Unions  Federation continue their campaign against dialogue and have  proposed new ideas about formation of militias and distribution  of arms to the public, that is to supporters of the regime, to  break the intensity of the dual confrontation between the Army  and the armed organizations and turn that into a multiple  confrontation in which civilian sectors of the population would  take part.    In a statement it issued yesterday after meeting with  President Zeroual, Hamas said that the Algerian president  confirmed that the political dialogue which he started about a  week ago will include leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front  [FIS]. It added that President Zeroual reaffirmed his  determination to hold a serious dialogue without excluding any  party and without any pressures, and that he also emphasized  that the Army will respect any decisions made by the political  authority to ensure success of the dialogue.    That implies a denial of last week's reprts about  differences  between President Zeroual and some Army commanders.    Despite that denial, informed sources have stressed that  such  differences did occur during the military command's three-day  meeting 10 days ago.    However, there are those who say that both sides in the end  agreed on a compromise solution based on combining what may be  achieved through security confrontation and what may be achieved  through serious dialogue with all parties, and agreed that if  the recent security campaign achieves tangible results, it will  enable the regime to negotiate from a position of strength and  will restore the state's lost prestige.

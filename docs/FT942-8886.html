			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Portugal to privatise majority Cimpor stake Portugal is to privatise a majority of the capital of Cimpor, the country's largest cement producer, by mid-1995, in three tranches beginning next month. The company has been independently valued at more than Es200bn (Dollars 1.2bn). Mr Antonio de Sousa, secretary of state for finance, said a 20 per cent stake would be sold on the Lisbon stock exchange in June. A second tranche of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent would be sold to foreign investors in an offering on foreign exchanges later this year. The final tranche of between 20 per cent and 30 per cent would be sold in the first half of 1995, giving private shareholders control of the company, he said. The June sale will embody Portugal's recently-revived policy of advancing popular capitalism by offering up to 35 per cent of the shares on sale at a discount to small savers. A total of 14m shares will be sold at a fixed price of Es2,900 each. However, 25 per cent will initially be reserved for employees at Es2,600, and for small investors at Es2,700. This tranche will be increased to 35 per cent if there is sufficient demand.</p>

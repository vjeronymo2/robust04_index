			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Nynex invests Dollars 1.2bn in Viacom VIACOM, the US cable television company, yesterday gained a new ally in its battle to take over Paramount Communications when Nynex, the regional telephone company serving the north-eastern US, agreed to invest Dollars 1.2bn in Viacom. The deal, together with a Dollars 600m investment in Viacom last week by video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment, will give the company a war-chest of almost Dollars 2bn with which it could increase its bid for Paramount. However, Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom's chairman, said last night that 'presently we see no reason to restructure the offer'. Viacom's agreed shares and cash offer for Paramount, which owns the Hollywood film studios of the same name, is worth around Dollars 7.5bn - Dollars 2bn less than a hostile shares and cash offer from QVC Network, the home shopping channel headed by Mr Barry Diller, a leading film industry figure. For Nynex, one of the seven 'Baby Bell' regional telephone companies, yesterday's deal represents a big leap into the US cable TV industry. The company's main involvement in the sector at present is in the UK. Mr Bill Ferguson, Nynex chairman, said: 'We've been looking around the world for a long time. It's important we have a relationship with content and software.' Viacom is best known for its MTV pop music channel, although it also runs a cable TV service to more than 1m US customers. Nynex will buy Dollars 1.2bn of 5 per cent Viacom cumulative convertible preferred stock, convertible into Viacom Class B non-voting stock at a conversion price of Dollars 70. There is a provision for Nynex or Viacom to reduce the investment by Dollars 600m if the Viacom merger with Paramount is not completed by next August. The same terms cover Blockbuster's investment in Viacom. Mr Ferguson will join the Viacom board, as will Mr Wayne Huizenga, chairman of Blockbuster. The largest investment in a US cable company to date is by Denver-based US West, which has invested Dollars 2.5bn in the cable and film entertainment arm of Time Warner. Southwestern Bell agreed last February to buy two cable systems in the Washington, DC area for Dollars 650m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, a Russian military attache was accredited at  the Ministry of Defense. His name is Vladimir Konayev, and he  is a Russian army captain.    Latvian Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis described the  occasion as a significant step towards the normalizing of  relations between Latvia and Russia. Russian Ambassador to  Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh agreed with the Latvian defense  minister and said that the new attache would help the Russian  Embassy in handling different questions related to cooperation  between Latvian and Russian Defense Ministries.    The attache's activities will not be directly connected with  the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia, but he is going to  involve the embassy in solving of the problem connected with the  pullout.    Konayev, born in 1931, has been on service since 1958. Since  May 1993 he was performing the duties of military and political  counsellor at the Russian Embassy to Latvia.</p>

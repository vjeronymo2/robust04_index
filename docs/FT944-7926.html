			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Further wave of short-dated eurodollar offerings Continued strong investor demand for US dollar-denominated bonds prompted another wave of short-dated eurodollar offerings yesterday. The dollar sector has witnessed a flurry of activity since last week's higher-than-expected rise in US short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a point to 5.5 per cent. 'European investors now believe the process of monetary tightening in the US is nearing an end, and with US Treasuries weakening despite the rise, investors now see good value in the US market,' said one trader. Confidence in the sector is also being supported by a belief that the dollar is set to appreciate against the yen and D-Mark, traders said. Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, the financing arm of Toyota's operations in the US, launched a Dollars 250m offering of three-year bonds, which was greeted with very strong demand, lead manager Paribas said. 'This was exactly what the market wanted. There are no triple-A rated corporate names out there at the moment offering such an attractive coupon,' a Paribas official said. The bonds offered a coupon of 7 3/4 per cent and maintained their initial launch spread of 14 basis points above US government bonds after the bonds were freed to trade. Paribas expects a large part of the offering to be placed with Swiss retail accounts although there was also strong demand from retail investors in Germany and the Benelux countries and from UK institutional accounts. The proceeds from the offering were swapped into floating-rate dollars. Both UBS Finance and SBC Finance reopened earlier offerings due to the strong investor demand for dollar assets. SBC launched a Dollars 100m offering of seven-year bonds priced to yield three basis points above US Treasuries. UBS launched a Dollars 100 offering - later increased to Dollars 250m - of two-year bonds, priced level with US Treasuries. 'We saw constant buying in the Swiss retail network of the original issue, driving the price in the secondary market down to 10 basis points through Treasuries,' a UBS syndicate official said. The bonds had been launched at five basis points over US Treasuries. Also in the two-year dollar sector, Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten launched a Dollars 200m bond offering, priced to yield two basis points over US Treasuries. Mainly targeted at Swiss and Benelux retail investors, the bonds also found firm demand from UK institutions, lead manager JP Morgan said. The proceeds were swapped into guilders, market sources said. In the the sterling sector, Deutsche Bank Finance launched a Pounds 100m offering of two-year bonds, priced to yield 20 basis points over German government bonds. Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday assigned a B+ rating to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan's planned first-ever eurobond. The outlook on the country's foreign currency debt rating is positive, S&amp;P said.</p>

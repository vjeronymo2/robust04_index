			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Survey of Bangladesh (12): Aid for the poorest / Profile of Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee Hawabibi, a 35-year-old village mother of four, was destitute until she borrowed Tk7,000 to erect a chicken coop and buy nine hens and a rooster. Six years later, she has built herself a house of wood and bamboo and a shed, and has enough money to send her children to secondary school. The loan that changed her life came from the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, the biggest non-government organisation in Bangladesh and one of the world's largest development aid institutions in terms of the number of people that it reaches. 'Without BRAC's loan, we could never have thought of improving our standard of living,' says Hawabibi, who lives in the densely-populated rice-growing district of Mirzapur, north of Dhaka. She is one of 480,000 Bangladeshi women to have received BRAC loans to rear chickens, while about 400,000 have borrowed money for cattle, tea planting, silk farming, irrigation schemes and weaving. BRAC has also taught 13m women how to treat diarrhoea; it runs 22,000 primary schools and plans to have 100,000 by the year 2000. BRAC shows what can be achieved in Bangladesh, even with limited resources. A non-profit making organisation, it receives 70 per cent of its Dollars 40m annual income from foreign aid donors. There is a high priority on cost control and making the most of its funds. BRAC's schools operate at lower costs than the government's. In its credit operations, bad debts run at under 2 per cent of lending, even though borrowers are charged annual interest of 20 per cent. As for revenue, BRAC tries to generate as much of its own as possible - 30 per cent of its income comes from commercial activities, including a chain of handicraft shops. This month it will open its first overseas outlet - in Islington, London. In 1972, Mr F. H. Abed, a former accountant with Shell, the international oil group, set up BRAC in the wake of Bangladesh's independence war and with the help of money from Oxfam, the British charity. Its first work was post-war reconstruction, particularly the restoration of damaged homes. Mr Abed devised the plan to open BRAC handicraft stores overseas. It was also his suggestion that the British government should recruit unemployed British graduates as teachers to work in BRAC schools for a year or two. BRAC's schools generally cater for children who are so poor they would usually have no education at all. However, the quality of education provided is widely regarded to be better than that of rural government schools. BRAC recruits part-time untrained graduate volunteers as teachers because they are cheaper than qualified professionals; it maintains standards by providing intensive training courses, highly-structured material for use in class and frequent monitoring. The combination is so effective that BRAC's methods have been praised by Unicef, the United Nations organisation for children, and copied by other countries. Today, BRAC's most delicate political problem comes in fending off attacks from conservative Islamic clerics, who condemn its efforts to elevate the status of women as 'Christianisation'. 'We get a lot of flak from the mullahs,' says Mr Abed. About 5 per cent of the 700,000 children at BRAC schools have been kept away from class by parents influenced by the clergy. Some mullahs have even ruled that membership of a BRAC credit co-operative is grounds for divorce. But Mr Abed believes strongly that bringing women into economic activity is vital to Bangladesh's future. The majority of participants in BRAC schemes are women, whom BRAC has found to be better credit risks than men. Mr Abed says women benefit more from BRAC than men because they are new to work outside their immediate household and so are more conscientious. Also, women are, from an early age, brought up to bear responsibilities, first for their younger siblings and later for their own children. 'In the 1975 famine, men deserted their families to look for food. Women stayed with their children. Survival in the villages depends more on women than on men.' While Bangladesh has seen steady economic growth, particularly in the past three years, half of the 120m people live below the government's poverty line. Mr Abed believes the poor will not benefit unless the growth rate rises from recent levels of 4-5 per cent annually to 6-7 per cent. 'In the meantime, we must target programmes at the poorest people.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guadalajara, 6 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Nicaraguan  President Violeta Chamorro denied she had fainted in  Guadalajara, as has been reported by some media. "I am well and  I do not wish anyone harm," the Nicaraguan president said upon  leaving the hotel where she is staying in this city while  participating in the forum entitled; "Women in the Americas;  Participation and Development."    Armando Morquecho, government spokesman for the western  state  of Jalisco, said Maria Magdalena Zeco de Posadas, wife of  Uruguay's representative to the IDB, was taken to the emergency  room at Del Carmen Hospital. Morquecho explained that Ignacio de  Posadas, Uruguay's representative to the IDB, had accompanied  his wife to the hospital, where she was transferred to the  emergency ward for treatment for an asthmatic-bronchitis attack.  Morquecho said the commotion at the hotel occurred at the same  time that the Nicaraguan president was arriving, thus causing  confusion and giving rise to reports that Chamorro had fainted.    Chamorro will participate this afternoon at the forum's full  session, where the theme will be: "The road to Beijing,  preparations for the Fourth Women's Conference."</p>

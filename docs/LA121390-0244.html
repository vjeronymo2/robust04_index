			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DISNEY WON'T COMPETE FOR BONDS  </P> <P> Walt Disney World officials say they have killed plans to compete with Orange  County, Fla., and other governments for federally regulated tax-exempt bonds  Disney had hoped to use for sewage treatment.  </P> <P> The Reedy Creek Improvement District, Disney's governmental arm, was set to  apply for the bonds Jan. 2 -- a move that would have once again put it in  competition with Orange County and other municipalities. But Tom Moses, Reedy  Creek's general manager, said Wednesday that talks with Orange County  Chairwoman Linda Chapin convinced him and other officials that housing needs in  1991 are critical.  </P></p>

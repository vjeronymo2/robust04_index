			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UN to study Kuwaiti claims from Gulf war The United Nations Compensation Commission charged with recompensating victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait is to start examining a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) claim from the Kuwait Oil Company for the cost of putting out hundreds of oil well fires, Frances Williams reports from Geneva. The fires were deliberately started by Iraqi troops as they retreated from the US-led allied advance. The commission, which has so far received a total of nearly Dollars 160bn in claims, has already begun to pay out small amounts of compensation to individuals but this is the first big commercial claim it has tackled. The reimbursement requested by the Kuwait Oil Company, 'in excess of' Dollars 950m, is part of an overall compensation demand for nearly Dollars 100bn filed by the Kuwaiti government. Other claims relate to damage to oil reservoirs and loss of crude oil production following the oil well fires. An expert panel will be set up to assess the Kuwait Oil Company claim which the commission describes as of 'symbolic character' for Kuwait 'because of its economic, environmental and health hazard connota-tions'. However, even if agreed, the compensation commission has no money at present to reimburse the company. Satisfaction of this and other claims will have to await funds generated by UN-approved Iraqi oil sales.</p>

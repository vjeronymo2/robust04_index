			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Axa buys Victoire Belgium Axa, one of France's largest insurers, is expanding its European interests by buying Victoire Belgium from Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) for FFr1bn (Dollars 188m). UAP acquired Victoire Belgium last year as part of a complex deal which gave it control of the international activities of Victoire, the Paris-based insurer then owned by the Suez group. The bulk of Victoire's domestic business has since been sold by Suez to Commercial Union, the UK concern, as part of the ongoing restructuring of the European insurance industry. Axa, which trails UAP as the second force in French insurance, has been steadily expanding its international interests. It already has a presence in the Belgian market through its Axa Belgium and Mutuelle Patronale subsidiaries, which had combined turnover of FFr2.35bn in 1993. The acquisition of Victoire Belgium, which commanded an estimated 1.3 per cent of the Belgian insurance sector with 1993 turnover of FFr920m, should raise Axa's share of the Belgian market to around 5 per cent. It will still lag UAP which, even after this latest disposal, remains the number two insurer in Belgium, through its Royale Belge subsidiary. That business had turnover of FFr9.3bn last year. Vic-Life, the Luxembourg subsidiary of Victoire Belgium, has been exempted from yesterday's transaction. Instead of going to Axa, it will become part of the Royale Belge group, raising UAP's profile in Luxembourg by lifting its annual sales to around FFr190m. Axa and UAP are still intent on pursuing further international acquisitions. Axa yesterday announced it was poised to clinch a deal to buy the The Wing On Life Assurance Company in Hong Kong. UAP has expressed interest in Asia, but is also seeking a non-life insurer in the UK.</p>

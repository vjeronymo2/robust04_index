			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei sees gains eroded as Hong Kong surges 4.8% The rise in US interest rates and the strong rally on Wall Street initially encouraged investors, but later arbitrage selling and profit-taking due to the higher yen eroded most of the earlier gains, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average finished 19.20 up at 20,152.73 after a day's high of 20,285.96 and low of 19,965.79. The yen rose against the dollar in spite of previous expectations that the yen would ease against the dollar on a rate cut. Institutional investors stepped up selling in the afternoon session, but buying by overseas investors provided underlying support. Volume totalled 300m shares, against 249m. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 1.74 at 1,634.69 and the Nikkei 300 eased 0.25 to 298.88. Falls led advances by 517 to 460, with 195 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 3.55 to 1,329.19. In spite of the immediate reaction on the financial markets, some economists said the US discount rate and federal fund rate rise would have positive effects on the yen and the economy in the medium term. 'The real yield differential between Japan and the US will mean that capital flows will support the dollar,' said Mr Dick Beason, senior economist at James Capel. The yen's easing, which may start around the end of July, coupled with the apparent softening stance on trade of US officials, could also help consumer confidence, he said. Sanyo Electric, the most active issue of the day on foreign buying, rose Y5 to Y525 on reports that it would start marketing portable telephones in the UK from September. Hitachi firmed Y10 to Y1,010 and Matsushita Electric Industrial gained Y10 at Y1,720, but Sony fell Y60 to Y5,940 and Victor retreated Y40 to Y1,360 on the higher yen. Arbitrage selling depressed banks. Industrial Bank of Japan weakened Y50 to Y3,220 and Mitsubishi Bank shed Y20 to Y2,740. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the benchmark for investor confidence, fell Y10,000 to Y879,000, while East Japan Railway receded Y3,000 to Y504,000. Companies which have announced favourable business results over the past few days were strong. Aiwa, the consumer electronics company, moved ahead Y80 to Y2,680 and Uni-Charm put on Y30 at Y2,960 and Ajinomoto advanced Y20 to Y1,290. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 43.08 to 22,323.85 in volume of 21.5m shares. Roundup The Fed's move to tighten US monetary policy was in line with expectations, but still gave a fillip to some Pacific Rim markets. Seoul was closed for a holiday. HONG KONG surged 4.8 per cent, cheered by the US interest rate developments and the announcement of plans to resume Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's airport. The Hang Seng index rose 431.94 to 9,476.64, just below its peak for the day of 9,477.33, in turnover that jumped to a hefty HKDollars 6.71bn, from a revised HKDollars 5.04bn on Tuesday. Property issues led the rise. Cheung Kong advanced HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 39.75, Henderson Land HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 43.50 and SHK Properties HKDollars 4.25 to HKDollars 53. KUALA LUMPUR was led higher by institutional buying of Tenaga Nasional which left the composite index up 18.31, or 1.9 per cent, at 1,010.27. Tenaga, which accounts for 20 per cent weightage on the index, rose 70 cents to MDollars 14.10 in volume of 1.6m shares after the company clarified details of its foreign exchange losses. BANGKOK advanced 1.7 per cent, the SET index rising 22.62 to 1,325.47 in heavy turnover of Bt12.2bn. Construction materials and electronic component issues saw some early profit-taking, but bargain hunting sent the finance sector 5.2 per cent ahead in turnover of Bt5.4bn. SYDNEY faltered in afternoon trade but still ended firmer in response to buoyant commodity prices and positive news from overseas which had sparked strong morning gains. The All Ordinaries index finished 11.8 higher at 2,107.8, but profit-taking took the index off the day's peak of 2,120.4. Volume was 237.7m shares. WELLINGTON saw demand from Asia and Australia which took the NZSE-40 capital index 37.06 higher to 2,155.10 in healthy turnover of NZDollars 52.7m. SINGAPORE saw some institutional demand for blue chips, and the Straits Times Industrial index rose 18.67 to 2,323.16 in volume of 144.9m shares. Yeo Hiap Seng shares were actively traded, aided by news that Orchard Parade Holdings had raised its stake. The YHS shares closed 8 cents stronger at SDollars 3.90. TAIPEI continued its consolidation, the weighted index losing 32.58 to 5,983.25 in turnover that fell to TDollars 62.8bn from Tuesday's TDollars 67.29bn. MANILA was worried about investigations into Bancapital Development Corporation, an unlicensed investment house that appeared to have closed down, leaving a trail of undelivered Treasury bills and some banks with large losses. The composite index fell 37.08 to 2,899.35 in volume of 1.88bn shares, compared with Tuesday's 2.34bn. KARACHI moved ahead in active trade in energy shares after reports of government incentives in the 1994/95 budget, which is due on June 9. The KSE 100-share index closed 25.34, or 1.2 per cent, up at 2,214.83.</p>

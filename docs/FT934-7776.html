			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: TPC puts block on new sugar venture PLANS by CSR, the Australian sugar and building products group, to form a major sugar industry joint venture with the Mackay Sugar Co-Operative Association and London-based trading house ED&amp; F. Man, have run into opposition from the Australian Trades Practices Commission. The joint venture was announced in August, when CSR said it would join with Mackay Refined Sugars - a joint arrangement between Man and MSCA - to form a white sugar production, marketing and distribution operation. CSR was to hold 50 per cent of the company, with MSCA and Man each taking 25 per cent. CSR would have contributed refinery assets in Perth, Melbourne and Auckland, while Mackay would have supplied its new low-cost refinery, being built in Queensland, along with bulk storage facilities. The partners claimed that the venture would create a refined sugar export industry in Australia, which has traditionally exported raw sugar only. Annual turnover of the joint venture company was forecast at ADollars 500m (USDollars 327m). Yesterday, however, the TPC claimed that the proposal would substantially lessen competition in the refined sugar industry and push up prices for sugar and products containing it. The TPC said that the companies were pooling refining capacity which would have given them a joint market share of over 50 per cent and that 'having combined the assets, the companies would not compete'. It suggested that CSR was insulating itself from competition which would otherwise have been generated by a new Mackay refinery, and said that the proposed export benefits had been overstated. The TPC also rejected the argument that imports would be an effective constraint on prices, given high freight and handling costs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 29 KYODO -- New International Trade  and Industry Minister [MITI] Eijiro Hata has called for  "comprehensive efforts" to break the trade impasse between Japan  and the United States.    The private sector and the ruling coalition parties, as well  as government ministries, should make concerted efforts to  maintain Japan's national interests on the trade front, Hata  said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE and other news  organizations Thursday.    As a way to improve the current trade situation, the new  coalition government may need the power of a single influential  politician, Hata said in an indirect endorsement of the role of  Ichiro Ozawa, the chief strategist for the government of new  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and his predecessor Morihiro  Hosokawa.    Ozawa is believed to have played a key role in settling the  Japan-U.S. row over Motorola Inc.'s access to Japan's cellular  phone market in March.    In his first press conference as MITI chief earlier  Thursday,  Hata also vowed Tokyo's maximum efforts to use "every trade  channel, including informal negotiations" to mend the strained  economic ties between Tokyo and Washington.    The trade minister said Japan should take the formation of  the new cabinet as an opportunity to clarify anew the  fundamental problems between Tokyo and Washington.    "Little time is left (before the July summit of the group of  seven leading industrialized nations in Naples). But the new  government should not spare time digging into the core part of  the current trade wrangling," Hata said.    Hata opposed the U.S. demand for numerical targets as a tool  to gauge the openness of Japan's markets, calling for  Washington's understanding of Japan's stance against managed  trade.    The trade minister voiced regret over the Social Democratic  Party's departure from the coalition, due to intracoalition  feud, immediately after a coalition accord on a policy platform  was struck.    The departure resulted in a ruling minority alliance for the  new government, the first in Japan in nearly 40 years.    Hata called for the socialists to continue respecting a  coalition accord on key issues, including tax reforms.    The platform includes "significantly painful measures" for  the SDP, but they are "worth being implemented," he said.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kennecott makes large Canadian diamond find The emerging diamond field in Canada's Northwest Territories has been further extended with a substantial discovery by a joint venture led by Kennecott, a subsidiary of the UK's RTZ group. Kennecott's Canadian partner, Aber Resources, said that it has recovered 154 stones from a 155kg sample taken from its Diavik property, about 350km north-east of Yellowknife. The property is on the southern boundary of the Lac de Gras area in which Australia's BHP Minerals and its Canadian partner, Dia Met Minerals, have already made substantial discoveries. BHP and Dia Met are presently analysing bulk ore samples from their property before deciding whether to build North America's first diamond mine on the site. Their confidence that the CDollars 400m project will go ahead is reflected in talks which have already begun with the Northwest Territories government on environmental permits and financial arrangements for a mine. BHP believes the property could be in production by 1997. Aber stressed that its discovery was concentrated in a single kimberlite pipe. Of the 154 stones, 38 had a diameter of more than 0.5mm. However, it said that preliminary results from another pipe also pointed to the presence of diamonds. The Kennecott/Aber discovery has given another push to the surge in share prices of companies involved in the NWT diamond rush. Aber gained 88 cents to CDollars 8.25 in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday, after jumping by CDollars 2 on Monday afternoon, following the announcement of its find. Dia Met was also higher.</p>

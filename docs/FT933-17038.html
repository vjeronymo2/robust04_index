			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Bundesbank given rates signal THE Bonn coalition's DM25bn (Pounds 9.8bn) savings package was widely hailed yesterday as a signal for the Bundesbank to resume cutting key interest rates - but there was no agreement on when the first move would come. Today's meeting of the central bank's policy-making council in Leipzig was considered too early by Mr Rudiger Pohl, a member of the government's council of economic advisers. He believed the bank might delay action until the political fate of the contentious package, based on cuts in social spending, was clearer. Financial market traders were also sceptical, even though the bank early yesterday gave a further downward nudge to the securities repurchase rate, at which it supplies markets with wholesale funds. A cut from 7.59 to 7.58 per cent - the smallest possible - had been expected and gave no grounds for immediate optimism, one trader said. However, as several observers pointed out, after today's meeting only two more council sessions are scheduled before the long summer break. Strains in the economy alone pointed to the need for some encouragement from the central bank sometime this month. Despite the Bundesbank's repeated attempts to talk up the state of the economy, calls are increasing from industry for further rates relief. Mr Tyll Necker, president of the BDI federal industry confederation, said earlier this week that the end of the slump had not been reached and all indicators were still pointing downwards. Private sector economists have this week downgraded their forecasts and now expect the west German economy to shrink by up to 3 per cent in 1993. The government, too, wants some help to divert further criticism of German fiscal laxity and monetary rigidity expected at next month's summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Tokyo. Chancellor Helmut Kohl would draw attention to the deficit-reduction package at the talks, Mr Dieter Vogel, the official government spokesman, said. The planned cuts would help put an end to uncertainty about the stability of the D-Mark, he added, and create conditions for further rate cuts. Reductions in social supports would make them a less attractive alternative to working. Deutsche Bank, with especially close links to industry, was among the more bullish proponents of immediate cuts. Mr Axel Siedenberg, an economist in the bank's research division, said he expected at least a quarter-point reduction today in the 7.25 per cent discount and the 8.50 per cent Lombard rates. He pointed to the expected return of monetary growth to the Bundesbank's target range, a further easing of inflation, and continuing falls in import prices. Although import prices in May fell 0.3 per cent to stand 3.6 per cent lower than a year earlier, other economists pointed out that the recent rise of the dollar against the D-Mark would quickly push them up again.</p>

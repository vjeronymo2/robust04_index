			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Age of the old buffer Our churches, those seductive promoters of immortality, are losing customers. This is another example of short-termism. The question of eternal life, the lost congregations tell themselves, is not an immediate one. What does seem urgent is to ask what we are to do with the extra quarter of a century that most of us can now look forward to - and how to pay for it. The ancient conundrum that gave so much gainful employment to philosophers in centuries past is being turned on its head. In the west the contemplation of life after death is being replaced by studies of life before death. Canny social scientists are seizing the opportunity opened up by this shift in the angst market. Some of them will meet in London next week to discuss 'life, work and livelihood in the third age', a conference called to mark the recently published final report of a Carnegie-sponsored inquiry into those topics. The 'third age' is taken to mean everyone over 50 and under 75. In Britain that amounts to a quarter of the population, or some 14m people. This important chunk of society would not exist but for 20th century medicine and economic development. Since 1901 the average life expectancy at birth has risen from 45 to 73 for men and from 49 to 79 for women, largely as a result of a reduction of deaths in infancy and childhood. At the same time the number of people surviving into what Carnegie and others term the 'fourth age' - the years of dependency - has grown sharply. In 1951 only 4 per cent of the UK population was aged 75-plus; by the turn of the century the proportion will have doubled to 8 per cent. Carnegie's central proposition is that the 50 to 75-year-olds should be kept busy, either in gainful if part-time employment, or in voluntary work, the better to be able to help finance or manage the upkeep of the over-75s. 'Fundamentally, the third age could be the source of a major contribution to the economy or a drag upon it,' says the report. Solutions may be easier to find for those whose working lives have been brain-driven than for those who have been made redundant by the contraction of smokestack industries. Old miners, old steelworkers, old shipbuilders may not die - not just yet - but we know that many of them are doomed to spend long empty years fading away. The unfairness of human existence persists to its end. This is recognised in the report, whose chapter on pensions is the best in the book. No surprise here: it was prepared at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Under Carnegie's label the IFS presents a list of recommendations, and a set of options. The choices make themselves. First, we cannot afford, and should not aim to afford, state pensions for under-65s. Recent hints from ministers suggest that there is some infirmity of purpose on this matter. The logic of raising the pension age for women to 65 has been accepted. What remains to be demonstrated is the will. In my view the state pension age should be 70, and rising. Second, the earnings-related state pension should be abolished, although existing commitments will have to be met. Let private and occupational pensions do the job for which Serps was intended. Third, the upper earnings limit on National Insurance contributions should be removed, thus raising the marginal tax rate on the top tranche of higher earners' incomes. The tens of billions of pounds saved could be directed towards better social security for very old pensioners, the majority of whom are women. Retired people in the third age are more likely than their older relatives to have independent sources of income, such as part-time earnings, company pensions, savings, a paid-for house, or even a few dividends. For them the government's policy is to allow the value of the basic state pension to decline in relation to average earnings - that is, to let it wither away. Perhaps this is right. It is in the fourth age that the need becomes desperate. Loading the money into support for people who depend entirely on the state makes sense. The pity is that no one has a comparable plan for men in their 50s who are trapped in long-term unemployment - unless you count what has become a ritual incantation about education and training. The IFS chapter also floats the idea of long-term care insurance, which would help defray the costs of living through our 80s and, with luck, our 90s. This could be a runner. I turn to Professor Alan Walker of the University of Sheffield. He is co-ordinator of the European Community's official and continuous colloquy on these matters - the 'EC Observatory on Ageing'. Professor Walker says that there are now two models of late-in-life care evolving within the Community. The predominant one is for the state to pay, as with Britain's community care (some of which is in private homes) and Denmark's luxurious home helps, who are available around the clock. Against that, Germany and Belgium are developing state-organised insurance schemes. This sounds more like it: an individual armed with insurance money can make a better choice of carer than a local council official. Even better would be laws against age discrimination, as in the US. True, these are evaded but in logic they must help break down social attitudes based on 19th-century rates of life-expectancy. Grey power in America is, however, an old story, its victories won, its consequences digested. Europe is different. Here the tendency has been to encourage early retirement. Less than half the men aged between 55 and 64 in France and the Netherlands are counted as economically active. The UK figure in the year cited, 1988, was 68 per cent, a sharp fall on the 91.3 per cent of 1970. According to Prof Walker that tide is turning. The tendency in Continental northern Europe is now to reduce the force of 'early exit' policies. Thankfully, this will be a matter for individual countries. The EC has no legislative competence here, although it might acquire some under the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty. To compensate itself, it is financing talk-fests. This is the Community's 'Year of Older People and Solidarity between Generations', a soggy phrase derived from surveys that suggest that the aged prefer to be called something like 'senior citizens'. Personally I am - shall be - quite content with 'old buffer', if the money is right.</p>

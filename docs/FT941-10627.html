			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Japan agrees Pounds 95bn deal to aid economy Japan yesterday announced a record Y15,250bn (Pounds 95bn) package of tax cuts, government spending and loans, designed to pull the economy out of its deepest recession since the second world war. The stimulus package, to be implemented over the next year or so, consists of Y5,850bn in income tax cuts and Y9,400bn in public works spending and loans and grants for business and housing. The compromise was made possible by prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's decision to freeze his plans for a new 7 per cent sales tax in three years' time. It had been opposed by the Social Democratic party, the largest member of the unstable seven-party coalition. The size of the package and Mr Hosokawa's suspension of the sales tax bodes well for his meeting with President Bill Clinton on Friday to discuss trade relations. US officials had opposed an early increase in indirect taxes, for fear it would depress consumer demand and hamper efforts to curb Japan's record current account surplus. However, Mr Hosokawa has had to scale back his plan, announced last week, for a Y6,000bn annual income tax reduction, to win support from the fiscal conservatives in his coalition. They follow the finance ministry's line that tax cuts should be funded by indirect tax increases. Instead, the government will make a one-off Y5,850bn income tax cut - to be paid as an across-the-board 20 per cent tax rebate to all income tax payers  -while it attempts to agree on the permanent tax changes by the end of the year that Mr Hosokawa wanted. The rebate, to be paid in June and October this year, is worth Y106,000 to the average family of four, on a Y7m annual salary, the finance ministry estimated. The tax cut, the largest in postwar years, will be funded by the issue of deficit bonds, requiring special legislation. The powerful finance ministry has fought hard against deficit financing, but compromised on the understanding that the government will secure an agreement this year to increase indirect taxes. This is seen as essential to compensate for the loss of income tax revenue already expected as Japan's population of retired people rises sharply in the next few decades. The spending side of the package will be funded from a mixture of existing revenue and construction bonds, which the government issues to finance public spending on the infrastructure, and from postal savings. Business groups and economists welcomed the package yesterday. Private sector forecasters predicted that it would boost gross national product from around zero to around 1.3 per cent this year, while the government's economic planning agency said it would add as much as 2.2 per cent to growth. Yesterday's pump-priming package is the fourth announced by the government since August 1992. Most of the Y30,200bn made available in the past three stimulus packages has already been spent. The latest plan includes Y7,200bn of public spending on infrastructure, and loans for house buyers, small businesses and job creation. The package also contains plans to help banks dispose of bad loans faster, to avert fears of a credit shortage.

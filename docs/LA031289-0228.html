			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CENSUS BUREAU ACTS TO ENSURE CORRECT COUNT FOR SANTA ANA  </P> <P> As part of an effort to get a better count of a sprawling immigrant and  minority population that Santa Ana city officials say has been under counted in  the past, the U.S. Census Bureau is opening a district office in Santa Ana on  April 1 to gear up for the 1990 Census.  </P> <P> The office will be the first of four to be opened in Orange County that will  eventually employ about 800 workers who will conduct the mammoth counting task  next spring, according to Mike Weiler, assistant regional manager for  operations in the Census Bureau's regional office in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> The opening of the Santa Ana office marks a partnership between city and  federal officials, one they hope will ensure that people of every cultural and  racial background are included in the count, a concern especially critical in  Santa Ana, whose minority population has exploded in recent years.  </P> <P> Santa Ana officials have grumbled for almost 10 years that the city lost out on  all sorts of federal and state funds because a large segment of its population  went uncounted.  </P> <P> City officials have said they believe the tabulation for Santa Ana was off by  about 50,000 people in the last Census, partially because many among the city's  immigrants and Latinos -- native and immigrant, including illegal migrants --  were suspicious of the process or did not understand the significance of their  participation, said Santa Ana City Councilman Miguel A. Pulido said.  </P> <P> "You might say, 'So what? What difference does it make if you under count?' The  answer is money," Pulido said. "If you don't have an accurate count, you have  to service people that don't exist on paper."  </P> <P> If the city's population is miscounted in the same proportion as last time,  Pulido said, the loss in revenue could be huge, as much as $5 million a year by  some city estimates.  </P> <P> "That means $150 to $200 per person per year for the decade of the '90s --  that's what's at stake," he said. "That's a lot of money for us."  </P> <P> Last month, the City Council announced formation of a Better Count Committee  which will work with the U.S. Census Bureau to help familiarize the public with  the benefits of cooperating with Census workers.  </P> <P> Officials are predicting that with this new effort, the 1990 Census will  present a much different picture of the county's population than that of 10  years ago.  </P> <P> "This whole Orange County area -- and of course Santa Ana -- has been so  impacted with the growing Asian community, with the immigrants from Central and  South America, as well as the Mexican immigrants who have been here for some  time," said Martha Gallegos, who was hired in November as the city's outreach  supervisor.  </P> <P> "There's just been a tremendous growth in the last 10 years," she said.  </P> <P> Local and federal officials say the experience of the last two federal Census  counts has shown them that identifying the groups that don't participate in the  count is not enough. The new challenge is to hire Census workers who are from  those groups that were under counted, in order to build trust among those  residents, and to seek out those groups on their own turf.  </P> <P> The city, for example, plans to send representatives to community organizations  and agencies to spread the word to clients, to such places as centers where  mothers go for Women, Infant and Children social services, well-baby programs  for low-income mothers and adult education classes that teach English to  immigrants applying for legal status.  </P> <P> Also, they will work with elementary and junior high schools to familiarize  children with the Census material.  </P> <P> "We're focusing on that level because many parents do not read, even in their  own language," Gallegos said. "Children are often used to acting as  interpreters for their parents to fill out forms, and we're hoping that by  showing the children the forms, telling them what the questions are, how the  information will be used, and really stress the confidentiality of it, when the  parents receive the forms in the mail, the children will say, 'Oh yes, we had  this in school, we heard about this.' "  </P> <P> As Census Day -- April 1, 1990 -- approaches, the city plans to hold a carnival  or other type of entertainment event to mark the day and help families "to  participate in the Census in a relaxed atmosphere."  </P> <P> There also are plans to ask churches to mention the Census in their sermons,  and for grocery stores to participate by announcing the approach of the Census  on their grocery bags.  </P> <P> Gallegos said she eventually will have a staff of five people, including  Asians.  </P> <P> "I would say that maybe the Asian population may have been under counted, but  mostly it was the Hispanics in Santa Ana," she said. "One of the biggest  reasons is that there is a large population that is here illegally and, of  course, may not want to give information, and may not understand it. Or they  have fears, fears that maybe the INS is going to see this information . . . or  maybe that they have three families living in a single dwelling."  </P> <P> Santa Ana is the first city in California this year to hire an outreach worker  to coordinate the Census task with federal officials, Gallegos said. And  because of its high immigrant and ethnic population, Santa Ana has been  targeted as one of 50 cities across the nation that the bureau will be working  with closely.  </P> <P> Weiler said the opening of the Santa Ana office will culminate months of work  by federal and city officials to ensure a better count through cooperation.  </P> <P> Last month, for example, John Reeder Jr., a representative of the U.S.  Department of Commerce, came to make a presentation on the Census at an event  sponsored by the city and Voces Unidas, a Latino civic organization.  </P> <P> The Census Bureau's seven other Southland offices are in Long Beach, Panorama  City, Ventura, Pasadena, San Diego, Compton and Riverside. Weiler said the  10-county Southern California region eventually will have 30 district offices,  but most of those will not open until later this year.  </P> <P> A management team for the Santa Ana office has already been hired and went  through training last week, Weiler said. Now they will concentrate on hiring  the 140 people who will begin the work of verifying computerized mail lists  that will be used for the Census. He said he wants to get the word out that  there are jobs to be had and that the bureau is interested in hiring people of  all races and backgrounds.  </P> <P> "The vast majority of the people we hire are from the community," he said.  "That does two things: it gives us people knowledgeable about the community.  People feel more comfortable working in their own community. And from a cost  standpoint, they're not spending a lot of time driving to work or finding their  way around.  </P> <P> "It also gives us a work force that is representative of the people we are  going to count," Weiler said. "For us to do a good job, our work force must be  representative of the people we are counting."  </P></p>

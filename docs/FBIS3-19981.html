Violante, a member of the Democratic Party of the Left, came  under heavy fire from parties and spokesmen on the right of the  political spectrum after the Turin daily, LA STAMPA, published  remarks in which he reportedly claimed the managing-director of  TV tycoon Silvio Berlusconi's Publitalia advertising arm,  Marcello Dell'Utri was under investigation by the Catania public  prosecutor's office for Mafia ties in a case involving arms and  drugs trafficking.    The prosecutor's office denied the claim yesterday with a  less than categorical statement, which deplored press leaks and  voiced "surprise, alarm and disappointment" over publication of  news which "should it prove true, would definitely jeopardise  investigations."    This afternoon, Berlusconi was meeting here with President  Oscar Luigi Scalfaro in his role as president of the Superior  Council of the Magistrature, the body through which the  judiciary governs its affairs, to end what the media  mogul-turned-politician called "this provocation against the  liberty of the Italians."    Reports that Dell'Utri has been named by Cosa Nostra  supergrass Salvatore Cancemi in connection with organised crime  activities have been legion in recent days, and there was court  testimony from the late 1980's in which he was linked to Mafia  figures.    LA STAMPA's confirmation of its printed version of the  remarks in which Violante is quoted as asking the journalist not  to print some of his more flippant observations was greeted by  Berlusconi's conservative Go Italy party as triumphant  confirmation of a "Communist plot" to prevent the Right from  winning the imminent elections.    Other conservatives joined the chorus, most of them arguing  that Violante, who said yesterday evening he was meditating  resignation as an "act of conscience," should step down because  his remarks may have represent a breach of the judicial secret.    Informed judicial sources said that the name that had in  fact  occurred in the investigations was that of Alberto Dell'Utri,  Marcello's twin brother, who apparently cropped up during  telephone taps on the conversations of organised crime figures.    Violante told journalists that it was the LA STAMPA reporter  who had mentioned the Catania investigations to him, then  putting the remarks into his mouth. He also said he had asked  his lawyers to start legal proceedings, claiming he had been  "trapped."    Today, Violante's letter pointed out that, "beyond their  party membership and political opinion," during his chairmanship  at the Anti-Mafia Committee, all the committee members, who come  from both houses of parliament, gave their full cooperation to  enquiries that had for the first time elucidated the nexus  between organised crime, business interests and politicians.  "Consolidated equilibriums have been upset," he told the  speakers of the two houses of parliament. "A start has been made  to ascertaining responsibilities never identified before, and  hitherto concealed collusions have become public and have been  made evident. Whence the attempt to strike back, using every  means and with the aim of delegitimising this work. The trap  was sprung on a lie, and the attack is built on lies, using the  contingency of the elections beyond any acceptable limit."    Chatting with journalists, Violante claimed one should have  "strong doubts" about the whole of the power system from which  the attack against him and the Anti-Mafia Committee were coming:  "When the first Mafia trials started, there was talk of plots.  When a certain type of power is questioned and brought back in  line with the law, there are shouts of a plot because it needs  illegality."    He also said he had received hundreds of messages of  support,  not least from the families of police and magistrates slain by  the Mafia, adding that he was also acting in defence of his own  personal values.    Now 52, Violante has been on leave from his job as a judge  since 1979 when he first won election to the Lower House for the  Italian Communist Party after working as an assistant prosecutor  in Turin, handling mostly terrorist cases.    For his thirteen years in parliament, he has been a leading  voice in the national debate on judicial affairs and played a  direct role in moves in parliamentary enquiries to uncover the  Gladio stay-behind operation, earning violent criticism from  then President Francesco Cossiga who on one occasion described  him as "the Italian Vyshinskiy." But the work that has taken  most of his attention and projected him firmly into the public  eye when he became the Anti-Mafia Committee's chairman has been  organised crime.    He was a major force behind approval of legislation on Mafia  association and in support of witness protection programmes for  Mafia state's witnesses. The Anti-Mafia Committee's reports on  the links between organised crime, politicians and business were  approved by a large majority.    Even though he denied alleging that Berlusconi has any  direct  responsibility in it, Violante said he sees a "general strategy  to delegitimise... my work and the commission's." "My  impression is that the nucleus of interests collected round Go  Italy is in deep continuity with the system of power that in the  past caused so much mourning and so much damage in Italy," he  added.    In other remarks, he described the remarks published by LA  STAMPA as a "pseudo-interview" and told reporters to refer to  his denial.    He also repeated that his resignation was not capitulation  to  the charges against him, but was to avoid charges of partiality  being advanced against the Anti-Mafia Committee and its work.</p>

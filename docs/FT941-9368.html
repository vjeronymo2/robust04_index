			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Valentine bloom for Flying Flowers Flying Flowers, the UK's sole quoted flowers-by-post business, celebrated St Valentine's Day by announcing more than doubled 1993 pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.1m, against Pounds 533,000. The result compared with a forecast last August of not less than Pounds 940,000 at the time of the Jersey-based company's flotation. Total sales expanded from Pounds 5.36m to Pounds 7.05m. Mr Walter Goldsmith, chairman, said the results reflected strong trading in postal packs of flowers. This was achieved by mailing to an increasingly large database and by direct response advertising. Additional sales were generated by the progressive involvement with retail chains, mail order and credit card companies. Mr Goldsmith said the company was now offering a postal pack service for delivery to most northern European countries and would be market testing an advertising offer in France for Mother's Day. The carnation nursery in Jersey produced about 4m blooms in 1993, he said, although production was inhibited by unusually low natural light levels. The 17-acre Jersey site had become one of the island's most successful tourist attractions, generating extra revenues. The company is paying a dividend 25 per cent higher than expected of 1.08p gross to UK shareholders - equivalent to 1.35p for Jersey holders - against a flotation forecast of 0.866p and 1.083p to UK and Jersey shareholders respectively. Earnings per share climbed from 3.06p to 5.19p. Mr Goldsmith said the company entered 1994 'with a strong balance sheet, no borrowings and a consistent growth record'. Cash and short term deposits at the end of 1993 were Pounds 751,000. The shares rose 1p to 96p yesterday.</p>

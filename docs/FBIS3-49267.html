			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Josef Lux, chairman of the Christian and </F> Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, by Roman  Krasnicky; place and date not given: "Our Voters Do Not Have To  Attend Church Services"]    [Text] Josef Lux, chairman of the Christian and  Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, rules out the  possibility that his party could, in the future, receive less  than 5 percent of votes: We will always be a parliamentary  party, he says.    [Krasnicky] How stable is the coalition after 18 months of  existence?    [Lux] Just as it was at the beginning. It will last for the  entire electoral term.    [Krasnicky] The Civic Democratic Party [ODS] represents 30  percent of all voters, your party just 6 percent. The ODS  members dominate the Cabinet. Does their greater responsibility  imply also a greater "right" to enforce their views?    [Lux] I reject any deliberation on diverse responsibilities.  It is the same in the coalition. The only difference is in  strength. The ODS is the strongest in the coalition, and it also  uses the strength. The equality of the parties is given by the  coalition treaty. If equality of the parties did not exist, we  could speak not about a coalition but about a vassalage. The  fundamental issues must be accepted by all coalition parties.    [Krasnicky] At the Olomouc congress of the Christian  Democratic Party [KDS], you delivered a speech that has been  favorably viewed by the KDS members. Is an association of the  two parties feasible?    [Lux] It is true that I felt as if I was among good friends  at the KDS conference. We have the same ideological basis, the  same world view.... If I compare our policy statement with the  KDS program, it is difficult to distinguish any substantial  differences. Therefore, I see a lot of room for practical  cooperation at all levels. The need for this cooperation is even  more urgent if we realize that the Christian democratic concept  of politics truly is the universal political alternative to all  socialist and liberal egotist models. I hope that together we  will be able to push through our model. I myself have two  ambitions: first, to prove to people that it is not necessary  for them to attend church services to be able to vote for a  party with a Christian democratic program, as the propaganda is  trying to make them believe, and second, that social regard and  solidarity are not prerogatives of the left wing but, rather,  are characteristic for us.    [Krasnicky] Public opinion surveys regularly attribute to  you  relatively few votes near the magic 5-percent limit. Does it  make you uneasy? Do you believe that the third time around, in  the 1996 parliamentary elections, you will be lucky again and  manage to keep slightly above the limit?    [Lux] We do not feel at all uneasy. We work according to our  concept, holding the entire four-year electoral cycle in  perspective. The mistrust in election results that you indicated  is based purely on lack of knowledge of our party. No other  party has dared to advocate, at first sight, so many unpopular  issues as ours. One instance is agriculture. Some people  whispered to me: Do not touch the farmers; you would lose  traditional voters. I am convinced that it is necessary for this  country to reduce the number of farmers by 50 percent, as is  usual in the world, and therefore I am pushing through certain  measures. Similarly, I refused to continue the practice of  granting subsidies from the state treasury to private farmers  and for each hectare. If they farmed individually, those 5- and  10-hectare farmers would soon go bankrupt anyway because such  small farms cannot be competitive. I told them this immediately.  Many have held it against me until today, but most understood  that this saved them from the unhappy fate of bankrupts, and  they will further combine in larger partnerships.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Weekend Interview: The man who paints like Michelangelo - Gianluigi Colalucci is tackling the art world's greatest challenge: restoring the Sistine Chapel GOETHE claimed that only by seeing the Sistine Chapel with Michelangelo's frescos could one have a complete understanding of what a single man can achieve. Few have a greater understanding of the achievements of this man than Professor Gianluigi Colalucci. He has been in charge of the painstaking task of restoring these frescos in the Vatican from the moment the first experiments were carried out on an area the size of a postage stamp 12 years ago. The complexity and sheer scale of dealing with Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling and the wall, with the gigantic composition of the 'Last Judgement', has made it one of the most remarkable acts of modern restoration. Ironically, the work of cleaning and restoration, together with pauses to assess progress, has taken longer than the combined time Michelangelo took to paint the frescos. The ceiling with the famous central depiction of the creation was painted from 1508-12; while the turbulent 'Last Judgement' was begun 22 years later and completed in 1541. Restoration is in its final phase and the magnificently fresh colours - Prof Colalucci's critics say too fresh - of the ceiling can be seen by all. On a scaffold behind a white net at the far end of the chapel, the team is now working on the surface of 'The Last Judgement'. 'I deliberately left this until the end as it the most complex part of the whole restoration', says Colalucci. Pope Paul IV dismissed 'The Last Judgement' as a 'stew of nudes' and outrage over the nudity of the figures led breeches and loincloths to be painted over some of the figures. At one stage the entire fresco was nearly white-washed. Working so close to Michelangelo, does he feel the presence of the genius? 'Ah, yes' he sighs deeply. He is familiar with every brush stroke. 'I've known him for so long . . . even before I started this project, when I first came to work at the Vatican (in 1960) I was given the task every year of dusting the Judgement. Even then I was taking photographs, trying to understand his extraordinary technique.' In his office in the bowels of the Vatican museum he has a blow-up photograph of the 'Judgement' as he calls it affectionately. Covered with coloured stickers and numbers indicating the work schedule, it looks like one of those German Christmas cards with windows to open for each day until Christmas. Colalucci puts in at least four hours a day on his 'Judgement'. Mindful of the physical ravages wrought on Michelangelo producing this masterpiece, was this not a gruelling project for a man of 62? 'Last year I began to feel a few aches in the back for the first time. But I have been helped a lot through keeping fit because I go to a gym.' He chuckles quietly over the casual way he entered his chosen career. 'I don't come from a family of artists.' His father was a famous sports journalist. He himself was an indifferent student and entered the world of art restoration through a chance meeting with a leading restorer. However, he says he realised that being brought up in Rome surrounded by a vast accumulation of ancient monuments imbued him with a natural sense of culture. 'It is part of my character to enter into the past.' He is a great believer that Culture cannot only be acquired through learning and books. 'There is also an intuitive element which comes from deep inside you. This makes you feel the work of art closer, and treat it in a familiar, not a reverential, way.' When he decided to enter the Rome Restoration Institute in 1949 he was one of only five students - 'Now there are queues waiting to get in.' His first job was a one-month stint in Sicily which turned into an unexpected stay of seven years during which developed an expertise restoring early paintings on wood. Parts of Sicily then were like a return to the 18th century. He recalls driving round the island in a Fiat 500, coming across priceless paintings which sacristans had sought to embellish with olive oil, others retouched by enthusiastic amateurs. When the Vatican was looking for new blood in 1960, he was recruited for his skills with wood. He eventually moved on to fresco work by virtue of the Vatican possessing 90 per cent of its painting in the form. This becomes obvious as one walks with him through the endless painted corridors, halls and rooms to the Sistine Chapel. (From the museum entrance to the Chapel it is nearly a kilometre). What is the secret of a good restorer? 'For me the important thing is not necessarily the iconography of a work of art but to understand how it is painted, the choice of colours, the movement of mass . . . it is like understanding the structure of a piece of music.' It is the natural approach of a craftsman and he does not wish to be distracted by academic debate over, say, the identity of a saint. He talks often of restoring paintings to the original 'text for a proper reading'. Modern restoration, he says, is in essence based on 'a great respect for the original and minimum interference. Everything done to present the work, providing the damage is not too visible, is carried out in such a way so that you can see the original. In the past there was a lot of retouching and too much reconstruction of what was missing and damaged.' He feels that attitudes in Italy differ towards restoration because there is little money and so much to restore, whereas many rich countries have little to restore. Is one not intimidated by approaching something so immense and so well known as the Sistine Chapel? 'My experience on wood, which is a much more delicate medium, has helped enormously in my work on the Sistine chapel. The mentality of a restorer of paintings on wood is very special - the work does not permit experiment, you cannot take short cuts: you need to be very clear-headed . . . You cannot make mistakes. Frescos, on the other hand, were often done by large numbers of people and are executed generally on a grand scale on big spaces. 'However, restoring Michelangelo requires all the techniques used for wood-based painting work because his painting is so refined, so delicate - and so well known. You need the mentality of someone used to working on the square centimetre.' The restoration presented special problems because he says Michelangelo changed techniques often. Technically it has been difficult both to remove the glue varnish, which over time had left scales, and to return to the original colours while all proper conservation procedures were observed. Does one also need to jump the centuries and get inside the mentality of the artist? ' As a man he left nothing, but one can see as an artist he was extremely severe with himself and with others. And I understand him: if a person possesses such talents he cannot get on with anyone else.' For Colalucci, the most painful aspect of the restoration has been the criticism directed against his work - because he is the first one to want to get it right. Can he ever therefore relax and feel no that mistakes have been made on a work which the world regards as one of its foremost art treasures, and which thousands queue to see every day? ' I fear being overconfident. I found it positive that people challenged what I was doing. The polemics could destroy me as a person and my work, but they could also act as a stimulus to improve. I never undervalued any criticism even when I thought it stupid, and this has enabled me to be serene about all that's been said. I think I have been proved right.' The criticism has so far referred to the ceiling. Though the arguments are complex, one polemic was over the belief that Michelangelo had modified the original fresco with extensive glazing and additions in secco after the original work had dried. Others centred on the use of certain chemicals which it was feared might affect future conservation. Yet another complained that the restored colours simply looked too modern. One US critic even called the restoration a 'disaster'. Colalucci divides his critics into two categories. 'There are those who know a work of art as if it belongs to them, something they have learned from childhood, seen on a special trip or have studied - and they don't want it to change.' Looking with him at pictures of the 'before' and 'after', it is as though a fine grey veil has been peeled away from the ceiling. 'The main critics have in fact been painters because they have studied Michelangelo in a certain way, often from books - for them it is sacrosanct. I understand this, even I can have problems with an excellent restoration by a colleague in this way. But this is a sentimental reaction.' On technical aspects, he claims 'the challenge has come from persons who knew nothing about technique'. But he believes the polemic has subsided over the past 18 months, especially as the lighting has been corrected. He adds: 'It is not as if this has been done in-house, we have had a team of 18 internationally recognised experts monitoring the project.' But does he ever ask tourists what they think as he wanders around the chapel? 'No. I just listen to the comments.' These days many of the comments are in Japanese, as a sizeable proportion of visitors are groups from Japan. Japanese television has also paid Dollars 4m (about Pounds 2m) for the rights to film the whole process of restoration. How does he imagine the Japanese confront western art and Michelangelo's very personal interpretation of Christianity? 'I know well what it feels like to look at another culture from the outside; but what the Japanese think about this remains a mystery.' Indeed crowds, and the conservation issues raised by mass tourism, are an increasing problem for the Sistine Chapel. Often it is impossible to contemplate the frescos in reasonable tranquillity. Should limits be placed on the number of visitors? Should they be made to be content with replicas? Colalucci wryly observes that the replica of Michelangelo's 'Pieta' in the Vatican museum is usually treated with the same reverence and curiosity as the original in St Peter's, which is more difficult to see as it is behind glass. 'Works of art today are subject to stress but it's not just people in museums but pollution in general. Why should you deny people the chance of seeing these masterpieces? I think it would be impossible.' Is this restoration like repainting the Forth Bridge - once finished, one immediately begins again? 'No. This will last.'</p>

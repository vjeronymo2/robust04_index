Regional party committee Secretary Zhao Fulin delivered a  speech at the tea party in which he stated: Over the past year,  we in Guangxi have actively and comprehensively implemented the  spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress and the spirit of both  the Second and Third Plenary Sessions of the 14th CPC Central  Committee; seized each and every opportunity to speed up reform  and development under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and  scored noticeable results in all fields of endeavors.    Comrade Zhao Fulin stressed: We have scored these  achievements mainly because we have united as one and worked  hard under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council. The CPPCC organizations at all levels in Guangxi  also have made invaluable contributions to the region by  conscientiously carrying out political consultation and  democratic supervision. In addition, the regional branches of  various democratic parties, the regional federation of industry  and commerce, as well as patriotic figures without party  affiliation in the region also have actively played their  respective roles and done much fruitful work to this end.    After expressing thanks to all comrades concerned on behalf  of the regional party committee and people's government, Comrade  Zhao Fulin noted that the year 1994 is a crucial one in which  Guangxi will strive to accelerate reform and development, and he  called for concentrating on the following five aspects of work  in 1994: 1) To seize each and every excellent opportunity to  speed up reform; 2) To continually readjust industrial structure  and accelerate economic growth; 3) To continually make  painstaking efforts to build a link between the Southwest and  coastal areas, and further expand opening up to the outside  world; 4) To safeguard social and political stability, and  protect and mobilize enthusiasm among the broad masses of  people; 5) To further step up party building and clean  government building.    Comrade Zhao Fulin expressed the hope that the CPPCC  organizations, the branches of various democratic parties, and  the federations of industry and commerce at all levels across  the region will continue in 1994, as they have always done, to  support, cooperate with, and assist the party committees and  people's governments at all levels and make more contributions  to Guangxi's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization  drive.    Wu Keqing, vice chairman of the regional CPPCC committee,  delivered a speech at the tea party on behalf of the regional  branches of various democratic parties and the regional  federation of industry and commerce.</p>

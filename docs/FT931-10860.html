			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / The German Rate Cut: Smoke clears around the franc - France THERE was almost audible relief in the government offices and banking halls of Paris yesterday. French authorities have interpreted the German interest rate as a long-awaited sign that their bruising battle to defend the franc is over and that, sooner or later, the Bank of France should be able to signal a cut in interest rates. 'This is the signal we've been waiting for,' said a spokesman for Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy. 'It's definitely a step in the right direction,' commented an official at the Finance Ministry. The rate cut's timing caught many in the government by surprise, but they seemed convinced that the Bundesbank was on course for further reductions in the cost of money. 'Germany and the rest of Europe are now in the same stage of the cycle, with both inflation and economic activity weakening,' said another official in the prime minister's office. Further German rate cuts might be slow in coming, but 'at least the supertanker (the Bundesbank) has now changed course', said an Elysee official. The Paris stock market, which had been sluggish throughout the morning, greeted the Bundesbank announcement with an afternoon surge. It ended the day up by 1.66 per cent at 1,854. Meanwhile, the French franc closed at 3.379 against the D-Mark yesterday, against 3.391 on the previous day. The news of the German rate reduction came in the nick of time for France. The franc's resilience earlier this week after the devaluation of the Irish punt was hailed by French ministers as evidence that the currency was out of danger. But the battle for the franc has left France with high interest rates which are squeezing the economy in the run-up to next month's elections. There is also the threat of a further rise in bank base rates. The commercial banks are under intense pressure given that base rates at 10 per cent have been around 2 percentage points lower than market rates - which determine the banks' borrowing costs - since early January. Societe Generale estimates that this costs the French banking system an extra FFr50m a week. The German rate cut should give French officials the ammunition they need to persuade the banks that the pain will soon be over. 'It has certainly given France a breathing space,' said Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon Brothers. 'It should stop the banks from raising base rates, but the key question is whether it will be enough to produce a cut in official interest rates.' The reaction of the French markets yesterday suggested that there was no expectation of an immediate cut in interest rates. Short-term market rates remained steady with three-month money hovering between 11.75 and 12.25 per cent. On the political level, the Bundesbank move eases the pressure on Paris and Bonn to find ways of bolstering Franco-German monetary co-operation. With the Maastricht treaty still awaiting UK and Danish ratification, and with its monetary underpinning, the European monetary system, under such strain, experts in both capitals had been weighing new means of restoring impetus to monetary union.</p>

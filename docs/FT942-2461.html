			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Cyanide found in antibiotics French police are investigating how cyanide got into a bottle of antibiotic drugs, causing the death of a young girl, Laboratoire Bellon, the French pharmaceuticals company, which produces the drug, said yesterday. The company, a subsidiary of Rhone Poulenc, said the cyanide had been found in only one bottle of its Josacine antibiotic drug and that its presence was the result of a criminal act. It said, however, that it was taking the precautionary measure of recalling all bottles of the drug, which is sold in France, its overseas territories and some African and Middle Eastern countries.</p>

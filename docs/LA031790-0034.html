			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CHEAP PUBLICITY' STUNT SADDENS A FELLOW LAWYER  </P> <P> I am an attorney, an LMU alumnus, and was at the game when Hank Gathers died.  The LMU community had a special relationship with and respect for Hank.  </P> <P> There is no question that if someone contributed to Hank's death, that person  should be held responsible.  </P> <P> This last week has been difficult, but the Gathers family and LMU have handled  it with dignity. In contrast, I am struck by how inappropriate and distasteful  are the actions of the family's attorney.  </P> <P> To hold a news conference and make accusations before Hank is buried, before  the medical examiner's office releases its finding, before a majority of the  facts can possibly have been examined, and while the team and members of the  university are in Philadelphia is disgusting. There is no reason that any legal  action could not have waited several weeks or even a month or two. The only  possible reason for this timing is for the cheap publicity it offered the  attorney, which you provided by putting his picture on the front page of the  sports section.  </P> <P> It is no wonder my profession is held in such low regard. It made me sick to my  stomach.  </P> <P> JAMES G. MORRIS  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

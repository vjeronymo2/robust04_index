			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unitary councils will not spawn 'despised quangos' Sir, Mrs Pat Case, Conservative opposition leader of Lancashire County Council (Letters, January 6), complains that the Local Government Commission's moves to restructure local government are out of line with the Conservative government's transfer of responsibilities for health, education and waste management to trusts and company boards. Mrs Case also claims that replacing large and remote county councils like Lancashire with smaller, all-purpose unitary councils will spawn a system of 'despised quangos' because the new authorities will have to work together on some functions such as strategic planning, county archives and the lord lieutenancy. If Mrs Case despises quangos so much, she would do well to understand what a quango is. My dictionary says a quango is a quasi-autonomous national government organisation - in other words, a body which can more or less do what it likes and derives its existence and power from national government. That sounds to me like a perfect description of the health trusts and opted-out school governing boards which Mrs Case seems to like so much. Conversely, it does not fit at all the handful of joint arrangements, overseen by locally-elected councillors, which the new unitary authorities will need. Replacing the present system of separate county and district councils with unitary councils will put right the mistakes of the 1974 reorganisation, eliminate waste and an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy, save money, be more responsive and accountable and, as commission chairman, Martin Easteal, says, produce a structure which can take back powers from the quangos. The real threat to local democracy and to ordinary people's ability to control their local services comes precisely from those quangos - and not from the pending reorganisation. John Wilson, chairman, Lancashire District Councils, Town Hall, Chorley, Lancashire</p>

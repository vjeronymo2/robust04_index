			<p>BFN     [Text] The Crimean parliament continued today the debate on  the status of the Crimean Supreme Council deputy. Members voted  against the amendment requiring them to be guided in their work  not only by the law, but by their conscience. They also  rejected the amendment requiring them to take an oath of loyalty  to the people of Crimea. However, the majority voted to allow  deputies to carry personal weapons.</p>

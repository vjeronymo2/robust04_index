			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rights and sale plan from Stakis next week STAKIS, the hotels, nursing home and casino group, is expected to announce both a rights issue and the sale of its nursing home division when it presents its results next Thursday. The company, where Sir Lewis Robertson took over as rescue chairman in early 1991, is believed to have returned to around break-even before tax in the year to September 30 1992 against a loss of Pounds 47.4m. However, it still has about Pounds 200m of debt owed to 21 banks. A plan to sell its casinos had to be abandoned when Stakis failed to achieve a suitable price. Stakis has rationalised the management of its hotel operations and sold peripheral leisure activities under Mr David Michels, its chief executive. However, it still needs to reduce debt. Ashbourne Homes, its nursing home subsidiary, operates 18 nursing homes profitably, but also has 19 sites for new homes which would cost about Pounds 50m to develop. Stakis should be able to reveal an agreement to sell Ashbourne Homes next week. The company is also expected to announce a rights issue under which shareholders would be offered one new share for either three or four existing shares. Stakis's market capitalisation is about Pounds 105m so the rights issue could raise up to Pounds 35m.</p>

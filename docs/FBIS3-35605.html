Up to 10,000 incidents are registered annually of border  violations and illegal fishing in Russia's economic zone by  Japanese fishing boats. The latest in a series of similar  violations took place on January 21 and 22 following illegal  entry into the Russian territorial waters of Kunashir Island  (Southern Kurils) by dozens of Japanese trawlers.    Commander of the Russian Coast Guard Rear-Admiral Kudinov  described the action as "planned and coordinated."    The Governor of Sakhalin believes that Russia's military  strength in the Southern Kurils is just what it should be and  does not upset the regional balance of forces or pose any threat  to each other's security. He says any diversion will cause  nothing but an extra source of international tension.    Krasnoyarov says that any reduction in Russia's regional  presence is taken by Japanese poachers as "an invitation to  dinner." The redeployment of an air force regiment from Iturup  Island has immediately led to an increase in the number of  border violations, he said.    The same applies to the problem of Russian military presence  in Sakhalin. The Chief of Staff of the Russian Armed Forces  does not rule out military cutbacks to save money needed for the  upkeep of troops deployed in the island. However, the Governor  says the redeployment of troops in mainland Russia will cost the  government "a bunch."    Krasnoyarov is determined to try to defend his position  before the Federation Council (Senate) and the government. On  informing Tokyo about Russia's strength in the Far East, he said  such openness was possible only on a mutual basis. Any  unilateral demand of this kind, he said, "is not at all  acceptable to Russia as a sovereign state".</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Bingo clubs help Rank to Pounds 96m THE RANK Organisation achieved only a slight reduction in net debt in the 28 weeks to May 15, to Pounds 1.09bn, 60 per cent of which is at fixed interest rates of nearly 9 per cent. But there are no current plans for a rights issue, Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, said yesterday. 'We would like the level of our indebtedness to be a bit lower,' he added. 'But it's an entirely manageable position, we're not going to rush things'. The scrip dividend offered shareholders yesterday will add to the equity base but that was not the motive for it. The interim pre-tax profit rose to Pounds 95.7m from Pounds 19.8m, restated from Pounds 94m, a year earlier. Turnover rose from Pounds 935.5m to Pounds 969.9m. Trading profit from continuing operations was Pounds 66.2m (Pounds 64m) and overall trading profit was Pounds 66.4m (Pounds 66.1m). Earnings per share were 14p (restated losses of 7.6p). Recreation trading profit rose to Pounds 32.7m (Pounds 29m) on turnover of Pounds 363.4m (Pounds 348m). Social and bingo clubs were buoyant while casino profits rose on the back of a strong performance in London. Film and television trading profit fell to Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 7.2m) on turnover of Pounds 307.5m (Pounds 287m). Holiday and hotel profits fell to Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 13.6m) on turnover down from Pounds 153.6m to Pounds 150m. The group said weaker results from hotels, particularly in London, had contributed to the fall. Of the profits reduction, Pounds 2m had come from hotels now sold. The outlook for the holiday side was more encouraging for the second half, with bookings up 9 per cent. Trading profits from leisure rose from Pounds 15.8m to Pounds 22.3m on turnover of Pounds 135.3m (Pounds 107m). Hard Rock Cafe and the nightclubs improved results. Net borrowings were Pounds 1.1bn, Pounds 74m lower than last year.</p>

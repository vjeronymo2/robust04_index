			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Letter: Throwing new light on an old word Sir, I read with interest the letter from Michael Connors (April 21) on John Diebold's recent talk of 'the need for a new word: 'infostructure' '. Connors points out to us the astounding coincidence that he independently crafted this word back in 1992 and cites his use of it 'throughout' his 1993 book as evidence. Well this amazing fact can be amplified since by even more amazing coincidence this word has been 'independently' crafted by scores of others. One such amazing coincidence is Karen Levitan's 1987 book Government Infostructures (Greenwood Press). Others include P. Zurkowski's 1984 Integrating America's Infostructure in the Journal of American Society for Information Science and Forest and Woody Horton's 1982 Understanding US Information Policy: the Infostructure Handbook. Connors also might phone Infostructures Inc. in one of their offices in Rockville or Potomac, Maryland, or in Hallandale, Florida, to talk about this neologism. Of course, it might be cheaper to phone Infostructures Ltd. in Birmingham, England. Charles Wankel, associate professor of management St John's University, New York, US</p>

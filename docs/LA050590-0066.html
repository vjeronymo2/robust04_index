			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> JOFFREY MOUNTS AN ALL-ARPINO PROGRAM AT CHANDLER PAVILION  </P> <P> All-Arpino programs by the Joffrey Ballet are scarcely news -- but the  three-part bill at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on Thursday seemed in danger  of proving historic. For all anyone knew at the time, this might have been the  final performance of any Gerald Arpino ballet by the company he co-founded.  </P> <P> After resigning as artistic director on Tuesday, Arpino had issued a statement  through his lawyer prohibiting the performance of any of his works as of  Friday. Two Arpino works are scheduled for Saturday's performance. Attorneys  for both sides were conferring Friday afternoon in an attempt to reach a  settlement.  </P> <P> In any case, a company in crisis is something to see. This was a night of  virtually faultless dancing, an assertion of spirit and prowess despite the  circumstances -- and, inevitably, despite the choreography.  </P> <P> Normally a blur of dancers running and jumping through dappled light, "Suite  Saint-Saens" (1978) suddenly acquired some potent afterimages: the noble calm  of Douglas Martin in the opening section, for example, or the playful  flamboyance of Carole Valleskey in the finale. Edward Stierle, of course,  jumping madly -- but also moments when Peter Narbutas, Deborah Dawn, Tyler  Walters and others filled Arpino's emptiest adagios with deep feeling.  </P> <P> If Jerome Robbins' faun met Frederick Ashton's Ondine under a pier some night,  you'd have "Sea Shadow" (1962), an adagio to Ravel with lots of rippling limbs  and stylized gymnastics. Valerie Madonia and Tom Mossbrucker couldn't exactly  make the liquid posturings look profound, but they danced with great surety,  and pianist Stanley Babin accompanied them sensitively.  </P> <P> The new "TWO-A-DAY" extravaganza featured several major cast changes from the  previous evening. A listless Jill Davidson led the boys through the top-hat  ensemble, Deborah Dawn slinked expertly through the Spanish sequence and, best  of all, Jodie Gates gave the Marilyn Miller impersonation a childlike sense of  wonder.  </P> <P> John Miner and Allan Lewis shared the program's conducting duties, with the  orchestra sounding especially fine in "Suite Saint-Saens."

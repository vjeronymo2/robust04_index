			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: Monumental primitivism - William Packer admires the wit and strength of Paolozzi's sculptures Our sculptor knights seem a hale and hearty lot. We celebrated Sir Anthony Caro's 70th birthday earlier in the year with the show at Kenwood of his suite of monumental new works, The Trojan War. Now it is the turn of Sir Eduardo Paolozzi with a small but choice retrospective, most appropriately the first of the two to appear at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, for he is its patron. A much more ambitious project had been mooted, for the Sculpture Park can happily embrace the largest monumental works and Paolozzi has never been afraid to work on a monumental scale. (His latest big commission, 'The Wealth of Nations' for the Royal Bank of Scotland, has recenlty been set up in Edinburgh.) Small this survey may be, in both actual size as in number, but while it may seem a pity that the larger scheme should have been scotched, in the event it proves a blessing. Huge works are naturally impressive, but they tend to be impressive for themselves: they hold the attention by their scale and physical presence, but as single and isolated creatures. Here, set out on the hillside among the trees, there are enough works of a middling size to represent that open-air and monumental aspect. Most are welded stainless-steel pieces from the mid-1960s and early '70s, industrial in their processes, material and references. I remember them as seeming pretty big at the time. But with the emphasis on smaller works - the studies and maquettes alongside the substantive pieces on a human and domestic scale - we find ourselves considering the unity of the oeuvre as a whole. Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose: and with Paolozzi, as with so many other artists, despite superficial shifts and changes in interest and practice, the essential preoccupations seem instinctively, intuitively, to remain the same. The hand, the eye, the informing sensibility, do not change. Take the group of heads that fills the Park's Bothy Gallery. Among all Paolozzi's myriad magpie enthusiasms, that for toys and games and puzzles stands very high, especially those that come apart, or break, or show their insides. It has always been the putting back together, twisting and refitting the elements, mixing them up and getting them purposefully just wrong and out-of-kilter, that seems to fascinate him most. All the heads, the recent self-portraits especially, demonstrate this approach, sliced apart and the bits jammed incongruously together. And here is the earliest head of all, 'Mr Cruikshank', a portrait head of 1950, cleanly modelled and entire, yet with its potential for segmentation clearly inferred by the vertical and horizontal contours that mark its sections. It could have been made yesterday. Paolozzi has been a major force and influence in British art for nearly 50 years and yet more recently, while he has been impossible to ignore, he has been made to seem something of a marginal figure, critically awkward if not actually incorrect. Fashion has had a lot to do with it. It was bad enough to remain even remotely figurative in the work, and his, with his towers and monsters, was always founded in humane experience. And then the literary and philosophical, technological and scientific reference with which the work is dense made it so hard to categorise. Acknowledge the quality of his surreal invention by all means, and his particular role as a pioneer of British Pop Art, but that was then: safer now, in a tidier age, to push him critically aside. This subversive little show quite dismisses those safe and tidy assumptions. Rather, it restores Paolozzi to the central position which in truth was always his, from the time when he was in Paris just after the war and bringing together the formal simplicities of Hepworth and the organic surrealism of Picasso and Giacometti. The Park's Pavilion Gallery shows it all in a stimulating, unchronological mix of early, middle and late. How strong it is, the work of the 1940s and '50s with its gleeful, monumental primitivism, and how consistent the work has remained, in the vitality of its invention and its formal strength alike, to this day. We must never forget the simple truth, that good artists do go on, and what they go on doing is making good art.

			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: WRONG TURNS PUT WAYWARD MEN ON THE MAP  </P> <P> I'd like to destroy the myth that women can't read a road map and men, on the  other hand, are endowed with a great sense of direction.  </P> <P> A schoolteacher from Stevensville, Md., has asked that I settle the dispute  once and for all. She teaches children how to read road maps, and yet her  husband charged, "Put you in a phone booth, Joan, turn you around, and you  couldn't find your way out of it." Her retort is, "What about Christopher  Columbus?"  </P> <P> Yeah, what about Christopher Columbus? Turn the guy around in the Bahamas a  couple of times, and he couldn't find America if it was on fire. And he can't  blame it on a woman reading the navigational charts!  </P> <P> And while we're illuminating some of the gems of direction, let us not forget  Douglas Corrigan, a pilot who in 1939 climbed into his monoplane in New York  headed for California. Twenty-four hours later, he looked out and, instead of a  palm tree, saw Dublin's airport. Did people say to him, "Is figuring out east  and west too hard for you?" No, they gave him a hero's welcome.  </P> <P> Men are always pointing out their great explorations. The truth? They were lost  half of the time. Burton and Speke didn't know if they found the source of the  Nile or a new strain of mosquito. Dr. David Livingstone just sort of "stumbled  onto" Victoria Falls.  </P> <P> In 1531, when Pizarro and his troops went to Peru to relieve it of its gold, a  hundred maidens escaped and found refuge in a secret hideaway, Machu Picchu.  The women found it, but Pizarro didn't have a clue where they were hiding. In  fact, it took 380 years for it to be rediscovered.  </P> <P> And, of course, no argument on bearings would be complete without mentioning  Roy Riegels. Maybe his is not a household name, but sportsmen and history will  remember him as the player for the University of California who blew the 1929  Rose Bowl for his team by galloping into the sunlight with ball in hand for a  total of 70 yards -- to reach his own goal line.  </P> <P> The trouble with all of these men is that they didn't ask. The stubbornness of  explorers probably set this country back 400 years. That and the fact they  wouldn't listen to their wives.  </P> <P> Men just have to learn to trust us. As my friend Joan wrote, "Where would men  be today if Eve hadn't helped Adam find his way out of the Garden of Eden?"  Isn't that the truth?  </P></p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Observer: Roll over Carnegie The UK economy must be on the mend - judging by the number of new (ad)ventures being started by Peter de Savary, the buccaneering yachtsman-cum-businessman who found the last recession more heavy going than most. Last week Observer reported that de Savary, who was pipped at the buoy in the 1983 America's Cup by Australia's Alan Bond, was planning to invest upwards of Dollars 1.5m on a boat to take part in a new international race being planned by the super snooty Royal Yacht Squadron and the New York Yacht Club. Now comes news that he is planning to reopen the 100-room Skibo Castle, Andrew Carnegie's old home in the Scottish highlands, as an upmarket leisure resort. The local enterprise council has chipped in Pounds 0.5m towards the Pounds 15m that de Savary is planning to spend on upgrading the property to the style the US steel magnate is accustomed to when entertaining the likes of Edward VII and the Rockefellers. It will, of course, have a few extra facilities such as a fully equipped gymnasium, golf course and beauty therapy centre. No word yet on the cost of membership, but de Savary is planning to milk the great steel man's name for all it is worth by christening his latest baby the Carnegie Club.</p>

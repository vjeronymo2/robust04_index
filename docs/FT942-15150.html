			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's It has been a mixed week for long-suffering Lloyd's Names. The High Court accepted that members agents responsible for mis-selling risky investments should take responsibility for subsequent losses. While that ruling is welcome, it could be difficult for most Names to prove that they were similarly misled. Neither does the judgment have much impact on the larger body of legal actions, which claim negligence among managing agents and underwriters. For most Names, the chances of winning financial redress through the courts have changed little. More worrying is the growing number of managing agents cancelling Names' participations in profitable syndicates. If it turns out that private investors are being eased out to make way for corporate investors, Names will lose the opportunity to cover past losses with future profits. It is too early to be sure what is happening. Managing agents are concerned about rule changes being considered by Lloyd's management. They say that giving notice to Names leaves them greater room for manoeuvre. But until pre-emption rights are introduced, probably next year, Names have little protection. Even then, Names will have to fight for their rights to any future profits. The new rules may allow agents to turn their syndicates into, in effect, insurance companies at Lloyd's. But how the equity in such companies would be divided between the managing agent, which provides the expertise, and those who supply the capital remains an open question. The issue of ownership will be hotly contested in the coming months.</p>

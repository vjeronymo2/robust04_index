			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE PROBE CLUES LINKING VICTIMS OF S.F. SHOOT-OUT  </P> <P> A gunman who killed a prominent attorney and then was slain by police in an  office shoot-out was closing his gospel ministry in the building after saying  he was ill, a building spokeswoman said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "He had given his notice a couple of weeks ago that he was going to be vacating  the premises," said Denise Spisak, assistant manager of the James Flood  Building, where the shooting occurred at about lunchtime Tuesday.  </P> <P> "He said he was not well -- that's why he was going," Spisak said.  </P> <P> Norman Wadsworth's telephone service also had been cut off for his Living  Gospel Outreach office on the third floor of the historic building.  </P> <P> Police say Wadsworth shot Garfield Steward outside the attorney's sixth-floor  office, then was killed in a gunfire exchange with police after he went back  down to the third floor. Two officers received minor gunshot wounds.  </P> <P> Police theorize that the 64-year-old Wadsworth, who lived in San Leandro, was a  disgruntled casual friend of Steward, 75, of San Francisco.  </P> <P> "Apparently the relationship had soured when some legal settlement went awry,"  Police Inspector Earl Sanders said.  </P> <P> Jasmine Wadsworth, daughter of the gunman, didn't comment on her father's  health. But she said he had been angry because he had paid Steward $13,000 to  handle a 1983 divorce but then had to go to another lawyer to complete the  case. Wadsworth had been unable to get back his money, she said.  </P> <P> Steward's son, Daniel, said Wednesday that he wasn't aware of any dispute over  money between the two.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WINLESS LAGUNA BEACH GIVES ORANGE A SCARE  </P> <P> In a Pacific Coast League opener, Orange High School (4-1-1) barely escaped its  homecoming night with a 7-6 victory over Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> "It was an ugly win, but we'll take it," Orange coach Tom Meiss said. "Maybe we  all underestimated Laguna Beach." The Artists (0-6) took the lead on the  opening possession of the second half when Sean Mallett caught a 10-yard  touchdown pass from Aaron Scheid.  </P> <P> After drawing two delay of game penalties while deciding whether to try for one  or two points, Laguna Beach's conversion kick sailed wide.  </P> <P> The Panthers took the ensuing kickoff and marched to the Laguna Beach 20. On  4th and 12, Gregg Campbell made a diving catch of Chris Thompson's pass in the  corner of the end zone to tie the game, and kicker David Knorr made the  conversion to give the Panthers the victory.  </P> <P> "We only made one mistake tonight," Laguna Beach Coach Lyman Olney said , "and  it cost us the game."

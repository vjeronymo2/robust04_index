			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Fear of sharing a bed with the 'Russian elephant': Concerns about Moscow's political dominance may lead to a 'two-tier' CIS WHEN THE heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States meet in the Belarus capital of Minsk on Friday, they must agree a charter for an organisation that has been in crisis since its inception. They will probably fail. While economically the CIS member states are deeply intertwined and heavily dependent on low energy prices from Russia, politically they lack the will and administrative structures to develop co-operative institutions. The challenge will be to reconcile the demands for a downgrading of the commonwealth into the loosest of alliance - from states such as Ukraine - with calls for a strengthening of the organisation and the fulfilment of its decisions to date - from Kazakhstan and other central Asian republics. The charter proposes a range of agreements to co-ordinate economic, foreign and defence policies - with common control of the external borders of the CIS and a common defence policy, both overseen by a new council of defence ministers. Free movement of goods, capital and labour between CIS members operating a common economic zone would be mandatory, and a governing body located in Minsk would be empowered to impose sanctions on states which did not observe the charter. On Monday, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, said Ukraine would resist any attempt 'to turn (the CIS) into a supra-national body subject to international law'. Mr Kravchuk sees the draft charter of the CIS, prepared for the Minsk summit, as just such an attempt. In an interview in Izvestia earlier this month, Mr Kravchuk said that 'we must realise that we are sharing a bed with an elephant (Russia): if it rolls over it can smother us'. However, Mr Narsultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, intends to demand in Minsk that the CIS be strengthened. Speaking after a meeting two weeks ago of the five Central Asian republics in the Uzbek capital of Tashkent, Mr Nazarbayev said that these states 'will support a common rouble zone'. Mr Askar Akaev, president of Kyrgyzia, said at the same meeting that 'it's important that the CIS become a functioning organisation, and not just a formal one'. But not all the central Asian leaders seem to agree. Mr Saparmurad Niyazov, president of Turkmenistan, said in an interview with the Interfax news agency that new CIS co-ordinating bodies were 'unnecessary' and that a rouble zone was impossible. 'How can one speak of a rouble zone when in different villages the value of the rouble is different?' Russia, the 'elephant' of the Commonwealth, is torn both ways. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, speaking last week, said that 'many experts now say that we (Russia) should move to world prices for energy (sales to CIS) right away' - but added that, because of the disruptive effects on Russian industry, the move would not be taken immediately. 'A standard approach of moving to world prices should not be expected,' he said. The interdependence of the Commonwealth means that no change in one state is without costs to others. Above everything else, decisions taken by Russia on oil supplies and their price go to the very heart of the other CIS countries' increasingly shaky economies - especially heavily industrialised Ukraine. Ukraine had been used to consuming some 60m tonnes of oil a year - some 86 per cent of that from Russia. Its efforts to diversify its sources of supply have been limited in success: only one deal, with the National Iranian Oil Company, to supply 80,000 barrels of crude a day, has been reportedly signed, but nothing so far has been delivered. In talks with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, last week, Mr Kravchuk received a vaguely worded promise of 20m tonnes a year from Russia, essentially on a barter basis: this was better than the 15m originally offered, but will mean desperately hard times for Ukrainian oil users. The proclaimed success of the Russian-Ukrainian talks is itself ambiguous. Though an oil deal was done, and though a guarantee from Russia of nuclear protection to Ukraine will - according to Mr Kravchuk - make it easier for the Ukrainian parliamentarians to ratify the treaty with the US on strategic arms reduction (Start), this was a bilateral deal, not one which strengthened the CIS. As Mr Kravchuk said on Monday, the 'specific questions' which the states must address are matters for individual negotiation, not for general agreement. The death of the CIS has been much mooted in the past year, as it became clear that none of the member states were willing to make serious efforts to render it effective and that the needs of nation-building in each state were driving them apart rather than together. It is possible that a break may occur in Minsk - but more likely that a 'two-tier' CIS will emerge, with an inner and outer core. In the inner core would be Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzia and Uzbekistan; and in the outer core, Ukraine, Turkemistan and Moldova (though this state has never ratified the CIS agreement). Azerbaijan, formerly a member of the CIS, has effectively left it, and Tadjikistan, also a member, is presently in the grip of civil war and it is unclear what position it will take when stable government is restored. Georgia, where civil war also rages, has never participated in the CIS, though it may decide to join the 'outer core': while the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania would be unlikely to join even that. Yet even this is unlikely to be stable - so pressured are all of these states and so drawn to make ever-closer relationships with states outside of the old USSR on their external borders. The long dissolution seems set to continue.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   ECONOMIC INDICATORS FOR CIS STATES         Jan-Aug 1992 percentage change over same period 1991.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    GNP      Ind    Retail  Consumer    Wages*                          output               sales   Prices*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Russia           -20.0    -16.6     -42.5      1060     651.0 Ukraine          -12.0  -19.7**     -25.0      1014     530.0 Belarus          -15.0    -14.2     -28.3       820     605.9 Moldova          -22.5    -29.1     -55.0      1060     403.2 Azerbaijan       -21.8++  -21.8     -65.0       810     326.4 Armenia          -44.7    -50.3     -74.0         -     193.5 Kazakhstan       -20.3    -14.4     -41.0       620     511.9 Uzbekistan       -20.5     -9.8     -40.1       410     338.8 Kyrgyzstan       -25.2    -21.7     -64.0       840     332.7 Tajikistan           -    -17.1     -68.6       790     266.0 Turkmenistan     -10.5    -23.7     -35.8       570     459.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Aug 1991-Aug 1992. **Jan-Sep 1992 over same period 1991. ++ Jan-June 1992 over same period 1991 Source: CIS Committee for Statistics; Radio Free Europe.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

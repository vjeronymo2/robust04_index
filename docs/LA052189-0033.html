			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A CASE OF JUSTICE FOR ALL  </P> <P> Roger Simon's writing is the greatest, but a statement he made on May 5 must be  corrected.  </P> <P> He said ". . . Tower can't get on the Supreme Court. He is not a lawyer.  Otherwise, Bush probably would put him there."  </P> <P> The truth of it is that there are no legal qualifications for the post of  Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. You don't have to be a lawyer, just get  yourself appointed by the President.  </P> <P> No justice before the 20th Century even had a law degree. Oliver Wendell Holmes  Jr., appointed in 1902, was the first to have one.  </P> <P> Perhaps Bush shouldn't read this or John Tower may become the shortest justice  after all.  </P> <P> BENSON SMITHKIN  </P> <P> Camarillo  </P></p>

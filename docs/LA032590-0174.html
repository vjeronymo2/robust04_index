			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LOCKOUT MAY NOT HURT LOADED ROYALS  </P> <P> If anybody can find anything good in the lockout that shortened spring  training, it might be the Kansas City Royals.  </P> <P> The Royals opened camp belatedly this week with a lineup that is virtually set  after a winter flurry of deals. The only competition is in center field, where  Jim Eisenreich is pushing Willie Wilson for the starting position after being  named Royals player of the year in 1989.  </P> <P> "That's not to say we can be cavalier," General Manager John Schuerholz said of  the three-week spring session leading up to the April 9 opener in Kansas City.  </P> <P> "We're not in the position of some other teams that have to make major  decisions. But we're going to have to pay careful attention to our players,  keeping close watch on their conditioning to make sure they don't push  themselves too fast and injure themselves."  </P> <P> The Royals, the first team ever to sport the two reigning Cy Young winners on  the same roster, are convinced they can win the American League West after  finishing seven games back of Oakland last year.  </P> <P> "We think we have a very legitimate chance to be a championship team,"  Schuerholz said. "We're focused on 1990 and that's our commitment."  </P> <P> The Royals made a huge commitment to free agents for the first time in their  history, signing National League Cy Young winner Mark Davis to a $3 million  contract along with Storm Davis.  </P> <P> Richard Dotson was also signed to be the fifth starter, and Kansas City traded  Charlie Leibrandt to Atlanta to get Gerald Perry as designated hitter.  </P> <P> The signing of Mark Davis teams him with American League Cy Young winner Bret  Saberhagen, who was virtually unhittable in the last month of last season.  </P> <P> The Royals clubhouse now is occupied by players making widely divergent  salaries. Mark Davis, a newcomer, is now the highest paid player on a team that  includes such Royals veterans as George Brett and Frank White as well as  Saberhagen.  </P> <P> Brett, the franchise player, created a stir in January when he complained the  Royals were not paying enough attention to him and that possibly he should be  traded if the Royals would not renegotiate his contract.  </P> <P> The Kansas City first baseman later called reporters to his home in an unusual  session and apologized for the remarks, saying he and Royals owner Ewing  Kauffman had reached an understanding.  </P> <P> The Royals also have an arbitration loser in Bo Jackson, and Eisenreich settled  for $475,000, about half of what he was seeking in arbitration.  </P> <P> "In my view, it's not a problem," Schuerholz said. "I'm not going to say that  there are not professional egos in place. But these guys know the free agent  system was created by them for their benefit and if some of their brethren are  able to take advantage of it momentarily they know they will maybe have a  chance to benefit in the future."  </P> <P> Brett said he also believed the team would come together.  </P> <P> "Once they get down there with the guys and start playing baseball, I think  they'll be thinking baseball," Brett said. "We have too much to lose to let  petty jealousies affect us."  </P> <P> On the field, the Royals will lead with what could be the strongest pitching  staff in the league.  </P> <P> Saberhagen finished 23-6 last year to set a Royals record for victories. He led  the league with a 2.16 earned run average, 12 complete games and 262 1/3  innings.  </P> <P> Saberhagen is followed by fastballer Mark Gubicza, a 15-game winner last year,  and Tom Gordon, who won 17 despite a late-season slump. Gubicza says he has  recovered from a shoulder injury that bothered him late last season.  </P> <P> Storm Davis is penciled in as the fourth starter to be followed by Dotson.  </P> <P> The Royals traded their only left-handed starter, Leibrandt, for Gerald Perry.  Perry, who will be the designated hitter, says he has recovered from a shoulder  injury.  </P> <P> One of the effects of signing Mark Davis to be the closer was strengthening the  middle-relief corps. Steve Farr and Jeff Montgomery, both right-handers, move  down as set-up men for Davis after each saved 18 games last season.  </P> <P> The infield is set with Brett, who drove in 80 runs after missing 35 games with  a knee injury, at first, White at second, Kurt Stillwell at short and Kevin  Seitzer at third.  </P> <P> Eisenreich may get the nod in center after batting .293 last year while playing  all three outfield positions. He drove in 59 runs and stole 27 bases.  </P> <P> Wilson had his fifth straight disappointing season, hitting just .253 in 112  games. Since he batted .301 in 1984, Wilson has hit .278, .269, 279, .262 and  .253 while drawing criticism for not walking enough in his leadoff position.  </P> <P> Jackson, who made a memorable throw to cut down a runner at the plate in  Seattle last year but had another second-half slide, is in left and Danny  Tartabull, still with the team after all those trade rumors, is in right.  </P> <P> Venerable Bob Boone signed to catch a 17th season, although Manager John Wathan  may want to work in Mike Macfarlane for seasoning.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yoram Kohen] </F>   [Excerpts] Mass demonstrations against the peace agreement  were held today in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The  demonstrators also called for the release of all Palestinian  prisoners. Violent clashes between Hebron residents and  soldiers took place today against the background of the growing  tension surrounding the prisoner release. Our correspondent  Yoram Kohen reports:    What may have looked like just another demonstration for the  release of all the Palestinian prisoners was actually more than  that. Today's demonstrations in Jericho were really a protest  against the peace process. This afternoon, over 2,000  supporters of the rejectionist organizations, mostly from George  Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP],  gathered to protest the Gaza-Jericho First agreement while  demanding the immediate release of all Palestinian prisoners.  The demonstration marched uninterrupted down the town's main  streets. Palestinian policemen were prepared for the event but  did not intervene.    Earlier, after Friday prayers, hundreds of Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] supporters demonstrated in the town for the  same reasons. The Hamas activists, however, had a different  slogan. They shouted that Islam is the solution. [passage  omitted]    Residents of the Gaza Strip also demonstrated today over the  prisoner issue. The demonstrations have been held every day for  a week now. The rally was organized by the PFLP. The residents  are furious with the Palestinian leadership and claim it  capitulated to Israel on this issue.    Nabil Sha'th said today that the negotiations on the release  of those prisoners who still remain in jail will start at the  beginning of next week. Up till now, approximately 1,300  prisoners have refused to sign a commitment to stop terrorist  activity. [passage omitted]</p>

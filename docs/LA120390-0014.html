			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIKINGS IMPRESSIVE IN FIFTH STRAIGHT WIN;  </P> <P> NFC: CARTER SCORES ON 56-YARD FLEA-FLICKER PLAY TO KEY 23-7 VICTORY OVER THE  PACKERS.  </P> <P> The Minnesota Vikings struck quickly in the third quarter Sunday and stayed in  the hunt for a playoff berth with a 23-7 victory over the Minnesota Vikings.  </P> <P> Wide receiver Anthony Carter highlighted a 17-point outburst by scoring on a  56-yard flea-flicker play that helped the Vikings (6-6) get their fifth  consecutive victory and pull even with the Packers (6-6) in the NFC Central.  Green Bay's loss clinched the division title for the Chicago Bears (10-2).  </P> <P> The Packers took a 7-6 lead three minutes into the third quarter when Tiger  Greene blocked Harry Newsome's punt then grabbed the ball and ran 36 yards for  a touchdown.  </P> <P> A 41-yard field goal by Fuad Reveiz put the Vikings ahead, up 9-7 with 2:57  </P> <P> left in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Minnesota forced a punt and, on the next play, Viking quarterback Rich Gannon  handed off to Herschel Walker, who pitched back to the quarterback. Gannon  heaved the ball downfield even though Mark Lee had tight coverage on Carter.  </P> <P> Carter leaped and tipped the ball away from Lee and, as he was falling into the  end zone, grabbed the ball for a 16-7 lead with 54 seconds left in the quarter.  </P> <P> Carter made a similar catch, also a 56-yarder, to key a 27-22 victory over  Denver in the game that launched Minnesota's winning streak.  </P> <P> "I don't know if another receiver can make that catch," Gannon said. "In fact,  I didn't think anybody could make that catch and I have a hard time thinking  that A.C. could make that catch again."  </P> <P> On the Packers' possession after Carter's catch, Anthony Dilweg was sacked by  Al Noga, who knocked the ball away from the quarterback and recovered in the  end zone with three seconds left in the third quarter. That capped Minnesota's  17-point spree in a 2:54 span.  </P> <P> The loss, only Green Bay's second in its last eight games against Minnesota,  ended a three-game winning streak. The Packers are seeking their first playoff  berth in a non-strike season since 1972.  </P> <P> "It would be nice to be two games ahead of these guys but now we're tied,"  Green Bay Coach Lindy Infante. "We took a step backward but we're not out of  it."  </P> <P> The Vikings appeared to be out of it five weeks ago, when their fifth straight  loss dropped them to 1-6. Only the 1970 Cincinnati Bengals have made the  playoffs after a 1-6 start. Instead, the Vikings have hopes of making their  fourth consecutive postseason appearance.  </P> <P> Dilweg, playing for injured Don Majkowski, threw three interceptions, fumbled  twice and was sacked five times for 41 yards.  </P></p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Architecture: Daring to be different - The career of Theo Crosby It takes courage to be different, especially if you are an architect trained in the 1930s but interested in much more than dogmatic modernism and the narrow world of contemporary architecture. Theo Crosby, who died last week, was a gentle genius who loved architecture, design and communication. It is hard to think of many other architects of his generation who worked so hard to restore architecture to its broader base and to develop links between the members of a polarised profession. He was born in South Africa in 1925. When he came to England in the 1940s he worked with leading modernists Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry, and later Denys Lasdun. He was always interested in the architectural debate and, as technical editor of the influential magazine Architectural Design, combined writing and design work. It was his interest in communicating and discussing architectural ideas that made him so much broader and wiser than many of his colleagues. His journalism was often original and always questioning. He also saw the value of exhibitions - the Whitechapel Art Gallery exhibition This is Tomorrow, held in 1956, was a crucial show that demonstrated how modern architecture could change the world. Theo Crosby saw through much architectural dogma, and the varied highlights of his career show that he was a fast mover, able to put his own stamp on a wide range of projects. He was the leader of Taylor Woodrow's design team for the reconstruction of London's Euston station in the early 1960s, although I don't think he was ever happy about the demolition of the Euston Arch or some of the political decisions that influenced the design. His British pavilion at the Milan Triennale in 1964 won a major prize and led to more work for the British pavilion at the Montreal Expo of 1967. By the mid-1960s he had created a partnership with Alan Fletcher, Colin Forbes and Bob Gill. Under the name Pentagram, this was to become one of the world's leading design firms. It put architecture into context and pulled together all the design disciplines. Theo Crosby was always a benign presence in the firm's London offices, where his hospitality encouraged meetings and discussion groups. It was later in his career that some of his more maverick sides emerged in his architecture. There is a fascinating brick elevation, at the back of one of the Nash Terraces in Regent's Park, which is almost Victorian in its richness. He was chosen by Unilever to transform its London headquarters at Blackfriars and it is doubtful whether anyone else could have persuaded the company to embellish a building in the art-deco style. He even succeeded in commissioning larger-than-life-size sculptures for the parapet and to involve several artists in elements of the building, from the lift doors to the board room furniture. A project which preoccupied and fascinated him for a long time was the re-creation of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre on the banks of the Thames at Southwark's Bankside. With the late Sam Wanamaker, he persisted against the odds, winning friends and influencing people until his design could be built. Crosby's design is more than a 'wooden O' While it has the replica theatre at its heart it also has towers, balconies and crenellations which will give Bankside the humanity and richness it very much needs. The idea of the Globe appealed to Crosby as an extraordinary challenge to ensure scholarly authenticity while making the theatre work. He loved theatres. Before he died he was working on a project for a new small opera house near his home in Spitalfields. With his wife, the artist Polly Hope, Theo Crosby presented an annual summer opera or concert at their home - the sight of Theo in a pale blue silk kaftan remains a memorable one. Crosby led an inspired life full of creative energy: his design for the Globe must be completed. The sad thing is that his other London memorial had only just begun. He was commissioned (and welcomed the impossible task) to humanise and refurbish the interiors of the Barbican Centre. I pray that will continue. It will be Crosby's greatest victory over architectural dogma and bring colour and joy to the City of London's impenetrable concrete monster.</p>

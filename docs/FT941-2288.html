			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Rural stress seen in farmer suicides Stress, loneliness and de-pression are rife in rural communities and farmers have one of the highest suicide rates of any occupational group, a conference in Warwickshire heard yesterday. The suicide rate among male farmers and farm workers is 187 per million, compared with the national average of 110 per million. About 39 per cent of suicides use shotguns or other firearms, easily available on the farm. Only vets, who often share the rural isolation and have access to drugs, have a markedly higher level of suicides. The National Farmers' Union said: 'Farmers are up there with vets, dentists and pharmacists as the groups having the highest suicide rates.' The conference on rural stress, organised by a coalition including the NFU, the Department of Health, the agriculture ministry and the Samaritans, heard that causes included poor rural services, long working hours, unpredictable weather and a sense of having little control over the future of the farming business. The decline of agriculture has cut the farming workforce by more than half to 622,000 in the past two decades. The NFU said people were leaving the land at an average of about 6,000 a year, putting added pressure on those who remained. The industry faced further change, with the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the conclusion of a world trade deal likely to lead to more production cuts and greater rural unemployment. Public opposition to the set-aside programme, under which Brussels pays arable farmers to leave some of their land idle to cut overproduction, was making things worse. The NFU said: 'They're seen as jolly farmers racing round the countryside in their Range Rovers not doing very much on the farm, and in most cases they're saying that's not true. The public doesn't understand the grim reality of farming.' The Department of Health is funding a two-year research project by Oxford University into the causes of rural stress and how it might be eased. Health professionals will be encouraged to learn more about the problems facing farming so that they can discuss these when they detect signs of stress.</p>

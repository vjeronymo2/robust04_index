			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIXER-UPPER ART;  </P> <P> WHY MANY CONTEMPORARY ARTWORKS ARE FALLING APART -- AND HOW CONSERVATORS ARE  FIGHTING BACK  </P> <P> Most visitors at "A Forest of Signs," at the Museum of Contemporary Art's  Temporary Contemporary facility in Little Tokyo, see an intriguing array of  ideas set forth in texts and objects. Art conservators see a mass of problems.  </P> <P> Yellow blotches have appeared on the faces of poets, philosophers and painters  in Mike Kelley's corridor of portraits, called "Pay for Your Pleasure."  </P> <P> Some of Cindy Sherman's photographs are rippled, a few so badly that  replacement prints had to be substituted for the ones originally sent to the  show.  </P> <P> Three vinyl panels in Gretchen Bender's "People and Pain," a neon-lighted work  based on 1988 movie titles, came unglued and fell off during shipping.  </P> <P> The paper on Mitchell Syrop's panels that borrow the advertising phrase, "lift  and separate," have themselves begun to lift and separate from their backing.  </P> <P> Jeff Koons' polychromed wood sculptures, less than a year old, were late in  arriving because they needed repairs, registrar Mo Shannon said.  </P> <P> What is the meaning of this? Is the art of our time falling apart?  </P> <P> In some cases, yes, and the implications are serious for artists who want to be  remembered, for collectors who pay ever-higher prices for contemporary art and  for museums charged with maintaining the art. Furthermore, the problem isn't  limited to artists' latest creations. Conservation problems plague the entire  field of contemporary art (the contemporary art period generally is defined as  1945 to the present).  </P> <P> Some of Robert Rauschenberg's most prized "Combines" from the '50s, for  example, are in need of serious attention. "Untitled (Man in the White Shoes),"  a 1955 Rauschenberg in MOCA's Panza collection, is undergoing an $18,000  conservation job ($11,000 of it paid for by a grant from the National Endowment  for the Arts).  </P> <P> The 7-foot-tall box-like construction, containing a stuffed chicken, gauze  curtains, a pair of men's shoes, an anonymous landscape painting and  autobiographical collaged elements (childhood drawings by Rauschenberg's son,  Christopher, and photographs of his family), requires a variety of conservation  skills.  </P> <P> MOCA has no staff conservator, so the museum has contracted four specialists to  do the work: Tatyana Thompson for the painted parts of the piece, Glenn Wharton  for the objects, Mark Watters for paper components and Sharon Shore for  textiles. Shore has already completed the job of cleaning the chicken, which is  now wrapped in plastic until the rest of the conservation is done.  </P> <P> Specialists trace contemporary art's conservation ills to the flowering of an  experimental approach to materials and techniques. "Before World War II,  artists' materials were limited. They painted on panel or canvas and there was  a limited number of sculpture materials. But since then, everything has become  fair game -- anything out of the garbage dump or the refrigerator," said Pieter  Meyers, head of conservation at the County Museum of Art.  </P> <P> Along with this liberated approach to the physical components of art came a  change of attitude. "In the '50s, Action Painting was de rigueur. If you spent  more than 30 seconds on anything you were overworking it," said artist George  Herms, describing some of his early works that were held together by a single  nail. His vintage assemblages of castoff materials were made to look old and  tattered.  </P> <P> Disdain for workmanship was a result of "growing up with the atomic bomb,"  Herms said. "The generation of artists who came to maturity knowing that we  could be blown up any minute didn't see much point in making art to last  forever."  </P> <P> Whether creating from a new sense of freedom or as a political statement,  artists in the last three decades have produced a proliferation of notably  impermanent art. And now that conservators must deal with these works, there is  no shortage of horror stories.  </P> <P> One well known case concerns five murals commissioned in 1961 for Harvard  University from Abstract Expressionist Mark Rothko. Because of unstable  pigments and overexposure to sunlight, the paintings began to fade almost as  soon as they were installed in the Holly Oak Center, a lounge for faculty and  administrators. Deterioration continued until first one panel and then the  whole set had to be removed.  </P> <P> "There's no expectation that these paintings will ever return to exhibition or  to permanent installation," said Richard Koshalek, director of the Museum of  Contemporary Art, who presented the Rothko case last winter at a conservation  symposium in Los Angeles. The loss of "a major set of post-World War II  paintings" (one that would be worth millions on today's market) is particularly  bitter because it occurred at one of the nation's most distinguished  institutions, he said.  </P> <P> Rothko is partly responsible for the Harvard disaster. He sometimes bought his  paints at Woolworth's and used egg whites for a medium and for surface effects.  But he wasn't alone in his cavalier use of materials. Hard pressed for cash,  fellow Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline often used  inexpensive house paint, which tends to shrink, crack and discolor on canvas.  Kline mixed thick paints that had different drying properties and used  incorrect proportions of medium and paint.  </P> <P> A subsequent generation of Color Field and stain paintings on unprimed canvas  has faded, sometimes changing color to an extraordinary degree, and exposed  fabric has yellowed and become dirty, according to Joseph Fronek, conservator  of paintings at the County Museum of Art. At work on "Cinema di Pepsi V," a  1966 painting by Frank Stella, Fronek explained that contemporary unvarnished  works have to be dry-cleaned with erasers or special solvents that don't wet  the fabric and cause it to expand or contract. Old Master canvases, on the  other hand, are covered with paint and sealed with varnish so they can be  cleaned with small amounts of water or organic solvents.  </P> <P> Problems can be even more severe when artists such as Pop master Claes  Oldenburg venture into highly unorthodox materials. Insects have attacked his  chocolate sculptures, and his fragile chicken-wire and plaster objects from the  early '60s are dirty and cracked, including those in MOCA's collection.  Oldenburg's "Giant Pool Balls," in the County Museum of Art's collection, has  been repainted twice -- most recently by a body shop that specializes in  painting luxury autos.  </P> <P> Such examples indicate a legacy of deteriorating art. It's a fact of life for  artists who favor unconventional materials and pride themselves on challenging  traditional notions about permanence and value. It's also a fact of life for  collectors who pay private conservators $50 to $100 an hour for their services.  </P> <P> But should contemporary art be allowed to rot in peace? Or is a massive  education campaign needed to awaken artists and collectors to a threat to our  cultural heritage? A series of interviews with artists, conservators and  collectors produced the following responses to these queries:  </P> <P>  -- Is the conservation of contemporary art a serious issue?  </P> <P> Conservators who breathe new life into damaged art and serious-minded  collectors agree that it is, but artists' opinions vary. "It's not a huge  concern for me. I'm more interested in spurring ideas," said Mike Kelley, whose  past exhibitions include entire walls of raw, unframed drawings. "When I was  young, I just used anything I had access to. Now I try to use paper that won't  discolor, but ephemeral material is part of the anti-heroicism of my work."  </P> <P> The banner-like portraits in "A Forest of Signs" were done to his  specifications by a house painter, Kelley said, and the yellowed portions are  the result of too much thinner mixed with the pigment. At first Kelley was  shocked by the discoloration, which occurred almost immediately, he said, "but  now it doesn't bother me. It gives a sense of age that's appropriate to the  subject."  </P> <P> "I think that all viewers should get the same ride," Herms said, explaining  that he wants today's audience to have the same experience of his vintage  pieces as people who saw them many years ago. The letters LOVE that appear on  his works are "a seal of approval," he said, and an indication that he wants  viewers 100 years from now to see the work as he created it.  </P> <P> Bruce Houston, who is best known for fragile assemblages made of tiny plastic  toys, has taken to enclosing some of his works in plexiglass boxes to avoid  breakage, though he believes that interferes with their sculptural quality. He  also worries about the durability of the plastic components. "Plastic cups on  the beach seem to last forever, but we don't really know how durable some of  these plastics are," he said.  </P> <P> "An artist has to weigh choices -- the effect of the moment against  permanence," said Alexis Smith, whose narrative collages are based on American  Pop culture and literature. That balance tends to change as an artist matures,  she said. "At the beginning when you are giving your work away, you don't feel  a big responsibility for making it last. But when people start paying  reasonable prices for it, you take more care so that you and they won't have  problems. I try to make things as well as I can, as archival as possible. I  don't skimp on materials or technology."  </P> <P>  -- When is conservation appropriate and how far should artists and  conservators go to repair damage?  </P> <P> "As soon as an artwork enters our collection, we have a big commitment to do  whatever we can to maintain the original intent of the artist," Meyers said.  That philosophy may indicate treatment, but "it also prevents us from doing all  kinds of things," he said.  </P> <P> It may even prevent the museum from calling in the artist, as it did last year  when conservators found a flaw on the surface of "Blue Curve III," a 1972  diamond-shaped painting. Meyers said: "Ellsworth Kelly loves to have perfect  surfaces. Even a thumbprint is an imperfection to him. He was very helpful and  repainted the piece. But now I have difficulty with it (Kelly's repair). How do  I know it is the same color blue, that the surface is exactly the same, that  there are not subtle differences? I would not do that again. I would leave it  the way it was, the way he intended it because Ellsworth Kelly in 1988 not the  same as Ellsworth Kelly in 1972."  </P> <P> "When I am called in to restore a work, I try to put myself in the spirit of  the artist who made the piece 30 years ago, but I usually break more than I  repair," Herms said. "I call it restoration comedy."  </P> <P> The crew working at MOCA on Rauschenberg's "Combine" has no intention of  putting the piece in pristine condition. Their cleaning and repairs will be  "consistent with the artist's presumed intention," according to a prepared  statement. Self-destruction is often built into contemporary art in the form of  incompatible materials, said Wharton, a member of the MOCA team. The best that  conservators can do in such cases is "to help the art live a little longer," he  said.  </P> <P> The rule of thumb for conservation is that all treatments should be reversible  and that the artist's intentions at the time of creation should be honored.  Conservators say that the best thing a museum can provide is a stabile  environment, one in which temperature and humidity are constant. "We can't stop  deterioration, but we can retard it because we have an ideal environment. The  problem is more difficult for smaller institutions and private collectors,"  Meyers said.  </P> <P>  -- Are experimental methods and materials the only source of conservation  problems?  </P> <P> Absolutely not.  </P> <P> A lack of knowledge about -- or concern for -- safe display and storage is a  major cause of damage to contemporary art, conservators agree.  </P> <P> "There's almost a total absence of knowledge on how to treat, preserve and  store works of art" on the part of both individual and corporate collectors,  Meyers said. "Most banks and other corporations that collect art have no  conservators and don't know how to store art."  </P> <P> Interior design also conflicts with conservation, according to Meyers. "The  airy, light styles of today's houses are disastrous for contemporary art,"  which often contains unstable dies that fade easily in sunlight, he said.  </P> <P> "Poor packing and shipping is a big killer of artworks," Smith said, citing  another frequent complaint.  </P> <P> Exhibitions, particularly those that travel from place to place, take a big  toll on artworks. There's a limit to how many times, say, Frank Stella's  painted metal constructions can be dismantled and reassembled without weakening  them. When that sort of wear is combined with faulty packing and handling, the  results can be disastrous.  </P> <P> Collector Robert H. Halff, who often loans art to exhibitions, said that it is  not unusual for loaned works to be damaged and that the problem is more likely  to come from shipping and handling than the artist's workmanship. Known as a  generous donor and lender, he said that some works in his collection are now  too fragile to travel.  </P> <P> Loans -- and even damage -- can produce good stories, however. One of Halff's  past loans had a funny twist that he likes to tell visitors to his collection.  An insect was stuck in the wax surface of his prized Jasper Johns' encaustic,  "Figure 7," when Halff took it to Art Services to be specially framed for  Johns' retrospective. Assuming the bug to be an intruder, Halff asked Manny  Silverman of Art Services to remove it, but Silverman (who now has his own  gallery) thought Johns might have put the insect in the art and intended it to  stay.  </P> <P> Halff contacted Johns, who said no, encaustic attracts bugs, so Silverman  removed the visitor. But when Halff got the piece back from the exhibition a  tiny piece of encaustic had chipped off exactly where the insect had been. "I  call it 'Memorial to the Bug,' " Halff said.  </P> <P>  -- What's the solution to the conservation of contemporary art?  </P> <P> There's no quick fix, but a heightened awareness could lead to prevention of  some of the most serious problems, conservators say.  </P> <P> One hopeful sign is that conservators are building up experience in working  with unorthodox materials. LACMA conservator Sharon Blank, for example, is a  biochemist whose expertise in plastics has been in demand on everything from  Barbie dolls and Tupperware to sculpture by Russian modernist Naum Gabo. At  LACMA, she has worked on an Edward Kienholz assemblage and Charles Frazier's  "Anno Domini 1962," a globe covered with plastic toys.  </P> <P> Some conservators suggest that art schools might do more to educate their  students about conservation, but artists often disagree. "There's a danger of  making the work too precious before that's appropriate," Smith said.  </P> <P> "When I teach at UCLA, we destroy everything at the end of the quarter," Herms  said.  </P> <P> "An artist should have an awareness of using proper materials, what paints are  stabile, what technology to use. But there's no way to limit materials, to have  a conservator's stamp of approval," Meyers said.  </P> <P> While it's his business to be concerned about conservation, Meyers maintains a  philosophical distance. "If we can't take out imperfections without changing  the art, we have to change the way the public looks at art. Remember that we  are not seeing Rembrandt's paintings the way Rembrandt painted them, but we  still enjoy and appreciate them. The greens in Dutch 17th-Century paintings  have turned brown, but our eyes have adjusted. It should be just as easy to  adjust to changes in contemporary art."  </P> <P> Herms injected a bit of humor into an otherwise worrisome situation: "I think  we need cryogenics for art. The solutions to these problems will be discovered.  In the meantime we should freeze the art."  </P></p>

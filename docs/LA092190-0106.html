			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Donald Trump Misses Payment on Airline: The financier hopes to delay payments  on $245 million in loans for his Trump Shuttle, after already missing a payment  of $1.1 million, a top aide said. Trump and two assistants have met with  officials from Citibank, asking the bank to restructure debt payments on the  shuttle, which provides service on the Boston-New York-Washington corridor.  </P> <P> Like other airlines, the shuttle has been hurt by rising fuel costs and a  slowing economy. Citibank officials "have been very encouraging so far in  helping us through these problems," said Stephen Bollenbach, chief financial  officer of the Trump Organization. He was one of the Trump officials who  participated in the meeting. Citibank declined comment, citing the  confidentiality of its dealings with customers.  </P></p>

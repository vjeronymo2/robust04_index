The statement follows media reports from  the past two days which quoted Ukrainian Ambassador Volodymyr  Krzhanitskiy as saying "the first trainload of nuclear warheads  has already arrived in Russia from Ukraine."    The embassy said the only thing the ambassador mentioned in  recent interviews was that "plans are under way to transfer  missile units for subsequent destruction in Russia."    The statement describes media reports about the "first  trainload of warheads" as an attempt at rushing things.</p>

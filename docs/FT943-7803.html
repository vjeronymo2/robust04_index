			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Taxing US dividends Am I correct in making the following assumptions? 1. That stock dividends in foreign companies - in this case, US companies - are, in effect, the equivalent to bonus scrip issues in the UK. 2. That when a US quoted company does a share split - through issuing, say, a one for one stock dividend - there is no liability to UK income tax. 3. That that there is no liability to US tax for the US stock dividends. The answer to your questions is yes. The term stock dividend (or scrip dividend) is used in the UK to mean an issue of bonus shares as an alternative to a cash dividend, generally speaking. The usage in the US is different. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

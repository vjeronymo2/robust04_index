			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P>  ONE PLAY'S TOO HEAVY, ANOTHER'S A SOUFFLE;  </P> <P> 'OUT OF THE FRYING PAN' COOKS UP A LOAD OF LAUGHS  </P> <P> There's good news for patrons of the Way Off Broadway Playhouse. For one thing,  the small theater in Santa Ana finally has put in real seats to replace those  makeshift jobs that were such a pain, literally.  </P> <P> That's not the best news, though: After suffering through several weak, even  embarrassing productions since it opened in late 1987, Way Off Broadway has a  show it can be pleased about.  </P> <P> As the first offering in its second season, the company has taken Francis  Swann's seldom-staged 1930s screwball comedy "Out of the Frying Pan" and has  plumbed its harebrained wackiness. The result is an overacted, overheated show  that is a kick from the start.  </P> <P> Director Tony Reverditto realizes that "Out of the Frying Pan" is the kind of  play even someone with a barely responsive EEG will have no trouble  understanding, so he immediately tosses subtlety aside. This production comes  at you with bad accents and dopey situations, silly gags and infectious  performances.  </P> <P> Swann couldn't have put a lot of thought into the plot: What we get is six  frisky young actors, an even mix of boys and girls, sharing a New York  apartment that just happens to be above the flat of a big-deal Broadway  producer.  </P> <P> The kids' scheme, see, is to rehearse one of his murder mysteries in their  apartment and then finagle him upstairs to see a performance. Amazed by their  talents, he will sign them for his next show.  </P> <P> Right. Of course, everything goes wrong. First, a blue-blooded friend (Layce  Gardner) of the resident birdbrain (Brenda Beals) comes a calling. She finds  the living arrangement, uh, peculiar. Then the birdbrain's stuffy politician  father makes an entrance. Yipes, better hide the boys. Then the eccentric  producer (Richard Flin) gets involved. Then the cops drop in. . . .  </P> <P> It may not sound like much, and, guess what, it isn't. But Swann does fill most  scenes with enough knuckleheaded gags to keep things moving. Some scenes romp  better than others -- the busy nonsense with the police is not that funny --  but the show tends to work when the roommates get to interact.  </P> <P> The performances can't be called original. In fact, most are straight-up swipes  of pretty familiar characterizations -- Gardner's snob, for example, is a  dead-eye incarnation of Miss Hathaway from "The Beverly Hillbillies" -- but  they are amusing nonetheless.  </P> <P> Beals does the generic dumb blonde (sometimes she's Marilyn Monroe in  "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," other times she's more like Jean Kasem's Loretta of  "Cheers") with cute results. Michael Kemp's Norman, the pumped-up, Brooklyn  wise guy, could be any one of the Bowery Boys. Michelle Fashian as the wry Kate  could be doing just about any Southern belle/smarty-pants, maybe a young  Tallulah Bankhead.  </P> <P> Cathleen Cullen is a natural for the role of the sweet ingenue Marge and  Michael Gaffney has some of the most fun as the mincing, always-hungry George.  Shawn Smyth as Marge's husband and Terri Schmidt as the landlord are also  commendable.  </P> <P> As usual, the production values are flea market utilitarian: standard blue  blazers with upturned collars pass for police uniforms, that kind of thing. But  that's OK, too.  </P> <P> 'OUT OF THE FRYING PAN'  </P> <P> A Way Off Broadway Playhouse production of Francis Swann's comedy. Directed by  Tony Reverditto.

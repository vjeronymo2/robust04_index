			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Ivanidze: ``Greenpeace More Worried </F> About Russia than Atomic Energy Ministry'']    [Excerpts] Apparently, a train carrying the spent nuclear  fuel from the Finnish nuclear power station has now arrived  successfully in notorious Chelyabinsk-65, despite all the  efforts by members of the international environmental  organization Greenpeace to prevent it from doing so. [passage  omitted]    ``We will take it and bury it. If we fail to fulfill the  agreements concluded by the government no one will speak to us.  We are obliged to take spent nuclear fuel from the Finnish  nuclear power station (not waste) until 14 May 1999. The  agreement does not stipulate burial, but the USSR pledged to  take the fuel and it was up to it what it did with the fuel,''  Mr. Vishnevskiy [Yuriy Vishnevskiy, chairman of the Russian  Federation Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation  Safety] said.    Strange as it may seem, the date of expiration of the  agreement, as indicated by the Federal Inspectorate chairman,  does not coincide with the one announced last year by Finnish  Trade and Industry Minister Seppo Kaariainen. According to him,  shipments of spent nuclear fuel to Russia would cease in 1996,  when the agreement expired. Who is telling the truth?    Nonetheless, no agreement has ever committed Russia to  taking  waste from other countries, according to Viktor  Danilov-Danilyan, Russian Federation minister of ecology and  natural resources. France and Britain, the main processors of  nuclear fuel in Europe, ship all the nuclear waste to the  countries that placed the orders for processing, thus creating  the waste. But, incredibly, nuclear waste from other countries'  fuel is being buried in Russia.    Incidentally, some days ago Mr. Danilov-Danilyan handed over  an engineering project to his Norwegian colleagues for them to  study and finance. A large part of it relates to the  construction of a burial site on the Kola Peninsula.    ``The burial site is intended primarily for radioactive  waste  produced in Russia itself, and for the waste that has already  accumulated. In particular, on the Kola Peninsula. It is  stored in such a way that it can in no way be regarded as  satisfactory from the ecological viewpoint,'' the minister told  IZVESTIYA.    Answering my question about the possibility of importing and  burying nuclear waste from other countries in the future, Viktor  Ivanovich suddenly stopped choosing his words carefully and  ominously stated: ``Who knows?''    The specter of the Atomic Energy Ministry that lay behind  this ominous statement manifested itself on television screens  at the end of last week in the shape of Georgiy Kaurov, who made  the following statement: ``The Greenpeace organization is  trying to impose its own, non-Russian viewpoint on us. It is an  international viewpoint, that of the mafia that engages in  antinuclear lobbying.''    It appears that the officials from the Federal Inspectorate  have finally lost touch with reality and are treating everyone  as a complete idiot. One of Finland's Swedish-language  newspaper, in its 20 April 1994 issue, cites Mikhail Sharov,  representative of the ``Mayak'' Production Association, who went  to Finland to monitor the loading of the train with spent  nuclear fuel.    ``In 1993 Finland paid $400 for each kilogram of spent  nuclear fuel taken by Russia,'' the representative of the  ``Mayak'' Production Association, or Chelyabinsk-65, told  Finnish journalists.    So the Atomic Energy Ministry received $11.6 million for the  latest trainload alone. For similar processing in Britain the  Finns would have paid two and one-half times as much, as prices  stood two years ago. In addition they would have gotten back  all the solid and liquid waste from the processing of their  nuclear fuel, including contaminated equipment, instruments,  means of personal protection, packaging, special clothing and  footwear for workers, and many other almost new items.    Incidentally, if the Atomic Energy Minuistry were ever to  curb its greed and try to return the nuclear waste, even then  some of it would remain in Russia. The nuclear fuel processing  technology at the ``Mayak'' Production Associaiton is such that  practically all the medium-active liquid waste is still  discharged into nearby reservoirs.</p>

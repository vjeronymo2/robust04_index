			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Shaky consumer confidence holds back US store sales MANY OF the biggest US retail groups yesterday reported same-store sales increases for June that fell below the rates of improvement in April and May, while some retailers suffered a sales decline, suggesting that consumer confidence is still shaky. The Limited, a specialty clothing chain, startled Wall Street by posting a 4 per cent fall in comparable store sales for the month ended July 4. The company's share price fell Dollars  5/8 to close at Dollars 19 7/8 in New York, having earlier touched a 52-week low of Dollars 19 5/8 . The Limited's total sales increased 9 per cent in the five weeks to Dollars 585.3m. However, the Gap, another specialty clothing retailer, saw same store sales advance 5 per cent while overall sales rose 18 per cent to Dollars 242m. Wal-Mart, the aggressively-expanding discount chain which is the biggest US retailer by sales, turned in an 8 per cent advance in same-store revenues compared with June 1991. The company's total sales climbed 23 per cent over the previous year to Dollars 4.28bn. Rival discount chain K mart reported a 2 per cent advance in comparable store sales and an overall rise of 7.2 per cent, to Dollars 3.52bn. Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, blamed the slim sales increase on unusually cold weather in May and June. He added that there were two fewer days of pre-Independence Day sales in 1991, and the company's reporting period ended on July 1 this year compared with July 3 a year earlier. The cool weather also hurt comparable domestic store sales at Sears Roebuck, the Chicago-based stores and catalogue group, which fell 2.6 per cent. The company said gains in clothing and home office equipment sales were offset by a decline in air conditioning and related equipment in June. Overall, sales slipped 1.7 per cent to Dollars 2.13bn. However, JC Penney, the department store and catalogue group, said a successful Father's Day fuelled strong clothing sales. It reported an 11.2 per cent increase in comparable store sales while total sales rose 11.4 per cent to Dollars 1.47bn. Other mainstream department store groups managed single-digit sales gains. Dayton Hudson saw same-store sales rise by 2.1 per cent, while May Department Stores managed a 3.3 per cent improvement and domestic comparable store sales for Woolworth edged 0.6 per cent higher.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Nato considers Bihac weapons exclusion zone: Troop mobilisation prompts US action The US and its Nato allies are considering establishing a heavy weapons exclusion zone around the Serb-besieged Bosnian town of Bihac, the US Defence Department said yesterday. The possibility of such a zone has been raised as forces loyal to Mr Fikret Abdic, the ousted Moslem leader of the Bihac enclave, are being mobilised to join a Serb offensive against Bihac, UN officials reported yesterday. American officials added privately that the US had raised the issue and that the allies, at a meeting of Nato ambassadors in Brussels, had agreed to look into the proposal, which could allow allied air power to prevent Serb forces from overrunning the Moslem-held Bihac enclave in north-west Bosnia. 'There have been discussions of the North Atlantic Council on the possibility of an exclusion zone around Bihac. No decision has been made. These consultations and discussions are continuing,' said Mr Ken Bacon, the defence department spokesman. But he would not confirm that the US had raised the issue with the council, Nato's political arm. Other US officials said that Washington had indeed raised the possibility with the allies of establishing a 10km heavy weapons exclusion zone around Bihac. 'It is one of a number of suggestions that has come up for how to deal with the situation there, and I'd rather not be more specific about it now,' Mr Bacon said. 'There are a whole series of options you could think of. An exclusion zone is one.' UN spokesman Mr Michael Williams, speaking in Sarajevo, said: 'Our estimate is that Mr Abdic is presently mobilising a force of at least 5,000 from refugee camps.' Bosnian Serb forces are reportedly closing in on Bihac. Mr Williams yesterday confirmed they fired seven Sam anti-aircraft missiles at the Bihac area on Monday. About 30,000 civilians and soldiers loyal to Mr Abdic fled the Bihac pocket, designated a UN safe area, last August after being defeated by Bosnian government forces. They lived under difficult conditions in Serb-held lands in Croatia when Zagreb refused to let them cross into the self-styled Serb state. Local Serbs have re-armed Mr Abdic's soldiers, apparently preparing an assault from Croatia, which borders the Bihac pocket.</p>

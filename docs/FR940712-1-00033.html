			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the decline following World War II, on March 11, 1967 (32 FR 4001), the Secretary of the Interior listed bald eagles south of the 40th parallel as endangered under the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966. The northern bald eagle was not included in that action primarily because the Alaskan and Canadian populations were not considered endangered in 1967. On December 31, 1972, DDT was banned from use in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1973, the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) was passed. Among other provisions, it allowed the listing of distinct populations of animal species and the addition of a new category, ``threatened.'' The Act defines an endangered species as a species that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A threatened species is defined as any species that is likely to become an endangered species (but is not in danger of extinction) throughout all or a significant portion of its range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A nationwide bald eagle survey by the Service and a number of other agencies and conservation groups in 1974 revealed that, in parts of the northern half of the lower 48 States, bald eagle populations and reproductive success were lower than in certain southern areas. Thus, in 1978, the Service listed the bald eagle,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Haliaeetus leucocephalus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (no subspecies referenced) throughout the lower 48 States as endangered except in Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Washington, and Oregon, where it was designated as threatened (February 14, 1978; 43 FR 6233).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Restoring endangered and threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again viable, self-sustaining members of their ecosystems is the main goal of the Endangered Species Act. Thus, the Act contains recovery as well as listing and protection provisions. To effect recovery, section 4(f) of the Act provides for the development and implementation of recovery plans for listed species. According to the Act, a recovery plan is a plan for the conservation and survival of the species. It identifies, describes, and schedules the actions necessary to restore endangered and threatened species to a more secure biological condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In establishing a recovery program for the species in the mid-1970s, the Service divided the bald eagles of the lower 48 States into five recovery populations, based on geographic location, termed Recovery Regions. A recovery plan was prepared for each population by separate recovery teams composed of species experts in each geographic area. The teams set forth goals for recovery and identified tasks to achieve those goals. Coordination meetings were held regularly among the five teams to exchange data and other information. The five recovery regions and the dates of their approved recovery plans are as follows: Chesapeake Bay (1982, revised 1990); Pacific (1986); Southeastern (1984, revised 1989); Northern States (1983); and Southwestern (1982). The last two plans are under active revision and expected to be available for public review within the next 12 months. Many of the tasks described within these recovery plans have been funded and carried out by the Service and other Federal, State, and private organizations. Annual expenditures for the recovery and protection of the bald eagle by public and private agencies have exceeded $1 million each year for the past decade (Service files).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the 16 years since it was listed throughout the conterminous 48 States, the bald eagle population has clearly improved. The improvement is a direct result of the banning of DDT and other persistent organochlorines and from recovery efforts. In 1963, a National Audubon Society survey reported only 417 active nests in the lower 48 States, with an average of 0.59 young produced per active nest. In 1993, about 4,000 occupied breeding areas were reported by the States with an estimated average young per occupied territory of 0.93. Compared to 1974, for example, the number of occupied breeding areas in the lower 48 States has increased by 408 percent, and since 1990, there has been a 32 percent increase. The species is doubling its breeding population every 6&hyph;7 years since the late 1970s.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- J.L. Viljoen, South  Africa's ambassador to the Republic of China [ROC], opened  Taiwan voting in his country's first all-race elections when he  cast his ballot at 7 a.m.    All citizens and permanent residents of South Africa above  the age of 18 residing or traveling here are eligible to vote at  Taipei's polling station, Viljoen said.    The polling station, located at the South African Embassy on  Tinhua North Road, will remain open until 7 p.m. Tuesday [26  April], he added.    Although a few hundred South Africans have already cast  their  ballots, the envoy said he did not know how many voters will  turn out for the one-day vote.    In order to ensure the poll's fairness, the South African  government invited Chou Nien-tzu, a researcher at National  Chengchi University's Institute of International Relations, and  Arlene Lang, a U.S. citizen, to act as observers at the Taipei  polling station.    All the ballot boxes will be sealed and transported back to  South Africa via express delivery for vote counting, which will  begin on April 29, Viljoen said.    The South African polls, which will elect the president,  National Assembly, nine governors, and nine regional assemblies,  opened Tuesday morning and will continue through April 28.</p>

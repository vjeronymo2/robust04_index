			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FORMER W.VA. GOVERNOR JAILED 5 YEARS FOR PUBLIC CORRUPTION  </P> <P> Former West Virginia Gov. Arch Moore was sentenced today to five years and 10  months in prison and fined $170,000 on his pleas of guilty to five counts of  public corruption.  </P> <P> The sentence was handed down by Special Judge Walter Hoffman less than 24 hours  after an unsuccessful bid by Moore to withdraw his guilty pleas to five federal  corruption charges.  </P> <P> Hoffman ordered Moore to report to the minimum-security federal prison in  Petersburg, Va., by July 31.  </P> <P> The 10-month sentence for obstruction of justice was added on to four  concurrent five-year terms for mail fraud, extortion and two income tax  charges. Moore, a Republican and the state's only three-term governor, could  have received maximum sentences of 36 years in prison and $1.25 million in  fines.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Joe Savage told the judge that Moore has refused to accept  full responsibility for his actions by failure to give the government complete  information on $100,000 in illegal campaign contributions used in the 1984  campaign. Savage said Moore has only given information concerning $20,000 and  has refused to say where the rest of the monies came from.  </P></p>

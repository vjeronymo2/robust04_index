Tian Jiyun, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC  Central  Committee and vice chairman of the National People's Congress  Standing Comittee, delivered a speech at the meeting. Li  Lanqing, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central  Committee and vice premier of the State Council, cabled his  congratulations.    Tian Jiyun said: What is the fundamental reason that after  15 years of reform and opening up China has made great strides  in successfully accomplishing its first phase strategic  objective and is presently advancing toward the goal of being  comfortably well off? My personal experience tells me that it  boils down to one thing, namely, the results of reform and  opening up and delegation of authority and invigoration carried  out since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee and carried out under the guidance of the theory of  socialism with Chinese characteristics advanced by Comrade  Xiaoping. Adherence to this idea is also crucial to continuing  our triumphant advance and to realizing our second and even  third phase strategic objectives. We must fully understand that  the transformation to a market economy [xiang shichang jingji  zhuanbian] is an extremely arduous process; dificulties,  obstructions, and complications will be unavoidable. We must  take note of and cherish the initiative of the central and local  governments, all trades and professions, and the broad masses of  cadres and people, which we had a hard time arousing over the  past dozen years. He pointed out: We should follow the course  set for us by Comrade Xiaoping, making the transformation to a  socialist market economy, and in a down-to-earth manner, working  steadily and making solid progress, strive to build socialism  with Chinese characteristics.    In his congratulatory telegram, Li Lanqing, member of the  Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier  of the State Council, said: I hope that this conference will  contribute to deepening the study and understanding of Comrade  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and to further carrying out the decision of the  Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and  that it will play a positive role in deepening reform and  promoting development.    This conference was jointly sponsored and convened by the  China Market Economy Association, the Guangdong Provincial  Federation of Societies for Social Sciences, and the Shenzhen  Municipal CPC Committee. Wang Jue, chairman of the China Market  Economy Association, presided over the conference. The experts  and scholars in attendance held lively discussions on thoroughly  understanding and earnestly carrying out Comrade Xiaoping's  thought on socialist market economy.</p>

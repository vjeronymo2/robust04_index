			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has told AL-NAHAR  that investigations into the church bombing are taking their  natural course. There are no doubts regarding the measures that  have been taken or regarding the fairness and honesty of the  judicial system. The media should not pressure the judiciary,  because investigations continue and justice will inevitably take  its course. The prime minister added: The authorities must  adhere to all the measures that are taken. The judiciary must  be given enough time to investigate the minute details. This is  why the issue is proceeding according to judicial protocol and  within the authority of the law. Answering a question, he said:  Attempts to destroy the security and political situation in the  country are directed at the whole country's unity and civilian  security. But these attempts have not succeeded, praise be to  God, he said.    In an interview with AL-DIYAR, Prime Minister al-Hariri  announced that the Cabinet will meet on 23 March. He noted that  the results of investigations into the Zuq Mikha'il explosion  will be announced when a decision is made. He said the  deployment of the Army in two Lebanese Forces positions is  linked with the investigations into the church bombing. He  added that all the steps taken proceed from the judicial  stipulations followed in the Lebanese state.    Al-Hariri said there is complete cooperation among the  executive authorities and their various organs as well as  understanding over the methods of handling this situation in  accordance with the legal bases and laws.    The prime minister continued: We are facing real dangers  from Israel, which is lurking in the shadows. He said the  current situation is crucial. It is now time for us to stand  alongside our country. It is time for citizens to stand beside  Lebanon. We know the true direction of the compass --  reconstructing Lebanon and continuing the march of development.  My belief in Lebanon is great. Despite the very difficult  times, my belief has never waned. We will continue to rebuild  and grow, to rebuild the state, the prime minister said.</p>

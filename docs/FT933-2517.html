			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Scheme to finish Dockland properties A NEW SCHEME to rescue bankrupt properties in London's docklands has been announced following the news that the largest collapse, Canary Wharf, may come out of administrative receivership at the end of October. Investment advisory group Matrix Securities is to try and capitalise on renewed interest by investors - due to a possible underground extension and a proposed Pounds 1.1bn bank rescue package - with the launch of a Pounds 95m trust. The Matrix South Quay trust plans to finish developing three buildings opposite Canary Wharf by using enterprise zone tax concessions - available for buildings started before the area's enterprise zone status ended in 1992. Investors will be able to subscribe for units in the trust by providing Pounds 325 for each Pounds 1,000 invested. The balance of Pounds 675 will be provided by Hill Samuel, the merchant banking arm of TSB in the form of a loan. Matrix says that a 40 per cent tax payer should receive a tax break of Pounds 395 for each Pounds 1,000 invested, which means a paper profit of Pounds 67. The minimum investment is Pounds 25,000.</p>

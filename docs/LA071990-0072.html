			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOMEFED CORP. REPORTS $108-MILLION LOSS IN PERIOD  </P> <P> Blaming deteriorating real estate markets in California and other states,  HomeFed Corp. on Wednesday reported a $108-million loss for the second quarter  after adding sharply to its loan-loss reserves.  </P> <P> The San Diego-based parent of HomeFed Bank also said it will shut down  virtually all of its loan operations outside California except in Nevada  because of a rising tide of bad loans in other states. At a press conference  Wednesday, President Robert F. Adelizzi admitted that HomeFed's out-of-state  "diversification" was a mistake.  </P> <P> The magnitude of the loss for the quarter ended June 30, which compares to a  $28.1-million profit for the same quarter last year, came as a surprise to an  industry which by and large views HomeFed as one of the industry's  better-managed thrifts. Thanks to a strong balance sheet, HomeFed's capital is  still above the minimum levels required by regulators.  </P> <P> Thrift analyst Allan Bortel at the Sutro &amp; Co. securities firm said the  HomeFed loss was "an incredible hit," but added that the S&amp;L "may very well  be over-reserving . . . to clear the air. Big baths usually work because it  means that in future periods your loss provisions are negligible."  </P> <P> The loss was the direct result of $234 million in additional loan-loss  provisions -- which are charges against earnings -- that HomeFed set aside for  the quarter. Adelizzi said the provisions were warranted after HomeFed's  nonperforming assets ballooned during the quarter to $708 million, or 3.73% of  total assets, up from $454 million, or 2.5%, as of March 31.  </P> <P> The bad loans were identified during a special review, conducted during late  May and June, of all HomeFed loans over $2 million. The review was prompted by  an alarming increase in bad loans in April and May when nonperforming assets  increased by $40 million and $81 million, respectively. In June, bad loans  increased by $133 million.  </P> <P> Adelizzi said the loan review was "management driven" and not done at the  insistence of regulators.  </P> <P> HomeFed stock closed Wednesday at $19 per share, down $1.75, in New York Stock  Exchange trading. Word of the loss was disclosed after the market had closed.  </P> <P> HomeFed's misguided foray into out-of-state lending was responsible for most of  the S&amp;L's problem loans, Adelizzi said. Although only 20% of HomeFed's  loans are made outside California -- primarily in Arizona, Massachusetts and  Georgia -- those loans account for 60% of the 212-branch thrift's bad loans.  About 30% of HomeFed's total loans in Florida, for example, are either in  default or in foreclosure, he said.  </P> <P> HomeFed has $19 billion in assets.  </P></p>

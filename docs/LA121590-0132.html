			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> CURB REJECTED ON RV RESIDENTIAL PARKING  </P> <P> Fearing a lawsuit, the City Council this week rejected a proposal to restrict  recreational vehicle parking on city streets.  </P> <P> "This problem has been around for about 20 years," Councilman Richard Partin  said.  </P> <P> "It just keeps resurfacing."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Gail H. Kerry requested that the city study the proposed  restrictions to curb neighborhood parking problems. Proposals ranged from  partial bans to a total prohibition against recreation-type vehicles parking on  residential streets if they obstruct the vision of motorists and pedestrians at  intersections or driveways.  </P> <P> However, heeding the city attorney's warnings, the council declined to take  action.  </P> <P> City Atty. Jerry M. Patterson told the council that there are conflicting  reports regarding parking prohibitions. The state attorney general's office  "says a city can't restrict or classify vehicles differently," he said.  </P> <P> However, other legal opinions give cities that right. Some have already enacted  ordinances, but these could be challenged in court, Patterson pointed out.  </P> <P> The council decided to draft a formal position that will be sent to the  California League of Cities. "Maybe we could try and guide something through  the league," Kerry said. She asked that the council consider the issue.  </P> <P> The league could pursue legislation giving cities the right to control the  parking, Patterson said. LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

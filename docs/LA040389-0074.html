			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMITHKLINE, BEECHAM CONFIRM MERGER TALKS  </P> <P> SmithKline Beckman Corp. and Beecham PLC confirmed Sunday that the companies  are discussing a merger of most of their operations that could create one of  the world's largest pharmaceutical firms, but officials refused to give  details.  </P> <P> In a news release from the Philadelphia-based SmithKline, the companies said no  agreement has been finalized and cautioned that there was no assurance any  agreement would be reached.  </P> <P> However, a Beecham official in London who asked not to be identified said the  news release was a sign the companies "appear to have common ground."  </P> <P> On Friday, the price of SmithKline stock jumped $5.25 after Beecham confirmed  that it had hired the U.S. merger specialist Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co. as  a financial adviser.  </P> <P> A report last week said Beecham, the British pharmaceutical and consumer  products company, had held merger talks with SmithKline, a pharmaceutical and  medical products company. The talks reportedly soured over questions about who  would control the new firm.  </P> <P> The companies said in the Sunday release that the entity created by a merger  "would be governed by a board of directors drawn equally from both companies  and with management selected from both companies." The release also said "major  parts" of both businesses might be merged.  </P> <P> Under such a merger, current SmithKline and Beecham shareholders would own the  new entity equally, the news release said.  </P> <P> The Beecham official said the companies have three common medicine divisions:  prescription, over the counter and animal health.  </P> <P> "Those are the parts that lend themselves to merger," he said.  </P> <P> The official said he did not know how long the discussions had been going on,  but "you can assume it's been for some time."  </P> <P> An industry analyst said the tone of the announcement indicates that the  companies are close to an agreement.  </P> <P> "I would judge from the tenor of the press release that they're in the advanced  stages of the negotiations," said Richard Stover, an analyst with Alex Brown  &amp; Sons in New York.  </P> <P> The companies may have decided to confirm the merger talks were going on  because "the rumors were just too intense," Stover said.  </P> <P> Beecham's U.S. operations are based in Pittsburgh. Its products include  Aqua-Fresh toothpaste, Sucrets lozenges, Geritol vitamins and Williams Lectric  Shave lotion.  </P> <P> SmithKline's major prescription drugs are Tagamet, an ulcer medication, and  Dyazide, used to treat high blood pressure.  </P></p>

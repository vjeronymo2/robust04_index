			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (2): Optimism strengthens in spite of downbeat statistics AFTER THREE years of decline, the investment market for top-quality property is beginning to strengthen. The fall in interest rates, following sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, helped stabilise the market. It reduced the risk of tenant failures and eased the pressure on company balance sheets, lessening the need to sell property. Moreover, the falling cost of finance and the diminished returns on cash helped attract overseas buyers and private investors into the market. By late spring, the growing confidence had prompted institutional investors to return. Potential demand for property is widely considered to be at its highest for at least five years. Property companies raised about Pounds 1.5bn in new funds in the first half of 1993, and are channelling much of this into the market. Overseas investors are also making significant investments; their 1992 total is expected to be around Pounds 1 1/2 -Pounds 2bn. But these sources of finance are overshadowed by the potential demand from UK institutions, which are prepared to invest Pounds 7bn in commercial property over the next 12-18 months, according to DTZ Debenham Thorpe, property advisers. Last year, the combined institutional net purchases of just less than Pounds 1bn was half the 1991 total, and one of the lowest recorded over the past 12 years. As a percentage of new investment, property slipped from about 15 per cent at the start of the 1980s to 5 per cent at the start of 1993. But there has been a sea change in attitude in the past few months. Like the mid-1970s, when institutions returned in force, there is a widespread view that the property cycle is on an upswing. Admittedly, this view is not wholly reinforced by official statistics. Figures from the Central Statistical Office suggest institutions were actually net sellers of UK property during the second quarter of 1993. Nonetheless, most commentators believe these statistics give a misleadingly downbeat impression. The large number of transactions agreed in the second quarter are unlikely to show up in the figures until later in the year. The speed of the revival in investor interest is even prompting fears of overheating in some parts of the market. Competition is intense for buildings with blue-chip tenants and long leases. Security of income has become one of property's main attractions. Falling bond yields highlight the yields available from property - which rose above gilt yields in 1992 for the first time since the 1960s. Some investors fear such attractions could be eroded by legislative changes. The government has announced plans to abolish privity of contract - whereby the original tenant retains the ultimate responsibility for paying rent throughout the lease - on new leases. The impact this will have is hotly debated. Around 60 per cent of the UK's 50 largest funds surveyed by DTZ Debenham Thorpe believed the new legislation, if not applied retrospectively, would have no impact on the value of their existing portfolios. A quarter, however, feared it would reduce the value of their existing assets. The DTZ survey also found that nine out of 10 respondents believe there will be a recovery in values over the next couple of years. At present, however, investor demand is largely restricted to a narrow band of top-quality property. Property with shorter leases and less financially secure tenants is still difficult to sell, not least because banks remain highly cautious about lending. But the banks' caution is not necessarily a cause for dismay. It may lead to a shortage of development finance, which will restrict the supply of new property and encourage a revival in rental values.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Humble rich make a meal of shopping THE WEALTHY believe themselves to be middle class and to be excluded from a London or university-based upper-class establishment. The results of a survey of 70 of Britain's richest families show that many rich people perceive themselves to be just like everybody else. Leicester University interviewed Midlands families deriving fortunes from new and old money. The families, from landed gentry to captains of industry and commerce, each had at least Pounds 250,000 in liquid assets. Professor John Scott said many interviewees claimed their biggest extravagance was their weekly Sainsbury's shopping bill or going out for a meal - in spite owning a yacht, jet aircraft or private stables. Women were less content than men. Only five of the 70 families had women heading their business activities. In the others almost all key decisions were taken by men. Yet many women had played an important role in founding family fortunes either through their work or by providing the initial capital. One woman said: 'It was his dream, my money.' In a surprising result business people displayed a lack of concern about passing on their companies to their children.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Roman Zadunaiskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow 5 April, TASS -- The arrival of Ukrainian  supreme military officials and special units in Sevastopol, the  main base of the Black Sea Fleet, without any coordination with  the Crimean leadership and notification of the Fleet Command  aggravated the Crimean situation today.    Some 30 servicemen of special units of the Ukrainian  National  Guard and the Ukrainian Interior Ministry arrived in the base  this morning on board the plane of the deputy head of the  Ukrainian armed forces general staff, military sources in  Sevastopol told ITAR-TASS. The servicemen settled at the  Slavutich ship of the Ukrainian Navy Department.    Another 500 special unit servicemen settled at the Nakhimov  navy school in Sevastopol. The Black Sea Fleet Command is ready  to put the fleet on the alert in case of a conflict.    There is no reports about movement of Ukrainian troops  stationed in the peninsula. According to the Russian military,  the Ukrainian troops stationed in the Crimea increased from  18,000 to 51,000 men within the past two years.    Well-informed sources told ITAR-TASS Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov failed to return to the Crimea at 1800 today as it was  planned since Turkey closed its skies to the presidential plane  without any announced reasons. Meshkov is expected to return to  Simferopol at 0100 on 6 April.    In the opinion of observers, the developments are not  accidental. A decree of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was  made public in the absence of Meshkov to announce the  introduction of a post of Kravchuk representative in the Crimea,  which was followed by the arrival of the Ukrainian military  officials and special units.    Observers think President Kravchuk may explore the ground  for  the introduction of a special rule in the Crimea and  subordination of Yuriy Meshkov to his representative.</p>

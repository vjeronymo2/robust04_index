			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION 5-A BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> OCEAN VIEW KEEPS MOVING WITH VICTORY  </P> <P> Perhaps Jim Harris, Ocean View High School basketball coach, should have stuck  with his original plans. Last summer, he scrapped a motion offense for a power  inside game because the players disliked it.  </P> <P> That is, until they found out that they could win with it, which they did again  Friday night with a 75-67 second-round Southern Section 5-A playoff victory  over Etiwanda at Etiwanda.  </P> <P> Harris inserted the motion offense a month ago, and the Hawks won seven of  their final eight Sunset League games.  </P> <P> "(The coaches) say we're not even close to running it right yet," senior Todd  Norman said. "They say we are really going to win big when we do."  </P> <P> The Hawks (19-9) executed the offense well enough to lead, 39-34, by halftime.  And their patience paid even bigger dividends in the fourth quarter when they  broke away to increase the lead to 16 points.  </P> <P> In contrast, the Eagles, who averaged 79.8 points a game this season, shot at  will, but it didn't do any good.  </P> <P> "Our game's going to be push it down, and shoot it," Etiwanda Coach Jess Evans  said. "If you have to work too hard, then you better pass it."  </P> <P> That philosophy backfired in the second half when the Eagles fell behind and  forced shots trying to catch up.  </P> <P> "They came out firing," Harris said. "That's not our style, so it took us a  little while to get used to it.  </P> <P> "In the second half, we played a steady man-to-man defense and were patient on  offense and it showed."  </P> <P> Ocean View controlled the tempo and took a 55-45 lead on Norman's basket with  2:18 remaining in the third quarter. Norman finished with 20 points and 7  rebounds.  </P> <P> Tim Pelonis added six points and had 10 rebounds for the Hawks.  </P> <P> The Eagles were led by John Adams with 32 points, Michael Jackson with 26 and  Marcus Bell with 25.  </P></p>

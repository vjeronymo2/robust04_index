			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Recession is over, says Bonn: Minister predicts German economic growth may reach 2.5% by end of year The west German recession was officially declared over yesterday by Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, who said unemployment was falling and national economic growth could reach 2.5 per cent this year. Reconstruction of the eastern economy was also progressing rapidly, he said. Hinting at even more robust prospects for 1995, the minister, speaking in Bonn, took the opportunity to goad opposition Social Democrats (SPD) already discomfited by a further poll showing continued gains for the ruling coalition. Far from being frivolous and tainted by wishful thinking, as the SPD had claimed, his new year forecasts of up to 1.5 per cent pan-German growth had been shown to be 'extremely cautious', Mr Rexrodt claimed. The economics ministry had also upgraded its earlier prediction of up to 8 per cent growth in the east to a maximum of 10 per cent his year. 'Unfortunate talk of de-industrialisation in east Germany is false,' Mr Rexrodt said. Although unemployment would be unacceptably high this year at just over 3.7m, the total would be less than his ministry had forecast earlier, and 'horror' scenarios of up to 4.5m unemployed had been proven far removed from reality, he added. Mr Rexrodt said real income cuts would have to be accepted temporarily in the interests of improving labour market conditions, but employees could count on real increases as productivity improved. But even then moderation would be required. This view was echoed in the Bundesbank's latest monthly report, published yesterday, which said rises in hourly wages of more than 6 per cent in 1991 and 1992 were among the fundamental causes of last year's recession. Between 1989 and 1993 real incomes had grown at more than double the rate justified by economic performance, it said. The central bank has consistently said that this year's 2 per cent pay increase in the west, implying real cuts in purchasing power, was only the first step back to a rational pay policy. While not as enthusiastic as Mr Rexrodt, the bank also noted that west German industrial production rose 3 per cent in the second quarter, while manufacturing capacity utilisation was at levels last seen in the autumn of 1992. Latest data from the east showed a 27 per cent year-on-year rise in industrial output, it said. On Thursday, the Bundesbank council will meet to decide on interest rate policy. European markets were yesterday cautious ahead of the meeting, the first since since the summer holiday. In an attempt to counter opposition proposals to redistribute tax burdens to help lower income groups, Mr Rexrodt said research had shown 'room for manoeuvre' on federal, state and local taxes. In his view, the basic minimum income could be freed of tax by 1996. France adjusts slowly to recovery, Page 2; Bonds, Page 23; Currencies, Page 25</p>

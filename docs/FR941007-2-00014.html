That ZLIP has the authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements independent of any government authority was evident from our examination of correspondence and written agreements and contracts. We also confirmed that ZLIP retained proceeds from its export sales and made independent decisions regarding disposition of profits and financing of losses (based on our examination of bank account records, financial records, and purchase contracts). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on our examination of management appointment announcements and other correspondence, we have determined that ZLIP had autonomy from the central government in making decisions regarding the selection of management. According to ZLIP's company charter, both the general manager and the deputy general manager are appointed by the local administering authority, the ZCOFTEC. While this may indicate that ZLIP is subject to the control of ZCOFTEC, there is no evidence that any other exporter of the subject merchandise, is currently under the control of ZCOFTEC. Therefore, we have concluded that ZLIP is entitled to a separate rate. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> All non-responding exporters are presumed to be under the control of the central government. Moreover, there is no basis on which to conclude that Abel, the only exporter that has not participated in this proceeding, in subject to control by ZCOFTEC. Abel is located in Shenzhen Province, and ZCOFTEC is an agency of Zhejiang Province. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that any non-responding exporter is controlled by ZCOFTEC. ZMEC, also located within Zhejiang Province, is not subject to such control by ZCOFTEC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Lansheng <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In conducting a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de facto <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  analysis of Lansheng, we have examined the factors set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Silicon Carbide, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and whether the change in corporate structure alters our conclusion regarding those factors. Lansheng's sales documentation and correspondence supports the conclusion that no government entity exercises control over Lansheng's export prices. Additionally, our examination of numerous contracts with domestic and foreign trading companies demonstrates that Lansheng has the authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements without interference from any governmental entity. We confirmed during verification that this situation did not change after Lansheng became a share company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before Lensheng became a share company, the general manager of its predecessor company, Shanghai Stationery &amp; Sporting Goods Import and Export Company (Shanghai Stationery), was elected on February 27, 1993. The election proceeded in the following manner. First, for every ten employees, there was one elected representative. Second, the representatives then elected the general manager. Third, once the general manager was elected, the company sent a letter, announcing the election to the Shanghai Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Shanghai COFTEC). Shanghai COFTEC then approved the manager and sent a letter of congratulation to the company. While Shanghai COFTEC technically had the authority to reject an elected manager, it reportedly had never done so. After Lansheng became a share company, the same manager continued to lead the company. At the first general shareholder's meeting, when Lansheng's Board of Directors was elected, the shares held by the State Assets Management Bureau (SAMB) were voted by the general manager of the former company, Shanghai Stationery. Subsequently, the newly elected Board of Directors appointed the former general manager as Chairman of the Board for Lansheng ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Final Concurrence Memorandum in this proceeding, which attaches the Department's report of its verification of Lansheng in the Antidumping Investigation of Certain Cased Pencils from the PRC). There is no evidence that any government entity participated in the election of the Board of Directors or the decision to retain current management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also found that Lansheng retained proceeds from export sales and made independent decisions regarding the disposition of profits and financing of losses both before and after becoming a share company. This point was supported through examination of Lansheng's bank account records and bank loan applications. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Lansheng's verification report.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated above, Lansheng's change to a share company did not have any effect on the actual day-to-day operations. The record shows that, following its conversion to a share company, 25.1 percent of Lansheng's shares were sold publicly, with the proceeds returning to the company as new capital investment. The remaining 74.9 percent of the shares represents the value of the assets in the original company, Shanghai Stationery (which was owned by ``all the people''). Evidence on the record indicates that these remaining shares are held in trust by the SAMB, just as its assets were held in trust when Lansheng was owned by ``all the people.'' The company's management, which has remained the same throughout its transition to a share company, votes these shares at the general shareholders' meetings of Lansheng. This evidence supports the conclusion that, under the new corporate structure, the government has not exerted control over Lansheng through the exercise of shareholder rights or otherwise; operational control remains in the hands of company management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHEASTERN STATES PELTED BY SNOW AND FREEZING RAIN  </P> <P> Snow and freezing rain fell in several Southeastern states Saturday, a day  after an onslaught that left up to a foot of snow in parts of the East. Much of  the Northeast remained in the grip of a cold spell.  </P> <P> Sleet and freezing rain damaged trees and power lines Saturday in central  Georgia, and an inch of ice covered roads between the towns of Gordon and  Irwinton. Parts of northern Georgia were coated with up to 3 inches of snow by  mid-afternoon, and there were reports of deeper snow in the mountains.  </P> <P> Residents in the Atlanta area reported snowflakes the size of cotton balls.  </P> <P> "There's about an inch of snow in my yard, and snowflakes falling the size of  half-dollars," said one resident of the suburb of Chamblee. "It's the prettiest  snow I have seen in my years in Atlanta."  </P> <P> Snow also was scattered over western North Carolina, with almost 6 inches  covering Mt. Mitchell and 4 inches in Boone. Freezing rain and sleet extended  over southeast Virginia and central North Carolina.  </P> <P> Cold weather continued in much of the Northeast. The early-morning temperature  was 7 degrees in Harrisburg, Pa., where the old mark of 10 had stood since  1917. Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states was 16 degrees below zero at  Montpelier, Vt.  </P> <P> Although snow and rain were still falling in the South, the wintry storm that  had walloped the mid-Atlantic Coast and the South crept out to sea Saturday.  </P> <P> Temperatures in parts of the East were forecast to climb today and begin  melting away the glaze of ice that was as thick as 1 inch in the heart of  Georgia.  </P> <P> But the National Weather Service issued a statement saying that another storm  might strike Monday and dump more snow in parts of the East.  </P> <P> The wintry onslaught Friday left up to a foot of snow in parts of Delaware,  Maryland, the Washington, D.C., area, northern Virginia and West Virginia.  Smaller amounts fell over most of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, the mountains of  Tennessee and North Carolina.  </P> <P> The icy blast also struck parts of the Midwest and Mississippi Valley, dumping  varying amounts of snow. Freezing rain fell from southeast Arkansas into  southwest Mississippi.  </P> <P> A dangerous sheet of ice formed over many areas hit by the storm, including  roads in most of North Carolina, where two people died early Saturday in a car  crash in Cumberland County, highway patrol Sgt. D. W. Taylor said.  </P> <P> The weather also was blamed for the deaths of a total of 13 other people in  accidents Thursday and Friday in five states.  </P></p>

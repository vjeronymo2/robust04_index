			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor </F> Krejci; place and date not given: "The Issue Did Not Involve  Individual Sudeten German Claims"]    [Text] [Krejci] You allegedly said in an interview for  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG that negotiations on claims by  Sudeten Germans for compensation should be held not on the basis  of the collective principle but individually.    [Klaus] Not a word was said in my interview for this  newspaper about compensation for individual Sudeten Germans.  The issue does not involve compensation, but resolving this  issue. These are two completely different things. I proceeded  from the premise that, in harmony with our concept for  individual rights, we do not like to hear ideas about collective  rights and solutions. If, however, this or that German--I do  not say Sudeten German on purpose--shows an interest in moving  to the Czech Republic, settling here, and acquiring state  citizenship, then that is in order. This is exactly what we  have always said; I was merely making a distinction between  collective and individual solutions.    [Krejci] So, you did not discuss claims?    [Klaus] Not a word was said about claims. This newspaper is  one of those publications that does not publish interviews on  principle. A journalist records an interview with someone, then  writes an article based on it and places quotations from what he  said between quotation marks. The interviewee does not have the  slightest opportunity, however, to influence their order or  choice. I refrain from such interviews-non-interviews and I only  give them to journalists that I know and trust, which applies in  the case of FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG. I think that the  article published in this newspaper gave a faithful account of  the essence of our conversation.    [Krejci] The Civic Democratic Party [ODS] Executive Council  has entrusted you with holding talks with the representatives of  the Jewish communities. Why?    [Klaus] The Civic Democratic Party cannot countenance the  accusations being made against it by certain political entities  for allegedly not respecting Jewish traditions or the suffering  of the Jews during World War II. We cannot condone this  offensive, deliberate, and calculated tactic.    [Krejci] How do you assess the behavior of your coalition  partners during the parliamentary vote on the property belonging  to the Jewish communities?    [Klaus] In my opinion, this was trivial. If someone leaves  the chamber because, by chance, his view does not prevail, his  is not the practice of normal political life. Several votes  have been held in the government on this draft, and I have to  say that I have not always won. The government's point of view  on the draft for this law was not exactly what I would have  wished; despite this, I did not make the proceedings impossible,  and I did not walk out. I would ask other people not act like  this.    [Krejci] What do you expect from the ODS Commission that has  been charged with looking into the possibility of resolving the  issue of Jewish property on the basis of a government decision?    [Klaus] There is a strong view within the government, which  I like, according to which this issue could be resolved outside  the law, simply by an executive decision on returning the  property in state ownership. At the same time, the communities  would be asked to consider doing the same thing. The ODS  Executive Committee would be pleased if this path were embarked  upon. This means finding the right method, and the free  transfer could take place.    [Krejci] Will this solution be acceptable to the coalition  partners?    [Klaus] I do not envisage that the coalition partners would  want to block the issue of returning Jewish property.    [Krejci] Should this method also be applied in the case of  church property?    [Klaus] If this were to turn out to be a quick and viable  method, I would not have anything against it.</p>

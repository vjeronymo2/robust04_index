			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bank of New York profits climb sharply to Dollars 369m THE BANK of New York, a large and conservatively-managed commercial bank, turned in net profits of Dollars 369m, or Dollars 4.23 a share, for 1992, up sharply from Dollars 122m, or Dollars 1.28, in 1991. Earnings were helped by stronger fee income, wider interest spreads and lower bad debt provisions. Net income in the fourth quarter of 1992 was Dollars 104m (Dollars 1.14 per share), up from Dollars 66m, or 80 cents. Return on equity was 12.42 per cent. Bank of New York's acquisition of the branch business of Barclays Bank of New York was completed last December 11, providing a small contribution to earnings. The Barclays purchase added Dollars 54m to non-performing assets, but the net total of such assets declined by Dollars 96m last year to Dollars 931m. Bank of New York's bad debt provisions in 1992 were Dollars 427m, down from Dollars 746m in 1991. On Wall Street, its share price was Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 55 1/8 at the close. First Chicago turned in fourth-quarter net earnings of Dollars 136.6m, or Dollars 1.53, compared with a Dollars 15.1m loss in the corresponding quarter of 1991. Earnings for the whole of 1992 were Dollars 93.5m, down from Dollars 116.3m the previous year. Mr Richard Thomas, chairman, said the level of non-performing assets declined to Dollars 414m, the lowest since 1985, and commercial credit quality was improving. Bad debt provisions for 1992 were Dollars 425m, down from Dollars 440m. The bank's return on its Dollars 49.3bn of assets in 1992 was just 0.17 per cent, even lower than the 0.22 per cent a year before. In New Jersey, First Fidelity said its 1992 net earnings were 41.8 per cent higher at Dollars 313.7m. The bank's fourth-quarter net profit was 54.9 per cent better at Dollars 89.6m, while the return on assets was 1.15 per cent. The New Jersey bank, which has been hit in the past by heavy commercial real estate loan losses, has embarked on a recovery campaign. But Mr Tony Terracciano, chairman, said: 'We have come only part way in our efforts to bring the company to its full earnings potential.' In Florida, Barnett Banks, one of the biggest in the state, said its fourth-quarter net income fell to just Dollars 6.2m in 1992 from Dollars 44.1m the previous year because of a Dollars 92.6m restructuring write-off that resulted from its merger last month with First Florida. For the whole of 1992 Barnett earned Dollars 207.7m of net profit, up sharply from Dollars 81.4m in 1991.</p>

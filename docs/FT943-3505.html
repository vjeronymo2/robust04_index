			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / US and N Korea talk in Pyongyang The US and North Korea yesterday ended what were described as 'serious and co-operative' talks in Pyongyang about the establishment of liaison offices as a first step to diplomatic relations. The US is offering improved relations in return for North Korea accepting full international nuclear inspections and a stop to its current nuclear programme. The discussions in Pyongyang, which began on Saturday, have focused on technical matters such as selecting a location for the US office in North Korea. But no details about the talks were disclosed in a short joint statement. A decision on whether to proceed with the liaison offices will come after the US and North Korea resume high-level negotiations in Geneva on September 23 to settle the nuclear dispute. North Korea offered several conciliatory gestures yesterday, indicating satisfaction with talks with the US. It returned the remains of 14 US soldiers killed during the Korean war and allowed International Atomic Energy Agency experts access to a fuel fabrication plant and a fresh fuel storage building they had previously been barred from. The US and North Korea are also meeting in Berlin this week to discuss the means to deprive Pyongyang of the ability to produce weapons-grade plutonium from its nuclear programme. The measures include converting the North's nuclear programme to safer light-water reactors, providing alternative energy during the 10-year conversion process, and the final disposal of plutonium-rich nuclear fuel rods recently removed from the North's 5MW reactor. One stumbling block to the successful outcome of the Berlin talks is the North's insistence that the new light water reactors should be provided by Russia, since it has had experience operating Soviet-designed reactors. Instead, the US and South Korea want the North to accept US-designed reactors being used by Seoul. South Korea has said it will refuse to finance the bulk of the estimated Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) project unless its companies are involved in the programme. Mr Robert Gallucci, the chief US delegate to the Geneva talks, will arrive in Seoul today to discuss the issue.</p>

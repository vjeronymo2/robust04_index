			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Minimum bank guarantees proposed ALL depositors in EC banks should have a minimum Ecu15,000 (Pounds 10,500) of their deposits guaranteed, the European Commission proposed yesterday. The EC executive began work on the draft directive before the failure of the Bank of Commerce and Credit International (BCCI) last year, but accelerated its initiative after the scandal surrounding the bank's collapse. The Commission suggests that bank customers should obtain their deposit guarantee reimbursement within three months, in contrast to the much longer period that many depositors with the Luxembourg-incorporated BCCI had to wait. Responsibility for deposit insurance would switch from the host to the home country of a bank. Mr Pierre Jaans, head of the Luxembourg Monetary Institute, said this would not pose a problem for the duchy. Very few Luxembourg-based banks, with the notable exception of BCCI, had branches abroad. Commission officials hope that EC governments will reach basic agreement on the guarantee scheme under the UK presidency of the EC later this year. The plan would require Greece and Portugal to institute deposit guarrantees for the first time.</p>

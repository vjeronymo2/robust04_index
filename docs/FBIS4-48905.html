			<p>BFN     [Text] Damascus, April 30 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher arrived here from Israel this afternoon  to mediate for the Middle East peace process.    He was met by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' at  Damascus International Airport.    Christopher came 4 hours later than what was scheduled and  the American Embassy here did not explain the reason.    He is going to hold talks with Syrian President Hafiz  al-Asad  and hand him the Israeli peace plan on returning the Golan  Heights to Syria. Israel seized the Golan in the 1967 Middle  East war.    According to a statement issued Friday [29 April] by Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, the Israeli plan includes Israeli  perspective on phased withdrawal from the plateau and  normalization of relations between the two countries.    Christopher stated in Israel Friday that he is going to hold  important talks here to revive the Syrian-Israeli talks.    He said that the aim the U.S. tries to reach is establishing  a just and comprehensive peace in the region, something which  necessitates enhancing the talks on the Syrian-Israeli track.    During his current Mideast tour, Christopher has already  visited Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel.</p>

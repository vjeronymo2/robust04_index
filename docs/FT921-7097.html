			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television If you accept Prince Philip's conservation argument (you know, the more animals you slaughter the better, since the people most interested in the welfare of pheasants or foxes are those who need a good supply for hunting) then presumably you will sympathise with the government of Zimbabwe. They plan to boost big game hunting, expand the ivory trade, increase consumption of antelope meat, and kill crocodiles for their skin, reasoning that this is the best way of preserving exotic animals. Brilliant] Assignment reports (7.45 BBC2). Television generally is now anti-man in a casual way, the broadcasting industry being disproportionately packed with feminists (most of them male) but Tuesdays have become particularly so. Men Behaving Badly is a new comedy about two sex-mad blokes sharing a flat and treating women in a way that must ensure they never achieve their desires (8.30 ITV). Rides (9.30 BBC1) is a new series about a woman who runs a minicab service. She concluded in Episode 1 that all men are unreliable and all women reliable and the firm will henceforth employ only women. Imagine the brouhaha if either of these series was sexually transposed . . .</p>

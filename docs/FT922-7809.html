			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / BCCI probe 'impeded in Washington' A former top prosecuter claimed in congressional testimony yesterday that he had been impeded last year by the Department of Justice in his efforts to obtain documents and bring indictments against the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). Mr Dexter Lehtinen, US Attorney in Miami until four months ago, complained that despite numerous written requests to Washington, the department declined to give him permission to enforce subpoenas demanding crucial BCCI documents about the bank's Luxembourg and other non-US operations. Mr Lehtinen testified that in a separate instance, a Justice Department official told him last August not to bring a tax charge against BCCI. The former prosecuter said the order not to bring the indictment has been given by Mr William Barr, the US Attorney-General, and relayed to him by a deputy of Mr Barr. The department has consistently denied that it impeded any US investigations of BCCI. Mr Lehtinen, before a senate foreign relations sub-committee, said he had written to the department in May 1991, requesting assistance on BCCI, because he believed his investigation would 'crack open a case of the greatest national urgency.' He said he was told repeatedly by Justice Department officials in Washington that an out-of-court BCCI settlement of a money laundering case in Tampa in January 1990 precluded his bringing any further indictments in Miami.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Brussels seeks G7 policy meeting: EC's Christophersen urges closer monetary co-operation THE European Commission is seeking a special meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers to bolster monetary co-operation and co-ordination between the EC and the incoming Clinton administration in the US. Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner, said yesterday that lack of monetary co-operation with the US was partly to blame for last September's crisis in the European Monetary System and the resulting turbulence in international currency markets. It is understood that contacts between Brussels and Washington have taken place with a view to holding a meeting of G7 finance ministers in early February - well ahead of their scheduled talks in April, around the time of the International Monetary Fund's policy-making interim committee. In Senate confirmation hearings last week, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary-designate, showed interest in breathing new life into G7 co-operation. Mr Christophersen - who as an EC Commissioner would not normally attend a G7 finance ministers meeting - said yesterday it was 'very important' to revive international monetary co-operation inside the G7 which, as a forum, had fallen into disrepair. 'In the last nine to 10 months, there has been a wide gap between US and European interest rates. That is part of the explanation of what has happened in the currency markets,' he said. Mr Christophersen believed European interest rates had now 'peaked' - picking up the optimistic theme struck last Monday at a meeting of EC finance ministers in Brussels. He predicted that Germany would soon be able to lower interest rates, based on the prospect of a wages pact between unions, employers and the Bonn government and tax increases to fund the costs of German unification. These were the preconditions set by the Bundesbank for an early cut in interest rates, said Mr Christophersen who this week unveiled a lower forecast of 0.8 per cent growth in the Community in 1993 - down from between 1 and 1.5 per cent. The Danish commissioner suggested yesterday, however, that a small fiscal stimulus in the US could lead to an extra 0.5 per cent growth in the EC this year. On prospects for Emu, Mr Christophersen said it was likely that the planned enlargement of the EC to include Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway by 1995 would increase the chances of a 'majority' of EC members opting for a common currency. Under the provisions of the Maastricht treaty, the European Commission must prepare a report on whether member states' are in compliance with strict convergence programmes on budget deficits, inflation and exchange rate stability. Mr Christophersen predicted that the new Scandinavian members and Austria would probably meet the criteria and would want to press ahead with the third stage of Emu by 1997. But he stressed the importance of closer co-operation between EC members both on measures to promote growt - such as shifting from current to capital spending - and to achieve the strict economic convergence targets.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: CBOT cleared to trade as overseas exchange in UK THE CHICAGO Board of Trade was yesterday recognised as an overseas investment exchange in the UK, clearing the way for UK-based users of Globex, the screen-based futures and options trading system launched last month, to trade CBOT products. The move was welcomed by the CBOT, which hopes that the authorisation will lift volume on Globex, which is languishing at under 2,000 contracts a day. Globex, developed by CBOT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, the financial information and news company, gives subscribers in different time zones access to markets outside exchange trading hours. City dealers can trade, throughout the European trading day, the CBOT's highly liquid futures and options on 10-year US Treasury notes, and on five-year and two-year notes. Prior to the ruling, these contracts could be traded on terminals in New York, Chicago and Paris. The CBOT's long bond contracts, the CME's Eurodollar, Treasury bill and one-month Libor contracts are due to be listed on Globex on August 16. Announcing the authorisation, Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government welcomed overseas exchanges that were well regulated and did not operate anti-competitively. 'The Chicago Board of Trade meets these criteria and, through its activities on Globex, will bring an important increase in the range of choice available to investors,' he said.</p>

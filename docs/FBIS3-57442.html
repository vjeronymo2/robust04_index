Ministry of the Economy Will Once Again  Try To Elaborate Selective Structural Policy"]    [Text] Economy Minister Aleksandr Shokhin stated in a news  conference yesterday that his department intends to "sum up  suggestions on correcting the reforms" that had been hammered  out in particular by the working group under First Vice Premier  Oleg Soskovets; by academicians Abalkin and Petrakov; by Lvov,  corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences; by Academician  Shatalin's "Reforma" fund, and so forth. Mr. Shokhin hopes to  sum up these programs by early February, when the ministry's  collegium session is planned. Besides, he is hoping that the  "designers of formulas for Russia's salvation," for example,  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, "will not hide their ideas until the moment  they are asked to form their government."    Russia's new economy minister, the fifth in two years,  stated  the need to "combine the line toward macroeconomic stabilization  with measures in the field of microeconomy." Mr. Shokhin  explained his perception of the premier's comments about the use  alongside with "monetarist" measures of "nonmonetarist" measures  in controlling the economy. "It is necessary to fill with  concrete contents the selective structural policy," he declared.  According to the economy minister, the effectiveness of  granting preferential credits last year was extremely low, and  it is now necessary to design a mechanism to issue them on a  selective basis. Besides, the state should pay up the debts to  the national industry and agriculture -- "even if to minimize  the sum, we should pay in the first quarter at least 3 trillion  rubles under our obligations of last year's fourth quarter.  This is the most conservative estimate of what we cannot afford  not to do," he said, adding that all this "does not contradict  the financial policy guidelines."    Aleksandr Shokhin rejected the explanation given by Yegor  Gaydar for his resignation (Mr. Gaydar referred to the  government decisions in January that ran counter to the policy  of financial stabilization). "Inflation in January will be  immeasurably greater than in December," but, like the growth of  the budget deficit, this "is predetermined by the last months of  the past year," Mr. Shokhin stated. He explained the desire of  a number of politicians to "leave the government" by political  expediency. As for the present composition of the cabinet, Mr.  Shokhin thought that the composition of the government would not  have undergone appreciable changes compared with that of the  start of September had Boris Fedorov stayed in the position of  finance minister. "Now is a rather hard time for carrying out  reforms, but I did not cash in on the opportune moment to leave  the government because all the horsepower in here is necessary  now," he said.    In the meantime, according to Mr. Shokhin, certain political  forces are doing "all to discredit the prime minister, equating  his actions with a creeping counterrevolution" so as "to try and  organize in April-May an all-Russia strike and take power."    Touching on the problem of Russia's relations with  international financial organizations, Aleksandr Shokhin pointed  out in particular that "he would not now speak about who  precisely will conduct talks with G-7, the Paris and London  creditor's clubs, as well as with the IMF and the World Bank."  At the same time, the new economy minister stated that he would  insist on jointly resolving all questions pertaining to  relations with international financial organizations, and that  he thought it necessary to preserve the commission for  cooperation with international financial organizations.    Answering journalists' questions about the chances of a  second line of the system of credit from the IMF for Russia, and  the granting of standby credit in 1994, the Russian IMF director  doubted if "Russia would be able in the near future to meet the  standard set of criteria brought by the Fund's board in deciding  on granting it." The economy minister, however, believes it  necessary to continue the talks with IMF representatives on  these problems. "This is useful at least because thus we can  see the situation in Russia's real economy," he stated.    During yesterday's press conference, Mr. Shokhin was  extremely cautious about chances for the merging of the monetary  systems of Russia and Belarus, saying that such a decision  should be preceded by finding a compromise on a closer union of  the two countries' economic policies. Mr. Shokhin intimated  that he would be in charge of Russia's relations with the CIS  subject to approval by the premier.</p>

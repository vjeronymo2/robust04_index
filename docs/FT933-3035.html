			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Speculation on Airbus crash Aerospace industry officials and analysts said yesterday they did not believe the crash of an Airbus Industrie A320 in Poland, the fourth since it went into service, was linked to its controversial fly-by-wire controls, Reuter reports from Paris. The Lufthansa jet carrying 70 people from Frankfurt crashed on landing at Warsaw airport on Tuesday, killing two people and injuring up to 55.

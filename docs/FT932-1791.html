			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Preussag blames loss on European steel downturn PREUSSAG STAHL, the third-largest German steel group, returned a loss of DM96m for the six months to March 31, compared with a profit of DM30m in the corresponding period a year before. Sales for the six months dropped by 26.6 per cent to DM1.1bn, down from DM1.5bn previously. Preussag Stahl's raw steel production was 1.8m tonnes, down from 2.1m in 1991-92. The company's annual raw steel production last year stood at 4.2m tonnes. Preussag Stahl blamed the downturn in the European steel industry for the loss. 'We have joined the ranks of the other steelmakers, which are all posting large losses,' the company said. Capital investments continued to rise, totalling DM144m for six months. A second blast furnace will start operating in 1994, with a raw steel capacity of 2.1m tonnes a year. The new blast furnace will replace four smaller and older ones, allowing significant savings. The restructuring will cost 1,500 jobs over the next three years.</p>

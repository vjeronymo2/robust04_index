			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SOMBER OVERTONES WITH BEMIS AND DEJARNETT  </P> <P> When musicians form a new group, then try out their musical departure in a  decidedly out-of-the-limelight locale such as Long Beach's basement-room  Beneath Broadway theater, it may not be entirely sporting to review their first  show. But the acoustic-folk debut of singer-violinist Ann DeJarnett and  singer-guitarist Jimmy Bemis at that venue Thursday evening easily held up to  the early scrutiny.  </P> <P> Bemis' previous allegiance had been with the raw, punkish Chain Gang, while  DeJarnett, with the Falcons, had crafted some of the most distinctive and fully  realized original rock music to have come out of Orange County (with somewhat  watered-down examples available on two releases on Orange's Dr. Dream Records).  Though it was a shame to see that outfit jettisoned earlier this year, the new  music DeJarnett is making with Bemis also has the promise of becoming something  special.  </P> <P> The eight-song performance opened with three Bemis originals, which at present  are the duo's strongest suit. Bemis writes in a somber vein, but entirely  unlike the crop of young detached gloom coming out of England in the last few  years. His moody lyrics and delivery seem rooted in a dark, but very present,  landscape, recalling in a small way British folk singer Bert Jansch (who,  incidentally, is making a rare stateside appearance at McCabe's in Santa Monica  on Oct. 21).  </P> <P> Bemis' thick, slightly mushed vocals probably won't get him on "Star Search,"  but they were ideally suited to the dusky illumination called for by such lines  as "The night holds no mystery / The universe bears no love / And the branches  of the hanging tree embrace the mourning dove" from the pair's opening song,  "Traveller."  </P> <P> The other great advantage to Bemis' songs was DeJarnett's supporting violin  work. Where her electric fiddle excursions with her former band rarely took  full advantage of her classical training, the acoustic setting allowed more  nuance and shading to her playing, which settled a Celtic moodiness about  Bemis' vocals. If there is one curse to her classical background, it is that  her solo fills still followed set lines rather than relying on the spirit of  the moment.  </P> <P> Switching to rhythm guitar for her own songs, DeJarnett sang "Longest Day of  the Year" from her 1988 album, "Possessions," and two unreleased songs, "Frozen  Reasons" and "Farewell Again," each drawing on the interior emotional  landscapes that mark much of her previous work. As with her violin, the  acoustic backing allowed a greater range of expression in her singing --  particularly in the confiding tone and controlled vibrato of "Farewell Again"  -- though one might also miss the raw fury she often achieved with the Falcons.  </P> <P> Located in the basement of downtown Long Beach's Broadlind Hotel, Beneath  Broadway is a venue ideally suited to introducing new things. Decidedly  Bohemian with its subterranean location, thrift shop furniture and cushions  spread across the floor (there are also a couple more cats slinking about than  are found in the average nightclub), the tiny theater routinely offers  open-mike time to aspiring poets and musicians, and a variety of music and  drama events, not unlike the spirit at the former Huntington Beach club Safari  Sam's.  </P></p>

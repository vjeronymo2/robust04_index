			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Heinz joins high profile string with Dollars 300m offering Dollar-denominated offerings dominated the eurobond market yesterday in spite of volatility in the eurodollar market caused by fears that Orange County, California, would be forced to liquidate its Dollars 7.5bn bond fund. This fuelled fears that a flood of bonds would flow on to international markets, and spreads in the dollar market widened significantly. Orange County filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday evening after being hit by a loss of Dollars 1.5bn from its dealings in the bond market. In spite of the volatility, another US corporate borrower moved yesterday to exploit the relatively low cost of borrowing currently available in the eurodollar market. H. J. Heinz, the US food group, launched a Dollars 300m offering of three-year fixed-rate bonds priced to yield 27 basis points over US Treasury bonds of the same maturity. This is the latest in a string of offerings by high-profile US corporate borrowers who have taken advantage of the strong demand for their credit among European retail investors. This enables them to achieve funding at up to 10 basis points below that available in the US domestic bond market. 'US investors focus closely on the borrower's credit rating and on the spread being offered, whereas European investors look to the coupon and to the name. And these are great names,' said one dealer in London. 'Borrowers can get funding at a price significantly better than their credit-rating warrants,' he said. A deal brought at around 27 basis points over US Treasuries in the euromarkets would require a price to yield at least 35 basis points in the US market, one dealer estimated. Walt Disney and PepsiCo both turned to the eurodollar market last week with Dollars 300m and Dollars 250m offerings respectively, both targeted at European retail investors. The Heinz offering found a similar pattern of demand, lead manager Goldman Sachs said. 'There was some UK institutional interest but primarily the bonds were sold to Swiss retail investors,' a syndicate official said. Heinz last came to the eurodollar market in 1988. Kyushu Electric Power, the Aa1-rated Japanese electric power company, launched a Dollars 300m offering of five-year fixed-rate bonds priced to yield 33 basis points over US Treasuries. This was the first electric power company to come to the US dollar market since July 1993, traders said. 'Most of the electric utilities have been doing their funding in yen over the last year because of the attractive rates available on fixed-yen. But the attractiveness of yen is now and the dollar market is coming back into vogue again,' said one trader. 'As a result, we expect to see more Japanese electricity companies coming to the market in January and February,' he said. Demand for the offering came from European and Japanese institutional investors, joint lead manager IBJ said. Syndicate managers said that the spread of 33 basis points was wider than initially anticipated due to the general widening of spreads on the back of worries over Orange County. South Africa's Dollars 750m global offering was priced at 193 basis points, at the lower end of its 193 to 198 basis point launch spread. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, assigned a Baa3 rating to the global bond issue.</p>

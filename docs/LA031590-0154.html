			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> CHANGES SOUGHT IN PROPOSED DOG LAW  </P> <P> Consideration of a proposed ordinance on vicious dogs has been delayed two  weeks after the City Council requested several modifications.  </P> <P> Among the requested changes was that the law include a requirement that the  owner of a dog declared potentially dangerous or vicious maintain homeowners or  general liability insurance for at least $200,000.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, which was presented by the city attorney, a dog would be  classified as potentially dangerous or vicious by a three-member commission  appointed by the council. The commission would also have the authority to order  a vicious dog destroyed.  </P> <P> The push for stricter dog laws came as the result of the Feb. 2 dog attack on  6-year-old Jeffrey Kerley, who was mauled by two 100-pound Rottweilers as he  played near his home in the 7700 block of 19th Street. He received 75 stitches.  </P> <P> Jeffrey's father, Noble Kerley, attended Tuesday's City Council meeting and  said he was satisfied with the city's proposed ordinance.  </P> <P> "The ordinance looks pretty good, pretty clean," Kerley said. "It's too late to  help my son, but maybe it will help other victims in the future."  </P> <P> The council will vote on the revised ordinance at a March 27 meeting.  </P></p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Sharp rise in prisoners on remand THE NUMBER of prisoners held on remand in police cells has risen by 50 per cent since the end of January, when Mr Kenneth Baker, the home secretary, described the situation as 'unacceptable'. Last Friday 1,846 prisoners were being held on remand in police cells in England and Wales, the highest number for more than six months and almost double the average daily total in 1991. The cost of keeping a prisoner on remand in a police cell is put at Pounds 220 a night, compared with about Pounds 50 a night in a prison. The total cost of keeping prisoners in police cells in 1991 was estimated at Pounds 85m. That was Pounds 68m more than it would have cost to keep them in prison. The cost of keeping prisoners in police cells is expected to rise to more than Pounds 100m this year. Last week, launching the Labour party's law and order proposals, Mr Roy Hattersley, the shadow home secretary said Labour would pay for extra police officers and crime prevention programmes by reducing numbers held on remand in police cells. Labour would make room for all remand prisoners to be held in the prison system by shortening the average time spent on remand before trial and by removing some categories of offenders, such as maintenance payment defaulters, from the system.</p>

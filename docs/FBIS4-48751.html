			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Lagos, 25 May (AFP) -- Politicians in  southeastern Nigeria have formed a new party in defiance of a  government ban and called on the junta of General Sani Abacha to  stand down, press reports said here Wednesday [25 May]. The  People's Mandate Party was formed in the city of Enugu last week  as an offshoot of the Eastern Mandate Union (EMU) grouping  prominent politicians from seven states in the region, the  reports said.    In a statement, the group demanded that Abacha relinquish  power by June 30 to make way for a sovereign national conference  on Nigeria's political future, and said it was "agreeable" to  the possible validation of the outcome of a presidential  election annulled by a previous military regime last June. That  poll, said by international observers to be free and fair, was  generally held to have been won by millionaire businessman  Moshood Abiola, but then junta chief General Ibrahim Babangida  alleged there had been irregularities.    The EMU said it could embark on the organisation of a  sovereign national conference and the establishment of a  government of national unity with like-minded political  organisations elsewhere in the country.    It was not clear whether the new group was affiliated to the  recently-formed National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), a  pro-democracy movement comprising prominent politicians, retired  military officers and ex-political office holders from states in  the southwest, southeast and middle belt of the country. NADECO  masterminded a boycott Monday in much of Nigeria of the first  round of elections to a constitutional conference which the  regime plans to organise at the end of June, as part of a plan  it has presented to restore civilian rule. [passage omitted]    The EMU, led by former presidential candidate Patrick Dele  Cole, also revived old charges that the east of the country has  been marginalised within the military and proposed the  establishment of regional commands to decentralise the Armed  Forces. In 1967-70, Nigeria was wracked by a civil war that  ended the secessionist aspirations of the mainly Ibo-peopled  east, which tried to form the separate state of Biafra.</p>

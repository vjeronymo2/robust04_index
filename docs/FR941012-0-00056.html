			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In addition, the Regulatory Impact Analysis for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final logging standard estimates, based on the various data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the record, that there are an average of 158 fatalities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6,798 lost workday injuries and 3,770 non-lost workday  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injuries that occur each year in the logging industry. (For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further discussion see section VI of this preamble.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the 72,100 employees engaged in logging operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as defined by the final rule, only 38 percent (27,170) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by State Plan State logging standards, <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently provide protection regardless of kind of logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation in which the loggers are employed. Of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated 62 percent (44,930) of logging employees who are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not covered by State plan State standards, OSHA estimates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that at only one-third (16,478) are covered by the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pulpwood logging standard. That means that almost two-thirds (28,452) are not covered by any Federal or State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging standard. (This estimate is consistent with the WIR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey, which indicated that only 35 percent of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyed were engaged in pulpwood logging operations.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> In 1977, the leading states in logging employment (with 48 percent of the total) were Washington (15, 400), Oregon (14,000), California (6,100) and Maine (4,300). By 1982, the employment pattern had shifted and the leading states (with 42 percent of the total) were Washington (11,900, down 3,500); Oregon (11,300, down 2,700); Georgia (5,400, up 1,600); and Alabama (5,000, up 1,200). California (3,900, down 2,200), was no longer one of the leaders. Overall logging employment in the Pacific Coast states decreased 22% during this period. The South was the only region in the country to show an increase in logging employment (21%). This employment trend, resulting in the change from harvesting the Pacific Coast's old-growth timber to increased harvesting of third and forth-growth pine forests in the south, means that an increasing proportion of logging employment is in states not covered by state logging standards. (As noted earlier, only Alaska (16th in 1982), California (7th), Hawaii (very small), Michigan (19th), Oregon (2nd) and Washington (1st) have OSHA approved state logging standards covering all loggers.) This means that as the centers of activity (and employment) shift from the old growth forests of the pacific coast to the pine forests of the south, fewer employees conducting general logging (non-pulpwood logging) will be covered by these State plan State logging standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The preceding section shows there has been a steady  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease in injury and lost-workday incidence rates since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the adoption of OSHA's existing pulpwood logging standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the State plan State standards. In addition to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further reduction in accidents for those employers currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by OSHA and State logging standards, OSHA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a substantial reduction in incidence rates can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieved by promulgating a uniform national logging standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that provides protection for all employees engaged in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logging operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing the proposed rule, OSHA used the l978  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI standard as its model for a uniform national logging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, since many of its requirements were stated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance language. This is in keeping with the Agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination that properly drafted performance standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can adequately address safety and health hazards without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessarily impeding technological advancement and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer innovation. The final rule provides a base level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of safety for employees in all logging operations. At the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same time, it still allows those State plan States with more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complicated or specialized local conditions to develop their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own detailed standards, as several States have already done.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many participants in this rulemaking have said that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive performance-based logging standard is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to reduce the risk of injury and death (Ex. 5&hyph;6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;10, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;18, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;22, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tr. W1 21, 73, 202). OSHA agrees with these commenters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that the integrated program of personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective equipment; equipment, machine and vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protective devices, inspection and maintenance; work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices; and training contained in the final rule is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably necessary and appropriate to reduce the high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> injury and fatality incidence rates in this industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> V. Major Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> A. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As a result of issues raised by those commenting on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed logging standard, OSHA solicited information on 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major issues in the notice of public hearing (55 FR 19745,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 11, 1990). OSHA requested detailed information on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variety of issues including training, personal protective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, first aid, chain-saw protective devices, and seat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> belts. These issues were discussed by the participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the public hearings and in post-hearing comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The evidence submitted to the record is summarized and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated in the following discussion of each issue and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the summary and explanation of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

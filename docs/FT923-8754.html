			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / SAS cancels flights in face of wildcat strikes Scandinavian Airlines yesterday cancelled nearly all flights from Norway and Denmark as it was hit by its fourth consecutive day of wildcat strikes, Reuter reports from Stockholm. The airline was able to operate only a handful of international flights from Oslo and Copenhagen using non-striking Swedish crew. SAS's Norwegian and Danish cabin crew members had walked off their jobs on Thursday in a protest over planned job reductions at the airline. However, Norwegian cabin crew yesterday agreed to return to work after their union agreed to call a legal strike if their demands for SAS to change its job-reduction plans were not met. Their strikes followed a two-day stoppage by Swedish cabin and ground crew which also disrupted operations.</p>

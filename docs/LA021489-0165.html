			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CRASH TOTALS EARNHARDT'S RACE CAR  </P> <P> Dale Earnhardt escaped injury today in a crash that destroyed his Grand  National race car during practice at Daytona International Speedway. Earnhardt,  a three-time Winston Cup champion who campaigns his own Grand National car, was  running a hot lap at the end of the session when he tangled with a car driven  by L. D. Ottinger. Neither driver was injured, but Earnhardt's Chevrolet was  too badly damaged to repair. Ottinger's crew was working frantically on his  Pontiac in an effort to repair it in time to qualify for Saturday's Goody's 300  Busch Grand National stock car race. Earnhardt, who had been planning to run in  both the Goody's race and Sunday's Daytona 500, will concentrate on the Winston  Cup event.  </P></p>

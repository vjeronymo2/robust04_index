			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 26 May (PAP) -- While assessing Wednesday's  meeting between NATO defense ministers and defense ministers of  the countries who joined the Partnership for Peace program,  Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said today in Warsaw that  he "feels something is lacking" after the meeting. "We are not  satisfied with the Western countries' way of thinking,"  Kolodziejczyk told journalists.    In the Polish defense minister's opinion, the process of  integration with the European Union [EU], the Western European  Union [WEU], and NATO should run parallel and not, as the West  wants, from EU membership through WEU membership to NATO.  "Maybe we should even join the NATO alliance earlier. We have  no time," Kolodziejczyk stressed.    According to Kolodziejczyk, the idea of Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev, who presented a proposal for a new  system of European security at the meeting, a system based on  close cooperation between the CSCE and the North Atlantic  Council -- must be given some thought. It should not, however,  block the Partnership for Peace initiative, the minister said.  Kolodziejczyk believes that many international institutions  have been ineffective, including the CSCE, as the events in  former Yugoslavia have shown.</p>

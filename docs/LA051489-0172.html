			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV IN CHINA;  </P> <P> U.S. SEES BENEFIT IN NEW COMMUNIST DETENTE  </P> <P> Brushing aside the superpower politics of the last 17 years, during which the  United States and China built a peculiar friendship on the foundation of mutual  hostility for the Soviet Union, the Bush Administration says it welcomes Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to Beijing because it promises to ease  tensions in Asia and the Pacific.  </P> <P> Washington's relaxed attitude toward the first full-scale Sino-Soviet summit in  almost 30 years is based on a new assessment that antagonism between the Soviet  Union and China does more harm than good to U.S. interests, according to a  consensus of Administration policy-makers, former U.S. officials and  non-government specialists.  </P> <P> Besides, these experts say, the American ability to exploit the Sino-Soviet  rivalry has eroded over the years. Even if it wanted to, there is not much the  Administration could do to influence the meeting between Gorbachev and Chinese  leader Deng Xiaoping.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Force Behind Relationship  </P> <P> "The U.S.-China relationship started on the basis that 'the enemy of my enemy  is my friend,' " a State Department official said. "That was certainly the  force behind the relationship in the 1970s and much of the 1980s."  </P> <P> But now, China and the United States have more common interests than a common  enemy, this official said. This is so despite the sharp differences between the  two nations on matters such as Chinese suppression of human rights, freedom of  expression and individual liberty.  </P> <P> "China does things for us in Asia and will continue to do things for us in  Asia," said the official, who asked not to be named. As examples, he said,  China "tacitly supports" U.S. bases in Japan and the Philippines, helps to  buttress the security of Thailand and has supplied money and arms to the  U.S.-backed moujahedeen guerrillas in Afghanistan.  </P> <P> From its side, China looks to Washington and the West for the technology it  needs for its economic modernization program.  </P> <P> Moreover, the official said, China and the Soviet Union are not expected to end  their mutual mistrust as the result of a single summit. No one expects a  reprise of the Sino-Soviet alliance of the 1950s.  </P> <P> "China still perceives that the Soviet Union is the chief long-range threat to  its security," the official said. "That assessment has not changed. One can't  accuse the Chinese of moving with wholesale haste to improve their relations  with the Soviet Union at the expense of their American friends. China has been  moving slowly because they did not want to frighten the Americans."  </P> <P> U.S. officials admit that there may be an element of wishful thinking in their  assessment, an attempt to put the best possible face on something they cannot  change anyway. Only Vice President Dan Quayle has sounded a word of caution,  and even his assessment was weighted to emphasize the positive.  </P> <P> "We believe that a lessening of Sino-Soviet tensions is a logical course for  both nations to pursue and have no objections to that," Quayle said in a recent  speech, "provided that any new relationship harms neither our own interests nor  those of our friends, and that it directly addresses our common security  needs."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Result of U.S. Policy  </P> <P> Michel Oksenberg, a University of Michigan professor who was the White House  National Security Council's chief China expert when the Jimmy Carter  Administration established normal diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979,  said the Sino-Soviet rapprochement resulted from the success of U.S. policy.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's overture to China, he said, represented a sharp change in Soviet  policy "due in no small measure to Sino-American cooperation over the past 10  years."  </P> <P> Other experts say that Washington's ability to shape the three-cornered  U.S.-Chinese-Soviet relationship will certainly decline as a result of the  Gorbachev-Deng summit.  </P> <P> "Obviously, restoration of normal relations between the Soviet Union and China  is going to erode the favored U.S. position in the triangle," a senior  Administration official said. "However, it will make it more difficult for any  side of the triangle to manipulate the others. Frankly, that's not a situation  that we are uncomfortable with. I think we can live with it."  </P> <P> Jonathan Pollack, head of the political science department at the RAND Corp. in  Santa Monica, added: "We harbored a lot of illusions about our ability to  manipulate relations between the Russians and the Chinese even during the time  of Deng Xiaoping's most violent anti-Soviet rhetoric in the 1970s.  </P> <P> "The Chinese clearly sing a very different song today than they did a few years  ago," Pollack said. "This is because they find Mr. Gorbachev a different breed  of cat" from former Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev.  </P> <P> Some experts see Gorbachev's trip to Beijing as part of a global "charm  offensive" by the Soviet leader, which may ultimately challenge Washington's  position around the world.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev thinks in classical 19th-Century balance-of-power terms," said  George Carver, a former deputy director of the CIA. "I think his long-term plan  is to isolate us by achieving bilateral ties with all of the people we used to  use as a counterweight to Soviet expansion."  </P> <P> Carver, now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International  Studies in Washington, complained that the Bush Administration has failed to  devise a long-term strategy to deal with the change in style at the top of the  Kremlin.  </P> <P> "The thing that messes us up is a continuing concentration on the short term,"  Carver said. "We are sprinters competing with marathon runners in a marathon."  </P> <P> For Carver and many other experts, both in and out of government, the most  significant long-term consequences center on Soviet relations with Japan, not  China. But there is no agreement among the specialists over whether Washington  should be reassured or alarmed by this prospect.  </P> <P> "The bigger issue is whether Gorbachev's opening to China gives him any  leverage with Japan because Japan is the one major global player that stands  apart from the love-in for Gorbachev," Pollack said. "A Gorbachev overture to  Japan might be a cause for concern."  </P> <P> Oksenberg agreed: "The most important trip Gorbachev will take is still ahead  of us. The route to Tokyo is through Beijing."  </P> <P> But Oksenberg added that a Soviet-Japanese rapprochement might ultimately  advance American interests by giving Washington an opening to resume relations  with Vietnam.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus on Cambodia  </P> <P> "The Russians and the Chinese are dealing with each other over Indochina, and  we are peripheral actors," he said. "I think it is important for us to become  more engaged in that equation, but to do that, we would have to spend more  money for the reconstruction of Indochina. We don't have the money for that, so  it will have to be done by Japan."  </P> <P> U.S. officials believe that a major topic of the Gorbachev-Deng meeting will be  the situation in Cambodia. Moscow has supported the Vietnamese invasion, while  Beijing backs a three-sided rebel coalition -- two non-Communist factions  supported by the United States plus the murderous Khmer Rouge, blamed for the  deaths of more than 1 million Cambodians when it was in power in the 1970s.  </P> <P> "Cambodia has been an important obstacle to Sino-Soviet relations because they  were backing different horses," one U.S. official said. "It now appears that  the Chinese and the Soviets will sit down and agree on a solution for  Cambodia."  </P></p>

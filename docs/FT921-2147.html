			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: LVMH improves on late surge LVMH, the French luxury goods group run by Mr Bernard Arnault, yesterday announced an 11 per cent increase in net profits to FFr3.74bn (Dollars 669m) in 1991 from FFr3.37bn the previous year. The group, which owns a string of prestigious brand names including Louis Vuitton luggage, Christian Dior perfumes, Moet et Chandon champagne and Hennessy cognac, saw sales slip in the opening months of last year because of the impact of the Gulf war on international air travel and the important duty-free market. However, it managed to stage a recovery in the second half of 1991. By the end of the year, group sales rose by just over 11 per cent to FFr22.04bn from FFr19.83bn, and operating profits increased 13 per cent to FFr6.41bn, against FFr5.67bn. As a result, net earnings per share rose 11.5 per cent to FFr252, compared with FFr226 last time, and the board proposed a dividend of FFr68 a share for the year. The champagne and wines division sustained a slight fall in operating income to FFr1.33bn, against FFr1.34bn, on sales ahead to FFr5.55bn from FFr5.15bn. The downturn in operating income reflected the impact of the economic recession in its key markets of the US and UK. By contrast, cognac and spirits saw operating profits rise to FFr2.79bn from FFr2.3bn, on sales of FFr6.23bn, against FFr5.07bn. This reflected the buoyancy of the Asian market and strong growth in sales of older quality cognacs. Luggage and leather goods reported a rise in operating profits to FFr1.88bn from FFr1.75bn, on sales of FFr4.85bn, up from FFr4.45bn. The recently introduced cuirepi range experienced a 50 per cent increase in sales. Perfumes and beauty products benefited from the launch of two new fragrances  -Dune by Dior and Givenchy's Amarige - and saw operating profits rise to FFr636m, against FFr462m last time, on increased sales of FFr4.87bn, against FFr4.65bn.</p>

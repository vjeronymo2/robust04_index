In this teleconference meeting, the RAC intends to concur on technical edits to its draft report on review of the topic of radiation environmental futures for the purpose of closure by the full committee and to forward the revised report to the SAB's Environmental Futures Committee (EFC) for final approval at their September 13 and 14 meeting in Washington, DC (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Vol. 59, No. 134, Thursday, July 14, 1994, pp. 35927&hyph;35928). The August working draft will be made available to the Agency or the public. The teleconference meeting is open to the public and teleconference lines will be assigned on a first come basis. Previous public meetings to discuss the topic of future issues in environmental radiation include those held on May 4&hyph;6, 1994 (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Vol. 59, No. 68, Friday, April 8, 1994, pp. 16809&hyph;16811), June 20, July 11 and July 13 (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Vol. 59, No. 106, Friday, June 3, 1994, pp. 28856&hyph;28857).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any member of the public wishing further information, such as a proposed agenda for the meeting, should contact Dr. K.

Members of the public who wish to make a brief oral presentation at the teleconference should contact Dr. Kooyoomjian or Ms. Clark no later than August 24, 1994 in order to have time reserved on the agenda. The Science Advisory Board expects that public statements presented at the teleconference meeting will not be repetitive of previously submitted oral or written statements. In general, each individual or group making an oral presentation will be limited to a total time of three minutes. Written comments (at least 24 copies) received by the SAB by August 22, 1994 may be mailed to the SAB's RAC and REFS prior to the meeting; comments received after that date will be provided to the RAC and the REFS as logistics allow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Marsh Management Subcommittee Meeting_September 7&hyph;8, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Public Law 92&hyph;463, notice is hereby given that the Marsh Management Subcommittee of the Ecological Processes and Effects Committee (EPEC) will meet on September 7&hyph;8, 1994, at the Gangplank Restaurant, 600 Water Street, Washington, DC 20024, telephone (202) 554&hyph;5000.

Due to limited space, seating will be on a first-come basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 21, the Marsh Management Subcommittee met to begin a review of the science underlying marsh management, defined as the use of water control structures, berms, dikes etc. to modify the hydrology of marsh systems. At the request of the Agency's Office of Water, the Subcommittee has been established to evaluate the ecological implications of marsh management practices in various types of marsh ecosystems. EPA has formed a Marsh Management Steering Committee, consisting of federal agencies with responsibilities for marsh management, to refine a set of technical questions to be addressed by the Subcommittee. On July 21, the Subcommittee heard presentations from various federal and state agencies regarding relevant federal and state policies and technical issues of concern and received public comments on marsh management issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the September 7&hyph;8 meeting, the Subcommittee will begin developing written recommendations in response to the six questions posed in the Charge to the Subcommittee: (1) Does structural marsh management protect or create emergent vegetated wetlands? (2) To what extent does structural marsh management impact the physical, biological and/or chemical aspects of natural marsh-sustaining processes? (3) What are the impacts of marsh management, if any, to estuarine fisheries, waterfowl, and other fish and wildlife? (4) What are the cumulative effects of numerous large-scale marsh management projects with respect to emergent vegetation, accretion, fish and wildlife, and other resources? (5) What are the gaps and the highest priorities for research studies related to the effects of structural marsh management projects, and for routine monitoring of such projects? (6) What scientific or technical criteria should EPA use as part of the basis for case-specific decision-making; or, as an alternative, what approach should EPA take to develop such criteria?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Single copies of the briefing materials provided to the Marsh Management Subcommittee may be obtained by calling the EPA Wetlands Hot Line at 1&hyph;800&hyph;832&hyph;7828.

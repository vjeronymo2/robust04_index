			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> CHILD-CARE PROGRAM OKD  </P> <P> A city-employee child-care program and a $100,000 loan program to operate  child-care centers in Northwest Pasadena were approved Tuesday by the Board of  Directors.  </P> <P> Under the $171,020 Model Employer Program, the city will provide a subsidy to  low- and moderate-income city employees who need help paying for child care.  </P> <P> The board approved providing $142,000 to such payments that are expected to  average about $87 monthly for very low-income city workers.  </P> <P> The program also provides six months of unpaid maternity leave for city workers  who could return to a reduced work week of 20 hours. City employees would be  allowed to take sick leave for family emergencies or to care for a sick child.  </P> <P> Under the Northwest Child Care Trust Fund, three-year loans at 5% interest  would be provided to family day-care homes and child-care centers in Northwest  Pasadena, the city's largest minority neighborhood.  </P> <P> The model employer program is an effort by the city to set an example and to  encourage private businesses in Pasadena to set up child-care programs. Only  Santa Monica and Irvine offer similar subsidies to city employees.  </P> <P> The Pasadena loan program will begin July 1, but the city's child-care program  will initially serve only management and non-union employees. Labor unions  representing about 1,200 of the city's 1,600 workers must agree to the  child-care program before it goes into effect for unionized employees.  </P></p>

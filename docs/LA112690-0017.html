			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Menudo Members Ousted on Pot Charges: Two singers with the pop teen band Menudo  were arrested in Miami for possession of marijuana, then ousted from the group,  which cultivates a clean-cut image. Police at Miami International Airport  confiscated 45 grams of marijuana from Sergio Gonzalez, 18, and 38 grams from  Ruben Gomez, 16, Thursday night as the group stopped in Miami en route to  Venezuela from Mexico City.  </P> <P> Both are free on bail after being charged with marijuana possession. The group,  which has been active in anti-drug campaigns aimed at young teens, maintains  its youthful appeal by rotating boys out of the group when they reach 16.  Officials with Sonotone Music Corp., which distributes Menudo's albums, could  not explain why 18-year-old Gonzalez was still in the group. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> HOT FLASH: Talk about timely. Just as 2 Live Crew is being prosecuted for  making allegedly obscene rap records, Rhino Records is putting together a  collection of lascivious R&amp;B gems that would bring a blush to the cheeks of  pop morality crusader Tipper Gore (who frequently boasts about her love for old  rock 'n' roll).  </P> <P> Compiled by Rhino A&amp;R exec James Austin, the compilation, titled "Risque  Rhythm," is due in September and features a host of of double-entendre classics  that can be seen as the progenitors of today's raunchy rap hits. The 18-song  package includes Bull Moose Jackson's "Big Ten-Inch Record," Tampa Red's "Let  Me Play With Your Poodle," the Dominoes' "Sixty Minute Man" and Wynonie Harris'  "Keep on Churning (Till the Butter Comes)."  </P></p>

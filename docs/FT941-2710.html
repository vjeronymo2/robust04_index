			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Iraq sanctions to stay in place - News in brief The UN Security Council agreed yesterday that sanctions against Iraq must stay despite Baghdad's improved co-operation on eliminating weapons of mass destruction. But the accord obscured sharp divisions within the council, which spent three days in intense discussions on what has hitherto been a brief and routine 60-day review of the embargo. France, which holds the council presidency this month, sought agreement on a formal statement praising Iraq for its greater co-operation. Russia and China supported this but both the US and Britain objected saying Iraq was still far short of full compliance with the cease-fire terms. Diplomats said the French initiative was prompted by fears that even if the Iraqis met these terms, Washington would block lifting sanctions by raising new issues, such as human rights violations. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN commission charged with destroying Iraq's nuclear, chemical and heavy weapons capability, must report full compliance before sanctions can be lifted. He expects to do so before the end of the year.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Tokai Bank expects to meet BIS rules TOKAI Bank, a leading Japanese bank, said it expects to clear the capital to asset ratio required under Bank for International Settlements rules, as of the end of the business year ended March. Mr Kiichiro Ito, president of Tokai, said the bank's capital asset ratio had fallen to an estimated 8.2 per cent, down from 8.34 per cent last September, due to the weakness of the Tokyo stock market. Japanese banks are required to raise their capital asset ratios to 8 per cent by the end of the year to March 1993.</p>

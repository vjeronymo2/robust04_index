			<p>BFN     [Text] The deputy central government representative in  Mbale, Mr. Henry Rwigyemera, has strongly condemned the  political thuggery exhibited yesterday by some political  reactionaries who tried to assassinate the minister of tourism,  wildlife and antiquity, Mr. James Wapakkabulo, last night, by  throwing two hand grenades at his vehicles, killing one person  and injuring 14 others, two of them critically.    One grenade was aimed at two vehicles belonging to the  minister and his supporters and another at a minibus belonging  to one of the minister's supporters.    Talking to a Kampala Radio Uganda Network reporter by  telephone from Mbale, Mr. Rwigyemera assured the people of Mbale  and the entire country that government authorities in Mbale have  zeroed on those reactionaries and security precautions have  [been] maximally undertaken to ensure that such acts of thuggery  do not occur again, and that elections are not disrupted at all.    He disclosed that they are aware that the target area for  the  thugs are Mbale municipality, Bubulo east and west  constituencies and Manjiya County. He said the cause of these  is that the reactionaries have realized that they are in for a  shock on Monday [28 March, contrary to the fallacy that Bugisu  and eastern Uganda are their power base. He said that the thugs  have also realized that the people can no longer be manipulated.    The central government representative expressed condolence  to  the relatives of the young man who was killed in the attack. He  also expressed sympathy to the relatives of those who were  injured.</p>

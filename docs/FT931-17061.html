			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: Unit trust funds rise to all-time high in November - At a glance Unit trust funds under management rose to an all-time high at Pounds 61.95bn in November, according to the Unit Trust Association. Net inflow, at Pounds 258m, was the highest for any single month since September 1991 - and it scarcely seems coincidental that the Building Societies Association reported a net outflow of Pounds 184m for the same month. Lower interest rates are forcing savers to look around for the best rates. Cash and fixed interest unit trusts, not traditionally high sellers, accounted for most of the inflow of funds. These attracted a gross Pounds 820m and accounted for half of total net sales in the 11 months to the end of November. Growth in funds under management in fixed interest sectors has been startling - according to the UTA, money market funds under management rose by 47.5 per cent, international fixed interest by 71 per cent, and UK gilts and fixed interest by 23 per cent in the year to November.</p>

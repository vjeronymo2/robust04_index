			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Hoechst Hoechst's restructuring represents a cultural revolution at the world's largest chemicals group. The intention is to internationalise and make the company more dynamic and profit-orientated. The number of divisions has been slashed from 15 to seven. Each will be responsible for its own profitability, offering freedom from Frankfurt's bureaucratic bungling. The new management is younger and more international. For the first time, an American is on the board. Hoechst's new-found dynamism is to be welcomed, especially given its previous torpor. Since 1990, operating profits have fallen more than 53 per cent, the return on assets from 11.8 per cent to 5.3 per cent. Over the same period, Bayer slashed 19,100 employees from its pay-roll. Hoechst's total edged down by just 407, although the figure does include recent consolidation of overseas subsidiaries. Not surprisingly, the company has underperformed the DAX by 35 per cent since 1988. The biggest headache remains the drugs division - a decade ago the world's largest pharmaceuticals business, but now sixth. The portfolio is fragmented and old. More than 75 per cent of its drugs date from before 1974. Pre-research and development margins are only 24 per cent, compared with an industry average of 40 per cent. The challenge before the new management is huge. The new team may look dynamic, but it must prove it knows the difference between activity and productivity.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Setting losses against income Some time ago in the FT, I read an article saying that losses in private managed companies can be set against income. My accountant says it does not apply to offshore trusts. Is he correct? The article you read was talking about sections 573 to 576 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. To satisfy yourself that your accountant is right, go to a local reference library and look up these provisions in one of the multi-volume tax works, such as the British Tax Encyclopedia. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

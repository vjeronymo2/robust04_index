			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Yadukha report from Simferopol under general </F> headline: "Russia and Ukraine Have Divided The Ships. Now They  Are Only Left To Decide On How To Position Them"]    [Text] The situation in Crimea remains quiet. The armored  personnel carriers spotted the day before on the railroad near  Simferopol have been towed away to join a national guard brigade  whose strength, according to Ukrainian First Deputy Interior  Minister Col. Gen. Valentin Nedrigaylo, will soon reach 2,500.    Intensive consultations are under way in the Crimean  parliament on forming a working group which is to discuss  outstanding issues with Kiev by 30 May. The group's composition  is expected to be approved at a Crimean parliament session  before 27 May.    According to reports from Izmail, where a Black Sea Fleet  river boats brigade is based, a group of Ukraine navy officers  led by Lt. Col. Krichevskiy arrived at the local Black Sea Fleet  naval engineers service. He stated that before 1 June a  corresponding Ukraine Navy unit will be formed on the basis of  the Izmail division and, on pain of dismissal, demanded that the  personnel switch their allegiance and serve the Ukraine military  department. Black Sea Fleet servicemen refused to obey this  demand.    Following this incident, Captain 1st Rank Dmitriy Ukrainets,  chief of the Ukraine Navy Western Maritime Protection Zone,  stated that no one had given Lt. Col. Krichevskiy any such  powers.</p>

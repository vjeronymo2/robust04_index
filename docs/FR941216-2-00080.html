The DMR's for these pump tests shall be submitted to within thirty (30) days after discharge ceases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Dischargers meeting the conditions set forth in Part I A.3.c. are not required to submit an detailed NOI as outlined above, but must submit a copy of the analytical tests and a summary of the proposed activity one (1) week after discharge begins.

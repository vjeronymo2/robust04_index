			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Some foreign information sources have circulated  reports, from which it follows that the energy crisis enveloping  Ukraine is so strong that it has forced it to suspend not only  its energy deliveries to Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, the Czech  Republic, and Austria, but also the transit Russian energy  deliveries. To what extent does this correspond to reality?    A UKRINFORM correspondent was informed at Ukraine's Ministry  of Power and Electrification, that a tense situation with  supplying electric power stations with organic fuel really did  arise in Ukraine in the autumn-winter period of 1993-94. The  main reasons were the more than hundredfold price increase for  imported gas and oil products, tariffs on electric power lagging  behind the general increase in the price of fuel, and also  consumers' not wishing to pay the power industry.    Left alone with its fuel problems, Ukraine's unified power  supply was forced to lower the frequency of the alternating  current in the grid. Namely for this reason the power systems  of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary separated  from it, and the export of electric power by the Lvov interstate  (?crossing) was suspended.    The suspension of its deliveries naturally did not evoke  especial enthusiasm from [Ukraine's] foreign partners. However,  they had an understanding attitude to the problems of their  eastern neighbors and expressed their readiness for further  cooperation after the situation improves. At the same time,  they emphasized at the ministry of power and electrification,  Ukrainian power engineers are continuing to carry out the  transit of electric power from Russia to Bulgaria and Austria,  although to date the Russian side has not extended the relevant  agreement.    They assert at the ministry that other events in the said  reports do not correspond to reality either, for example, those  concerning Ukraine's losses of one and a half billion from the  suspension of exports or [concerning] the urgent measures by  parliamentarians of eastern European countries regarding uniting  with western countries and excluding Ukraine from the number of  partners.    It was noted at the ministry of power and electrification  that the process of integrating the economies of eastern  European states into the west European economic system,  initiated by the leaders of the Visegrad Four countries in 1992,  also includes gradual preparation for the transition by the  power systems of these countries into a west European union. In  order to resolve this problem the power engineers of Hungary,  Germany, Poland, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic set up the  organization (?Centrel), to which Ukraine was accepted as an  observer.    In particular the organization called for a resolution to  the  issue of keeping the technical possibilities for Central and  Western Europe to receive electric power from Ukraine and  Russia. A regular Centrel consultation in Warsaw on 16-17  February will be about this with the participation of a  Ukrainian delegation.    Similarly the Russian plans to construct new lines of  electricity transfer to Europe via Belarus are not caused by the  current fuel situation in Ukraine, but are a part of a long-term  program of integrating Russia's power system in the Europe-wide  power house.    And so, although the situation in Ukraine's power  engineering  continues to remain tense, they summarized at the country's  minister of power and electrification, it is not a catastrophic  one.</p>

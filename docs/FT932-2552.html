			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / B Gas isolated in watchdog dispute BRITISH GAS and its regulator, Ofgas, clashed yesterday on how well the regulation of the gas industry was working. However, at the same conference on utility regulation in London, water and electricity companies had few complaints about how the regulatory regime - set up when they were privatised - was working. Sir James McKinnon, Ofgas's director-general, hit back at criticism that he had been too tough on British Gas and interfered arbitrarily in its business. 'British Gas has blamed Ofgas for the decline in its profitability. I suggest it should start looking into the mirror,' he said. But Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas's chief executive, called for the power of utility regulators to be diluted by the appointment of non-executive directors to their boards, and for regulators to be required to give reasons for their decisions. The dispute between Ofgas and British Gas has become particularly bitter since the company was referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission last year. The commission is due to report to the government by the end of next month. Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, the electricity regulator, and Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water regulator, also dismissed criticism that the regulatory system was not working. Prof Littlechild acknowledged that customers were concerned about utilities' prices and profits but said that he was dealing with such concerns by reviews of the regional electricity companies and the main electricity generators. Mr Byatt emphasised the importance of regulators explaining their judgments but rejected the idea of more detailed rules to constrain their discretion. The regulators received support from Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive of Yorkshire Electric. He said: 'UK regulation is less costly, less combative and more efficient than US regulation.'</p>

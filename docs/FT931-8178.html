			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Bill Clinton, the gambler PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, after a fumbling transition, can feel pleased with himself and his first month in office. The international reaction to his bold budget proposals, apart from a few understandable equity market flutters, was positive, and the initial US popular response has been enthusiastic. This is no small feat. It comes as no surprise that America's partners have welcomed what appears, at last, to be a serious attempt to close the US budget deficit. More surprising is the apparent support of middle America for a package that raises taxes on middle-class Americans. The US deficit is mainly a domestic political issue for Mr Clinton, and a risky one too. So the most significant endorsement of Mr Clinton's budget package came from Mr Ross Perot, erstwhile presidential candidate and number one US deficit-hater. Of course, the four-year package of tax increases and spending cuts did not go far enough for Mr Perot's liking. The president plans to raise taxes by about Dollars 240bn over four years and make net spending cuts (after allowing for a Dollars 160bn boost to public investment) of about Dollars 80bn. It is projected by the White House to halve the budget deficit from Dollars 332bn or 5 per cent of gross domestic product this year to 2 1/2 per cent of GDP (Dollars 206bn) in 1997, which would still be a drain on national savings. Mr Clinton will have his work cut out if he is to force the package through Congress and ensure that he is still in the White House to celebrate the meeting of these targets at the start of his second term. The Republican opposition was predictable: more tax and spend economics from a Democrat politician. More worrying for nervous Democrat senators, some of whom face congressional elections next year, are the political ramifications from increasing taxes on middle-income voters. Higher taxes Some 70 per cent of the increase in taxation will come from people earning over Dollars 100,000 a year, largely through a new top-income tax rate of 36 per cent for couples earning more than Dollars 140,000 in taxable income and a 10 per cent surtax on taxpayers earning more than Dollars 250,000. But the energy tax and other tinkering mean that the great bulk of American households - all families with incomes of more than Dollars 30,000 a year - will pay higher taxes as a result, breaking Mr Clinton's mistaken campaign pledge not to raise middle class taxes. Yet the fact that the opinion polls show widespread popular support for the package, and the popularity of Ross Perot's kitchen sink economics, may indicate a new realism among middle-class Americans. The need to raise taxes, as well as cut spending, in order to close the budget gap is clear; and Americans are currently asked to pay a relatively low proportion of income in taxes to state and federal government. Mr Clinton's package would raise taxes by over 1 percentage point of US GDP, but from a base of a little over 30 per cent compared to more than 40 per cent in all the main west European countries. Economic recovery Mr Clinton also has the luxury of an economic recovery, a fact confirmed by the optimistic testimony to Congress yesterday from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. A good economist but also a shrewd politician, Mr Greenspan will not trumpet the fact that the credit for this recovery rests with the cuts in interest rates that the Fed has delivered over the past few years rather than with Mr Clinton. But the president, who is probably a shrewder politician than economist, will happily claim the credit for his medium-term budget consolidation and short-term fiscal stimulus, worth Dollars 30bn over the next two years. The medium-term effect of the budget package may be slightly deflationary as consumers rein in consumption to pay higher taxes. But if, despite its structural problems, the US economy can deliver higher employment and higher real wages over the next three years, then Mr Clinton may get away with his tax increases. The most significant international effect of the package will be felt on world long-term interest rates. Long-term US interest rates fell by 0.1 percentage points over the course of last week as the scale of the Clinton package became clear. They have fallen by a full  1/2 point since November's election. The rest of the world can only hope that the beneficial effects from lower long-term rates, and a US recovery, are not outweighed by a US shift towards protectionism as Mr Clinton bargains with Congress in order to see his budget proposals enacted. Yet the main obstacle to European growth is short-term European interest rates. Lower long-term interest rates will be the trophy that the US delegation will bring to next weekend's meeting of finance ministers from the G7 group of leading industrialised countries; and a reciprocal cut in European interest rates will be its aim. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen will rightly receive the praise of the G7 for starting to bring the US deficit under control. Sadly for the US and growth-starved Europe, he is likely to get little in return.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Porsche With its heavy dependence on US sales, Porsche led the pack into the great German car industry pile-up. The fall in US sales  - down by almost 75 per cent from the 1986 peak  - meant that Porsche had to adjust much faster than those German carmakers which boomed as Trabants were swapped for Golfs after German unification. The early attack on costs has left Porsche better placed than some larger German car companies. Porsche was also fortunate that some 944 model manufacturing was subcontracted to Audi. When demand slumped Porsche lost the incremental profit on sales volumes, but was not stuck with the associated overheads. Since costs have now been cut to at least break-even, and the new 911 model is selling well, the company has bought itself a breathing space. The rights issue will help develop the two new models  - a new 911 and a cheaper two-seater 986 convertible  - which must take up the running from 1996-97. The issue now is whether in the longer term the Porsche and Piech family control can be maintained. Continued investment in engine and gearbox technology means Porsche does not face the severe development cost crunch which is forcing other specialist manufacturers into defensive mergers. Joint purchasing of parts with other German carmakers also eases Porsche's cost problems. The new models may be priced at only a modest premium to Japanese competition. In that case the strong brand and evolutionary design development may serve Porsche well against those manufacturers which reinvent the wheel every time they launch a new model.</p>

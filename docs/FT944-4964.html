			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: AB Foods buys flour producer Associated British Foods, the milling, baking, and sugar group has bought Allinson, the UK's leading producer of stoneground flour, from Booker for Pounds 6.7m in cash together with Pounds 1.5m in repayment of inter-group loans. ABF is one of the biggest consumers of stoneground flour in the UK and has been using the Allinson brandname under licence for the past 12 years. Mr Garry Weston, chairman of ABF, said the purchase will consolidate the group's position in the wholemeal bread market. 'We have been spending considerable sums of money promoting and developing the brandname and we wanted the security of owning it,' he said. The disposal of Allinson comes as part of a restructuring at Bookers initiated 12 months ago.</p>

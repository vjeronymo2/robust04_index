			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Hidden' tax deters employers Sir, In your leader, 'Jobs agenda for Europe' (May 9), you write in the penultimate paragraph: 'This can be done by radically reforming the subsidy regime, to promote employment.' It seems that employers are suffering a hidden payroll tax, because the cost of hiring an employee has to include the unemployment subsidy that he would have received - ie, in the UK an employer has to offer above Pounds 3,000. In businesses which operate with low wages and low profit margins, this hidden tax is a very high hurdle to surmount. Therefore, rather than talking of subsidies, let us talk of refunding this hidden tax to employers, so that they can start at a zero base. They may then offer whatever is needed to attract unemployed workers back into work. In effect, instead of paying benefits to the unemployed, let us pay them to employers so that they can take on more workers. This could be done variably so that employers would not recover the hidden tax for higher earners. This would mean that all employers of low-wage workers would recover the tax. Initially, therefore, we would pay out more 'benefit' but costs would reduce dramatically (because competition would force employers to cut prices if they continued to recover the tax without accepting lower profit margins) and the situation would soon balance itself. The great benefit to us would be this: instead of paying out benefit to the unemployed and getting nothing back, we would pay the same to em-ployers and get increased wealth.

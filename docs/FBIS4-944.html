			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mark Gevisser] </F>   [Text] Pigs in police-hats, Hernus Kriel with a  Pinocchio-nose, Winnie Mandela blown up big. The National Party  [NP, Nats] asks blacks if they could look a doe-eyed rape-victim  "in the eye and tell her you're giving a rapist the vote?" The  Democratic Party [DP] asks coloureds if they could look a  steely-eyed Helen Suzman "in the eye and say you're voting for  the Nats?" "A better life for all"; "Be sure of a better life";  "Jobs, peace, freedom" -- hype, hype, hype.    Look beyond the pig in the hat, though, and you'll find  intricately devised campaigns. Millions have been spent by the  ANC, NP and DP on print and radio advertisement. If it's hype,  it's carefully managed. On the surface, the strategies  governing the campaigns are:     -  The ANC wishes to assure potential voters that it is well-  prepared to assume government, and that current NP policies have  bankrupted the country and plunged it into violence: "We cannot  afford more of this."    -  The NP wishes to make it clear that is has "made the change"  to  being truly multiracial and that black voters, too, have made  the change and have come on board to support it.    -  The DP wishes to emphasise that it alone can be entrusted  with  providing effective opposition to an ANC-led government; that  the NP and the ANC, both corrupt, are in cahoots, and that only  the DP can protect South Africans "from the abuse of power".       You could call the ANC's campaign dry, the NP's campaign  dirty, and the DP's campaign elitist. But none of this is  unintentional. This is advertising -- applied psychology. The  parties are products that need to be sold. Behind these surface  images and words, there are a whole lot of subliminal messages  and unspoken assumptions. And there are mounds and mounds of  research. To begin with, both ANC and the NP have determined  that the other is the only serious contender. And so, even  though the DP's campaign is clever, witty and intentionally  strident to dispel the party's namby-pamby image, it has been  all but ignored by the two major players.    As in all ad campaigns, there are carefully-planned phases.  The ANC's first phase, last year, was the people's forums, to  give the impression of wide consultation. Then there was the  "Our Plan" phase, which laid out, in simple terms, the basic  tenets of the party's Reconstruction and Development Programme,  accompanied by poetic-images of roses growing out of barbed wire  or microphones attached to mops. Then there was the "contrast"  phase, where the ANC compared its plan for the future with  current NP government policy, accompanied this time by gritty  snapshots of unemployed men and weeping women. The ANC is now  moving into a "reassurance" phase: expect to see many  comforting images of Nelson Mandela in the last week of the  campaign. Strikingly absent from the ANC campaign has been  hard-hitting negativity: no archival photos dredged up of  Sharpeville or Soweto, or forced removals from District Six or  Sophiatown. "It would be patronising to tell black South  Africans that they've had a bad life under apartheid," says Ken  Modise, responsible for the ANC account at Applied Marketing and  Communications (AM&amp;C), a division of Hunt Lascaris. "They  don't  need to be reminded."    ANC media man Joel Netshitenzhe gives another reason: "We  have to acknowledge that the National Party has been successful  in presenting itself as a transformed multiracial party. F.W.  is not P.W.. So rather than going back to the evils of  apartheid, we have to show that, even now, under the new  transformed F.W., policies still discriminate against black  people."    Modise notes that "everybody knows the ANC was a highly  effective liberation movement. But will it be an effective  government? South Africans look to the ANC as the incumbent.  We had to be substantial; we had to be serious, to show people  that we had the where-withal to govern."    Eldad Louw is Modise's counterpart at the NP's ad agency,  Optimum (a division of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi). He believes that  by  mounting "a campaign of promises", the ANC dug itself into a  difficult ditch. "Our research showed that there came a point  when people could no longer believe all the ANC's promises; that  they said, "that's very nice, but can they deliver?"    Enter the NP, setting out with the avowed intention of  proving to voters -- and particularly black voters -- that the  ANC is not capable of governing. "What we would have liked to  say," says Paris Pitsilledes, a member of the Optimum team, "is  the following: 'Look how good life was for the whites, now you  can take part in it as well.'" As one NP ad puts it; "South  Africa works, so why change it?"    From the very beginning of its campaign, the NP targeted  African voters. This presented the party -- and its advertisers  -- with a problem: "We treat the party as a product," says  Pitsilledes. "And in the eye of the consumer, this particular  product had a major fault. So we had to go about changing  perceptions of it." This meant -- in blunt terms -- blackening  it up.    Given that the NP cannot organise effectively in black areas  because of intimidation, advertising has assumed an immense  significance. Just as De Klerk's staged events with traditional  leaders and cheering black NP supporters were calculated to beam  the message into the living-rooms of unsure black voters, that  there are black NP supporters, the NP's advertising campaign --  particularly its latest series of straight-talk endorsements  from black NP members -- is calculated, according to Louw, to  show potential supporters that "they are not alone, that there  are others who feel the same way as they do."    Pitsilledes says: "We've been knocked for taking the  emotional approach, but advertising is not about logic, it's  about emotion". Precisely because the ANC is making an  emotionally-charged call for the allegiance of black voters, "we  have to take the emotional approach to negate this". And so, in  an NP ad, one finds the textbook hear-tug image: the chubby  soft-focus shot of a cute beribboned girl: "Vote ANC. And  break her heart." Other NP ads, however, demand serious  attention and have come in for fiery criticism.    Like the ad, flighted last week, showing slain Inkatha  supporters outside ANC headquarters in Johannesburg, above a  quote from THE SOWETAN saying: "We are sick and tired of the  cynical use of ordinary folk who are also misinformed about the  real causes for marches, for rallies and for the politics of  today." Or like the series of ads attacking the ANC and the  DP's call to give prisoners the vote. Most controversial was  the ad featuring an identikit of the Station Strangler: "Can  you imagine the Cape Strangler having the vote? The ANC and DP  can."    The ANC and DP attacked it as playing on the racist fears of  coloured people, because the identikit is of a man more black  than brown, but NP executive director Olaus van Zyl rejects this  outright: "It wouldn't matter if the strangler was blue or  white! He's a strangler! A murderer! The issue is, should he  have the vote?"    Racist or not, Pitsilledes said the ad had immense effect  among coloureds in the Western Cape, at whom it was targeted.  And he answers criticism that it was cynical and manipulative  by saying: "So what? It worked."    Therein lies a major difference of style between the two  teams doing the ANC and NP campaigns. While Pitsilledes talks  of selling a product, for example, AM&amp;C copywriter Steve Shaw  highmindedly explains why the ANC has not used catchy jingles --  as the NP has -- in its radio advertisements: "We're not  selling dish-washing detergents, we're talking about the future  of this country."    There's a moral righteousness to the team at AM&amp;C; talk  of  "nation-building" abounds. Down the road at Optimum, however,  the mood is hard-boiled: "Sure, the ANC campaign is efficient,"  says Louw. "But we're looking for effectiveness."    Their respective attitudes reproduce, almost exactly, the  moods of the campaigns they are working for. Van Zyl goes out  of his way to show that the NP campaign is not a negative one,  citing research figures that show that black people do not go  for negative campaigning. According, to Van Zyl, the NP's  "sheep in wolf's clothing" ad, which hit the ANC on the number  of communists on its list, did not go down well among black  voters. Nevertheless, the reality is the NP is the challenger  in this campaign and, as the challenger, it has mounted a far  more robust and strident attack against the ANC than vice-versa.    Whether this tactic has worked will only be known after the  elections. One thing is certain, though: all three parties'  professional and fine-tuned campaigns will change South African  electoral politics for ever. For better or for worse, commerce  has become an integral and indivisible part of election  campaigning.</p>

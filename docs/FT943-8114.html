			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Cholera found in Don river A cholera epidemic reached further into the Russian heartland this week when health officials detected the disease in the waters of the Don, one of the nation's most important and beloved rivers. The outbreak has already claimed 16 lives in the southern region of Dagestan, where more than 500 people have been infected by the disease, and four in the embattled Chechen republic, where 34 cases have been registered. One person has died of cholera in Moscow and health officials both there and in St Petersburg fear that carriers of cholera may be at large in their cities. The epidemic now appears to be spreading from the Caucasus to the central regions of Russia. Officials in Voronezh have detected cholera in the Don and Bityig rivers and authorities in Krasnodar are worried that it has spread into their region as well. Four villages in Dagestan, the original source of the infection, have been placed under quarantine and some air, rail and transport routes have been closed, but officials fear that travel by car into and out of Dagestan might led to a further spread of cholera.</p>

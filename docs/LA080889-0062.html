			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANSON'S $5.6-BILLION BID IS ACCEPTED BY CONS GOLD  </P> <P> British industrial conglomerate Hanson PLC won control of Consolidated Gold  Fields on Monday with a revised $5.6-billion (3.5-billion pound) cash offer for  the London-based mining giant.  </P> <P> Hanson's investment bank, N. M. Rothschild, said it had acceptances  representing 57.3% of Cons Gold shares, including 29.6% committed by South  African-backed Minerals &amp; Resources Corp. after Minorco's own bid for Cons  Gold failed earlier this year.  </P> <P> Cons Gold's board recommended acceptance of the bid after Hanson improved a  June 22 offer of $4.8 billion (3.1 billion pounds).  </P> <P> The deal ends a protracted battle for control of the West's second-largest gold  mining company.  </P> <P> Minorco's cash and shares bid, which could have created the West's biggest  mining concern, was denounced by political opponents who saw it as a South  African exercise to extend interests abroad.  </P> <P> It finally collapsed in May after a U.S. federal judge dismissed a request by  Minorco to lift an injunction blocking its bid for Cons Gold, which lapsed the  following day.  </P> <P> Cons Gold and its 49%-owned U.S. associate, Newmont Mining Corp., had filed the  antitrust proceedings in New York the previous October, saying a Minorco  takeover of Cons Gold would create a monopoly in the world gold market.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possible Asset Sale  </P> <P> Former socialite Lord Hanson, 67, became an industrialist with a formidable  reputation on both sides of the Atlantic for buying groups and selling their  less profitable units to raise funds.  </P> <P> Analysts believe that he might sell some of Cons Gold's mining interests,  possibly attracting bids from Minorco for some of its divisions.  </P> <P> In the United States, Hanson's products include Jacuzzi whirlpool baths, Ground  Round restaurants, Farberware cookware and SCM Chemicals. In June, it said it  would sell most of its stock in Smith Corona typewriters.  </P> <P> The gold industry has shed much of its glamorous image in recent years. For  Hanson, Cons Gold's crown jewel is probably its Amey Roadstone subsidiary,  which analysts say would fit easily into its transatlantic business concerns.  </P> <P> Cons Gold, founded by British empire builder Cecil Rhodes, became a takeover  target last September when Minorco launched its original bid of $4.6 billion  (2.9 billion pounds).  </P></p>

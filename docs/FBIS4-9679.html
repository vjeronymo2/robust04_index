			<p>BFN     [Text] Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias has  defended the appointment of a military officer to the post of  deputy minister of government and has noted that he does not  understand why the UN recommends the opposite as there is a  tendency around the world to incorporate military personnel into  state civilian organizations. He explained: We are talking about  a deputy minister, not about a government minister. I think, he  added, there will be no problem. Besides, they are citizens too  and have a right to participate in the country's political life.    When asked about the policy to demilitarize society, he said  he agrees with it, although he noted that we are already a  civilian society where the Army always plays an important role.    Meanwhile, Adolfo Reyes, the person in charge of security  matters, has said he believes the presidential decision to  appoint an officer to the post of deputy government minister is  adequate but contrasts with recommendations from UN human rights  experts. Christian Tomuschat and Monica Pinto, of the United  Nations, have recommended that civilian authorities lead  civilian security corps, something adhered to by the previous  administration, he said.    Reyes explained this was a presidential order exercising a  sovereign right in an effort to find suitable ways to fight  crime. Reyes stated: It looks like this is the time for the  military to occupy some positions. This decision must be  respected. Reyes said that differences must not be established  among Guatemalans based on their professions because what is  important is respect for human rights and constitutional public  order.    Reyes confirmed he had resigned from his post. He submitted  his resignation to new Government Minister Danilo Parrinello and  to President Ramiro de Leon Carpio because the leave of absence  granted him by the Bank of Guatemala expires on 15 April. If he  does not resign now, this leave would be extended another year.  Reyes said Danilo Parrinello and de Leon Carpio asked him to  stay on the job, but he admitted that it would be difficult to  remain in this post because I did not help draft the security  plan for which they will be responsible. Reyes noted that  today, he and the goverment minister will go to the Bank of  Guatemala to talk to the bank's president, Willy Zapata, about  the possibility of Reyes continuing as an adviser on public  security issues.</p>

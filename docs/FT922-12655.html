			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Fortis shows 3.7% improvement STRONG profits growth in Fortis's life, accident and health insurance businesses helped the Dutch-Belgian insurance company to an Ecu408m (Dollars 331.7m) net profit last year, up 3.7 per cent on the 1990 figure of Ecu393m. Fortis - formed in 1990 from a merger of the activities of Amev, the Netherlands' third largest insurer, and Groupe AG, Belgium's largest insurance company - said it expected operating profits to rise again in 1992. Amev is proposing an increased dividend of Fl 3 a share, up from Fl 2.85, while Groupe AG expects to pay BFr46 a share, against BFr41.25 last time. Mr Maurice Lippens, co-chairman of Fortis, especially welcomed the 'spectacular results' of Amev's recently established venture with VSB, the largest Dutch savings bank and a Fortis subsidiary, to sell insurance products through its branches. Fortis is becoming increasingly involved in the growing bank-insurance sector. AG and Generale de Banque of Belgium are in talks about a deal similar to that with VSB. Mr Lippens, who is also chairman of AG, would not be drawn on the details or the progress of the talks, though he underlined their difficulties. Operating profit in the life insurance sector rose by nearly 17 per cent to Ecu147m, from Ecu126m the previous year. Operating profit in accident and health insurance rose to Ecu73.9m, against Ecu58.1m. Only poor results from the Spanish car and fire insurance operations and from the group's City of London subsidiary - since closed - held back the insurance operation's profits. Profit from banking activities rose from Ecu37.2m to Ecu53.8m, of which Ecu51.2m was interest on group equity, compared with Ecu46.5m. The group's total revenues increased by 19 per cent to Ecu7.47bn from Ecu6.3bn.</p>

			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Equity Markets: Learning lessons from failed hedging strategies - Risk and Reward Here's a test for all budding risk managers. Your company has a problem. It has been very ambitious in developing sales of its main products, which are all oil-based. Delivery commitments under fixed price contracts run as much as 10 years into the future. If the price of oil goes up, your company will suffer. Your predecessor as risk manager thought he had the answer. He bought futures and swaps to match the sales commitments, barrel for barrel. A good hedge? The problem is, there is liquidity only in short-term oil derivative contracts. So he placed all the hedges in short-term instruments. You can guess what happened next: oil prices plunged. With a position of around 160m barrels in the derivatives markets, this led to some pretty big margin calls. In fact, the cash calls ran into hundreds of millions of dollars, banks had to be persuaded to save the company from bankruptcy, the chief executive was sacked. This is where you come in. A new management has inherited the mess, and wants you to sort it out. No prizes for guessing that this is Metallgesellschaft. The company sacked Mr Arthur Benson, the person it blamed for the mess. It replaced him with Ms Nancy Kropp, an oil trader with a history of fire-fighting (she had helped Deutsche Bank, MG's main banker, with a similar - though lesser - disaster at German company Kloekner in the 1980s.) The first option facing you, as the new risk manager, is simply to do nothing. In your heart, perhaps, you think the oil price won't fall much further. The company has already taken the pain of meeting the margin calls. Also, if the oil price stays low, the future profits on contracts with customers will eventually match the derivatives losses. It will all come out in the wash. This was certainly the view of some derivatives experts when the MG problem blew up last December. The second option is to keep the existing positions, and buy another big hedge. This was Mr Benson's preferred route. His solution: buy a huge put option, to protect the company from any further fall in the oil price. This, in the view of the new management, was akin to shutting the stable door after the horse had bolted. The third option is to shrink both sides of the book: end some of the delivery contracts with customers and sell the matching 'hedges,' drastically reducing the company's positions. This is the route chosen by Ms Kropp. Mr Benson, who is suing MG and Deutsche Bank, claims her approach has led to real losses, rather than just the paper losses incurred under his strategy. She sold at the very bottom of the market, he says. Ms Kropp's decision appears to have been based largely on the impracticality of running such a vast derivatives book. According to one person familiar with the new MG hedging strategy, rolling over the short-term hedges was causing losses (real, not paper) of Dollars 50m a month: MG comprised such a large part of the market that nothing it did was invisible. As it lumbered forward, it was prey to other traders. 'The position was self-defeating. With such a large position, you become the market. The whole market was watching.' The right answer? Who knows. MG is not about to reveal details of its remaining positions, or the cost of the partial liquidation. There is one clear lesson from all of this, though: hedging strategies that look fine on paper often don't work in practice, particularly when they involve handling large volumes in thinly-traded markets.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Arkadiy Zheludkov report: "On the War Path. Soiree for </F> Yesterday's DEN or Today's ZAVTRA"]    [Text] The soiree for the spiritual opposition newspaper  ZAVTRA in the weight-lifting room at the Izmaylovo sports  complex, which was filled to bursting, resembled least of all a  quiet celebration of yesterday's DEN; it was more like the rally  by the supporters of resolute action to restore Soviet power  that began 9 May, involving virtually the same people, the same  demands, and the same confidence in the future.    The soiree's leaders ascended the weight-lifting podium with  confident stride: At the head came Aleksandr Rutskoy, like a  standard bearer, with everyone else behind. Rutskoy was the  first to speak after the soiree's master of ceremonies,  Aleksandr Prokhanov. The former vice president's speech was not  very reminiscent of his first meeting with a national-patriotic  audience, in the Rossiya movie theater -- the former pilot did  not have his usual sheet of paper, and there were none of the  usual prompters to tell him the correct pronunciation of the  names of Russian philosophical theoreticians. To quote the  state's former number two, the first thing that troubled  Aleksandr Rutskoy was the reason for the gathering. Forgetting  that he was just the first act in a preplanned spectacle, the  general asked his audience and comrades in arms: "What brings  us together?" Lust for power or the desire to live a worthy  life? However, Aleksandr Rutskoy soon made it clear that he was  only reiterating ideas voiced 9 May and that the purpose of the  gathering was to prepare everything to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the victory in time for 9 May 1995 and the  personal victory over "Yeltsin's and Kozyrev's mongrel policy."    Then came Ilya Konstantinov's recollections of his  impressions after reading a book by Victor Hugo; Aleksandr  Prokhanov's repeated assurances that all the people gathered  here were free agents (the soiree did indeed begin at 1830 hours  and, judging by the mood of the audience, no one was in a hurry  to go home). Aleksandr Prokhanov, who usually complains about  the dominance of the democratic press, suddenly bragged that the  opposition has around 100 newspapers countrywide and said that  he still remembers a dark corridor at "Ostankino," two candles,  and then the office of General Achalov, who told all the "mass  media" forthwith: "We want peace, but let them return their  plunder." And he also asked for the Soviet armed forces'  reputation to be restored.    The undoubted highlight of the evening was Nevzorov, who  described the "charming agrarians" now in the Duma who "wear the  same suit throughout their working life," and how Burbulis  behaves when he sits next to him at meetings, and finally made  the optimistic promise that "everything will be restored"  shortly.    The most touching moment of the evening was when Aleksandr  Nevzorov was given some flowers: A boy sent by some adult ran  up onto the weight-lifting podium and over to the soiree  presidium rostrum and spent a long time wondering to whom to  give the bouquet. "Whose boy is this?" Aleksandr Prokhanov  asked over the microphone and affectionately beckoned the boy  over. The kid took a long time to leave the stage, amid the  friendly laughter of the free agents in the room. Albert  Makashov went up to the microphone right after the boy and was  introduced by Aleksandr Prokhanov with a riddle: "Who ran  through the White House on foot in a black beret like a wolf  from the first to the 13th floor?" Gen. Makashov angrily asked  God to clear the country of prostitutes and the mafia, or else  he and his comrades would do it themselves "if you do not have  the time, God"; he also promised to hand over his shoulder  boards to anyone who would unite them [sentence as published].  It was probably for the special benefit of those people  gathered at Izmaylovo that evening who thought about uniting all  the readers of Prokhanov's newspaper in the future and obtaining  Gen. Makashov's shoulder boards that the following books were  sold in the foyer: "Mein Kampf," Zyuganov's memoirs, and a  political biography of Rutskoy, alongside cassettes of ponderous  German Army marches.    "All Russia is in the mire" -- that was the beginning of a  poem by General Titov, the most peaceable of all the generals at  the soiree. "I must live in peace and harmony," Mikhail  Georgiyevich continued, and gave the following reason: "I  belong to the heroic generation that stopped fascism." And he  asked the free agents to consider Prokhanov the people's editor  of what is indeed a people's newspaper and Boris Yeltsin as  Russia's first and last president, stipulating however for the  press that he personally favors the peaceful way of resolving  the problem.    A soiree that should have demonstrated the unity of the  whole  opposition nonetheless left observers with plenty of questions:  General Sterligov, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Viktor Aksyuchits's  Christian Democrats, Vasilyev's "Pamyat," Astafyev's Christian  Democrats, and many others did not want to subscribe to Russia's  unity. And Aleksandr Rutskoy himself, as a representative of  his party courteously told your IZVESTIYA correspondent, was the  only official delegate from the Free Russia People's Party. So  Gen. Makashov can rest easy over his shoulder boards.</p>

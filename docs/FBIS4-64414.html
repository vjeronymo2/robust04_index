			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, Apr. 30, INA -- Leader of the Turkish  Prosperity Party Necmittin Erbakan said perpetuation of the  embargo on the people of Iraq is a crime against humanity.  Speaking in the course of a meeting with the Iraqi ambassador  in Ankara on Friday [29 April], Mr Erbakan called for the  immediate lifting of the embargo and said that all  justifications led to imposing it no more exist since Iraq had  implemented its obligations toward the Security Council  resolutions. He said the Turkish economy was greatly affected  by the embargo and that the United States is not concerned with  Turkey's losses which totalled some 10 billion dollars since it  is realizing its interests and greeds.    Mr Erbakan added that his party which won the local  elections  in most of Turkey's major cities would continue its unlimited  support of the people of Iraqi leading to the lifting of the  embargo.    The Turkish party leader criticised the Turkish government's  attitudes in carrying on the implementation of the embargo  against Iraq despite the big economic losses inflicted on Turkey  and said there is no option before the Turkish government now  but to move toward Iraq and restore normal relationss and ending  the embargo. He added that influential circles inside the  Security Council with the United States and Britain in the  forefront fabricate all pretexts so that the council would not  implement its obligations toward Iraq and continue the starving  of the Iraqi people.</p>

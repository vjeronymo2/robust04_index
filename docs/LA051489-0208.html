			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'DEVIOUS WORLD. . .WHERE I NOW TOTALLY EXIST'  </P> <P> This is the text of the letter written by David L. Schoenecker to newspaper  columnist Bob Emmers.  </P> <P> Dear Mr. Emmers,  </P> <P> Last Friday night I shot and killed my wife. There is a very strong possibility  that no one has discovered her body so I suggest you have the police check 7871  E. Amanda Circle in Anaheim.  </P> <P> There was no hatred -- I loved her -- but the action was necessary because I  have a purpose and one that can not have an interruption or interference.  </P> <P> Over the past few years I have had this sense, images, that I know exactly what  is going to happen well before it actually occurs. At first I simply dismissed  these -- sensations -- or whatever, but when I started to see certain events,  very clearly I knew there was more to this than just daydreams or dreams or  nightmares.  </P> <P> What I was seeing, and seeing more than once, were events and occurances in my  life involving people that -- I not sure of a good word -- had done wrong or  evil against me. The sensation I was . . . and feeling is that all will be made  right and I will be the force to make it right.  </P> <P> Several times I tried to explain these "happenings" to gail (my wife) but she  dismissed them. I was never understood. I knew that as these feelings and  "pictures" continued to occur and repeat that I had to prepare a way, develope  a plan, make arrangements. And I have done so.  </P> <P> Now, I had to eliminate my wife. She wouldn't believe me. She wouldn't even  listen. So in order to keep her from finding out, I developed a seperate plan  or storyline that totally misled her, but it did make her happy. She was very  happy on Friday.  </P> <P> gail suspected that we were missing a great deal of money. She also was upset  about several of my trips. Recently she started to figure that I must be doing  something else with my time and our money.  </P> <P> gail reasoned only in black and white -- good and bad. She never dealt in the  grey or devious world. A world where I now totally exist.  </P> <P> I've left a list -- a partial list. Not everyone on the list will receive total  punishment -- but they will be punished. The images in my mind shows me exactly  how and when and where the punishment will be delivered. It has to be done.  </P> <P> All my life I've kept a diary like all of my famous generals. Well, now I am  going to open that diary and rediscover exactly what occured. The evil-doers  that have been shown to me and those in my diary will direct my actions.  </P> <P> Now you're asking why I am writing to you. Well, I've been alone all of my  life. Except for the companionship of my dogs, I have never been close enough  to anyone to really discuss my feelings. When I tried, as with gail, I was  laughed at or not understood. gail failed to comprehend how deep the hurt  inside my heart is for all the lost opportunities. So I've chosen you to talk  to and through you to the people on the list.  </P> <P> I will strike without warning against some of the people on the list. These are  the ones for whom the images and pictures are the strongest and repeated the  most frequent. These are the ones who were . . . the ones were failed to act  properly. These are people who should suffer great pain in their punishment and  the pictures in my mind indicate they will.  </P> <P> As for some others, I think I will let them know that their day is coming, so I  will write and give you a name or two -- so you can do as you chose. I think I  can trust you and I know you have connections which will allow you to contact  the list members better than anyone else.  </P> <P> Evil is not Evil. Death is not Evil. It is the intent, the word, the failed  duty that is the real evil. This is now so clear. I see the words, I see the  deeds, but I can not turn away.  </P> <P> I'll write again.  </P> <P> Please contact gails parents Earl and June Borchardt. They'll never understand,  but it won't matter anymore.  </P> <P> D.L. Schoenecker  </P> <P> Missoula Montana  </P> <P> May 8, 1989.  </P> <P> P.S. This is for real. If you are in doubt, all you have to do is wait.  </P></p>

The Modern Enterprise System Is the  Foundation of the Socialist Market Economic Structure    1. Enterprises are the market's basic economic units  and are the main body of competition. Establishing the status  of enterprises as the main body is an essential question in the  establishment of the socialist market economic structure.  While erecting a macroscopic framework for the market economic  structure, we must reshape the foundation for the market  economic structure and establish a modern enterprise system that  is in keeping with the socialist market economic structure.    2. Enterprise reform has always been central to the  entire economic structure reform. Over the past 15 years,  enterprise reform has basically proceeded in keeping with the  idea of separating ownership and the right of management,  expanding the self-managing power of enterprises, reforming the  forms of management, orienting enterprises to the market, and  invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.  The fact that the Regulations on Changing the Management  Mechanism of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People  was put into practice has further ensured that enterprises have  self-management power and has driven the reform of other  aspects. The Regulations on the Supervision of the Assets of  State-Owned Enterprises to be introduced soon will define  property rights and responsibilities, ensure the supervisory  function, and straighten out the property rights relationships,  laying the groundwork for enterprises to enter the market.    3. Following the deep-going development of China's economic  structure reform, the underlying causes of the inadequate  vitality of state-owned enterprises has further been exposed,  the main ones being the undefined property rights relationships,  the irrationality of the organizational system, and the fact  that the management system is unscientific. Therefore,  the further deepening of enterprise reform necessitates  the tackling of deep-seated contradictions, a change from policy  readjustment, whose main contents are power delegation and the  concession of interests, to focussing on innovations in the  enterprise system, exploring an effective method of combining  public ownership and market economy, further liberating and  developing productive forces, and consolidating and perfecting  the socialist system.    4. The modern enterprise system is the product of market  economy and large-scale socialized production. It is a fruit of  civilization created by men in the course of practice and is the  common wealth of mankind. It is necessary to absorb and use the  beneficial experiences of developed countries around the world  in light of China's reality and establish a Chinese-style modern  enterprise system that conforms to China's national conditions  and that is in keeping with international practice.    5. The modern enterprise system China is going to  establish is a new type of enterprise system that meets the  requirements of socialist market economy, that takes the  standardized and complete legal entity system [qi ye fa ren zhi  0120 2814 3127 0086 0455] as the mainstay, and that takes the  limited liability system as the core. Its basic  characteristics are: Government administration and enterprise  management are separated, property rights relationships are  clearly defined, the ownership of the state-owned assets of  enterprises is held by the state, and enterprises have corporate  property rights and are independent legal entities that operate  independently and assume sole responsibility for profits and  losses. Enterprises, as legal entities, possess all rights over  the assets formed by investments from various sources, including  the State, and become legal entities that enjoy rights and  shoulder responsibilities under civil law. They assume  responsibility to investors for maintaining and increasing the  value of assets. The investors, as owners, enjoy rights and  interests commensurate with their shares of capital investment  in enterprises and assume limited liabilities. Enterprises  organize production and operations in keeping with market needs  and aim at improving labor productivity and economic returns,  and the government does not directly interfere with their  managerial activities. Enterprises are to formulate rules,  establish a scientific and standardized leadership structure and  organizational and management system, and coordinate the  relationships between the owners, managers, and staff and  workers, thus forming a management mechanism that integrates  encouragement and regulation. Enterprises operate in accordance  with the law, have taxes levied on them according to  regulations, accept government supervision, and meet the state's  macroscopic regulation and control.    6. In establishing a modern enterprise system, it is  necessary to adhere to the status of the public-owned economy as  the mainstay and to the leading role of the state-owned  economy and allow the simultaneous development of all  economic sectors. Large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises are the pillars of China's economy and focusing on  pursuing the modern enterprise system in these enterprises is a  positive exploration and is of great significance to promoting  the deepening of reform and to establishing a socialist market  economic structure. Enterprise reform whose contents are to  establish a modern enterprise system will continue to be central  to establishing a socialist market economic structure.    II. Straighten Out the Property Rights Relationships  and Perfect the Legal Entity System    7. In order to establish a modern enterprise system, it is  necessary to perfect China's legal entity system. Under the  traditional planned economic structure, state-owned enterprises,  as the subsidiaries of state administrative organizations, did  not have the status of independent legal persons. The state was  the sole investor and competition was out of the question.  Although the state has, in the course of practicing the planned  commodity economy, established the legal entity system in the  form of law, it is an incomplete legal entity system. Although  nominally state- owned enterprises have the status of legal  persons, they have no independent property rights which  are indispensable to legal persons and they have difficulty  establishing a property restricting mechanism. In these  circumstances, they only assume responsibility for profits but  not for losses, and the state still assumes unlimited liability  for enterprises and enterprises are still not real independent  legal persons.    8. The state-owned assets of enterprises are owned by  the whole people, that is, by the state. The State Council  exercises the right of ownership of the assets on behalf of the  state. To state- owned enterprises, the essence of the legal  entity system is to confirm that the state possesses ownership  of the property and that enterprises possess independent legal  property rights and accordingly enjoy rights and shoulder  responsibilities under civil law. Confirming their legal  property rights will continue to change enterprises from having  someone assume responsibility to having the capability of  assuming responsibility and achieve the integration of their  civil rights capacity and the capacity for action, forming in  the market thousands of legal entities that assume sole  responsibility for profits and losses.    9. In order to confirm the legal property rights, it is  necessary to straighten out property rights relationships and  separate the ownership of investors from the property  rights of legal persons. Under some conditions, the ownership of  investors is reflected in their possession of stock rights, that  is, as shareholders, they enjoy such rights as profiting from  the assets, choosing managers, participating in the making of  major policy decisions, and transferring stock rights.  Investors cannot manipulate the part of a legal person's  property that belongs to themselves. They can only exercise  their rights as shareholders to influence the behavior of the  enterprise, but cannot directly interfere with the managerial  activities of the enterprise. The legal property rights  are reflected in the fact that enterprises enjoy the rights of  occupying, using, profiting from, and disposing of the property  of legal persons and assume responsibility for their own  managerial activities with independent property. The  ownership and legal property rights of investors have been  confirmed by law and are protected by law and are inviolable.    10. For state-owned enterprises, confirming the legal  property rights will not change the state's status as the owner  and the only change is the mode by which the state manages  state-owned assets, that is, a change from the management of  assets in physical form to the management of assets in value  form. What is important is that both the value increases of and  returns on the state-owned assets of enterprises belong to the  state. The state assumes responsibility for the business risks  of enterprises limited to only the amount of its capital  investment. Moreover, by holding state-owned stock rights, the  state can expand the scope of control and readjustment of  state-owned assets, that is, control a larger amount of capital  with a certain proportion of capital. It can also achieve the  rational flow of state-owned assets and the optimum allocation  of resources through the exchange of property rights, this being  conducive to the structural readjustment of the stock of  state-owned assets and to maintaining and increasing their value.    11. When enterprises possess the legal property rights, we  should ensure that they assume sole responsibility for profits  and losses by establishing the capital fund system and the  assets management responsibility system. We should encourage  enterprises to manipulate, utilize, and handle their own assets,  and to vitalize the stock of assets and achieve an effective  increase in value. In this way we should put an end to the  inseparability of government and enterprises functions and lay a  groundwork for enterprises to get rid of the status of  subsidiaries of government administrative institutions.    12. We should straighten out the property rights  relationships and perfect the legal entity system, creating  conditions for the effective integration of public ownership and  market economy. On the one hand, the state possesses  ownership and thus ensures the nature of the public ownership of  property. On the other hand, by establishing legal  property rights, enterprises will become real commodity  producers and managers that operate independently and that  assume sole responsibility for profits and losses. This  has shaped a diversified economic main body that meets the  requirements for the operation of the market economic structure,  is conducive to bringing into play the fundamental role of  market economy in resource allocation under the state's  macroscopic regulation and control, and enables state-owned  assets to operate effectively under market economic conditions  and to have their value maintained and increased during their  flow. Following the flowing and reorganization of property  rights, all sorts of ownerships intermingle and economic units  whose assets are owned by a mixture of parties will gradually  increase. As far as the whole country is concerned, different  regions and different trades and industries can differ in the  role of public ownership as the mainstay in their national  economy. The role of public ownership as the mainstay is mainly  embodied in such aspects as the dominant position of public  assets in aggregate social assets, the public-owned economy's  control over the lifeblood of the national economy, and its  influence on and guiding role in economic development.    III. The Organizational System of Modern  Enterprises    13. In keeping with the requirements of market economy, the  organizational patterns of modern enterprises should not be  delineated by the nature of their ownership, but should be  delineated in accordance with the forms of composition of their  assets and the legal responsibilities they assume. They are  generally categorized as sole proprietorship, partnership, and  corporation internationally. The first two are enterprises of  natural persons in which the investors assume unlimited  liability, whereas the corporation is a corporate enterprise  which mainly includes the limited liability company and the  limited liability stock company in which the investor assumes  limited liability commensurate with his amount of capital  investment. In China, in addition to the above forms of  organization, there is the company funded solely by the state,  the state-owned state-run enterprise, and the cooperative stock  enterprise. The corporation is an important form in the  organization of modern enterprises and has effectively separated  the ownership of investors from the property rights of the legal  person and has such characteristics as having wide sources of  funds pooling, limited investment risk, and a scientific  organizational system. It is typical and representative of the  organizational patterns of modern enterprises.    14. Corporations have already formed a complete  organizational system in the development of market economy. The  most obvious characteristic is that through the  corporation's authority institution, decisionmaking and  management institution, and supervisory institution, the owners,  managers, and producers form mutually restricting relationships,  whereby they are all independent and their rights and  responsibilities are clearly defined. Moreover, this can be  established and achieved through the law and the articles of  incorporation. This organizational system both gives the  managers full independent rights and conscientiously safeguards  the rights and interests of the owners while being able to bring  the initiative of the producers into play at the same time.    15. We can generally consider the organizational composition  of a corporation as follows:    -- The meeting of shareholders is the institution of  supreme authority of a company. It has the power to choose  and dismiss the members of the board of directors and the board  of supervisors, formulate and amend the articles of  incorporation, and examine and approve the company's major  matters, including its fiscal budget and actual budget,  investments, and profit distribution.    -- The board of directors is the managing and  policymaking institution of a company. Its functions are  to execute the resolutions adopted at the meeting of  shareholders, make policy decisions about production and  management for the company, and appoint and dismiss the  company's general manager. Its members comprise representatives  of shareholders and representatives of other quarters.  The chairman of the board is elected by the board of  directors and is generally the legal representative of the  company. The board of directors makes policy decisions  collectively. Each director has one vote, and decisions are  approved by a simple majority. Members of the board of  directors have to sign their votes for the record and assume  responsibility for them. This is good for policy decisions to  be democratic and scientific and examines the directors'  capability for making policy decisions at the same time.    The company general manager is in charge of the  company's daily operational and managerial activities and takes  on overall leadership of the company's production and  management. He discharges his functions in accordance with  the articles of incorporation and as authorized by the board of  directors and is responsible to the board of directors.  The board of directors invites the general manager to  serve rather than having him appointed by the higher  authorities. The personnel and salary relationships of  directors and managers are separated from the state's  administrative system.    -- The board of supervisors is the company's  supervisory institution. It comprises shareholders and  representatives of staff and workers according to certain  proportions and is responsible to the meeting of shareholders.  The board of supervisors supervises, in accordance with law and  with the articles of incorporation, the activities of the board  of directors and managers in the course of their discharging  their functions and prevents them from abusing their powers.  The board of supervisors has the right to examine and check the  company's financial status, safeguarding the company's interests  and the legitimacy of the company's business activities. The  board of supervisors can put forward proposals concerning the  appointment and dismissal of the directors and managers and  about their reward and punishment. In order to ensure  independence of supervision, the supervisors must not assume  managerial or supervisory posts with the company.    16. There can be some flexibility in the organizational  pattern of companies. Considering the convenience of the  structural convergence and operation of enterprises funded  solely by the state we can use another kind of organizational  structure, that is, setting up the board of supervisors outside  the company and above the board of directors. The board of  supervisors comprises representatives selected by government  supervisory departments; authoritative economic, financial,  legal, and technical experts appointed by government supervisory  departments; and representatives of staff and workers according  to certain proportions. The chairman of the board of  supervisors is appointed by government organizations. The  functions of the board of supervisors are: To appoint and  dismiss the members of the board of directors and the general  manager and make decisions about rewards and punishments;  supervise the company's management and the maintenance and  increase of its assets; and examine the enterprise's financial  report and major proposals concerning investment, financing, and  profit distribution without exercising the enterprise's right to  make policies concerning management. Using this pattern is  favorable to enterprises converging with the Regulations on the  Supervision and Management of the Assets of State-Owned  Enterprises and is favorable to staff and workers participating  in the management of the enterprise.    Moreover, it is favorable to the reform of government  departments in the future. Furthermore, we can generally  combine the board of directors and the group of managers (their  numbers should not be too large), that is, the board of  directors is the managing group of the company and the chairman  of the board acts also as the general manager and vice chairmen  act as vice general managers. This method is favorable to  enterprises converging with the factory director (manager)  responsibility system as provided for by the Enterprise Law and  protects the incentive of the factory directors (managers) of  large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.    The majority of enterprises that have not practiced the  corporate system should continue to stick to and perfect the  factory director (manager) responsibility system.    17. In establishing a Chinese-style modern enterprise  system,  it is necessary to bring into play the role of the  enterprise's party committee as the political core and  ensure that the policies and principles of supervising the party  and state are implemented. It is necessary to improve the  structure of the leading group of the enterprise's party  committee and increase the proportion of party members in the  administrative leadership. Party and government leaders can  take over each other's posts alternately, and they can assume  party and government posts at the same time if they meet the  requirements. The institution establishment and personnel  allocation of the enterprise's party committee should proceed in  such a way that they are competent and highly efficient and that  the enterprise can make independent decisions. The party  committee of an enterprise should pay good attention to  fostering the party and spiritual civilization and pay good  attention to ensuring supervision while rallying around the  enterprise's central task. As for an enterprise practicing the  corporate system, its party committee leaders can join the board  of directors and the board of supervisors through legal  procedures and thus participate in making policy decisions  concerning the enterprise's major issues.    18. Instituting democratic management by staff and  workers is one of the characteristics of the modern enterprise  system. It is necessary to enhance the sense of  responsibility of staff and workers as masters of their own  affairs and bring into play their initiative and creativity. In  state-owned and state-run enterprises and companies funded  solely by the state it is necessary to bring into play the role  of the representative assembly of staff and workers and the role  of trade unions and strengthen democratic management. In  enterprises that practice the corporate system, their trade  unions communicate the opinions and demands of their staff and  workers to the board of directors and the board of supervisors  and safeguard the legitimate rights of staff and workers.  Representatives of staff and workers should be organized and  recommended for joining the board of supervisors to participate  in the supervision of enterprise operations and management.  <H5>  IV. The Modern Enterprise Management System </H5>   19. A scientific enterprise management system is an  important  part of the modern enterprise system. Proceeding from  overcoming the weaknesses in China's existing enterprise  management system and improving enterprises' economic returns,  we should establish a modern enterprise management system  with the emphasis on reforming enterprises' structural  establishment and their labor use system, wage system, and  financial and accounting systems, and institute a strict  responsibility system.    20. The structural establishment should be decided by  enterprises themselves in keeping with the characteristics of  production and management and with the needs of market  competition and in line with the principles of clearly defining  functions, rationalizing the structure, using competent  personnel, and keeping rights commensurate with  responsibilities. It is necessary to emphatically stress  management systems, including development, quality, business and  sales, finance, and information, and improve the decisionmaking  expertise, enterprise quality, and economic returns. Large  enterprises and enterprise groups can gradually form the  management patterns of investment centers, profit centers, and  cost centers.    21. Establish a modern enterprise labor employment  system. Reform the method of the state's directly managing  labor employment and change the employer from the state to the  enterprise. Enterprises enjoy the right to employ their  own labor independently according to law and laborers have the  right to choose their own careers independently according to  law. The employment contract is the basic form of  establishing and readjusting labor relationships. The labor  relationship between an enterprise and a laborer is established  when the two parties sign the employment contract of their own  accord and the contract is the basis for safeguarding their  legitimate rights and interests. Eliminate the identity  boundaries between staff and workers and between cadres and  workers within an enterprise, between different forms of  employment, and between enterprises employing different forms of  ownership. It is necessary to establish and perfect the social  security system and the labor force market as soon as possible  and form an employment mechanism for an employing unit and a  laborer to choose each other and rationally flow to each  other. At present, it is necessary to continue to proceed  with the reform of the labor system whose main body is the  all-personnel labor contract system and make good arrangements  for the allocation of the surplus staff and workers of  enterprises in keeping with the principles that enterprises  mainly make the arrangements on their own while the state helps  in the process and that the basic livelihood of staff and  workers be guaranteed.    22. Establish a modern enterprise wage system.  The orientation of reform is to achieve enterprises'  independent distribution in the complete sense, namely that with  well-defined enterprise property rights and a sound  self-regulating mechanism and on the premise that the growth  rate of total wages is lower than the rate of increase of  enterprises' economic returns and that the average wage increase  rate of staff and workers is lower than the rate of increase of  their labor productivity, enterprises enjoy the full independent  right to distribute wages and the state does not directly  interfere with their wage distribution, but legislates for,  guides, and regulates and controls it on the macro scale.  The supply-demand situation in the labor power market  plays an essential role in determining wage levels. Wage  increases are usually determined through collective  consultation. The incomes of managers, the maintenance  and increase of the value of assets, and the profits of  enterprises are linked with one another; and the incomes of  staff and workers are determined according to their skills and  to their actual contributions in terms of labor so as to  implement the principle of "to each according to his work" and  to bring into full play the stimulating role of wages. At  present, it is necessary to further improve the method of  linking total wages with economic returns and combine all kinds  of allowances, bonuses, and other fringe benefits into wages so  that staff and workers receive their wages in a physical form  and in a standardized way.    23. Establish a modern enterprise financial and  accounting system. We should conscientiously implement the  "Accounting Rules for Enterprises" and establish an enterprise  financial and accounting system that is in keeping with  international practice. We should change the practice of  determining the financial and accounting systems of enterprises  in keeping with their different forms of ownership,  organizational patterns, and forms of management. Strengthen  enterprises' internal financial management and perfect their  auditing system. We should form an auditing supervisory  mechanism for enterprises through their internal auditing  institutions and through social auditing forces. We should  abandon the concept of "state-run enterprises keeping within  budgets," which was formed under the conditions of unified state  control over income and expenditure, and change the status of  state- owned enterprises as units that set fiscal budgets.    24. We should build up the contingent of staff and workers  and elevate enterprise culture and improve the quality of  enterprises in an all-round way. We should foster fine  professional ethics and a spirit of making sacrifices among  staff and workers and foster a spirit of cooperation in unity,  loving their professions and their factories, observing the law,  being faithful to their word, and being ready for new  explorations and innovations.  <H5>  V. Steps for Establishing a Modern Enterprise System </H5>   25. Establishing a modern enterprise system is an arduous  task and necessitates experimentation and the accumulation of  experience. We will gradually establish it in the approximately  seven years before the year 2000.    In establishing a modern enterprise system, the focus  is to change the management mechanism of state-owned  enterprises. At the present time, it is necessary to continue  to conscientiously implement the Enterprise Law and the  Regulations on Changing the Management Mechanism of Industrial  Enterprises Owned by the Whole People, change government  functions in earnest, give 100 percent of various independent  rights to enterprises, conscientiously put into practice the  Regulations on the Supervision and Management of State- Owned  Assets, and carry out the responsibility of maintaining and  increasing the value of state-owned assets. We should  quicken the readjustment of the organizational structure of  enterprises and gradually form a mechanism of competition. We  should resolutely prevent the unwarranted pooling of funds and  the arbitrary requisition of donations from enterprises, reduce  the burden of enterprises in their support of social  undertakings, and create fine external conditions for them to  enter the market and participate in fair competition.    26. We should pursue the modern enterprise system in light  of  the actual situation of China's enterprises and adopt a variety  of forms and treat specific cases differently.    -- As for enterprises engaging in special industries and  dealing in special products having to do with national security,  national defense, and sophisticated technology, we must continue  to retain their state ownership and put them under direct state  control and management. If some of them are fitted for the  corporate system, we should restructure them in keeping with the  structure of companies owned solely by the state. However,  where possible we should not have one company monopolizing the  whole trade or industry.    -- Large and medium-sized enterprises having the necessary  conditions can be restructured in keeping with the structure of  ordinary companies and absorb nonstate funds.    -- We should vigorously and steadily develop a number of  large enterprise groups which are transregional and embrace  several trades and that have public ownership as their mainstay  and are linked by assets, and bring into play their important  role in promoting structural readjustment, raising returns  through economies of scale, accelerating the development of new  technologies and new products, and enhancing competitiveness in  the international market.    -- Small state-owned enterprises should also be standardized  in keeping with the modern enterprise system. Some can be  changed into limited liability companies; some can be changed to  the partnership system in the form of stock sharing; some can be  contracted out and leased for private management without  changing their state ownership; and others can be be sold by  auction, transferring their property rights. In the long run,  the majority of small state-owned enterprises should gradually  transfer their property rights to collectives or individuals,  and the state will achieve a capital funds shift, divert the  incomes from such sales to industries that urgently need  developing, and use them in structural readjustment, allocating  personnel, and supporting the establishment of a social security  system.    -- Urban and rural collective enterprises should be changed  into partnership enterprises, enterprises employing partnership  in the form of stock sharing, and limited liability companies on  the basis of defining the sources of their assets and defining  their property rights relationships and in keeping with their  different situations. A few whose scale is large and whose  returns are good and which conform to the industrial policy can  be changed into limited liability stock companies or enterprise  groups.    27. The corporation is an effective organizational pattern  of  the modern enterprise system. Reorganizing some of the large  and medium-sized enterprises from the current "factory system"  into the "corporate system" is a great reform in China's  enterprise system and is of great significance in changing the  management mechanism of state-owned enterprises, enhancing their  competitiveness in the market, and bringing into better play  their leading role.    In reorganizing enterprises into the corporate system, we  should follow these three principles: 1) Reorganization should  proceed in accordance with the law. After the Company Law is  promulgated, relevant departments should formulate regulations  on company reorganization or methods for standardization and  make good preparations before reorganization. 2) Conditional  reorganization. For enterprises reorganizing into the corporate  system, they must conduct feasibility studies, set up a rational  stock rights structure, strictly assess and audit their assets,  formulate the articles of incorporation, and so forth. It is  necessary to prevent those enterprises that do not need  reorganization and that do not have the necessary conditions  from rigidly reorganizing into the corporate system and from  simply changing their company names. 3) Through  experimentation, company reorganization should proceed in  accordance with their different types and in different periods  and in groups. We should first experiment with enterprises  whose profits are comparatively good, whose burdens are  comparatively light, and whose leading groups are of  comparatively good quality. When we have obtained experience, we  should gradually promote it. We should prevent reorganizing them  at the same time.    28. As for the reorganization of enterprises into the  corporate system, most enterprises should choose the form of the  limited liability company. The limited liability company  has the characteristics of raising small amounts of funds, being  easy to operate, being easy to change over, and entailing low  reorganization costs. We can, in the first place, reorganize  into limited liability companies those enterprises that conform  to the state's industrial policy, that occupy an important place  in their own areas or trades, that produce comparatively good  economic returns, and that have practiced joint operations. A  small number of limited liability companies which have made  profits for three consecutive years and which meet the  requirements can change into limited liability stock companies.  As for enterprises directly reorganizing into limited liability  stock companies or changing from the directional pooling of  funds to having their shares traded on the market, we should  strictly examine their qualifications and comply with  examination and approval procedures in such a way as to be  responsible to public investors. The number of listed limited  liability stock companies is only extremely small and we should  focus on changing them from medium-sized enterprises into large  enterprises that act as the state's pillar industries.    29. Except for special trades or industries,  state-owned enterprises generally should be reorganized into  limited liability companies in which many shareholders hold  shares so as to be conducive to the standardization of their  operation. Ways of achieving this include: Scattering  stock rights among different investing units and encouraging  legal persons to hold each others' shares; changing creditors'  rights to stock rights with the consent of the creditors and the  debtors; attracting foreign investors to buy stocks and  improving the structure of stock ownership; and attracting all  kinds of funds from society to buy shares, including the funds  set up for staff and workers within enterprises.    30. Clear and dispose of the historical debts of  state-owned enterprises incurred as a result of policies so that  they can participate in market competition equally. The  reasons for the historical debts of enterprises are complicated,  and some debts have been left over as a result of policy  adjustment during the changeover from the old economic structure  to the new, while others have been caused by the improper  management and operation of enterprises. We should cope with  them in light of different situations. Debts arising from  enterprises' expanding business and developing production are  normal. During enterprises' entry into the market, the  historical debts incurred as a result of the state's policies  should be disposed of where the financial capability allows.  For example, the state's capital funds were increased when the  "giving of loans instead of appropriations" was changed to  "investing instead of giving loans" between 1983 and 1985. As  for the loan losses caused by irresistible objective reasons and  the policy mistakes of higher authorities, enterprises should  have their periods of repayment extended without the imposition  of interest if they are already making efforts and are in a  position to repay the debts. Some should be allowed to repay  debts later with interest calculated. Others should have  interest suspended. Where bad debts exist, they can be written  off as bank losses after they have been seriously examined by  the deposit banks and with the approval of relevant departments.  As for debts incurred as a result of improper management,  enterprises must repay them themselves. Those which have been  making losses for a long time and whose assets cannot cover  their debts and the curbing of whose losses is hopelessly  impossible should be made bankrupt according to law.    31. In pursuing a modern enterprise system, we badly need  large numbers of operational and management personnel that both  possess specialized knowledge and modern management experience  and are innovative and can usher in new prospects. This is an  important factor in the success or failure of the modern  enterprise system. As modern entrepreneurs, operational and  management personnel should become professionals with the  guarantee of credit and prestige.    It is necessary to vigorously train a contingent of  entrepreneurs and gradually form a management system that  meets the needs of market economy from personnel selection to  appraisal to dismissal.    32. We should be fully aware of the formidability and  complexity of establishing a modern enterprise system. For  company reorganization, the main responsibility of government  supervisory departments is to study overall preparations and  measures, formulate relevant policies and regulations, promote  experimentation, sum up experiences, give guidance, actively  encourage and steadily proceed with the establishment, practice  no formalism, and ensure the success rate of reorganization.  <H3>  IV. Quicken Matching Reforms and Improve Enterprises'  External Environment (Extracts [as published]) </H3>   33. When establishing a modern enterprise system, we must  conduct matching comprehensive reforms in the macroeconomic  management system, the market system, the social security  system, and so forth.    34. We should reform government organizations, streamline  the  administrative structure, and change government functions as  soon as possible, and change from the direct management of  economic activities to their indirect regulation and control.    35. We should establish a system for the macroscopic  regulation and control of socialist market economy.    -- The state is to set forth the goal and direction for  economic development, formulate industrial policies, and guide  the direction of enterprises' investment.    -- It should standardize the tax system on the basis of  practicing the revenue-sharing system.    -- It should transform specialized banks into  enterprise-style commercial banks and introduce the mechanism of  competition, creating a fine environment for enterprises to pool  funds.    36. We should conscientiously implement the Regulations on  the Supervision and Management of State-Owned Assets and  establish a new state-assets management system that both  guarantees the maintenance and increase of the value of  state-owned assets and promotes enterprises' operating with high  efficiency and full vitality. The State Council exercises the  functions of the owner of state-owned assets on behalf of the  state. Where possible, we should directly consign to groups of  companies and large enterprises the rights over state-owned  assets so as to change them into holding companies. We should  establish state-owned assets management companies mainly for  medium-sized and small enterprises and they should manage state-  owned assets in value form.    37. Vigorously foster the market and establish a  complete market system. First, straighten price  relationships.

He also  distributed 500 housing units to extremist Jews who publicly  insist they will stay on this Syrian territory and not give it  back to its owners, even in return for peace.    The Israeli minister has pledged to develop and expand  Zionist settlements on the Golan. Naturally, Ben-Eli'ezer was  assigned by the Rabin government to carry out this blatant,  provocative action, which is part of new-old scheme to undermine  the peace process, sabotage the U.S. initiative, circumvent in  advance the results of the Clinton-al-Asad summit, and put the  United States and the world face to face with a fait accompli.    Everybody knows that Israel has tried, since the signing of  the Oslo agreement, to mislead the world and the United States  by claiming that peace has been established in the region, that  the Palestine question has been resolved, and that peace efforts  on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks can be put on hold.    Furthermore, Israel has feverishly sought to marginalize  Syria's role, exclude Security Council resolutions, and replace  the objective of a just and comprehensive peace with separate  deals, such as the Gaza-Jericho agreement. However, all these  misleading attempts did not last long. The Americans, and the  world, have discovered that the Oslo agreement will not lead to  peace and that it has created new obstacles to a comprehensive  solution in the Middle East.    It was not merely a courtesy that Secretary Christopher  praised Syria's key role in the peace process and arranged for a  summit meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. Since  the announcement of the summit, the Israelis have cast doubt on  the point behind it and leaked misleading information about an  alleged Syrian role in this or that incident. Their maneuvers,  however, did not find any response. So they decided to move  from casting doubts to provocation. Thus, they encouraged  Zionist settlers to settle on the Golan and pledged to provide  all possible assistance to expand the existing settlements.  This was done in the hope of perplexing the Clinton  administration and planting mines to obstruct serious U.S.  efforts to advance the peace process on the Syrian and Lebanese  tracks.    The Israelis and the entire world know perfectly well that  peace in the Middle East is impossible without Syria's effective  participation. They also know that peace with Syria depends on  returning all of the occupied Golan and evacuating the settlers.  The Israelis and the world further know that when Syria says no,  it means what is says. Syria will not relinquish any territory  or rights; nor will it bargain over any inch of territory or any  rights. If Israel does not want peace and is seeking separate  deals that bolster occupation and usurpation, then the  international community knows there can be no peace in the  Middle East until it rests on the principles of justice and  right and UN resolutions. Certainly there can be no peace  without Syria's effective participation.    Inasmuch as Syria believes in and works for a just and  comprehensive peace, it adheres to its occupied territory and  those of the Arabs and resists blackmail and relinquishment.    The Golan is Syrian and shall remain so, whatever  settlements  Israel builds on it. Syria will not relinquish an iota of the  Golan. Certainly, there will be no peace in the region or with  Syria without the full return of the Golan to its kinsfolk and  sons.    Such familiar provocative Israeli policies can only  undermine the chances for peace. This requires that the  international community have a firm stance. Peace is the cause  of all nations, and it can no longer remain silent on Israel's  deliberate sabotage of U.S. and international peace efforts.</p>

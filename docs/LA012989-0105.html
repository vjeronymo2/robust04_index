			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The price of beer and spirits doubled as the Nicaraguan government prepared  tough new austerity measures to combat inflation running at over 21,000% a  year. Manufacturers announced a 120% increase in beer prices, a 100% hike for  rum and soft drinks and a 75% increase for some brands of cigarettes. The  latest increases brought the cost of 24 bottles of beer to $12.50 and a case of  lemonade to $7.50, which is more than many workers earn in a month. President  Daniel Ortega called a special session of Nicaragua's National Assembly for  Monday to announce an economic plan for 1989.  </P></p>

As Interfax learned in the government, this  resolution is likely to be signed by Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin.    At the same time the former government newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI, which declared independence in early January, will be  "made free" without any state subsidies. However, in expert  opinion, this decision may cause a conflict between the  government and the State Duma, which will most demand the return  of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA.    In early October last year the former newspaper of the  Russian Supreme Soviet was reorganized by its then general  director Pavel Gurin, former press-secretary of Viktor  Chernomyrdin.    The ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA problem will be probably discussed at  a meeting between Chernomyrdin and Speaker of the State Duma  Ivan Rybkin, which is expected to take place this week. If they  reach a compromise another solution is possible, whereas  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA will return to the parliament and ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI to the government of the Russian Federation in a  reorganized form and under the title DERZHAVA.    Otherwise the Duma will have to create a new newspaper of  its  own which would require additional multi-million expenses, which  is is unlikely in the present economic situation.</p>

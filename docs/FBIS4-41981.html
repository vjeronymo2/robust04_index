			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Yevgeniy Terekhov, and others]    [Text] Mikhail Beliy, director of the First Asian  Department in the Russian Foreign Ministry, told Interfax  Wednesday that international sanctions against Pyongyang were  not on the agenda any more as the U.S. and North Korea were  scheduled to hold talks in Geneva on July 8 and a summit meeting  of the two Koreas was to be held on July 25.    He said that Moscow welcomed the understanding on holding  the  first summit of North an South Korea. Beliy noted that this  idea was not new but until now it had never gone beyond the  coordination stage. He thought that if all barriers were  overcome this time, a new page might begin in the relations  between the two Koreas.    Beliy added that Russia still thought an international  conference on the Korean peninsula had to be held. He explained  that since the beginning of 1994 three crises had been about to  break out in the peninsula. When it attenuated somewhat, it  used to be followed by a stronger one, he said. For this  reason, Beliy believed, a multilateral conference might work  where bilateral talks failed.    He did not think that the American-North Korean dialog would  not necessarily be a success because the problems were too  complicated to be solved quickly. This was the reason why  Russia would press for an international conference.</p>

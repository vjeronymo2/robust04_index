			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed station commentary] </F>   [Text] A U.S. invasion of Haiti would be a gross mistake.  U.S. President Bill Clinton's latest threats to invade Haiti to  dislodge the military somewhat contradict the modern dictum of  respect for others. The Haitian military continues to control  power and prevent constitutional President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide from returning home. The events in Iraq, then Panama,  and now Haiti clearly demonstrate the United States has become  the international police force that tightens the reins of anyone  who steps out of line.    The case of Panama was very denigrating and offensive to the  dignity of the Latin American nations. The invasion of Panama  City by forces stationed in the Canal Zone destroyed the humble  buildings of many poor neighborhoods and ended the lives of many  Panamanians. The wounded and disabled survivors, who still  suffer the traumas of the massive attacks by U.S. gunships,  continue their plight from door to door demanding a modest  compensation that would allow them to continue surviving and  rebuild their poor huts, which U.S. artillery flattened.    The same could occur in Haiti; this is very disturbing,  because thousands of Haitians will lose their lives, huts, and  belongings if an invasion of the island does in fact occur. We  do not know, however, what kind of reaction to expect from an  angered people as patriotic as the Haitians. We believe a U.S.  invasion of Haiti would not be the picnic Panama was. The  Haitians will set a high price to their defeat. It will  undoubtedly be a massacre that will in no way benefit the image  of the powerful nation of the north. That does not matter.  Clinton has already said: The Haitian military can vary this  situation today if they wish; otherwise, they must face the  consequences. The Haitian military must understand the grave  nature of this decision and try and find a negotiated way out,  while saving face and avoiding any signs of surrender.    The Haitian people do not deserve to be massacred. They have  already suffered so much that there are no more tears left to  cry; this means nothing to Clinton. He wants to restore  democracy by fire and force, because they are the world's  policemen, and they say God gave them that power. Meanwhile,  all the other Latin American Nations, in their roles as  observers, have simply said go right ahead.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, Yasir 'Arafat's special </F> adviser, by 'Adi Talmor in the studio on 9 April; from the "In  the Current Situation" program --recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Talmor] Mr. al-Tibi, you  spoke with Yasir 'Arafat last night, and you have also met him  in Cairo over the last few days. Is he still silent on the  issue of terrorism? Has he explained to you why is he  refraining from publicly denouncing these terrorist acts?    [Al-Tibi] Look, I was with the chairman in Cairo before we  received the news about the murder in 'Afula. At the time  'Arafat held a meeting with the Spanish foreign minister; there  were a lot of Spanish, Egyptian, and other foreign journalists  who wanted to speak to him about other issues, but he left the  place. He did not want to speak to them. Later he refused to  meet other journalists, some of them Israelis....    [Talmor, interrupting] Washington, however, is exerting  great pressure on him.    [Al-Tibi continues] After we received the report about the  murderous attack on innocent civilians in 'Afula we held a  closed meeting in which we formulated an unequivocal  statement....    [Talmor, interrupting] Why has 'Arafat himself not denounced  this attack, as Rabin publicly and firmly did after the Hebron  massacre.    [Al-Tibi] The chairman participated with us in formulating a  statement, in which we expressed regret....    [Talmor, interrupting] I want to ask again, why is 'Arafat  afraid to publicly denounce these terrorist acts?    [Al-Tibi continues] ...and condolences for the bereaved  families. This was done on behalf of the chairman, who said in  the past that innocent people must not be harmed. This  statement would not have been accepted without the chairman's  involvement and approval. His position regarding such violence  and terrorism is known; only a month ago he sharply denounced  the murder of Mrs. Shoshan. I believe that the PLO statement  was unequivocal. What the chairman told us on this issue is  extremely clear and firm.    [Talmor] Why, then, does Washington still insist that  'Arafat publicly denounce these acts?    [Al-Tibi] The 'Afula attack is doubtlessly a most terrible  murder of innocent people. A murder is a murder is a murder. I  believe this attack must be denounced.    [Talmor] I, however, still insist 'Arafat should publicly  denounce the attack. Some people claim, for example, that he is  afraid to publicly denounce the attack because of PLO  rapprochement efforts with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement].  Some people even claim the PLO is coordinating with Hamas, and  a public denunciation of Hamas terror acts could harm these  efforts.    [Al-Tibi] These claims are utter nonsense. The PLO's and  'Arafat's stand on violence and terrorism is known and is  expressed whenever there are such grave incidents. This  position was also expressed after the murder of Mrs. Shoshan.  There is absolutely no coordination between the PLO and Hamas  in this area, and whoever says so does not know what he is  talking about. This issue does not deserve any further comment.    [Talmor] Despite the recent acts of terrorism and the fact  that it was the PLO that halted the negotiations following the  Hebron massacre, the Israeli Government yesterday said it wants  to facilitate the negotiations, while accusing you of delaying  the talks. What is your reaction to this?    [Al-Tibi] It was the Israeli side that suspended the talks  several days ago, not the Palestinians. They did this due to  Holocaust Memorial Day. But instead of halting the talks for  one day only they did it for three days. The claim that the  Palestinians halted the talks is baseless. It is in our  interest to end the talks as soon as possible in order to  immediately receive the authority and power in Gaza and Jericho.  At this point there are still controversial issues, due to  obstacles placed by the Israeli delegation on the way to  achieving an agreement between the two sides -- mainly in  relation to the deployment of the Palestinian police force; the  timetable for such a deployment; legal responsibility, and other  issues I do not want to broach.    [Talmor] Do you believe you will be able to control the area  when you receive the authority?    [Al-Tibi] At this point the PLO is still not in control of  the occupied territories. It is far away from them. The IDF is  in charge there at the present time. I believe that in future  the Palestinians will maintain full control of all areas under  their authority.</p>

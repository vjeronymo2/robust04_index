			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> GLASNOST DOESN'T WORRY CLANCY  </P> <P> Author Tom Clancy, master of Cold War thrillers, says he's not worried that the  warming of relations between the superpowers will put his career on ice.  </P> <P> Pretending to point a gun at a questioner, Clancy said: "I stand like this for  30 years, and then the 31st year I say, 'Hey, you're not such a bad guy after  all,' but I don't move. Would you still be worried?"  </P> <P> As long as the Soviet Union remains a Communist military power, Clancy said  he'll find plenty of grist for his best-selling novels of Soviet-U.S. conflict  and intrigue.  </P> <P> During a visit Thursday to his alma mater, Loyola High School, Clancy said his  Jesuit instructors were firm in teaching him the difference between right and  wrong.  </P> <P> "These guys don't let you forget. They beat it into your head," he said.  </P> <P> Clancy, who is the son of a Baltimore mail carrier, said he was a "crummy  student" at Loyola but then started to dream of becoming a writer.  </P></p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Gephardt hopeful of changes to Nafta CONGRESSMAN Richard Gephardt, leader of the majority Democrats in the US House of Representatives, has held out the possibility of measures that would modify the North American Free Trade Agreement enough to bring him to vote for it, writes George Graham in Washington. Mr Gephardt last week announced that he would vote against Nafta as it stood, since side agreements on environmental and labour issues negotiated by President Bill Clinton still left it deficient. However, Mr Gephardt said he was considering mechanisms to address his two concerns about labour rights and wages in Mexico, and the financing of environmental and infrastructure work along the US-Mexican border. While President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico has promised an increase in Mexico's minimum wage in line with productivity gains, Mr Gephardt said he was looking at ways of tying wages to productivity. For funding work along the Mexican border, Mr Gephardt said he favoured a fee on any item that crossed the border in either direction.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] Minister of the Presidency Oscar Alfredo Santamaria  today denied that the government received any official document  sent by the UN secretary general on nonfulfillment of the peace  agreements.    During this past weekend, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front] coordinator Shafik Handal reported that Butrus  Butrus-Ghali told a delegation of former guerrillas who were  visiting the United Nations that he had sent a letter to  President Alfredo Cristiani in which he asked him to accelerate  the application of some agreements, such as the deployment of  the PNC [Civilian National Police], the former fighters'  rejoining civilian life, and the transfer of land.    A UN spokesman recently notified an FMLN delegation that  traveled to the United Nations that Butrus Butrus-Ghali had sent  a letter to President Cristiani requesting that he make use of  his power with the same interest so that some pending agreements  related to the PNC and the transfer of land be implemented.  However, the minister of the presidency denied this report.    [Begin Santamaria recording] We have not received any  notification from the UN secretary general. [end recording]    Santamaria explained that the government, the FMLN, and  Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] are working on a new  schedule with regard to the deployment of the PNC. The official  added that nonetheless, the PNC issue is moving ahead well with  regard to deployment. He also said that it is false that the  government is not interested in fulfilling its commitments.    [Begin Santamaria recording] The United Nations has made no  such statement. All I can say is that at the end of its  transition period, this government is committed to having  concluded and implemented all of its agreements. Naturally,  some of them will continue, because some agreements are  scheduled to be concluded after the transition period. [end  recording]    Nonetheless, Dr. Santamaria admitted there are some delays  in  the programs to have the former fighters rejoining civilian life  related to the transfer of land. According to him, this is due  to the lack of financial support which the international  community had promised to solve.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INCENTIVE TO STUDY;  </P> <P> PROGRAM GIVES STUDENTS EARLY START IN COLLEGE  </P> <P> A year's worth of college credit and the guarantee of admission to West Los  Angeles College and UCLA are being offered to a select group of Hamilton High  School minority and low-income students as an incentive to continue their  education.  </P> <P> This year, about 160 Hamilton students will participate in the "supergraduate  program." Students in the program can take college courses to earn up to 32  units of credit while working on their high school diplomas. After graduation,  they will attend West Los Angeles College for one year to earn an associate  degree. They can then transfer to UCLA.  </P> <P> The program, which is financed by a $15,000 grant from the Sears-Roebuck  Foundation, will begin this summer with 10th- and 11th-graders, school  officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Win-Win Situation'  </P> <P> Los Angeles Schools Supt. Leonard Britton said the program will encourage  students to stay in school.  </P> <P> "It will broaden their experience. . . . It's a win-win situation for students,  teachers, schools, for everyone," said Britton who spoke at a press conference  attended by officials from Los Angeles schools, West Los Angeles College and  UCLA.  </P> <P> Donald Phelps, chancellor of the Los Angeles Community College District that  includes West Los Angeles College, said the program is designed to attract  students who might be intimidated by a college setting. "I want to see them  early on. They need to feel that you don't have to be 18 years old to go to a  college," he said.  </P> <P> Students will be given additional training in study skills, essay writing and  library use, school official said. They also will be helped with the transition  from high school to college with tutoring and special guidance programs. A  parents group will be organized to provide additional support, school officials  said. "It's not just a matter of recruiting kids, it's making sure that they  have the tools to be successful," said Eva Baker, associate dean of UCLA's  Graduate School of Education.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Academic Requirements  </P> <P> Students in the program are required to remain in good academic standing,  maintaining at least a B-minus average each semester at Hamilton and at West  Los Angeles Community College. Those who fail to do so will be placed on  academic probation for two semesters. Students who remain on probation for more  than two semesters will be dropped from the program.  </P> <P> School officials said other high schools are considering similar programs.  </P> <P> School board member Alan Gershman, whose district includes Hamilton High  School, called the program an "exciting example of a new educational  partnership."  </P> <P> All three institutions will benefit from the program, school officials said.  Hamilton will increase the number of college-bound students; West Los Angeles  College will receive students motivated to complete their courses, and UCLA  will increase the number of minority transfer students.  </P> <P> Hamilton is accepting applications for admission to the program. A committee of  teachers from Hamilton, West Los Angeles College and UCLA will select the  participants.  </P></p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Britannia struggles to stay afloat: Why the royal yacht could be heading for stormy waters The elegant shape of the royal yacht Britannia has been highly visible at the D-Day anniversary commemorations. Whether reviewing the fleet at Spithead or anchored off Omaha Beach, Normandy, it has provided the Queen with a floating palace. But behind the scenes, a confidential civil service review body has been putting the finishing touches to a report that could scupper the Britannia. Both its running costs and low level of use have been under scrutiny. 'The president of the USA doesn't feel the need for a yacht,' says Welsh Labour MP Alan Williams. 'It's shades of the British empire and the last days of the Raj when the natives would be impressed by this great big boat sailing in to their harbour. The Britannia is a throwback to a bygone age.' At 408ft overall, the Britannia is not the biggest private vessel afloat. That distinction belongs to the Abdul Aziz, owned by the Saudi royal family and fitted out with gold taps and surface-to-air missiles - work done amid great secrecy by the British firm Vospers. But it seldom leaves its home port of Jeddah and creates nothing like the world-wide attention focused on Britannia. Earlier this year, the British vessel notched up its millionth sea mile. In 1993, it spent 157 days at sea. And this is the heart of its problem. In motoring terms, the 40-year-old ship is an elderly Rolls-Royce with too many miles on the clock. Unlike classic cars, which can be kept safely in a garage until required, an ocean-going ship must be able to tackle the worst weather imaginable in total safety - especially if the head of state is aboard. Britannia last had a thorough re-fit - upgrading its engines and other systems - in 1987. This cost Pounds 17m. The next such overhaul is due in three years and might easily cost three times as much. Whether to accept this bill, or take a more radical route, is the choice facing the review committee. The Queen launched the vessel at John Brown's yard on the Clyde, near Glasgow, in 1953 - the first year of her reign. The ship was very special to the young monarch for reasons explained by her consort, Prince Philip, once a Royal Navy career officer who commanded a frigate. 'Almost every previous sovereign has been responsible for building a church, a castle, a palace, or just a house,' he said. 'The only comparable structure built in the present reign is the Britannia.' There was another, more poignant aspect. Victoria &amp; Albert, the previous royal yacht, was a steam-powered relic of the 19th century, and was unseaworthy. Doctors to the Queen's ailing father, King George VI, said his failing health might be restored if he could undertake sea voyages. But George VI died four months before the keel of Britannia was laid. In the austerity of post-war Britain, economy was a watchword at the shipyard. The lines for the new yacht were taken from two newly-built North Sea ferries. 'Our brief was to build a robust structure with an ocean-going capacity. It was also to be an advert for British shipbuilding at its best,' said Dr John Brown, the yard's chief naval architect. With such humble beginnings, it is a wonder that Britannia emerged for its maiden voyage in 1954 with the classic elegance of line which can thrill even its financial detractors. 'Its looks seem to improve with age,' remarked Sir Hugh Casson, who designed many of the interiors in the onboard royal apartments. The trick is in the detail. The almost unnatural smoothness of the hull is a result of Brown going back to Victorian shipbuilding techniques. Instead of using rivets on the plating, internal butt straps joined the steel without a mark or blemish on the outside. Britannia's reputation became blemished, however, during the Falkland Islands conflict in 1982. According to the Ministry of Defence, Britannia was to have a front-line role as a hospital ship in wartime. Wards for 200 patients could be installed in the royal apartments, with operating theatre and laboratory facilities in the bowels of the ship. Yet when the time came, Britannia proved useless. It could not be sent to the South Atlantic because it used heavy fuel oil and every other Royal Navy ship used diesel. The SS Uganda, a cruise liner, was chartered instead and Britannia sank a little in British public esteem. The royal yacht has become a cuckoo-in-the-nest for the Navy. At the time of its launch, the white ensign flew all around the world, fluttering above an organisation possessing enormous manpower and equivalent budgets. Now, the rear-admiral commanding Britannia and the 228 officers and men who serve with him, take resources from a much smaller pool. Conservative MP Julian Brazie said: 'At a time when the defence budget is being stretched beyond belief and we have the smallest fleet since the 17th century, I don't think funding of the yacht can be justified. Britannia has no military capability whatsoever. It's as simple as that.' In 1991/92, the last year for which official figures are available, the personnel cost to the Royal Navy of manning Britannia was Pounds 4m. And the financial compensations are few, with the main one being the promotion of Britain's exports to hard-headed business leaders who still find an invitation to spend a day on the Queen of England's yacht irresistible. Even so, the royal family makes more use of the yacht: in 1992 the royals spent 27 days aboard, while the commercial world spent only three. It has been argued that if commercial use of Britannia was increased, the Pounds 12m-a-year running costs could be transferred to a government department such as the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Opponents, however, argue that the yacht would then be turned into a mid-range executive hotel, wiping out its royal cachet. Within months, the review body will issue its recommendations on the yacht's future. The options range from the scrapyard, to increases in funding. The most radical step would be to sell Britannia and build a new yacht - smaller, modern and much cheaper to run - with costs met by the Ministry of Defence, the DTI or even the royal household itself. If the 5,769-ton yacht, with one careful owner, went on sale, there would be potential buyers. 'I think Britannia would be sold instantly,' said Jonathan Beckett, a partner in yacht brokers Nigel Burgess Ltd. 'It would be the kudos, not the boat. And it would have to be a fairly substantial owner to afford the running costs. There are one or two Japanese institutions who would find it intriguing to own that kind of yacht.' Beckett believes Britannia is either worth a lot or very little: 'No second-hand yacht has ever changed hands for more Dollars 30m, although that ceiling is going to be broken very soon.' Shipbuilding sources say that if Britannia were to be built today the ex-yard cost would be close to Dollars 150m. However, as ship costs increase exponentially with displacement, a 200ft yacht might cost only a quarter of that figure, which might make a new royal yacht acceptable. Rumours abound - but the small close-knit, super-yacht industry believes that Britannia's days as the royal yacht are numbered. There is nothing new in this debate, of course: the decision to build Britannia was taken by the Neville Chamberlain's government in 1938, although construction was delayed by the second world war. Cabinet minutes state: 'In the course of the discussion, the importance was emphasised of avoiding any possibility that the king might be exposed to criticism by building the yacht. 'The kind of argument that might be used for political discussion was that money was not available for the unemployed but could be . . . found for a new yacht.'</p>

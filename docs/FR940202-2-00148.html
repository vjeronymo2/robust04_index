			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the programs supported under this grant competition, the Corporation is sponsoring other Summer of Safety initiatives. These are briefly described in Appendix 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public agencies (including law enforcement agencies, local units of government, health/social service agencies, etc.), nonprofit organizations (including youth-servin groups, community based organizations, service organizations, etc.), institutions of higher education, and Indian tribes are eligible to apply. State agencies that intend to operate the program directly are also eligible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While a single entity may be the actual recipient of the grant thereby responsible for financial administration and program management we expect that the Summer of safety programs will be conducted by working partnerships among any or all of the above types of organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Funding Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Summer of Safety grants may be made from one of three sources of funds: Subtitle H of the Act (Investment for Quality and Innovation), Subtitle B&hyph;2 of the Act (Learn and Serve America: Higher Education) and Subtitle C of the Act (AmeriCorps Grants). Applicants should specify which type of funding they are seeking. While Subtitle H carries no restrictions, Subtitles B&hyph;2 and C contain the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtitle B&hyph;2 requires, among other things, that an applicant be an institution of higher education (or a consortium of such institutions), or a partnership of public or private nonprofit organizations and one or more institutions of higher education. Programs must involve, but are not limited to, current students. Pursuant to the Act, priority will be given to applications that meet certain characteristics, as detailed in Appendix 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation will ensure that at least 50% of the funds awarded under Subtitle C will support projects that will be conducted in areas of need, as detailed in Appendix 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beyond the requirements specific to the Subtitles from which the funding originates, applicants must meet all other requirements in this notice, regardless of the type of funds being requested. Proposals that do not indicate a preferred type of funding will be reviewed as the Corporation deems appropriate. Each of the two types of funds require a non-Corporation match of at least 25% of program costs. The Corporation has the flexibility to ensure that the highest quality proposals are funded, regardless of whether they are submitted under Subtitle B2 or Subtitle C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Content of Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Summer of Safety applicants should submit program proposals that contain the sections noted below and meet the requirements in this notice. Should you desire further guidance on the format of your proposal, you should contact the Corporation at 202/606&hyph;4949. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

Program Narrative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A narrative describing the proposed program should contain sections that respond to the following requirements: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Community Need/Anticipated Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The paramount goal of Summer of Safety is to address problems of crime, violence and fear in the communities where programs are conducted. To have such an impact, problems must be identified and defined and strategies developed which have specific objectives. Accordingly, successful proposals will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Discuss the specific needs or problems that exist in the target community/neighborhood(s) which the project will address. Sources of official data (demographic data, crime offense data, etc.), public opinion surveys, expert analysis, and other sources of local information are all useful. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Describe specifically how the program will address the identified problem(s). Outcomes must be direct and demonstrable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the goal of every project should be the reduction of crime, violence and fear, it may be very difficult to document such accomplishments, given the limited time during which a summer program can operate. Accordingly, as well as quantifiable measures of outcome, there may also be intermediate measures of effort and accomplishment which are appropriate as specific objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of such objectives each of which should address only one activity and include one result may include reduction in reported crime of XX% (generally, or in more limited focus, i.e., robberies of convenience stores, gang-related assaults, attacks against senior citizens, etc.), XX% of neighborhood residents feel safer compared to before program, XX victims of violent crime assisted at court or at home, XX Safe Houses established, XX playgrounds refurbished and supervised, XX ``crack houses'' rehabilitated, XX youth provided crime prevention/violence reduction training, etc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Hundreds die in Egypt fuel blaze More than 410 people were killed in southern Egypt yesterday, most of them when blazing fuel flooded into a village from a depot struck by lightning, officials in the town of Assiut said, Reuter reports from Assiut. A health official said hospitals had received 229 corpses from the stricken village of Dronka; a security official said another 122 corpses were still lying on the ground there. Flooding killed 63 others, the official said. Lightning struck the complex of eight fuel tanks holding 15,000 tonnes of aircraft and motor fuel after a thunderstorm had raged for at least five hours, an Assiut official said. The complex was still on fire at 6 pm local time. A new blaze had started in another storage tank. Firefighters decided to let the fire burn itself out. The governor of Assiut Province declared a state of emergency, sending in rescue units and army firefighters to try to control the flames. The missing included at least 10 men trapped in a mosque during prayers and a maintenance crew working inside the storage complex. The fuel tanks are operated by a subsidiary of the state-run Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). EGPC officials in Cairo declined to comment on the incident. One said a team of experts was travelling to Assiut to assess the damage to the tanks, used as a strategic fuel reserve for the defence ministry. Meteorologists in Cairo said the storm was one of the worst in Egypt's history.</p>

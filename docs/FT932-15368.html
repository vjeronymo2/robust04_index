			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / On-shore gas to fuel power station SCOTTISH POWER is to build a power station in North Yorkshire to be fuelled by what it says is Britain's largest on-shore sour gas field. Sour gas contains a significant amount of hydrogen sulphide and is normally unsuitable for household use. The 40MW to 50MW power station will generate enough power to provide electricity for a town of 15,000 people. Although small by comparison with other electricity plants, the station will underline the growing use of gas in power generation and the problems that causes for coal. The station is being built at Knapton in the Vale of Pickering between Scarborough and York. The gas - about 10m cubic feet daily - is being supplied by contract from Kelt UK in association with Edinburgh Oil and Gas, Marinex Exploration and Tullow Exploration. Output from the station will be connected to the national grid through Northern Electric's high-voltage system. The Department of Trade and Industry has granted planning permission for the project. Work will start within two months with completion expected in 1995. It has been agreed that if Kelt finds more gas in the area Scottish Power will have rights to its use.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- The mourners' group  of the North side formed to express condolences over the death  of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a South Korean reputed patriotic champion  of reunification, today released a statement denouncing the  South Korean authorities for blocking a working-level contact at  Panmunjom and not allowing the group to go to Seoul.    Their act is an insult to the deceased who devotedly  struggled for national reunification, the cherished desire of  the nation, and a violation of the beautiful manners and  customs, etiquette and morality handed down through generations,  the statement said, and continued:    Not allowing no more than five people to go to Seoul to  mourn  the death of Rev. Mun, the South Korean authorities clearly  showed once again that the "civilian" regime and the "civilian  administration" on their lips are a downright lie.    By preventing their call of condolence over the death of a  fellow countryman, the Kim Yong-sam group has left an indelible  stain in the history of the nation as the most despicable  traitor of the successive South Korean rulers.    The Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique charged the North side  with the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification  (Pomminnyon) and the "nuclear issue." [sentence as received] It  is a poor excuse for preventing a call of condolence from the  North side.    Its slander on Pomminnyon, a national umbrella organization  of the reunification movement, indicates that the Kim Yong-sam  regime is a group of anti-reunification elements and that to  charge the North over the fictitious "nuclear issue" proves that  they themselves are traitors subservient to foreign forces.    The behavior of blocking under an absurd pretext the call of  condolence prompted by compatriotic feelings and etiquette  showed that the Kim Yong-sam regime is in a very difficult  position in which it cannot receive even five mourners and has  but a few days left before it.    The people in the North, together with the fellow countrymen  in the South, will certainly settle accounts with the South  Korean rulers.    People of all walks of life in South Korea are now lifting  up  louder voices criticizing the Kim Yong-sam regime for blocking  the Seoul visit of our mourners' group. This is a serious  warning to the hooligans who know neither etiquette nor morality.    The Kim Yong-sam group hell bent on maintaining its power  while desperately pursuing the policy of depending on outside  forces, opposed to the national reconciliation and unity and the  reunification of the country, the cherished desire of the entire  fellow countrymen, will have to pay a high price before the  nation.</p>

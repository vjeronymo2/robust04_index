			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Yushchenko, Ukrainian National Bank </F> board chairman, by Petro Ovchar, under the rubric "An Interview  With an Element of Surprise"; place and date not given: "Viktor  Yushchenko: `My Heart Bleeds for Ukraine....'"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]    [Ovchar] Viktor Andriyovych, as they say, may God help you  to  translate this plan into reality.... Now we would like to  discuss strictly specific topics. Would you be so kind as to  tell us how the Ukrainian National Bank cooperates with  commercial banks? Have there been disagreements or problems? In  general, what is your vision of the banking system of Ukraine in  the future?    [Yushchenko] We might begin with the fact that a relevant  law  is the foundation for such cooperation in any state--a law on  banks and banking. Two years ago, such a law was passed here (at  the time, it was a democratic law). It set forth principles for  relations in a majority of areas of banking. However--this is  unambiguous--at present a legal foundation for the operation of  the banking system needs to be laid in order to build a strong  banking system. The difficulty lies in the fact that in the  course of 1,000 years of its history, Ukraine has had no  practice and experience in building a banking system, and the  central bank in particular. It was the periphery, a financial  province. We have now gained independence and our own monetary  space. However, many contradictions have developed. The National  Bank should be independent just as, for example, the Bundesbank  operates in Germany. There is no force in that state that could  cancel any decision of the Bundesbank. Only the chancellor has  the right to suspend its main actions--that is, the  Bundesbank's-- for 14 days. However, on the 15th day after a  decision is made it goes into effect. Is it surprising that the  independence of the Bundesbank has produced the strongest and  healthiest currency in the world--the Deutsche mark? All Germans  are grateful to the Bundesbank for upholding through its  independent position the standard of standards--its monetary  unit. That is, by now the following system has been created in  Germany: If a person receives a Deutsche Mark, he receives not  only tender, but also a means to save his wealth. Half a year  from now, it will be the same as it is today. This is one of the  functions of currency--to maintain the wealth of society in a  stable manner. However, independence in the operation of the  bank alone is not enough. We do remember that the relationship  between quantity and quality is a dialectical contradiction. A  single unit of emission already violates the ideology of  stability.    What is the case in our state? Let us recall this: Did  discussions not flare up at each of the past sessions of the  Supreme Council or meeting of the Presidium--do we, or do we not  have enough money in circulation? These discussions were  initiated by production managers--directors of enterprises,  kolkhoz chairmen, and others. We have a collective form of  undermining the force of the national currency because for me as  a banker the question of whether we have enough currency in  circulation does not exist even in theory. As it is, the formula  of operation of money in circulation is extremely simple: The  total amount of money corresponds to the quantity of goods times  their prices. The quantity of goods multiplied by prices  produces money. If there is less money today while the quantity  of goods is the same, their prices will be consequently lower.  This is a simple, classical tenet, the golden rule of monetary  circulation. In no country of the world do discussions develop  over whether enough currency is in circulation because everyone  understands that currency is in circulation, second after second.    At present, state structures account for 94 percent in our  country. Many of them have their representatives in the  parliament. They, these representatives, start the discussions  about the currency shortage with just one objective: to improve  the condition of their production units. As it is, they have no  money because of the inefficient production of goods, which in  addition sit forever in the warehouses because they are not in  demand strictly due to their consumer features. Then state  officials say: "Let us support this or that enterprise through  emission because this is an important sector...." A decision  concerning emission is made, and we obscure the picture of the  market: We throw in a new portion of money, and the potentially  bankrupt entity obtains new resources for its existence. This is  how the impression is created that its operations are rational.  One month passes, and the same problem arises.... I think that  everybody understands what the conclusion is: The real cause  cannot be eliminated by way of emission. We can merely postpone  it. Emission is a very peculiar lever. Certainly, it should be  used but the entire peculiarity of it is that the amount of  emission brings about the devaluation of the national currency.  There are things in a transitional economy that merit solving  certain problems through emission. However, how can, say, 15  percent out of the 94 percent of state monopoly enterprises be  switched to regular economic conditions? This would mean that 80  percent of the enterprises would be allowed to go into a free  fall, and the latter means free bankruptcies; this is a social  problem. In turn, an unsolved social problem brings about a  political conflict. Strikes, hunger strikes, demonstrations, and  so on begin.    A new membership of the Ukrainian Supreme Council has begun  its work. If this parliament does not create a safe atmosphere  for the operation of the banking system, including the  commercial system, we will experience many complications in the  area of economic restructuring.    With a view to streamlining the relations between the  National Bank and commercial banks, we have appointed this year  a special adviser to the National Bank board chairman who has  worked for 15 years as a manager of one of the regional  institutions of the Bundesbank. We are developing, putting it  figuratively, a tree of laws for the banking system of Ukraine  with his assistance. There will be two main laws: about the  National Bank and about commercial banks. This is the pillar on  which the entire banking system will rest.    [Ovchar] Certainly, for now you mean draft laws?    [Yushchenko] Of course, for now these are drafts. We have  sent them to the central banks of many countries of the world in  the hope of receiving consultations, remarks, and proposals. If  the Supreme Council passes these laws, a law on national  currency may also be adopted on the basis of them. If we keep  the form of management that we had a year ago we will never  build a healthy national monetary unit on such a basis. If we  fail to build it we will never ensure the classical functions of  currency.    We say that the national currency is a standard. It is so. I  will give the following example. Let us take, say, the meter as  the standard of length. As is known, it consists of 100  centimeters. Three days go by, and we say: The meter is the  standard of length, but there are only 98 centimeters in this  meter. Half a year passes, it is the same meter that is the  standard of length, but its value (in a figurative sense--the  value of the coupon) is then 70 or 60 centimeters. Then the  following question arises: Can anything be done under such  conditions? A standard is being violated, the standard of  standards! A currency can unite teachers, writers, steelworkers,  miners, and bankers....    The fourth quarter was dreadful for Ukrainian economy. All  of  this was a consequence of unprecedented emission-related  decisions to procure grain and sugar, and monumental problems  with the financial budget. We survived superhyperinflation. The  first quarter of this year produced an immediate reaction:  Production fell greatly. We just do not have the right to  operate in the chaos that occurred in the fourth quarter!  Therefore, controlling hyperinflation is the main economic  objective. If there is hyperinflation we will not have a state,  we will not have anything at all. Everyone's effort should be  enlisted in controlling hyperinflation--at the level of each  minister and each enterprise manager. As it were, inflation is  only advantageous for the rich who have access to currency from  emission and pernicious for all others who hold currency and do  not know that one day they may suddenly be robbed not by some  kind of street muggers but by the state, which has actually  already happened many times....    [Ovchar] Viktor Andriyovych, immediately after the  proclamation of Ukraine as an independent state, a massive sale  of apartments to foreign citizens began in Kiev, and not just in  Kiev. A paradoxical situation has developed: Foreigners who two  or three years ago bought apartments for $6,000-$8,000 are now  selling them for five to six times more. That is, without  incurring any outlays they profiteer at the expense of Ukraine,  at your expense and mine. What is your view of this situation?  Is there a way out of it?    [Yushchenko] The National Bank is aware of a technique to  overcome this situation. However, it is unfortunate that most  measures that should be taken are not the functions of the  National Bank. This question may be broadened and expanded to  many phenomena in our lives. We very frequently compare the  exchange rate of the Ukrainian karbovanets to the rate of the  American dollar and say: Isn't the U.S. currency strong!  However, there are interesting things that we forget. Let us  look at the dollar market while referring to the following  comparison. Let us walk along a street in, say, Kiev and a  similar street in any U.S. city. There, every square millimeter  of the street and each structure contributes to the dollar  because everything amounts to merchandise. Downtown is  merchandise, the periphery of the city is merchandise. What is  the case here? For example, there is a building opposite the  National Bank. It has nothing to do with the karbovanets because  it is the municipal sector. This sector is not a base for  reinforcing the Ukrainian currency. Over the past year, we have  changed the approach toward currency in certain areas. However,  in the classical interpretation we are still very far from it  being the symbol of the national monetary unit. If the stability  of currency is not supported by an economic budget (a package of  economic reforms), we will never have a stable currency.    So far, we have not liberalized prices, not only for  apartments, but also rents, electricity rates, and so on. A  system of two price lists is in effect. The state assumes a  proportion of such outlays through the budget. As a result of  this, a contradiction is created in the market. In this case, an  apartment in Kiev costs no less than in New York. However, in  view of the fact that our market is regulated by the state, that  is, the state assists us with financing, the apartment is cheap.  On the free market, the same apartment is appraised four times  higher. Since our state tampers with the market through  subsidies, the market value is distorted. The people who  understand market trends take advantage of this.    [Ovchar] If I understood you correctly, these people are not  to blame?    [Yushchenko] Certainly, it is the policy of the state rather  than these people that is to blame. For example, why does a rich  person in our state receive state subsidies for the square  meters of housing, for electricity, for subway fares, and so on,  and so forth? We need to liberalize prices. However, some may  object: If we liberalize prices for apartments, they would say,  5 million people will have no money to pay for them. So let the  state pay these 5 million, but not the rest of those who have an  opportunity to pay the real cost of apartments. How will our  nation grow rich if everyone receives the same state  compensation--those who make 30-40 million per month (there is  no concealing it--there are such people) and those who make,  say, 500,000 or less per month?    [Ovchar] Therefore, do we have an unhealthy social policy?    [Yushchenko] Precisely. For this reason, the National Bank  champions the poor people. Our position is: Do not reduce social  spending by a single karbovanets! However, the issue is how to  channel such spending specifically toward the poor, rather than  toward all. All states of the world always help the poor,  whereas we help everyone without distinction. This is a great  shortcoming of social policy that in two generations leads  toward us never having a healthy national currency under such  conditions.    We are used to working with distorted prices. For this  reason, there should be a special price policy of the state. I  will be more precise. We perceived the management of price  policy as the general suppression of real prices. This  differential between the real price and the one that is actually  in effect here is covered from the budget. At that point, those  from the budget organs come to the bank and say: "Print us money  because we have to pay for this and that." Printing money in  this particular manner means deliberately robbing the people.  For this reason, I attach great hopes to the new parliament  which, with assistance from us (I mean bankers, financiers, and  economists alike) should focus its attention on the social  problems of our people.

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Property: Suddenly, life on the farm is attractive again - Gerald Cadogan discovers that the economic clouds over agriculture now have some silver linings September 16 1992 - brought UK farmers an unexpected bonanza. Sterling's fall against the European Currency Unit (Ecu) brought them windfall gains in the 'green pounds' which are paid by the European Community under the Common Agricultural Policy for farm support and premiums. Then there was the low price of land (down 60 per cent in real terms over the past 13 years, says estate agent Savills), halved interest rates, and a realisation of just how generous were last year's changes in inheritance tax (IHT) relief for farms. Suddenly, agriculture was looking attractive again. Farm land now costs roughly Pounds 1,000-1,500 an acre (with the best silt land up to Pounds 2,500). The farmer receives the newly-enhanced payments for what he produces and can benefit from other money-generating schemes. He might, for instance, 'set aside' 15 per cent of his arable acreage and receive around Pounds 106 an acre a year, the precise amount depending on the Ecu exchange rate. (He must, however, rotate that 15 per cent and, sooner or later, will have to set aside his best land). Among other spurs, the government's farm woodland schemes pay well and encourage planting broad-leaved trees rather than conifers. There is even a Hedgerow Incentive Scheme which, ironically, pays Pounds 1.50-2.50 a metre for replacing hedges when, 20 years ago, farmers got grants to take them out. And the interest rate cuts - provided they are maintained for a long time - are a big help, as farmers rely on overdrafts to smooth their seasonal business. As for IHT, the 1992 Budget brought 100 per cent relief for farms in hand if they have been occupied for two years. (For tenanted farms, the relief is 50 per cent). It is hard to think of a greater stimulus, especially as using contractors to do the work still counts as farming in hand. Businessmen considering farming will welcome this arrangement. So will working farmers thinking of retirement; they can pay someone else to do the slog without IHT worries. That there was any farm market at all last year is significant. Strutt &amp; Parker, for instance, bought and sold 67,000 acres in 144 transactions. The sellers had had enough of high interest rates and the struggle to make a profit. Most of the buyers were other farmers, often those who had pulled out of the market in the 1980s (when businessmen channelling money into farms pushed up the prices) and saw a chance to round off their holdings while land was cheap and they had some money. Indeed, farmers who have survived the past two years have done well; the Ministry of Agriculture estimates that their incomes rose 24 per cent in 1992. Buying land still looks attractive, and prices have hardly gone up. Why? James Laing, of Strutt &amp; Parker, explains: 'There is uncertainty ahead, including what will happen when the green pound is re-set in July.' He has just sold all but one in a portfolio of nine farms around the country for Refuge Assurance, which regards them now as non-core investments. But the green pound might not suffer that much, although the sceptical are hedging against the Ecu or selling their crops forward to lock into present rates. Nicholas Leeming, of Humberts, points out: 'The farming lobbies of France and Germany are pretty vociferous. Levels will be set to suit them.' That will suit UK farmers equally. A substantial increase in land prices is unlikely unless supply cannot match the increasing demand. And although there are potential long-term bear factors - such as a rise in Hungarian cereal production, forecast by Savills' Bertie Ross - the future looks rosier than for a long time. Laing suggests that a businessman wanting to invest should probably go for an arable acreage because it is 'simpler and less risk.' Farms are available everywhere, with prices that include the farmhouse and outbuildings (although there is a shortage of large estates). And some make money from activities other than simple agriculture. Newton farm in Fife, Scotland, is one such. Close to St Andrews and Leuchars station for Edinburgh and London, and on offer from Strutt &amp; Parker in Edinburgh at over Pounds 500,000 for the main farm of 494 acres, it has a clay pigeon shoot, an off-road driving course for 4 X 4 enthusiasts (Pounds 12 an hour), and a trout loch that produced Pounds 38,600 in 1992. Cardwell farm, near Holbeach in Lincolnshire, grows cereals and vegetables on grade one silt land three miles south of The Wash. It is so productive that it does not need ancillary businesses and Savills offers its 990 acres as a whole for Pounds 2.3m, or in 10 lots. The same agent is selling a let estate of 599 acres at Bishopsthorpe, near Grimsby, for over Pounds 450,000. This comprises the more usual grade two and three land and produces rent of Pounds 29,315 a year. In rich country near Evesham, Gloucestershire, Hoden farm is just 194 acres of arable (although formerly a dairy unit). Charles R. Phillips is looking for around Pounds 300,000. Firs farm at Farnborough, near Banbury, Oxfordshire, is a 211-acre mixed operation on offer through Howkins &amp; Harrison for around Pounds 500,000. Just on the market - for the first time in 60 years - is Snitterfield fruit farm near Stratford-upon-Avon with 162 acres, 85 of them orchards and 16 for pick-your-own soft fruit. Four cold stores holding 50 tonnes apiece keep the produce fresh. The farm has been split into lots but the total guide price is around Pounds 580,000 (from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley). In Powys, Wales Phillips is selling Bron-Rhydd, in the hills near Llanwrtyd Wells, for Pounds 450-500,000. It has 530 acres for sheep and cattle. In south-west England, Strutt &amp; Parker in Exeter offers Stream farm at Broomfield, near Taunton, in one or two lots - totalling 222 mixed acres - for around Pounds 475,000. Last year, the owners opened a two-acre lake for fishing rainbow trout at a charge of Pounds 1-1.50 a day - which included two fish to take home.

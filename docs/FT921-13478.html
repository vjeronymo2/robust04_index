			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Land deal clearance by Ofwat THE OFFICE of Water Services (Ofwat), the economic regulator for the water industry, has announced that land sales by water companies valued at less than Pounds 500,000 will no longer have to be submitted for individual approval. The disposal of surplus land was a significant political issue in the run-up to privatisation two years ago. It was then decided that certificates and valuers' reports had to be submitted for all land sales to third parties worth more than Pounds 250,000 in London, Pounds 200,000 in the rest of the south-east and Pounds 150,000 elsewhere. The stringent rules were set up to ensure that all surplus land was properly accounted for, and sales were used to offset increases in water charges required to fund the industry's Pounds 18bn capital investment programme. Proceeds from any additional sales were to be divided equally between customers and shareholders of the water companies. Experience over the past two years has shown that in sales to independent third parties companies have been under pressure to secure the best price, and in these sales the interests of customers and shareholders have coincided. Removal of the certification procedure for small disposals will mean companies save on costs. Companies will be required to submit an annual summary to Ofwat on all land disposals, including transactions below the new Pounds 500,000 threshold. Ofwat said yesterday that greater scrutiny was still needed of land transfers made to associated companies within water companies. 'This is an area where the customers' interests need protecting the most, and so Ofwat will be redirecting its resources into examining these particular disposals more thoroughly.'

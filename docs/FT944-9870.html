			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / BNFL plans to sell off precision work business British Nuclear Fuels is planning to sell off some of its specialised high-precision manufacturing expertise within the next three years. It is currently exploiting this expertise to build new markets in the pharmaceutical, chemical and aerospace industries. However, it plans to sell this new business to its management once commercial viability is established. The new business will use techniques developed at Capenhurst, BNFL's engineering factory in the Wirral, to make components and vessels for its reprocessing plant at Sellafield. The techniques enable drums and containers to be mass-produced out of inch-thick stainless steel to an accuracy of three microns or three millionths of a metre - smaller than a particle of dust. Such accuracy is needed for nuclear safety. In an effort to secure non-nuclear spin-offs by transferring the manufacturing technology to products for other industries, state-owned BNFL has formed a wholly owned subsidiary called Deva Manufacturing Services and equipped it with Pounds 5m of computer-controlled and robotic machine tools on an industrial estate near Chester. Its first 30 employees are skilled Capenhurst workers who would have been made redundant following BNFL's rundown of activities now that Thorp, its thermal oxide reprocessing plant at Sellafield, has been completed. Deva's first contract is worth Pounds 50m over 10 years, making steel drums for storing intermediate-level nuclear waste. It plans to double turnover by selling high-precision steel products to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The company believes it will be able to exploit its ability to manufacture to tight tolerances. Industries moving to robotic production methods require vessels to fit exactly between robotic arms or automatic handling machinery. The nuclear storage drums cost about Pounds 1,800 each. Deva will also develop its own brand of a cheaper, re-useable stainless steel drum in the Pounds 250-Pounds 400 price range for the pharmaceutical industry. Mr Neville Chamberlain, BNFL's chief executive, said Deva's management would be encouraged to bid to buy the business out once it was established.</p>

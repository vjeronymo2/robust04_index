			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Quotes of the day Mr Norman Lamont, former chancellor: I have always been willing to be judged on my record. John Smith, Labour leader: Today's reshuffle is a panic measure by the prime minister, like a captain of a ship throwing his first mate off the bridge as they head for the rocks. Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats: This is just a new coat of paint for a discredited government. John MacGregor, transport secretary: I think Norman Lamont has had a pretty unfair treatment from the media really. Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles: The government is weak. If this is the way of securing party unity behind difficult and painful measures, then it had to be done. Nigel Richardson, an economist with Yamaichi International in London: It's extraordinary that the economy is picking up and inflation is at its lowest level since the 1960s and yet the chancellor is being forced to resign. Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of public service union Nalgo: Norman Lamont has been a disaster for Britain and his departure from the Treasury is at least a year too late.  But it's no use Major shuffling the cards. We need a new pack. Lamont Holdings (no relation) annual report: . . . this long period of depression appears to have bottomed out.</p>

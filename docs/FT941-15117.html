			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Company News This Week: Born again in carpets and kitchens - Magnet/Carpetright/MFI What goes around comes around, was Mr Alan Bowkett's summation of Berisford International's Pounds 56m acquisition of Magnet, the kitchen and joinery group, last week. That is certainly the conclusion to be drawn from the conjunction of three pieces of news: the Magnet deal, Carpetright's interim results this Thursday and MFI's interims next week. The three events mark the reappearance in public companies of retailers from the late 1980s. The fashion at that time was for leveraged buy-outs. It proved a particularly unsuccessful one. Sir Phil Harris sold his Lowndes Queensway business in 1988, setting up Carpetright shortly afterwards, and then saw it go under in 1990. MFI's MBO was done in 1987, which at least gave the group a couple of good years before the downturn in consumer spending caused by high interest rates  -which also crippled heavily indebted businesses - pushed it into a refinancing in 1989. It was then that Magnet's management undertook its Pounds 629m buy-out, which proved so disastrous for the backers. While Lowndes Queensway went into receivership - although its Carpetland business was bought by management in 1991 - and Magnet's parent company went into receivership in 1992, MFI has been a survivor. With MFI back on the stock market in 1992 and Carpetright in 1993, this year will see the return of Magnet if Berisford's reverse takeover is approved by shareholders. Now the hope is that trade is picking up once more. Magnet last week indicated that current sales were good. Analysts expect a good rise in interim profits from Carpetright to between Pounds 5.2m and Pounds 5.5m. Similarly, forecasts for MFI's interim results next week centre on Pounds 22.5m pre-tax, up from Pounds 12.7m, excluding the profit on MFI's sale of Carpetright shares.</p>

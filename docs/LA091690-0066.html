			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COURT'S RULE ON SECRECY SHINES WELCOMED LIGHT ON CIVIL TRIALS;  </P> <P> MORE WILL BENEFIT FROM PRODUCT-LIABILITY LAWSUITS  </P> <P> Once again, county Superior Court judges are showing their talent for  innovation. This time, the beneficiaries will be anyone seeking information in  the sometimes-murky world of product liability.  </P> <P> The court that introduced the fast-track system for civil cases -- a reform  adopted in courts around the state -- has enacted a rule limiting the kinds of  information that can be sealed once litigation has begun in civil cases. Even  defense lawyers concede that the effort to hide damaging information or trade  secrets has been extended over time to include disclosures that are merely  embarrassing.  </P> <P> Under the new rule, enacted July 1, a three-pronged test must be met before a  judge will seal an out-of-court settlement or information arising from the  discovery process in a trial. A court file can remain secret only if  non-disclosure is in the public interest, the material contains trade secrets  or other privileged information, and unsealing the file would cause "serious  harm."  </P> <P> The public obviously stands to benefit. The results of most product liability  lawsuits -- and other litigation concerning the public interest -- now will be  routinely available to an interested public, not hidden in sealed settlements.  </P> <P> The rule also will further streamline the judicial process. Plaintiffs won't  have to pry information out of recalcitrant defendants if it is readily  available from previous trials.  </P> <P> Will the reform encourage well-heeled defendants to settle fewer claims, using  their legal might to deter plaintiffs with a long court fight? Perhaps not. If  someone is hiding information, more will come out in a trial than in a  settlement.  </P> <P> Will they seek changes of venue, or settle prior to litigation? Perhaps. But if  other courts adopt this rule, the incentive for changes of venue would be  minimized. Pre-litigation settlements were always an option under the former  rules.  </P> <P> The courts are a public forum. Once matters land there, their outcomes should  be largely open to the public -- especially when the results can have a bearing  on consumers.  </P></p>

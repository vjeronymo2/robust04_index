			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WIRELESS, NON-CELLULAR PHONE TO GET TEST  </P> <P> A New York company said Thursday that it will begin testing within two years a  revolutionary wireless telephone system in Houston and Orlando, Fla., designed  to compete with wired and cellular systems.  </P> <P> The lightweight, wallet-sized phones will use high-frequency microwave signals  to connect with each other over short distances, such as in office buildings or  within neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The new system, known as a personal communications network, could be connected  with PCNs in other cities to provide nationwide communications. Owners would  only need to dial a code to let the system know where they were, said J. Shelby  Bryan, chairman of Millicom Inc., a New York-based international cellular  company.  </P> <P> Shelby said the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday approved a  request for a Millicom subsidiary, PCN America Inc., to test the system.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, American Personal Communications Inc. received FCC  permission to test a similar phone, but it would operate with certain  restrictions. The company hopes to begin testing next year.  </P> <P> Because of the short range of high-frequency microwave signals -- as little as  600 feet -- PCN, unlike regular cellular service, will be able to share space  with other private microwave users.  </P> <P> This feature greatly increases the system's capacity -- and its attractiveness  to businesses, which may find PCNs more convenient in an office building than  wired systems.  </P> <P> A large number of users in small areas would greatly lower the cost of the  phone units -- perhaps to $100 or less, Bryan said.  </P></p>

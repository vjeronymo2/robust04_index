			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dong Fangse (2639 2455 5331): "Zhou Hong Signs </F> First Deal as `Indentured' Writer, Xinwen Publishing Office To  Mop Up Publishing's Strange Births"]    [Text] China's publishing circles, in the midst of a sales  boom, are rapidly moving towards marketization.  <H5>  Publishing Houses Eye Throwing Themselves Into the Market </H5>   In the past, mainland publishing houses only put out books  in  accordance with the plan, not paying attention to market  attitudes and the interests of readers, with the result that  after new books were published, nobody was interested in them,  warehouses were overstocked, and readers also did not buy books  that they really needed. Now, a publishing house's profits are  linked with its books sales volume, and as many publishing  houses are starting to eye throwing themselves into the market,  great changes are brewing for China's publishing houses.  <H5>  Best Selling Books in 1993 </H5>   According to a recent survey, the best selling books on the  mainland fall primarily into the following categories:    1. Steady selling trend for well known foreign  best-sellers.    In 1993, various bookstores' stocks of well known foreign  best-sellers were generally low, while sales of stock items had  not yet fallen. Hangzhou City bookstores in the first half of  the year saw a 24 percent increase in this aspect of their sales  compared to a similar period in 1992. In addition, the majority  of well-known foreign works come in two types, those that  contain little that is Chinese in essence, and those editions  that are popularized and simplified. The selling trends for  these two types of editions are impressive, with the latter a  result of their low cost and the fact that they are favored by  college students and working class people.  <H5>  Five Great Works by the "Shaanxi Army's Eastern Expedition" </H5>   Among the modern popular novels, the novels of people  like Su Tong [5685 4547], and Liu Zhenyun [0491 7201 0061] are  selling comparatively well. Shaanxi author Jia Pingao's [6328  1627 0425] novel Ruined Capital [Feidu],  Chen Zhongshi's [7115 1813 1395] novel White Deer  Country [Bailu Yuan] and the novels Ardent  Destiny [Reai Mingyun], The Last Hun  [Zuihou Yige Xiongnu], and Eight Li of Kindness  and Hatred [Bali Qingchou] by several other  authors from Shaanxi Province, constitute the Five Great Works  by the "Shaanxi Army Eastern Expedition," which all at the same  time have won initial success in the Chinese literary world. Jia  Pingao's novel Ruined Capital has both been called a  "modern day Jin Pingmei," and received attention at  home and abroad, and allegedly the reprintings of the book now  exceed 500 thousand copies.    2. Acrobatic opera novels are making a comeback.    While acrobatic opera novels have generated a greatly  expanded group of readers, many people view this type of book as  addictive; particularly, the acrobatic opera novels  Jinyong and Gulong, which to this day  remain best-sellers at local newsstands.    3. On the spot business literature and financial and  economic type popular novels are popular.    For example, the twenty odd novels of the Hong Kong  female writer Liang Fengyi [2733 7685 0308] such as  Nightmares of the Rich [Haomen Jingmeng]  and Hua Kuijie are selling very well. In China, where  the number of readers has mushroomed, there are few readers who  still dislike this type of book.    4. Literature about foreign lands is in great demand.    Following in the path of such novels as A Beijinger  in New York, and A Chinese Woman in Manhattan,  the novel Luqia: A Beijing Girl in New York is  selling well. In addition, the books of a number of Taiwan and  Hong Kong authors such as Xi Murong [1598 1970 5554], San Mao  [0005 3029], and Qiong Yao [8825 3852] have already become big  sellers.    5. Biographies of famous persons are still very popular.    Biographies of famous persons, such as Historical  Selections of Mao Zedong, At the Wedding of Chiang  Kai-shek, The Biography of Zhou Enlai, and  My Father, Deng Xiaoping are all in great demand. A  number of biographies of famous foreigners, such as Franklin D.  Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Charles De Gaulle are also  unable to keep up with demand.    6. Specialized books are more and more in demand.    There is a tremendous amount of demand for this type of  book, and as long as the contents are practical, the quality is  high, and the editing is not disorderly, they will sell very  well indeed. For example, books of an economic genre such as  The Complete Book of World Trade, Dictionary of  Accounting, Real Estate Investment, A  Guidebook for Brokers; medical type books such as  Color Atlas of Chinese Medicinal Herbs; books on  historical relics such as Illustrated Dictionary of  Chinese Bronze Mirrors, and scientific type books such as  An English-Chinese Scientific and Technical  Dictionary. Though these books are high-priced, because of  their practical use, they are also books that specialists must  be equipped with, hence they are very much in demand.    7. Daily living type books and various types of juvenile  and children's reading material.    When it comes to daily living type books such as A  Handbook of Family Medicine, Use and Maintenance of  Household Electrical Appliances, and various types of  cookbooks, books on cosmetics, or weaving, though there appears  to be much duplication in the published items, each edition  seems to be selling quite well. Various types of books for  juveniles and children compiled to develop the intellect and  increase knowledge are also selling very well.  <H3>  New Symbols of Striding Towards the Market: Authors Signing  Agreements and Competitively Priced Manuscripts </H3>   Authors signing agreements and competitively priced  manuscripts are two to the most recent signs that the mainland  publishing world is striding towards the market.    Publishing a good book requires having a good manuscript,  yet over the past several years the many of the payments for  books for authors on the mainland have been from 30 yuan per  thousand characters, to 50 yuan per thousand, with the highest  figures reaching around 100 yuan. In the current situation, when  the economy is developing so rapidly, levels of consumption are  extremely high, and these types of fees for books written have  made it very difficult to attract writers. Some writers, to make  ends meet, have had no choice but to abandon the pen and go into  business. For some period of time, writers went overseas, and  this has resulted in a lack of good manuscripts, hence salacious  and low-grade works have flooded the market.    Without a good source of manuscripts, publishing houses  have been very hard pressed. Some publishing units have broken  through traditional manuscript standards, and adopted an  approach calling for superior prices paid for superior  manuscripts, vying for a good draft over a period of time, and  capturing the market. In October of 1993, the Shenzhen Youth  Magazine House and the Guangdong Province Periodical Commercial  Development Company sponsored a public competition for  outstanding manuscripts, an activity genuinely directed towards  entering into market competition for the manuscripts of mainland  authors.    On October 28, 1993, the mainland's first time ever  outstanding manuscript competition was launched in Shenzhen.  There were more than 30 manuscripts entered, and among them were  some 14 on-the-spot type literary works, occupying an  overwhelmingly dominant position. In addition, there were also  novels, movie scripts, examples of prose, essays, academic  works, specialized papers, and popular historical material. Some  well known writers such as Zhang Xianliang [1728 6343 0081]  participated in the competition, though a large number were up  and coming young writers.    The China Pacific Insurance Company's Shenzhen Branch  supplied guaranteed insurance for the guaranteed minimum price  of the competitively priced manuscripts. The units participating  in the competition included numerous domestic and foreign  publishing, television, and radio organizations and  entrepreneurs. The very first to strike a deal was author Shi  Tiesheng's [0670 6993 3932] short story "Others" [Bieren] and  the young theorist Wang Donghua's [3769 2639 5478] social  science treatise "The New Academics" [Xin Daxueren] which were  bought by the Shenzhen Airport Lounge Company, Ltd. for 8000  yuan and 80,000 respectively. One privately run enterprise head  offered an opening price of 3000 yuan per thousand characters  and purchased a manuscript by Liu Xiaoqing [0491 2556 1987]  titled "From Movie Star to Millionairess," and other manuscripts  also by and large were sold to industrial and commercial  enterprises.    When it comes to competitive pricing of manuscripts,  mainland authors and publishers have differing views.  <H3>  Does Putting Literature on the Market Foster an Impulsive  Spirit in Literary Circles? </H3>   Peoples' Publishing House head and editor-in-chief Xue  Dezhen [5641 1795 7201] is rather in agreement with this. He  states that the price of a manuscript in the final analysis must  be regulated by the unseen hand of the market. He believes that  though competitively pricing manuscripts using this method  meshes with the market, it is an assault on mainland publishing  circles' traditional approach involving the planned economy and  administrative fiat, and will be very beneficial for increasing  the quality of cultural products and promoting a change in the  thinking of publishing circles.    Art critic Ma Ye [7456 0048] thinks that the essential  significance of the competitive pricing of manuscripts lies in  the fact that it has made it possible for a market for culture  to be established in China. Let those men of letters who have  abandoned literature engage in business return to their own  heartfelt occupation, and compete in the "ocean of literature."  He disclosed that the original manuscript of Jia Pingao's new  work Ruined Capital was bought by the Beijing October  Art Publishing House for 150 yuan per 1000 characters (the  printing impression manuscript price was separately calculated),  and if it the deal had been done using competitive pricing, this  would have had an altogether different effect on the author, on  the publishing house, and on the social effect and benefit of  the work.    Some authors express concern and wearied bewilderment  when it comes to competitive pricing of manuscripts. Six  writers, including Zhang Jie [1728 3381] and Cong Weixi [0654  4850 3556], withdrew en masse from the reviewing committee for  this effort at competitive pricing of manuscripts. Author Liu  Xinwu [0491 1800 2976] believes that a market for literary  manuscripts should not be the basic method to solve the problem.  Literary works, though they possess the properties of a  commodity, at root also fall into the category of spirit, and  whether or not putting literature on the market fosters an  impulsive spirit in literary circles, it gives rise to money  worship and cultural philistinism.    There are also writers who hold that after market  behavior has played itself out, whether or not this is contrary  to the initial intention, it pulls down the market for literary  manuscripts into the vulgar realm of an arena for commodity  transaction.    Confronting the concerns of literary and art circles, one  figure from the publishing world points out that when it comes  to literary manuscripts, two mechanisms should be established:  First, the state should provide protection, and second, things  should be allowed to move towards the market.    It is reported that at the conclusion of this activity  involving the competitive pricing of manuscripts, the organizing  committee established a permanent organization in Shenzhen for  dealing in manuscripts, which will become a collection and  distribution center for mainland manuscripts.  <H5>  Zhou Hong, the First "Indentured" Chinese Writer? </H5>   In fact, at the same time as the Shenzhen manuscript  competitive pricing market was closing, the China Youth  Publishing House and the author Zhou Hong [0719 3163] signed an  agreement which has caused no small amount of rumblings within  publishing circles on the mainland. Some people believe that  Zhou is in fact the mainland's first "indentured" writer,  because the contract stipulates that for the next three years,  Zhou must fulfill obligations for writing books in accordance  with the overall plan of the China Youth Publishing House. If  the publishing house does not agree with a selected topic, Zhou  has no right to write about it. One older writer commented: "For  the writer, the most important thing is that when he writes, he  must have freedom of mind, and a distinctive individuality; if  he is only working in accordance with another's intentions, what  will he be able to produce?"    But there are also those who hold that because the  publishing house handles everything, the writer has no fear  problems back home, and can write while setting his or her mind  at rest.  <H3>  Changing the Situation of "Read a Manuscript, Do Not Worry,  Return the Manuscript, Do Not Pay Money, Agree on Eating from  the Common Pot, Printing Takes Three and a Half Years" </H3>   The China Youth Publishing House Director Hu Shouwen [5170  1343 2429] states that they "purchased" Zhou Hong with the  primary intention of upsetting the balance of the publishing  houses still under the old system. Because its interests are  bound together with those of the writer, the publishing house  will change the past cycle and rhythm of the type "read a  manuscript, do not worry, return the manuscript, do not pay  money for it, make an agreement on eating from the common pot,  print after three and a half years," and stimulate reform. He  comments that this publishing house will by stages and in groups  "purchase" writers, hoping to have a plan to promote the  mainland's own writers who are in great demand, such as San Mao,  Qiong Yao, and Jin Yong, and guide and capture over the long  term the market for popular literature that the old line  publishing houses have felt beneath their notice.    Zhou Hong's collection A Warning to the Chinese  People was the most popular and in demand set of books in  China for the first half of 1993. As for his status as  "indentured," Zhou says that this stems initially from the need  to subsist, but he hopes that other writers do not walk this  path, "because literature after all requires a group of people  who resolutely refuse to bend to the popular will."  <H3>  Centers for Buying and Selling Book Numbers: A Strange Birth  From Mainland's Publishing Circles </H3>   According to international practice, to issue a book it  must have a number, and the "Chinese Standard Book Numbers" are  the symbol of the right to publish that the government gives to  publishing houses. They are issued by the China ISBN Center free  of charge and supplied to publishing houses for their use. The  buying and selling of book numbers happens when a publishing  house takes a "Chinese Standard Book Number" subordinate to that  house and sells it to a non-publishing unit or another  publishing house. This in essence is an illegal publishing  activity.    The buying and selling of book numbers had already  emerged in China in 1984, and in recent years has become more  and more prevalent. According to relevant administrative  department statistics, book numbers sold by publishing units  over the course of a year constitute some 10 percent of the  total books published in the mainland. Figures from the Xinhua  Book Stores and departments that publish scientific research  believe that the real number is higher than this.    The factors that have generated this buying and selling  of book numbers have two primary aspects: First, publishing  house editors have little power, publishing funds are seriously  inadequate, and houses have a book number but are often  powerless to publish a book; second, a "second channel" of  distribution is rapidly developing, and some portion of the  newly formed collective, and individually owned book businesses,  are one by one switching from retail to wholesale, and from  wholesale gradually getting involved in publishing, hence book  numbers something that are in high demand among these  businesses. Some publishing houses, to solve the issue of  funding, will take their own book numbers and sell them for  several thousand yuan up to 10,000 yuan to collective and  individually owned book businesses, and these businesses, as  long as they pay around a 10,000 yuan "management fee," can hope  to turn a generous profit of from 10-fold to several tens-fold.  This is virtually becoming a market in the buying and selling of  book numbers.    Because the buying and selling of book numbers is  lucrative, more and more non-publishing units and individuals  are becoming interested. Those buying and selling book numbers  have gone from the original collective and individually owned  book businesses, government units, and individual writers, and  expanded to nearly all levels of society, including bookstores,  printing plants, and educational institutions.  <H5>  "Brokers of Culture" Emerge In Accordance With the Times </H5>   The trading in book numbers has given rise in publishing  circles two a situation that has caused concern to many: A group  of "brokers of culture," who reap unfair profits through selling  book numbers, has emerged in accordance with the times; this  group panders to the market and panders to vulgar popular taste  and vulgar literary style books and periodicals. According to a  survey, of the pornographic and salacious books and those with  "political problems," from 80 to 90 percent had book numbers  that were purchased.    In addition, the buying and selling of book numbers  disrupts the normal order of publishing house administration,  books are manufactured in a rough and slipshod manner, quality  is seriously reduced, and it reduces the number of planned books  that a publishing house can produce, hindering the publishing of  good books and literary works.    The China Xinwen Publishing Office has issued repeated  injunctions prohibiting the buying and selling of book numbers.  From 1989 to 1990, dozens of publishing units had their house  number revoked because of buying and selling of book numbers. In  September of 1993, as the whole society was engaged in an  anticorruption initiative, mainland publishing circles again  proposed the "resolute rooting out of the corrupt behavior of  buying and selling book numbers." But whether or not this  practice, with its strange origin, can really be eliminated on  the mainland will await conscientious implementation by  publishing circles and strict supervision by every level of  society.  <H5>  The Fraud of "Foreign Book Numbers" </H5>   When the "Chinese Standard Book Numbers" were a hot  topic, some foreign publishing organizations also looked at  mainland practice, using pleasing phrases such as "to assist  mainland publishing houses in resolving funding difficulties,"  and "to assist mainland authors in giving expression to their  intellectual achievements." They also peddled so-called  "international book numbers," and "Hong Kong book numbers," and  reaped unfair profits from this.    Most of those engaged in this sort of activity were  figures who in recent years have left the mainland to live in  Hong Kong. They register in Hong Kong a fictitious local  publishing house, and because they have no way to publish and  issue hot-selling books, they use differences between the  mainland and Hong Kong's local publishing system, and take  worthless local Hong Kong book numbers to the mainland to sell  at a high profit. They normally go through two channels: The  first is to send a large number of book number purchase order  lists to relevant departments and writers; the second is to  engage in selling book numbers for excessive profit through  representatives on the mainland.    The China Xinwen Publishing Administration Department has  taken measures to curb profiteering in "international numbers."  According to a public announcement by Chinese authorities: There  are around 10 Hong Kong publishing organizations engaging in  illegal buying and selling of book numbers in China, including  such outfits as the Tianma Book Company, Ltd. and the South  Pacific Publishing House.    Fraud involving "foreign book numbers" has meant that  many mainland authors who have been successful for many years  only to have their works exchanged as "illegal publications,"  and there are even some people who, wanting to publish a book,  buy a book number, and then borrow money, sustaining  irreplaceable losses. Disseminated news stories have warned  mainland writers "to be careful and protect against being  duped," while the China Xinwen Publishing Office has also issued  to various locales "Notification Relating to Prohibition of Sale  of Hong Kong and Taiwan Book Numbers on the Mainland." It is  reported that at present activity in illegally profiteering in  "international book numbers" has already been somewhat curtailed.  <H3>  "Sweeping Up Pornography" and "Cracking Down on Illegal  Publishing" </H3>   Since July 1987 when the mainland first launched an  extensive "anti- pornography" campaign, its seems that every  year an anti-pornography or "attack illegal publications"  campaign is undertaken. However, because management of the  publications market is chaotic, printing houses put profit  making first and pornographic publications have the attraction  of high profits, resulting in the fact that there is an  incessant wave of pornography, and the creators of pornographic  materials are constantly changing their appearance and adopting  new countermeasures.    Since early in 1993 an extensive anti-pornography  campaign has been underway, and this has forced illegal  smuggling activity around various coastal locales to be more and  more underground and secretive. Many areas have formed  "transprovincial" and "transnational" trust type underground  organizations, which have even been expanding into black market  operations.  <H5>  Bookstalls Primarily Hitting "Edge Balls" </H5>   A large number of bookstalls, meaning the proprietors,  when offering pornographic materials for sale in the midst of a  bustling metropolis, adopt the tactic of hitting "the edge  ball." The front cover titles are brimming with the seduction of  violence and lewdity, but in reality the contents often stop  short of this, and they cannot be equated with "pornography."  For example, "Husbands and Wives Talk About Sex and Love,"  "Robbers of the Flesh in Action," and no small number of picture  albums of the human body, collections of portraits all have  extremely seductive cover titles, while the contents cannot be  considered to have "exceeded the boundaries [of decency]".    Early in 1993, the amorous novels of the Qing and Ming  periods all the rage on the mainland were part of this  situation. These books to a lessor or greater extent all have  vigorous men and amorous females, and because they do not  involve questions of publishing rights, some publishing houses  reproduce large numbers, and most also attract readers with  covers that advertise things like "Qing period bawdy novel."  Sometimes one book will be out in editions from several  publishing houses. In addition, books related to Jin  Pingmei such as Jin Pingmei Words and  Expressions, Fan Jinlian and Li Pinger, and the  Western Gate Day [Ximen Qin] are also of this ilk.    Something that is different from hitting "edge balls"  occurs in some areas of Guangdong, were some pornographic  publications under names like "New Wave novels," "Three Level  novels," "Modern novels," or "selection of best-selling books,"  actually have contests that are really quite obscene. The  majority of these books draw materials from foreign pornographic  publications, and rearrange things through piecing together and  clipping and pasting. Almost every two or three weeks a new set  of "new wave novels" appears at bookstalls, and among this  variety of items, the quantity of pornographic material is high,  a ferocious force, making people surprised that this is  happening in China. Why local authorities in Guangdong are not  controlling this is even more strange.    In June and July of 1993, relevant departments on the  mainland again launched an anti-pornography campaign. In Beijing  alone there were eight cases that were investigated, with proper  actions taken against the "production of pornographic materials,  "trafficking in pornography" and engaging in illegal publishing  activity. Seven "nests of wholesalers" were ferreted out, more  than 230,000 items of contraband goods and illegal publications  were seized, including more than 40 types of obscene  publications totalling more than 110,000 items; some 3225  illegal videocassete tapes were seized, as were 12,700 illegal  audiotapes, and any further rise in the tide of pornography has  been controlled. The Xinwen Publishing Office again stresses  that "sweeping up pornography" and "cracking down on illegal  publications" are important matters related to the basic line,  and must resolutely be maintained, constantly grasped with no  letup.</p>

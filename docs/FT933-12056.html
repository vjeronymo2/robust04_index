			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Hyundai strike action collapsing THE INDUSTRIAL action at Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, appeared to be collapsing yesterday as two of eight striking companies concluded wage agreements and a third one is expected to do so today. This follows the ending of the strike last week at Hyundai Motor, the largest of the Hyundai subsidiaries disrupted by industrial action since last month. Workers at Hyundai Pipe and Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry agreed to accept the company's 4.7 per cent pay offer in return for increased fringe benefits. Hyundai Mipo Dockyard is expected to reach a similar accord today. The Labour Ministry is concentrating its efforts on ending the dispute at Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), the group's shipbuilding unit and the largest subsidiary still on strike. But HHI workers are insisting on the reinstatement of fired trade union members, which the government refuses to accept as part of a wage agreement. Officials are threatening to invoke emergency powers to end the strike as they did with Hyundai Motor. A Boeing 737 of Asiana Airline yesterday crashed into a mountain near Mokpo, South Korea, as it tried to land during a severe storm. About 63 of the 106 passengers on the flight from Seoul were killed. It was the first crash suffered by Asiana since the South Korea's second carrier was established in 1988. The aircraft had made three unsuccessful approaches to land at Mokpo and was trying again when it hit the mountain due to low visibility. The aircraft was insured for Dollars 30m, with Lloyd's of London holding 99.34 per cent of the insurance and Hyundai Marine Fire Insurance and other Korean insurers the remainder.</p>

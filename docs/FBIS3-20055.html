			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- FRG Interior Minister Manfred Kanther  (Christian Democratic Union) assessed the peaceful  demonstrations of several thousand Kurds in various German  cities on Sunday [27 March] as an "outstanding achievement by  the police and by society." He praised, above all, the security  forces, who worked around the clock, but also the Kurdish  families, who did not let themselves be instigated by agitators.    However, one cannot give the all-clear regarding the terror  of the Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), he said in Bonn. The  challenge continues. The minister affirmed that all proceedings  of criminal and aliens' law against PKK members who committed  acts of violence are to be concluded as quickly as possible. A  deportation agreement with Turkey, which guarantees that those  deported will not receive a death sentence, is as necessary as  the determined enforcement of the PKK ban in Germany.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ADD 'BANKING' TO SHOPPING LIST  </P> <P> In addition to stocking the pantry, shoppers at five Ralphs grocery stores in  San Diego County can now complete a full range of consumer banking transactions  at in-store branches operated by Union Bank.  </P> <P> The San Francisco-based bank intends to eventually open branch offices in 50  grocery stores throughout California, Union Bank vice president Linda Odenath  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Union Bank's supermarket branches, which open this morning at stores in Rancho  Penasquitos, Rancho San Diego, Chula Vista, Mission Valley and North City West,  were a response to "increased demands from consumers for more convenience,"  Odenath said. The Union Bank branches, which will be open every day, will offer  "everything but safety deposit boxes," Odenath said.  </P> <P> Grocery store branches are typically less expensive and easier to build than  traditional "brick and mortar" branches, according to John Garnett, vice  president of International Banking Technologies, an Atlanta-based firm that has  helped financial institutions open 300 grocery store branches.  </P> <P> Banks are finding that in-store branches present a cost-effective way to  attract new customers. The banks and savings and loans that use International  Banking Technologies typically convert 20% of a grocery store's regular  shoppers -- including many who have no previous banking affiliation -- into  customers during the first year alone, Garnett said.  </P> <P> With their lower capital and operating costs, grocery store branches also turn  a profit faster than traditional branches, according to John LeCave, marketing  director at National Bank of Commerce in Memphis, Tenn., which operates 33  grocery store branches.  </P> <P> National Bank of Commerce's in-store branches have generated 60,000 new  accounts with $303 million in deposits and more than $100 million in loans,  LeCave said.  </P> <P> Relatively few California financial institutions have opened branches in  grocery stores. Security Pacific recently opened 12 branches in Safeway stores  in Washington; California Savings &amp; Loan has one location in a San Ramon  grocery, and Great American Bank operates several branches in grocery stores in  Tucson and Phoenix. Citicorp Savings opened four branches in Ralph's stores in  the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Banks and savings and loans nationwide have opened 700 supermarket branches, up  from just 100 in 1983, Garnett said.  </P> <P> National Bank of Commerce has created a separate company that has established  170 branches in supermarkets for other banks and savings and loans.  </P> <P> "Supermarkets are the No. 1 traffic location in America," LeCave said. "We  figured, if you could provide banking at the same place, you have the ultimate  in terms of one-stop shopping."  </P> <P> Grocery chains view the bank branches as one more way to bolster customer  loyalty. "This is another service department . . . like the pharmacy, the  floral shop or the bakery," Garnett said.  </P> <P> Although financial institutions have operated branch offices in supermarkets  for several decades, observers said some banks and S&amp;Ls backed away from  the concept after First Nationwide made an ill-fated attempt to operate  financial service centers in K mart, J.C. Penney and Sears stores.  </P> <P> "The First Nationwide idea wasn't implemented in the right way," Odenath said.  "Consumers weren't going to K mart enough to make it worthwhile. But every  family makes an average of 2.3 trips to the grocery store each week."  </P> <P> "Ninety percent of grocery store shoppers are not your customers, but 99% of  the people who walk into your (bank) lobby are customers," LeCave said. "Our  lobby is now the entire cross section of people who walk into the grocery  store."  </P></p>

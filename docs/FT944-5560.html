			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Further signs of growth depress Dow Wall Street US share prices fell sharply as interest rate fears resurfaced in the wake of a week-long barrage of strong economic figures, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. Late in the afternoon the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to show a 48-point loss before picking up to end 38.36 down on the day at 3,700.87. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 4.77 at 448.92, the American SE composite fell 2.67 to 431.19 and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 9.12 to 740.61. NYSE volume was 286m shares. The National Association of Purchasing Managers reported its index of economic activity for November at 61.2 per cent, the highest level in more than 10 years. Several other pieces of economic data released yesterday added to inflation worries. Personal income in October jumped to 1.4 per cent from 0.6 per cent in September. That was the largest increase in income since February. Construction spending also rose beyond economists' expectations, growing 0.9 per cent in October. Those numbers just added to concern created by a number of indicators out earlier in the week. Among the most important were an upward revision of third-quarter gross domestic product and a leap in consumer confidence. Mr David Shulman, chief equities strategist at securities house Salomon Brothers, attributed the markets' decline to fears that the Federal Reserve would tighten monetary policy again. Investors will now place even more importance on key employment reports due out today, he said. So far this year the Fed has raised interest rates six times. Ultimately, the rising rates will erode corporate earnings by deterring borrowing. The Nasdaq, where high-technology issues make up approximately 10 per cent of the market capitalisation, was pulled down further than the other indices by continued market worries about a possible flaw in the Pentium computer chip designed by Intel. The Nasdaq composite fell 1.2 per cent, compared with a 1.0 per cent decrease in the Dow. Dell Computer shed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 39 3/4 and Gateway 2000 was down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 20 1/4 after securities house CS First Boston lowered its ratings as both companies prepared to deal with consumer concerns about the Intel chip in some computers. Intel, which also trades on the Nasdaq, dipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 62 5/8 . Several NYSE-traded high- technology companies also declined. IBM fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 69 5/8 , Digital Equipment was down Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 31 5/8 and Compaq Computer receded Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 38 1/4. Hewlett-Packard lost Dollars 3 at Dollars 95 on news that it would reduce the price of several of its desktop computers. Chrysler gained ground early in the day after announcing that it would increase its quarterly dividend by 60 per cent to 40 cents, but was off Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 47 3/4 by the close. The company's largest shareholder has been pushing for such a move. The nation's two largest publicly traded health maintenance organisations fell after a negative report on a low cost health provider, Kaiser Permanente, which is not publicly traded. US Healthcare lost Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 44 1/8 and United Healthcare fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 47. Canada Toronto drifted lower in cautious trading amid continu-ing worries about interest rates and as financial markets awaited today's key US employment data. The TSE 300 index closed 11.01 easier at 4,082.40 and falls outpaced rises by 444 to 254 after volume of 70m shares. Eleven of the 14 sub-group indices were down, led by communication, real estate, pipeline and conglomerate stocks. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo retreated from the day's peaks to finish a net 0.08 per cent off in moderate trade after prices tested some resistance barriers but did not find support at higher levels. Brokers said the afternoon's slide was not related to reports saying that president-elect Fernando Henrique Cardoso had not confirmed that he had chosen Pedro Malan, of the central bank, as Brazil's new economy minister. The Bovespa index, up 2.7 per cent initially, lost 37 points on balance at 46,523. Turnover came to RDollars 261.1m (Dollars 305.4m. News that the National Development Bank has raised RDollars 33.2m through a successful sale of Banco do Brasil and Petrobras shares helped early sentiment.</p>

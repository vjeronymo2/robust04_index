			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Knowing when to drop the fat operatic soprano - Carmakers' strategies VOLKSWAGEN may be preparing a VW Golf Europa special edition to celebrate the single market, but the company remains adamant that it will continue specific strategies market by market. According to Mr Philip Holliday, account manager for VW at the carmaker's UK advertising agency BMP DDB Needham, the group follows a common overall advertising strategy for Europe. This is built around the perceived virtues of reliability and quality but the interpretation of these features is left to national markets. 'German television ads tend to be rather literal, they assert something and give a very factual demonstration of reliability. In the UK it is much less direct. We show reliability as an emotional quality. In the face of adversity the car is there as a consistent, reliable friend.' In the UK the angry girlfriend may throw away her diamonds and her fur coat, but never the keys to her VW Golf. Mr Holliday insists that many advertising approaches do not translate to another country because of the humour or the dialogue. Fiat presented its Tipo small family car in the UK with a television campaign including an overweight operatic soprano appearing through the sun roof, but the approach has to be rather different in Italy. On the other hand some Volkswagen markets elsewhere in Europe did pick up the British VW Golf advert, in which the only squeak was in the lady driver's earring. Filmed in Spain the only dialogue was a few words and grunts spoken in Italian. Strategies towards the consumer also depend crucially on the relative strength of the individual car brand in a particular market. Gradually shares of individual markets are being evened out, but the carmakers' fortunes still vary widely. The Fiat group has a share of 12 per cent across Europe, but in Italy it takes 44 per cent of all new car sales and only 2 per cent in the UK. This relative market strength crucially affects pricing policies, and goes some way to explaining often widely divergent new car prices across Europe. Car prices will continue to differ from market to market driven not least by currency fluctuations and different tax regimes. But there is growing evidence that they will tend to converge as the borders between national markets become less distinct, and market shares become more equal. Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive of Renault, says: 'At the moment where you have a bigger market share and more loyalty, you can charge more, but these opportunities will become more limited. Prices are converging in different markets and carmakers will have less flexibility in marketing techniques.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In developing risk estimates for disease attributable to occupational exposure, reliance is placed on exposure encountered in the workplace to the extent possible. However, in the absence of purely occupational data, information derived in environments other than work sites is also considered. OSHA believes that there is no physiological difference related to exposure (or its outcome) regardless of where it is experienced. This is true regardless of whether the endpoint is lung cancer, heart disease, or indoor air related acute irritant effects. The only difference is that the degree of exposure may be greater in one place than in the other. Available information which uses nicotine concentration as an index of exposure suggests that the differences in exposure between office workplaces and residences lie well within the uncertainties of the determinations and for some workplaces, such as restaurants and transportation facilities, exposures are significantly higher than the average exposures found in residences. Thus, risk estimates based on residential exposures are expected to accurately reflect occupational risks in most workplaces and possibly underestimate the risk in some workplaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing its risk assessment for lung cancer, the EPA reviewed 19 studies which investigated nicotine concentrations in various environments [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. EPA's analysis showed that the range of average nicotine concentrations in office workplaces is very similar to that of homes. However, in some workplaces, such as restaurants and transportation facilities, exposures are significantly higher. It is true that there are many complicating factors in such determinations which could affect any final conclusions. For example, it is important to consider the duration of exposure, the intensity of exposure, the distance from the sources and other factors as well. However, EPA's analysis suggests that risk assessments based on home exposures are relevant to workplaces as well and, in comparison to some workplaces, may even result in an underestimate of the true occupational risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, other studies substantiate the magnitude of workplace exposures. For example, Emmons et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;98]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found that the majority of ETS exposure occurred in the workplace. Study subjects were selected from workplace settings with a wide range of ETS exposure. The work sites ranged from those with minimal restriction of smoking and high levels of exposure to work sites with extensive smoking restrictions and low exposure. Ninety percent of the subjects worked outside the home. Eighty-four percent of those who worked outside the home (75.6% of the total sample) reported being regularly exposed to smoking in the workplace. While the most highly exposed individuals in the study were those who had both home and work exposures, it is clear that workplace exposure constituted a significant component of overall exposure. Subjects who did not live with smokers reported that the majority of their exposure was in the workplace (mean=36.1 min/day), home (mean=1.4 min/day) or in other locations (mean=13.1 min/day). Subjects who lived with smokers reported receiving slightly more exposure at home than the workplace, however the difference between home exposure and workplace exposure was not substantial (work: mean=29.4 min/day, home: mean=31.2 min/day, other: mean=27.1 min/day). These results are shown in Table IV&hyph;5. The importance of the findings from this study is twofold. First, it indicates that the workplace is the primary source of ETS exposure for nonsmokers, who do not live with smokers. Secondly, it shows that for nonsmokers living with smokers, even though their household environment becomes their primary source of exposure, the workplace still contributes a substantial amount of exposure, comparable to that experienced by the nonsmoker living with nonsmokers (29.4 min/day v. 36.1 min/day).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,i1,s100,10,20 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table IV&hyph; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> 5._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Exposure to ETS by Location1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Subject Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Exposure (min/day)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 195 percent confidence interval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Living with a smoker: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=03 g=1 f=4 --> Workplace  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 29.4  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> (7.01&hyph;51.80)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 31.2  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> (21.60&hyph;40.80)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 27.1  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> (15.10&hyph;39.10)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Living without a smoker: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=03 g=1 f=4 --> Workplace  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 36.1  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> (22.70&hyph;49.50)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Home  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.4  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> (0.05&hyph;2.75)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 13.1  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> (8.75&hyph;17.40)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> 1Source: Emmons et al.

A re-analysis of the CAPS data (a detailed description of this study is found in the EXPOSURE section) shows that the workplace contributes on the average 46 percent to the total ETS exposure experienced by a nonsmoking worker.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> C.

These will be referred to as the ``diseases of interest'' and include coronary heart disease (excluding strokes) as defined in the Framingham study and lung cancer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

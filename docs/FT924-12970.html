			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / So farewell then, Che Guevara: John Barham on a revolutionary who was killed 25 years ago ERNESTO 'Che' Guevara was born, lived and died in another time. He might have been killed only 25 years ago this month, aged 39, but he belongs to a different world. The future Guevara hoped to shape now seems as distant as the utopias dreamed of by the Communards of 1870 Paris, the anarchists of civil war Spain, or the revolutionaries of May 1968. As perhaps the last romantic folk hero, and certainly the most famous of Latin America's guerrilla warriors, Guevara embodied the lethally simplistic revolutionary who believed sincerely that idealism, sacrifice and permanent, violent, struggle could one day build a perfect society of freedom, justice and plenty for all. Guevara lives on, emblazoned innocuously on countless T-shirts, posters and badges. It is easy to picture his stark features etched in black against a flaming red background: his beret, long, scraggly hair and a distant, mystical look in his eyes. But the teenagers who look to Guevara are less interested in his life as a revolutionary than in the glamourous, romantic picture of a rebellious free spirit. Che's appeal is undeniable. He was a wealthy, middle class youth who qualified as a doctor in Buenos Aires only to abandon the promise of a comfortable life to travel penniless through South America. He met Fidel Castro, then exiled in Mexico, in 1955 and they formed the nucleus of a rebel band that at first numbered only 16 men at the beginning of the Cuban revolution. Their uprising is an astonishing saga of revolutionaries who triumphed through luck, courage and determination. They almost starved and faced the constant threat of annihilation, yet they went on to defeat - against huge odds - a corrupt, reactionary dictatorship. But in 1965 Che, the revolutionary hero, effectively abandoned Cuba, probably horrified at Castro's bureaucratic institutionalisation of the revolution. That year, Guevara quit as industry minister to lead a motley guerrilla band in Bolivia rather than compromise his ideals by becoming involved in the difficult - and morally ambivalent - process of organising a state. Che's vision of igniting revolutionary wars of liberation throughout South America was as quixotic as it was idealistic, and demonstrated a disturbing separation from reality. One of the perplexed Bolivian peasants present at Guevara's death at the town of La Higuera said: 'He came to liberate us, but we did not understand.' His death at the hands of Bolivian troops - led by CIA advisers - on October 8 1967 seemed almost pre-destined. His violent end was appropriate for a man fascinated by death and violence in the best Argentine melodramatic tradition. Clearly, he had given the subject considerable attention. Recalling (in a campaign diary he kept during the Cuban revolution) the moment in 1956 when he was wounded slightly in a shoulder, Che wrote: 'I thought of myself as dead. Immediately, I began to think about the best way of dying in that minute when all seemed lost. I remembered an old story by Jack London where the hero, leaning against a tree trunk, prepares to end his life with dignity, knowing he was condemned to freeze to death in the frozen plains of Alaska. This is the only image I remember.' By dying before he grew old, Guevara passed into world consciousness as a mystic enveloped in revolutionary purity. If he had lived, Che would be 64 now and probably be a grandfather, perhaps paunchy and balding like Fidel Castro who has gone from beloved national hero to solitary tyrant. In his biography of Castro, American journalist Tad Szulc comments that the sensitive and highly intelligent Guevara probably sensed this and deliberately chose exile and eventual death in Bolivia's benighted interior. Our modern picture of Che, the self-denying revolutionary, could hardly be more distant from that of his successors. The urban guerrillas of the 1970s in Germany, Italy and Argentina appear to us now as psychopaths. The fat, bespectacled and middle-aged Abimael Guzman, leader of Peru's feared Shining Path guerrillas who was sentenced this week to life in jail for treason, is linked in our minds to Pol Pot, not Che Guevara. Guevara is, to many, forever the romantic, valiant and mystical harbinger of peace and understanding. The famous, scratchy black and white photos of the dead Che, stretched out with his chest perforated with bullets, has transformed him into a modern-day hero who gave his own life for an ideal. But the myth obscures the sinister side of his character. Like all revolutionary purists before him, Guevara isolated himself gradually from the real world in an attempt to create the new man of socialist society, untainted by selfishness, competitiveness, or individualism. He dreamt of sparking off a South American version of the Vietnam war that would unleash great Marxist revolutions across the continent. In his last radio message, from his Bolivian jungle hideout to a third world conference in Havana, Che exhorted: 'How closely we could look into a bright future should two, three or many Vietnams flourish throughout the world with their share of deaths and immense tragedies, their everyday tragedies, their everyday heroism, and their repeated blows against imperialism.' Yet, in spite of this macho posturing, Guevara probably was perceptive enough to see himself as much a Don Quixote as a proletarian Simon Bolivar. In one of his last letters to his parents in Buenos Aires just before leaving Havana, Che wrote: 'Once again, I feel beneath my heels the ribs of Rosinante (Quixote's horse) . . . I return to the road with my lance under my arm.'</p>

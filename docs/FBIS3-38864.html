This succinct conclusion is drawn by Werner Beutelmeyer, head  of the Market Institute in Linz, from the poll concluded at the  end of January for DER STANDARD's monthly European Barometer.    For this conclusion Market relies on several  indicators:     -  First, Austrians are regularly asked how they  would decide if a referendum were held right now. Last summer,  after a long period to the contrary, there was a majority in  favor of EU membership. This majority was, however, lost again  by autumn.    -  More decisive is the assessment of the general mood  by those polled. Market asks: "What do you think: How do most  Austrians currently view joining the EU?" Last June, when 40  percent of those polled were in favor of membership and 37  percent against, those same pollees believed that a majority  would be against EU membership. At that time 34 percent said  that a majority would be against membership, 31 percent assumed  that there would be a majority in favor of membership. In the  meantime, this relationship has clearly changed: Now 33 percent  think that the majority is in favor of membership; only 24  percent think that there is a majority against the EU.    -  Another  indicator is the assessment on whether joining the European  Community or the EU would bring personal advantages or  disadvantages for those polled. For months, right until last  autumn, there had been a majority that expected primarily  disadvantages for themselves. Since then, however, there has  been a clear and steady change, particularly in this respect.    Market chief Beutelmayer thinks that the reason for the  change in mood is the current reporting on Austria's  negotiations in Brussels. In this connection, it is important to  see that Austrian positions are defended seriously.    However, the referendum has been far from "won." One out of  four Austrians is undecided.</p>

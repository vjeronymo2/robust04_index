			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMBIA PICKS NEW AGENCY FOR TRI-STAR ADS  </P> <P> Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. said Friday that it pulled its Tri-Star  Pictures domestic advertising account from the Los Angeles branch of AC&amp;R  Advertising and gave it to McCann-Erickson Worldwide, which now places domestic  advertising for the company's Columbia Pictures unit.  </P> <P> The Tri-Star account, which involves media placement of the studio's movie ads,  is estimated to have billings of between $70 million and $75 million and is  believed to be among AC&amp;R Los Angeles' largest accounts, if not its  largest.  </P> <P> Its loss is a serious blow to AC&amp;R, a unit of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co.,  which has lost other entertainment accounts in the last few years, most notably  NBC Entertainment.  </P> <P> "It's been going on for a long time, and I have no idea why they changed," said  R. Lynn Livingston, president of AC&amp;R's Irvine office.  </P> <P> For McCann, it means a total of $150 million in Columbia billings. McCann  prevailed in an account review that included Grey Advertising and Backer  Spielvogel Bates. McCann officials could not be reached.  </P> <P> Livingston said the change may have been prompted by the recent $3.4-billion  buyout of Columbia Pictures Entertainment by Japan's Sony Corp. a month ago,  but a Columbia spokesman who asked not to be identified said the decision was  unrelated to the buyout.  </P> <P> One industry insider, who asked not to be identified, suggested that Tri-Star  may have been unhappy with AC&amp;R's media planning. Patrick King, who runs  AC&amp;R's Los Angeles office, could not be reached.  </P> <P> Among Tri-Star's recent films have been "Steel Magnolias" and "Look Who's  Talking," while Columbia's recent films have included "When Harry Met Sally . .  ." and "Ghostbusters II."  </P></p>

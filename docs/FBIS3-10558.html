			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Pritsiolas] </F>   [Text] Opposition spokesmen said yesterday alleged Middle  Eastern terrorists are in Panama to execute attacks during the  weeks before the 8 May general elections.    Mario Rognoni, PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party]  legislator, said his party has reports "radical" elements have  been making contacts with those foreigners so they will execute  violent actions.    According to Rognoni, that group of Middle Eastern  individuals reportedly operates from a residence in San  Francisco corregimiento.    The opposition legislator said PRD presidential candidate  Ernesto Perez Balladares has been informed of the situation, but  he does not plan to decrease his campaign visits.    Mario Rognoni said the intelligence team that works with  Perez Balladares gathered the reports about the presence of  Middle Eastern extremists in Panama.    According to Rognoni, all the parties that have nominated  presidential candidates have on their teams people who in one  way or another undertake intelligence tasks.    Meanwhile, Camilo Brenes, Christian Democratic Party  legislator, reiterated yesterday Bocas del Toro Province is one  of the points used for arms trafficking.    Brenes said the Changuinola area on the border with Costa  Rica was used in the past to bring in trailer trucks loaded with  weapons from Central American countries.    Camilo Brenes said he does not have information on the  hiring  of Middle Eastern extremists, but he said anything is possible.    Months prior to the U.S. invasion of Panama several officers  of the then Defense Forces traveled to Middle Eastern countries  to seek military support to confront the North Americans.    They were looking for surface-to-air missiles. One of those  in charge of that mission was Captain Asuncion Gaitan, then  chief of General Manuel Antonio Noriega's bodyguards. It is  unknown whether he was able to obtain these weapons.    A short time ago, Roberto Troncoso, head of the Panamanian  Human Rights Committee (CPDH), warned about the possibility of  death squads operating in Panama.    On that occasion, the authorities denied they had reports on  this and urged the CPDH to provide any information in this  regard.</p>

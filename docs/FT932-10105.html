			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Charging road users has high political cost - Toll roads unleashed explosive anger among the Norwegians TRANSPORT secretary Mr John MacGregor yesterday came face to face with some of the political risks and realities of introducing a system of charging people for the use of London's roads. On a fact-finding visit to one of the world's few road pricing schemes in the Norwegian capital of Oslo, he learned that shoppers, the young and the low-paid had emerged as some of the hardest hit by the charges. When the system was introduced in 1990, there were attempts to blow up the toll booths. It has remained unpopular, with the number of Oslo inhabitants opposed to the scheme little lower now than the level of 60 per cent initially. However, Mr MacGregor was told that the proceeds from the tolls had succeeded in financing the construction of new roads in the city, mostly in tunnels, which had helped eased city centre congestion. Mr MacGregor is visiting Scandinavia to see what lessons can be learned for his own plans to introduce road charging to Britain, initially on trunk roads and motorways and later in urban areas. He intends to set out his plans for motorway charges in a green paper in the next four to six weeks, but yesterday he said he would not take any decisions on urban road charging until a Department of Transport study of the issue had been completed towards the end of 1994. The Oslo urban road charging system was introduced in February 1990 with cross-party support to help finance a NK12bn (Pounds 1.138bn) programme of urban road building and improvements to public transport. The city is now ringed with 19 toll plazas where drivers pay an entry fee, either manually in cash or electronically through a debiting system similar to the one operating on London's Dartford Crossing. The entry fee is NK11 for vehicles up to 3.5 tonnes and double that for lorries, with discounts available for season tickets or multiple-entry tickets. Only motorcycles, buses, cars being driven by the handicapped, emergency vehicles and funeral processions are exempt from the charge. When vehicles go through the electronic debiting lanes without a payment being successfully deducted, their registration numbers are photographed so that they can be traced. Mr MacGregor was told that the violation rate was only 0.1 per cent, but some drivers went to elaborate lengths to avoid being charged - for example, covering their number plates with mud, bending the plates over so that they were horizontal to the road, or driving on the tail of the vehicle in front so that the camera could not get a clear view. Officials from Norway's Public Roads Administration said the introduction of road charges was estimated to have left total car journeys into the capital 5 per cent lower than they would otherwise have been. However, a high proportion of better-off workers had received help with the cost of an annual season ticket from their employers, while those who had stopped making journeys were mainly the less well-off and among off-peak users such as shoppers. The charges had also failed to produce any detectable increase in the use of public transport. Mr Olav Softeland, director general of the public roads administration, said it was 'basically an unpopular thing' to start charging for roads that had previously been free, and a 'hazardous thing' for a politician to put his name to.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 24 February at Radio Rebelde's Studio No. 2, in a  ceremony marking Rebelde's 36th anniversary, Fidel spoke of the  role that radio plays under the current circumstances:    [Begin recording] [Words indistinct] very clearly the  decisive role radio has at present. I could compare this moment  of the special period, this political moment the nation is  facing, with those days of fighting in the Sierra Maestra, with  those days in 1958 we have been mentioning here. The difference  is that this period is more prolonged. I would say that this  period is more difficult than that one. It requires more talent,  more commitment. The work is done under very complex conditions  today, particularly following the hard blows the national  economy has experienced. Only as a miracle of human will could  the country's resistance be explained. So now I see radio in  general -- I am not referring to Radio Rebelde alone, as a great  rebel radio -- in a period similar to that one, in a very  difficult and decisive moment. And I hope the workers, the  reporters, all those who work at in radio will be aware of this  and will be at the level of Radio Rebelde back then.    Some day new generations will meet here again, the younger  ones and some of the older ones will meet here again, and they  will meet to recall the important role played by radio during  these difficult days of the special period. [applause] [end  recording]    [Radio Progreso adds later in the broadcast that Castro's  visit to Radio Rebelde lasted over three hours and that he  stressed that, for very clear and objective reasons, nothing  today compares to radio. Castro pointed out that the role of  radio as a means of communication is growing: The print media  are limited because of paper shortages and television has  significantly reduced its programing because of problems with  electric power and resources. Progreso adds that Castro said  that in the Sierra we faced a local tyrant supported by  imperialism, while today we are confronting head-on an  imperialism that is employing every recourse in an effort to  destroy us. Castro underscored that today we are conducting a  greater and more meritorious struggle that the one waged then.]</p>

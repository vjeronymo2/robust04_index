			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 10 (TANJUG) -- Since the beginning of  the implementation of the country's economic recovery program at  the end of January, Yugoslavia's foreign currency reserves have  increased by 335 million German marks, it was said on Tuesday at  a meeting of the Federal Prime Minister, Radoje Kontic, with the  prime ministers of Serbia and Montenegro, Mirko Marjanovic and  Milo Djukanovic.    The Yugoslav Information Ministry said that the architect of  the program and governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia,  Dragoslav Avramovic, also attended the meeting. According to  the presented data, the National Bank of Yugoslavia has so far  purchased foreign exchange to the value of 502 million German  marks while it has sold around 167 million German marks to  citizens and firms during the same period.    The meeting confirmed the strong determination that budget  deficits should not covered by funds which have no foreign  currency backing and that credits for the revival of the economy  should not be approved if they are not covered as envisaged by  the program. A real increase in production could be expected  already this month, it was said at the meeting.    Money supply is still below the optimum level as compared  with the achieved social product and interest rates have  stabilized at the level of nine percent a year which is in  accordance with the stabilization program, it was said at the  meeting. The meeting pointed at difficulties occurring in the  implementation of the program, primarily in the domain of prices.    The Federal Trade Ministry is in charge of analyzing price  movements and urgently suggesting corresponding measures to the  federal government.</p>

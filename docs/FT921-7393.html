			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Gardening: An undercover story HALF-hardy annuals are those kinds which must be sown under cover to become advanced enough to flower outdoors in the same year. The usual practice is to sow in a moderately-heated greenhouse or propagator, with temperatures between 16-20`C (61-68`F), in February or March and to grow-on the seedlings in a slightly lower temperature until May, when they are accustomed gradually to outdoor temperatures. Then, late in May or early June, they can be planted in the garden. There are, however, all manner of variations on this treatment, just as there are all manner of differences in the characters and the actual degrees of tenderness of the plants we call half-hardy annuals. Some of them are not even annuals but perennials - for example, antirrhinums, lobelias and also Salvia splendens, the plant we used to call Scarlet Salvia until it started to blossom in other colours. There are also some half-hardy annuals that need not be sown until early May, such as zinnias and single-flowered annual asters; by then, they can be sown out of doors in many places. They will, of course, flower later and will not make such big plants as those that were sown a couple of months earlier, but they will avoid the checks to growth that can be caused by clumsy pricking-out or violent changes in temperature. What is certain about this rather ill-defined group of plants is that if you plan to grow some of them from seed, you should be making preparations now. If you prefer to buy plants ready to go direct into the garden, you should curb your impatience and not do anything until you are sure there is no further risk of frost - most particularly, the short-duration radiation frosts that can occur very severely around dawn in some places during April and much of May. People living near the sea or in towns often are best-placed to avoid these. Because antirrhinums are perennials, they tend to grow at a fairly leisurely rate and need to be sown rather early. I would certainly get them in by the end of February. But they are hardy compared with petunias, nicotianas or most marigolds which, if you are short of space in which to grow-on plants, might well be left for March sowing. The rate at which some of these true annuals can develop is astonishing. In February or March, you might be faced with perhaps a dozen seed pans occupying quite a small propagator. By April, there can be hundreds of little pots, each with its rapidly-growing seedling, and the greenhouse stagings are filled along with emergency shelves. Some seeds and seedlings are very small and difficult to handle. The dust-like seeds of begonias of all kinds need to be sown on the surface of smooth compost; then, they should be covered with a sheet of glass or a piece of tightly-stretched cling-film or polythene kept out of contact with the seeds and the soil. This should stay in place until the seeds germinate; then, it should be removed and the sprouted seeds covered with the merest sprinkling of fine peat or sand. It is possible to buy some seedlings in cartons in which the seeds have been germinated and are just at the right stage for pricking-out an inch or so apart in seed trays or whatever else you fancy. This method saves a lot of trouble, but I find there are usually so many seedlings in the cartons that you really need to share them with one or two other garden-owners. The biggest threat to all half-hardy seedlings in the early stages is damping-off disease (this is not really a single disease, but it is not necessary to distinguish between different forms). The thing is to avoid them all. That means using either naturally-sterile or sterilised seed and pricking-off composts, and also being extremely careful about drainage and avoiding over-watering. Low temperatures can also bring on a bad attack of damping-off which can wipe out whole cans of seedlings in a day or so. It is said that the disease can be checked by watering affected seedlings with a fungicide called Cheshunt Compound but, once the troubles have started, this is not really very successful. This does not mean it is not worthwhile to water compost in the seed pans before or immediately after the seed is sown, as a preventative rather than a cure. Most seeds will germinate equally well in the light or dark but some have preferences. Impatiens, the Busy Lizzie, must have light so it should not be shaded in any way, not even with compost. The method of covering the seed pan with glass, polythene film or cling-film can be followed and will have the added advantage of maintaining a moist compost and a humid atmosphere. Mark well, however that they need light - not scorching sunshine. The seed pans should be in a shady place where conditions will be equable all the time rather than fluctuating rapidly, and the temperature at least 21`C (70```F). After germination, this can drop to 18`C (65`F). Geraniums are half-hardy perennials but vast numbers are treated now as if they were half-hardy annuals and grown from seed sown each year. They are not the easiest of seeds to germinate, although most seed companies help the gardener by preparing them with clarification carried out by hand or with acid. Whether treated or not, a temperature of 21-24`C (70-75`F) is necessary for germination and the seeds should be sown quite deeply - about a quarter-inch (6mm). As all geranium seed is expensive, it seems wise to leave it until you have gained experience with easier things such as marigolds. The seeds of these are large and easy to handle, they have no special fads, and they can be spaced widely enough in the seed pans to dispense with the need for pricking-off. Instead, the seedlings can go direct into small pots when they have made two or three true leaves; then, since they grow rapidly, they can be moved into larger pots when the little ones get full of roots. There are plenty of half-hardy annuals and plants treated as such which should give little trouble. These include antirrhinums, ageratum, brachycome, Chabaud carnations and annual pinks, cosmos dimophocheca, lavatera, lobelia, nemesia, nicotiana, petunia, Rudbeckia Marmalade and Rustic Dwarfs, venidium, verbena and zinnia.</p>

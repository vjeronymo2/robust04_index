			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Hosokawa escapes gunshots Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa yesterday escaped unhurt after a gunman fired a shot in his direction while he was leaving a Tokyo hotel, AP reports. The gunman was wrestled to the floor. Police say they believe he may be a member of an extremist right-wing group who could have acted out of anger over Mr Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's actions in the second world war.</p>

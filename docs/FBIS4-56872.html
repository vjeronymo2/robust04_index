			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "180 Minutes of News" newscast] </F>   [Text] The transportation strike is in effect throughout  the metropolitan areas of Caracas, Sucre District, and Carabobo  State. In terms of Caracas, the city is paralyzed. The strike  was called because the government owes transportation workers  student fare subsidies but has failed to pay, despite an earlier  announcement that the payments will be made.    Passenger buses and cabs shut their engines off last night.  The government has warned it will crack down on any public  disorder. Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom addressed the  nation last night and called on students not to be influenced by  the professional agitators taking advantage of the  transportation strike. The government, through the Interior  Ministry, called today's transportation strike illegal and urged  reflection on the situation. The minister also said the  transportation strike is unfounded. He said the government has  the funds to pay the subsidy on preferential student bus fares,  which is the reason behind the call for the strike.    [Begin Escovar recording] A strike like this affects the  poorer sectors of the population and harms the general interest  of the community. Therefore, it is an affront against the  nation's basic interests, which the government is obliged to  defend as established by the Constitution and the law. [end  recording]    Minister Escovar Salom reminded the transportation workers  that routes and permits are granted by the government and must  be used to serve the public and not personal interest.</p>

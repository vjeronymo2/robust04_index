			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Pounds 10m fire was 'waiting to happen' The fire which engulfed the Allied Colloids chemical plant at Low Moor, Bradford, was 'waiting to happen,' a Health and Safety Executive official said yesterday. No-one died in the blaze in July 1992, but more than 30 people were taken to hospital. The blaze cost the company at least Pounds 10m. The fire could have been prevented if two incompatible chemicals, which formed a highly flamable explosive mixture, had not been stored together, the Health and Safety Executive said. 'This was a major fire which was waiting to happen given the circumstances,' HSE area director Ms Norma Collins said, launching a report on the blaze. She said the company 'had stored incompatible chemical substances together, chemicals which should never be stored together because of their dangerous properties'. She added: 'It is deplorable that the cause of the fire was well known throughout the industry and there had been previous advice and guidance. The company's management systems left a lot to be desired in relation to safe operating procedures. 'We have to ensure that arrangements for dealing with emergencies of this nature are adequate.' The company said it had taken on board all the lessons and was implementing safety procedures, and new warehouses were being built. Allied Colloids was fined Pounds 100,000 and ordered to pay Pounds 62,000 in costs at subsequent court hearings for breaching health and safety laws.</p>

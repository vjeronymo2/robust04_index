			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Embassy terrorism threat highlighted last year which includes the Israeli embassy - as a prime potential target for a car-bomb attack was given to the royal household and to the Metropolitan Police at the end of last year. The 100-page risk analysis, which detailed the resurgent threat of fundamentalist groups opposed to peace moves in the Middle East, was prepared by one of Britain's leading anti-terrorist experts. It was commissioned by officials working for the royal family as part of a security review of Kensington Palace, which is near the Israeli embassy. The report's author, Major John Wyatt, was a serving officer in Northern Ireland. His private company, Search Training International, has advised businesses on protection against terrorism and on security for the Crown Jewels. The report describes the embassy area as a 'credible attack scenario' for a 'vehicle bomb' because terrorist organisations would gain maximum international publicity from a successful operation. Maj Wyatt said this week that he had been concerned before Tuesday's bomb at the Israeli embassy about security being relaxed. However he added that in his view 'no degree of risk analysis' could have prevented the attack from taking place. He said: 'The problem faced by the security forces is striking a balance between maintaining an effective level of security and not unduly disrupting life in London.' Nevertheless, news of the report's existence will be an embarrassment to security officials, who have already been criticised by the Israeli government for ignoring requests for additional security after the July 18 bomb attack on the central Jewish community building in Buenos Aires which killed at least 96 people. Scotland Yard would not comment on the report but a police official expressed surprise that a risk analysis for Kensington Palace on such a sensitive subject should have been commissioned from a private consultancy and not from the police or the intelligence agencies. The report does not specifically refer to the Israeli embassy. However it identifies the growing threat of terrorism by Iran and by fundamentalist groups, such as Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hizbollah and Hamas, the Islamic resistance movement based in Damascus, opposed to the Middle East peace moves. According to the analysis, the terrorist threat had shifted from the US to Europe after bomb attack on New York's World Trade Centre. Whereas the US was 'too alien' to fundamentalists for such an attack to succeed again, Europe had become better known to extremist groups as an area where the 'juxtaposition of races and creeds' was sufficient to 'hide the perpetrators'. Predictions of an upsurge in fundamentalist terrorism do not appear to have been shared by MI5 and MI6, the intelligence agencies. Both appear to have focused their attention on the threat posed by the IRA.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Appointments: Bodies politic Derek Tordoff, director of the British Constructional Steelwork Association, and Michael McKinstry, purchasing director of Rover, are appointed representatives to the Consultative Committee of the European Coal and Steel Community. ***** John Holland is appointed president of the NATIONAL TYRE DISTRIBUTORS ASSOCIATION. ***** John Hill, a director of various subsidiaries of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, is appointed chairman of COMET, the Committee for Middle East Trade; he succeeds The Hon David Douglas-Home. ***** Barbara Deacon is elected chairman of the GIFTWARE ASSOCIATION. ***** Simon Dyer, the director general of the Automobile Association, has become world president of the ALLIANCE INTERNATIONALE de TOURISME. ***** Bob Hubbard, group business director of Eagle Star Life, is appointed president of The PENSIONS MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE from July. ***** Derek Jackson, formerly chief executive of the Heart of England Tec, has been appointed executive director of the CORONARY PREVENTION GROUP. ***** Gerry Klapwyk, director of the Slough Plastering Company, is the new president of the FEDERATION OF SPECIALIST BUILDING CONTRACTORS. ***** Ronnie Pugh, md of Polbeth Packaging, has been elected chairman of the PACKAGING AND INDUSTRIAL FILMS ASSOCIATION. ***** Gordon Gaddes, director of the Federation of British Electrotechnical and Allied Manufacturers' Association, has been appointed chairman of The EUROPEAN ELECTROTECHNICAL SECTORAL COMMITTEE. ***** John Barnett has resigned as a director of JARVIS PORTER, the specialist label printing group which is shaping up into a more aggressive business under the guidance of the recently-installed chief executive, Richard Brewster. Barnett, a former management consultant at Alexander Proudfoot who was in charge of group strategy, saw his role evaporate as Brewster shortened the lines of communication and assumed more immediate responsibility for the company's direction. Paul Jarvis, chairman, says: 'We were a bit top-heavy and so John decided to leave by mutual agreement.' The genial Brewster was the main architect of the dynamic acquisitive growth of David S Smith, the paper and packaging group, and has again hit the acquisition trail at Jarvis Porter since joining a year ago. ***** EUROPEAN LEISURE, which owns discotheques and snooker halls, is losing its finance director, Christopher Critchlow. Critchlow is to become finance director of a division of an unnamed listed company in the leisure sector. European Leisure is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office over its acquisition of Midsummer Leisure in 1990. European Leisure says, however, that Critchlow is leaving for personal reasons and that his departure has nothing to do with the SFO investigation. He lives in London and for family reasons was unable to move to European Leisure's new headquarters which are in Leicestershire. ***** Ian Barr, group financial controller of COOKSON, the materials group, is to become chief financial officer from May 1. He will replace Fergus Munro, finance director, who is leaving the company. According to chairman Robert Malpas, Munro's departure is part of the process of slimming down management and the headquarters. Barr will report to Richard Oster, managing director. The position of finance director will not be filled immediately. ***** Rocky Stone, a non-executive director of SMITH NEW COURT for eight years, died on April 18.</p>

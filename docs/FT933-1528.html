			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cantab's UK flotation will give Pounds 50m value CANTAB Pharmaceuticals, the Cambridge-based bio-technology company already quoted in the US, yesterday launched its pathfinder prospectus for a UK flotation through a placing set to be priced on September 19. The issue is expected to raise Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m and value the company at about Pounds 50m. It is likely to be priced relative to that prevailing in the US where Cantab issued 1m shares at Dollars 10 (670p) last year. Cantab is some way from producing a marketable product but is closest with a drug called LM-CD45, designed to reduce the incidence of rejection in kidney transplant operations. Mr Paul Hancock, chief executive, said a key strength of the company had been the links it had formalised with British academic institutions, notably Cambridge University. BZW is acting as adviser. The shares will start trading on October 25.</p>

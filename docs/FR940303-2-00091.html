			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Description of the Loan: The loan amount is the original principal amount of the loan being insured unless a modification is necessitated in connection with the closing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  &bull;Source of funds for the Loan: In the second full sentence on page 2 the source of funds must be accurately identified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> List of Documents <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;In General: If there are no brackets around a particular document, the document is one which is commonly used for initial endorsements for insured advances completion cases; however, it should be emphasized that it is impossible to list every document for every insured loan. Further, no attempt has been made to list all documents utilized in all types of refinancings and certain specialized programs, e.g. certificates of need and licenses for health care programs. Conversely, some documents may not be utilized in a particular transaction and should be deleted from the list in the actual opinion. Brackets around the name of the document indicate that the document may or may not be used for every loan. If bracketed documents are not used in a particular loan transaction, then delete such documents from the list in the actual opinion. Each document executed in connection with the loan must be listed by its correct title, showing each party executing it and its date. If documents are dated ``as of'' a particular date, then such phrase should be included in the description in the text. It is imperative that care must be taken to compile a list that accurately and completely reflects the transaction in the submission to HUD of the initial draft. After HUD review of the initial draft, the opinion may have to be modified, as necessary, to satisfy HUD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All documents executed in connection with the loan transaction must be listed regardless of whether the document is required by HUD. The appropriate HUD or FHA form number, if applicable, must be indicated in parenthesis after each document. Please note that the Guide lists a four digit number after virtually all of the standard HUD documents. In many instances as these forms have been updated, the four digit number has been changed so that they are now preceded by a ``9.'' However, HUD is in the process of changing to a standardized four digit number which should become effective in 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Organizational Documents: All of the Organizational Documents must be reviewed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. In addition to reviewing the Organizational Documents listed in the opinion, the following HUD guidelines should be followed in preparing or reviewing the following organizational documents. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

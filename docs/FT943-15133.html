			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Markets: Innovative technology - Economic Eye A few years ago, a senior Eurocrat lectured me on why Europe's future hinged on information technology. IT was so vital, he insisted, that control over its production would determine competition in every other business. 'If we have no IT industries, Japan and the US will dominate our economies,' he said. Such extreme paranoia is rare. Yet there is a tenacious belief, even among more sober policymakers, that high-tech is 'special' and merits attention which they would never lavish on other industries. In the name of investing in future prosperity, Europe has pumped billions of Ecus into collaborative research and development efforts, such as Esprit and Eureka, intended to strengthen the competitiveness of producers across a range of high-tech sectors. That Europe's high-tech trade balance has nonetheless continued to deteriorate, and that it has been marginalised in the computer and semiconductor markets, has caused some in Brussels to question the value of these efforts. But such doubts have not deterred the Clinton administration from embarking on a similar course. In the past 18 months, it has launched a battery of initiatives to support industrial R&amp;D and product development. Washington has long been the world's biggest R&amp;D spender, with an annual budget of Dollars 70bn. Most of the money has been for federal defence, space and energy programmes. The aim now is to re-orient spending to bolster producers in commercial markets. Whether results in the US will be any better than in Europe is debatable. But a more basic question is why high-tech attracts privileged treatment. Few of the most common explanations look convincing. One is that high-tech and other research-intensive industries matter because they account for an above-average share of output in advanced economies. But while that is true in the aggregate, individual industries' wealth-creating performance vary widely. Many leading pharmaceuticals companies are phenomenally profitable. But value-added per worker in US electronics manufacturing is barely an eighth of that in cigarette-making. Few jet airliner programmes ever recover their costs, while Philips, Europe's biggest electronics group, had negative value-added for many years. Some high-tech enthusiasts concede that point, but argue that the real benefits are more indirect. For instance, they say, high-tech industries raise skill levels by employing highly trained workers at above-average wages. But surely, in market economies, well-qualified workforces stimulate the creation of productive and rewarding jobs, rather than the reverse. That is certainly the lesson of Asia's 'tiger' economies. Another argument made in high-tech's favour is that it generates research-based spillovers which enrich the rest of the economy. However, generalisations are difficult. Civil aircraft makers clearly gain from defence research, while California's Silicon Valley has prospered hugely from the ceaseless cross-fertilisation of ideas and technology. It is less clear who has benefited from IBM's renowned habit of investing heavily in research which it often never exploited. In truth, spillovers depend as much on the effective diffusion of technology as on its volume and quality. Governments also often claim that a strong high-tech capacity is strategically necessary. Without local access to advanced technologies, it is said, users will be at the mercy of foreign producers. But in many high-tech industries, notably electronics, success often depends less on originating research than on appropriating it through efficient volume manufacturing. As a result, today's vital technologies can quickly become tomorrow's low-margin commodities. In this context, the Pentagon's recent project in flat panel display screens seems to be tempting fate. Worried by its reliance on scarce supplies from Japan, it has offered Dollars 500m in subsidies to persuade US companies to make them. Yet Korean companies are now investing in so much production capacity that the shortage may soon become a worldwide glut. Finally, it is often argued that high-tech is special because of its pervasive importance to industrial users. But though its application is commercially necessary, it rarely confers decisive advantage. Indeed, a recent international analysis of manufacturing by McKinsey, the management consultancy, found no instance where superior use of high-tech explained a market leader's success. So why do high-tech industries exude such political allure? One reason may be that many have long depended heavily on governments as customers, owners or regulators. Such cosy relations favour clientelism and special interest lobbying. Second, high-tech industries' glamour and fast-changing nature have encouraged a belief that more technology-push means more innovation. Witness, for instance, the UK government's recent effort to ginger up industrial performance by publishing a corporate R&amp;D 'scoreboard'. But technology and innovation are separate things, and the relationship between them is complex and subtle. If government policies drew the distinction more clearly, they would avoid a lot of misdirected effort and expensive mistakes.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- EXPORT MARKET SHARES (1) AND IMPORT PENETRATION (2) 1970 AND 1990  ----------------------------------------------------------------                   High             Medium            Low                technology        technology       technology              1970      1990    1970      1990   1970      1990  ------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        3.9       2.8     8.9       5.9    7.0       6.1              42.2     *63.4    42.9     *53.3   12.1     *16.8 France        7.7       8.7     8.5      10.0   10.7      12.1              21.6    **31.6    19.7    **34.1   10.7      21.4 Germany      17.7      16.2    23.1      24.7   15.0      17.9              14.9   ***37.0    17.2   ***29.5   11.1   ***20.9 Italy         5.5       5.1     7.1       7.7    8.5      12.8              16.2      22.8    23.6      28.9   11.6      15.7 Japan        13.2      21.1     8.5      16.9   13.2       7.1               5.2   ****5.4     4.5   ****5.9    3.0   ****6.6 UK           10.5      10.2    11.9       8.5    8.9       8.5              17.4     *42.4     n/a     *39.4   12.4     *19.8 US           31.1      26.3    21.7      15.4   13.4      13.3               4.2  ****18.4     5.6  ****18.5    3.8   ****8.8  -------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

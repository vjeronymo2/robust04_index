			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / The Long View: Throes of thrift Chancellors of the Exchequer like to pay respectful homage to the nation's savers, but sometimes thrift can go too far. The personal sector savings ratio hit a remarkable 12 1/2 per cent in 1992, and expectations of a lively consumer-led economic recovery depend on that falling to, say, 9 per cent next year. This is not a time when encouraging the savings habit is a priority, which is just as well, the track record of previous chancellors in creating tax breaks fails to stand up to close scrutiny. One tax-based investment scheme which already has a termination date of December 31, 1993 pinned on it is the Business Expansion Scheme, introduced in 1983 to encourage wealthy private individuals to provide risk capital to support small, unquoted companies. Rather than raising the flow of capital, however, the BES seemed to increase the risks. Few made money except the intermediaries. Soon the search was on for lower-risk businesses which qualified under the rules, but they were asset speculations rather than the manufacturers and traders that the government had targeted. The BES's final fling has been in financing rented housing, with the likes of Oxford colleges raising millions to house students: this is a worthy cause, no doubt, but surely does not carry a high priority for the taxpayers' support when there is a Pounds 50bn budget deficit. Then there was John Major's own pet scheme from his days as chancellor, the Tessa. This popped up for no obvious reason in the 1990 Budget, and was immediately open to the criticism that it would encourage little new saving, but only cause existing deposits to be shifted to the tax-free accounts. Although about Pounds 15bn has been lured into Tessas, the benefit to the public interest is hard to see. Neither has much of a favour been done for Tessa holders, who are now trapped. When the accounts were first available in January 1991 they yielded about 14 per cent. Next January the return may be down to 5 1/2 per cent and who knows how much lower it might go? After all, the banks and building societies can now exploit a helpless group of depositors. This is because nearly all the Tessas were opened in 1991, and cannot be liquidated before 1996 without the loss of all previous years' tax relief. Kenneth Clarke could do these depositors a favour, and save the Exchequer a little future money too, by closing the Tessa scheme down after three years, with tax relief. Another tax-based savings scheme that has veered off course is the personal equity plan. This was Nigel Lawson's bright idea in 1986 to encourage direct investment in UK equities at the expense of the institutions. The Pep, along with various employee share schemes and the privatisation of businesses on the cheap, was intended to promote 'popular capitalism'. Originally collective funds such as unit trusts and investment trusts were excluded from Peps, but they lobbied hard and won a modest foothold. With less than masterly timing, Peps were launched a few months ahead of the 1987 stock market crash and sales lagged badly. This gave the collective fund promoters their chance: they could provide the marketing drive which might get the Peps off the ground. Today the Pep has become overwhelmingly a unit trust tax break, with sales of Pounds 2bn of unit trust Peps in the last tax year. A full Pounds 6,000 annual Pep can be invested in a collective fund, only half of which need even be in equities. Now the unit trust trade association Autif is lobbying for Pounds 3,000 tax-exempt gilt-edged plans to be introduced in next week's Budget. The industry could shift Pounds 1bn a year in gilt plans, it reckons. Among other claimed advantages the gilt plans would further boost popular capitalism - though frankly it beats me what an investment in government bonds has to do with capitalism. This, I suppose, should only be regarded as a nice try by the unit trust men. But I would remind Kenneth Clarke that if he really wants to offer tax incentives to individuals for buying gilts he simply has to offer a tax-exempt issue through National Savings. Norman Lamont surreptitiously reduced the appeal of Peps last March through his cut in the rate of tax which could be reclaimed on UK company dividends from 25 to 20 per cent. More seriously, the same applied to pensions, including personal pension plans. So passive last March, the pensions industry has worked up a furious propaganda campaign ahead of the latest Budget, fearful that its formidable remaining annual Pounds 15bn of tax reliefs will prove an irresistible target for Clarke. Certainly the Chancellor must focus on the logic underlying the tax treatment of the main savings schemes in pensions and life assurance, and can ill afford to be diverted by pet projects. Life assurance is an emergency case for the Treasury, although paradoxically it may not figure in the Budget. Three years ago the Inland Revenue conducted a review of life assurance taxation, but ignored the implications of the Third Life Directive which was then only in draft but is soon due for implementation throughout the European Union. From next July life companies based around Europe, and especially in Luxembourg and Dublin, will be able to market investment policies into the UK offering tax-free roll-up. Caught napping, the life industry and the Revenue are locked in secret sessions to find a response. Tax men hate to recognise it, but there is a world out there where they do things differently. When the frontiers are opened investors are no longer helpless victims of the local tax inspectors. Internationalisation will mean that British chancellors will no longer find it easy to devise their own little savings schemes. Recent history suggests that will be a thoroughly good thing.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Arts: The Plough and the Stars - Young Vic With yet another initiative to solve the Irish Problem currently under way, this revival of Sean O'Casey's The Plough and the Stars is a timely reminder of how old and intractable the Troubles are. And how peripheral to the real lives of the people. This is no idealistic view of the 1916 Easter Rebellion. The heroes are not the patriots of the Irish Citizen Army, urged by stirring nationalistic rhetoric to 'Welcome war like the Angel of God', but the working class poor of the Dublin tenement who use the mayhem to loot the shops, but who rally automatically when the conflict enters their home. O'Casey is magnificent at toying with the emotions of the audience. The doomed sacrifice of Jack Clitheroe (Breffni McKenna), who puts loyalty to the Cause before his young wife because he is 'afraid to be called afraid', hardly touches us. It is the Empire loving Bessie Burgess (Judi Dench), who intersperses choruses of 'Rule Britannia' with abuse of the Fenians, who displays the truer loyalty because her commitment to the tenement is unthinking and spontaneous. The young communist Covey lives through slogans while the drunken carpenter Fluther acts courageously without the burden of ideals. What gives this good old fashioned four-act tragedy enduring life is O'Casey's ability to throw in everything and lose little. This is how life felt in Dublin during that fateful weekend. In Sam Mendes' production the Rebellion is ominously close in the ratatat of machine guns and the boom of cannons but it never replaces the petty bickerings of the tenants, the marital strains, the endemic sickness, the mundane poverty of the Dubliners, seeking small consolations in the liquor and the local tart. In a wrenching moment Nora Clitheroe (Niamh Cusack) temporarily wins back Jack's attention and seduces him into singing her a love song. And the second act, when the gentle shadow boxing of the locals in the pub is interrupted by the fiery speeches heard at the political rally outside, beautifully puts people before patriotism. Cramming a cast of 15 and four sets on to a tiny acting area creates problems (and makes for some intriguingly public set changes), and the strongly Irish cast is slow to warm to its task. But once the rhythm is caught, discreetly orchestrated by Judi Dench as the provoking widow, and John Rogan, all angles and itches as the nostalgic Fenian, the younger actors warm to their work. Niamh Cusack seizes her big speech on cowardice while the abashed men stand like sentries on the four corners of the stage awaiting the arrival of the inevitable catafalque. Life goes on, says O'Casey. Men while away the time playing cards alongside the coffin of the young consumptive; the English squaddies drink up the hot tea abandoned in the deserted flat. There is laughter here as well as constant tragedy. Mendes' production remains too earth bound and tentative to do full justice to the eternal truths but it is a brave stab at a great play.</p>

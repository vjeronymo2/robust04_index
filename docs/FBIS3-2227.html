In recent days, Hong Kong and foreign press units carried  reports saying that China has "detained more dissidents", and  prepared a list of about a dozen people.    Sources from the ministry said that only Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan  Hongbing and Wang Jiaqi are being investigated according to law  by public and state security organs as they are suspected of  being involved in unlawful acts in inciting turmoil and  disrupting social order or in criminal cases.    The rest of the people on the list, including Wei Jingsheng  and Wang Dan, are not put under detention, the sources said.    It is learned that Wei Jingsheng yesterday submitted an  application to the Public Security Department to go out of  Beijing for some private matter and his application has been  approved.</p>

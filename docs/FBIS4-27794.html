			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By securities division reporter Shuko Sadamoto] </F>   [Text] City banks are rushing to implement changes in  bond-trading strategy for clients in preparation for setting up  securities subsidiaries. Such action is being taken because of  banks' inevitable dependence on profits from bond trading for a  while even after establishment of subsidiaries and the  prerequisite to secure a comprehensive customer base in order to  ensure success in underwriting, which the banks see as a  potentially lucrative area. Moves to strengthen the bond sales  force are being taken aggressively by expanding formerly  understaffed sales staff handling government-secured bonds and  local government bonds and aggressively pursuing sales to small  and midsized regional financial institutions.    A bond trader at a major securities firm testifies,  "Formerly, most city banks would not consider approaching small  and midsized financial institutions, but recently they have gone  on a sales offensive and have succeeded in taking away our  clients." City banks have already embarked on the steady  building of an operating base even before establishing  securities subsidiaries.    Securities subsidiaries will be able to handle trading in  bonds such as corporate bonds, Euroyen bonds, and  interest-bearing financial institution bonds, which are not  handled by banks. However, these ordinary bonds, unlike  government bonds, are issued in small quantities and are thinly  traded and city banks will sell most of these bonds to small and  midsized regional financial institutions with whom they had only  limited dealings in the past.    The view is widespread that Nomura Securities is strong in  underwriting services because it has a "strong sales force." For  city bank securities subsidiaries without a network of branches,  the key to enhancing profits from bond trading and effective  performance of underwriting services will depend on how well  they can attract and process buy and sell orders from clients.    That being the case, city banks which had previously  emphasized government bonds and large investor accounts are now  emphasizing expansion of their sales forces to handle  government-guaranteed bonds and local government bonds.    At the end of November 1993, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank led other  banks in using computer terminals to provide the bid and ask  price on government-guaranteed bonds and local government bonds.  Such information is now being made available on 11 issues for  both central government agency and local government bonds. The  bank intends to expand its client base by trading in government  agency and local government bonds and to accumulate knowledge on  how to serve as market maker for future corporate bond issues  and manage bond inventories on ordinary bonds that are thinly  traded. The actions being taken by the bank, according to  trading sources, are motivated by "opportunities for larger  profits" with government agency and local government bonds where  the spread between bid and ask prices is wider, in comparison  with government bonds where spreads are limited.    Sources at Mitsubishi Bank comment, "Trading in government  agency and local government bonds is visibly increasing as  transactions in the over-the-counter market are taking place in  blocks of tens of billions of yen." Sales of  government-guaranteed bonds and local government bonds which  were underwritten in the past year by the investment accounts  department are being sold aggressively, while privately placed  local government bonds which cannot be handled by banks' product  accounts departments are being purchased from investment  accounts departments of regional banks and resold to life  insurance and trusts. It is a case where increased use of such  transaction conduits are proving to be effective.    Noticeable is the success being registered in acquiring new  clients in regional areas by building a sales force and  providing carefully tailored services. In April 1993, Sakura  Bank launched "Operation Roller" staffed by three specialists  who approached local banks, second local banks, trust banks,  credit associations, and agricultural cooperatives on a  concentrated basis to sell long-term government bonds,  government agency and local government bonds, and privately  placed local government bonds. Bond operations were expanded by  the team to all parts of Japan from Hokkaido to Okinawa into  areas other than prefectural government seats where bond sales  had previously never been made.    Sources in the securities sales department of Sakura Bank,  conceptualizing the establishment of securities subsidiaries,  express hope in "making even modest inroads relative to  potential corporate bond clients to whom it can sell via the  telephone."    If sole dependence is focused on public bonds, there will be  a limit to acquisition of new clients. In the competitive  bidding for 10-year long-term government bonds, Fuji Bank won  bids in fiscal year 1993 for 380 billion yen, three times that  of the previous year, with the objective of increasing clients  through the sale of government bonds. However, the bank decided  that more measures had to be taken and for two years has been  dispatching personnel to Daito Securities, an affiliate.  Currently, over 10 personnel are engaged in sales of corporate  and foreign bonds and are fully dedicated to making preparations  for future growth.    It appears that derivatives such as options and swaps which  are highly profitable will become one link in building up the  sales force. The investment accounts department of Sanwa Bank  began research in arbitrage trading involving derivatives  composed of an assortment of underlying products such as bonds  and stocks and in April formed a team that specializes in such  trading. In the case of Sanwa Bank, according to sources in its  trading department, it has the objective of "using the current  period to accumulate knowledge on how to respond to the  diversification and sophistication needs of clients with a view  toward expanding future operations."    However, sources at major securities firms which must deal  with the new competition state, "At present, the sales  capabilities of city banks pose no threat." Banks' securities  subsidiaries face major restrictions in terms of personnel,  branch networks, and securities that they can handle, such as  with stocks, thus placing them at a definite disadvantage to  major securities firms. A leading city bank official states that  steady efforts being made by city banks to launch city banks'  securities subsidiaries are a "necessary step toward ensuring  the profitability of the subsidiaries," and it appears that they  have not been afforded the best of operating conditions.</p>

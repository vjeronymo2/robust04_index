			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Canadian life insurers' rating higher than US CANADA'S life insurers are in better financial shape than their US counterparts, but face a significant competitive threat from the big domestic banks, according to a report by Standard &amp; Poor's, the New York rating agency. S &amp; P predicted that the Canadian industry 'will continue to be well-capitalised, generally profitable and financially strong'. Most of the largest underwriters - including Sun Life of Canada, Manufacturers Life, Great-West Life and Canada Life - still carry a Triple A rating on their ability to meet policyholders' claims. The optimistic assessment is based largely on the fewer number of competitors than the US and the greater market penetration of the leading companies. S &amp; P estimates that the top five Canadian insurers have an operating leverage of 8.9 times capital, well below the 14.6 times leverage of the leading US companies. The combined capital base of the five largest Canadian companies was CDollars 8.3bn (USDollars 6.4bn) at the end of 1991, about one-third the size of their US counterparts. The US economy is about 10 times the size of Canada.</p>

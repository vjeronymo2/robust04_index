			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Gt Portland rises Great Portland Estates, the property investment company, managed to pull off the unusual achievement of a rise in share price on the back of a rights issue and a dividend cut. The shares finally gained 8 to finish at 197p after the market responded favourably to the one-for-four Pounds 95m cash call that the company is making to mount acquisitions. Great Portland is looking to spend Pounds 70m on retail properties and office space. The company made its move in a generally optimistic climate in the sector. 'This won't be the last rights issue we see in property and investors are seeing them as an opportunity for the sector to regenerate,' said one analyst. Another saw buoyancy continuing while the appetite of investors remained strong. Great Portland's clearly stated intentions for the cash injection, and the fact that the dividend cut for this year from 10p to 8p had been flagged at the interim stage last November, inspired the confidence of the market. And at 150p per share the rights pricing was well viewed. The UK's two principal quoted holiday companies, Airtours and Owners Abroad, raced higher after leisure analysts adopted a much more bullish view of the holiday travel business. 'Volumes and achieved margins look set to show good growth this summer,' said Mr Roy Owens, a leisure specialist at Smith New Court, the stockbroker. Airtours also continued to attract keen interest in the market amid persistent talk that the company is about to launch a move to acquire Hogg Robinson travel agencies. Airtours, with interim figures due to be announced at the end of the month, advanced 9 to 318p, while Owners Abroad rose 7 to 102p. Other leisure stocks performed exceptionally well, led by Rank Organisation, which added 24 at 744p. Dixons slipped 4 to 208p. Analysts suggested that the stalling of the planned flotation by Clydesdale, the chain of electrical retailers in Scotland and northern England, may have dented confidence. Vodafone's recent strong performance was halted by a bout of profit-taking after the group announced profits at the very top of the market's range and matched best estimates for the dividend. At the close Vodafone shares were 14 1/2 lower at 451p after turnover of 8m. Strong demand for English China Clays early in the session saw the shares forge ahead. Some of the early gain was surrendered and the stock finished 16 up at 435p. Southend Properties did not match the success story of Great Portland when it announced a Pounds 24m convertible issue and a cut in dividend. Its shares slid from 82p to 70p. One analyst blamed the downward movement on a feeling that the dividend cut was a surprise and seemed to be 'quite defensive'. Thorn EMI closed 5 lighter at 863p following a presentation to analysts. Worries about the trading statement at next Monday's annual meeting left Ladbroke Group 3 cheaper at 185p. Christian Salvesen softened 2 to 352p in nervous trading ahead of tomorrow's results.</p>

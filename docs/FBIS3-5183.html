			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Italicized portions are recorded in English, fading into </F> Vietnamese translation]    [Summary] Visiting Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong  held a news conference in Hanoi on the evening of 3 March. At  the conference, "Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong gave a briefing of  the meetings with Vietnamese leaders at which both sides  informed each other about the current situation of their  country, exchanged views on issues necessary for promoting  friendly relations and mutual understanding, and discussed  economic, investment, and trade cooperation between Vietnam and  Singapore in the period to come."    In response to a BANGKOK POST reporter's question regarding  ASEAN membership for Vietnam, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said:    [Goh Chok Tong] Singapore supports Vietnam joining  ASEAN, but it should be done at the appropriate time. When that  will happen depends on how Vietnam can contribute to the  activities and affairs of ASEAN. I suggest that Vietnam study  these programs. Vietnam is presently an observer of ASEAN, and  its membership in ASEAN is only a matter of time. ASEAN opens  its door to Vietnam, and only Vietnam can decide when to  join.    Answering a reporter of the Voice of Vietnam Radio who asked  about the Vietnam-Singapore relations after the lifting of the  U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam, he said:    [Goh Chok Tong] At the moment, Singapore is Vietnam's  largest trading partner, and the eighth largest investor. With  the lifting of the U.S. trade embargo, we believe more American  investment will come to Vietnam, not immediately, but maybe in a  few years. Relations between Vietnam and Singapore have a bright  future, though they only started three years ago. It was a  short time, but I can affirm that our relations are excellent.  Vietnam has sent many missions to Singapore to study our  experience. I believe that business relations between the  United States and Vietnam will also develop very well.    Asked by a NHAN DAN reporter for his impression on his first  visit to Vietnam, he said:    [Goh Chok Tong] The visit to Vietnam reminds me of  Singapore 30 years ago. I believe that Vietnam has tremendous  potential for economic development. Singapore's investment in  Vietnam can only develop if Vietnam achieves political stability  and economic development. I believe that in the coming period,  Vietnam's economy will develop strongly.</p>

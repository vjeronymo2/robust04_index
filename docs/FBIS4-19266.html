			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Hilde Harbo report: "Probable `Yes' From Hagen"] </F>   [Text] Carl I. Hagen believes that it is of little  significance whether or not Norway becomes a member of the EU  [European Union].    Nor does he think that Norwegian influence in the EU is  important in itself.    "The central issue is party political influence, not  nationalistic considerations," he said.    The Progress Party chairman has little enthusiasm for  Norwegian EU membership, even though he expects that he will end  up saying "yes." He is planning to make public his personal  view of Norwegian membership at a press conference today. Hagen  said that even though he is basically positive toward the EU, he  has grown more and more skeptical toward the plans for further  union.    He has little enthusiasm for the EU's goal of a common  currency and a central bank, and is also deeply dissatisfied  with the EU's agricultural and regional policies which he  believes bear the mark of the planned economy.    The only unambiguously positive aspect of the EU that he can  see is the importance of the organization for peace and security  in Europe.    "The sum total of all the rest is neither here nor there. By  this I mean that Norwegian membership will not in itself mean  major changes. Both the `no' and `yes' sides exaggerate when  they respectively portray the EU as a hell and as a paradise.  The important thing is how Norway adapts and what policies we  pursue. We could for example choose to follow the EU's rules  even if we remained outside," Hagen said.    Hagen does not want the party's national conference this  coming weekend to reach a decision on the full negotiated  membership agreement with the EU, and pointed out that the  party's program has laid down that the matter will be decided at  a meeting of the party's national executive. Party chairman  Hagen thinks that the organization needs time to evaluate the  outcome of the negotiations and backs an extraordinary national  executive meeting in June. He also stressed, however, that he  fully accepts that the national conference can reach a decision  on Norwegian membership if this is the wish of the national  conference.</p>

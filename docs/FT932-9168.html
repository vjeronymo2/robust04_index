			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Devaluation supports Madrid, Lisbon THE likelihood of a devaluation of the peseta and escudo, confirmed after the close of trading, had an electrifying effect on trading in the Spanish and Portuguese equity markets yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. MADRID took off, the general index closing 9.96 or 4.1 per cent higher at 251.81 as the Spanish government's request for a peseta realignment encouraged estimates of a 5 to 10 per cent currency devaluation, and hopes of interest rate cuts. Turnover soared, reaching an estimated Pta64bn against Wednesday's Pta27.72bn (including Pta11.23bn for Argentaria on its first day of trading), and an average of around Pta11bn last week. Mr Craig Prime at FG in Madrid said that Argentaria had brought banks into the spotlight, but that interest rate speculation had given them lift-off yesterday with Santander and Popular in the lead, up Pta480 or 9.2 per cent to Pta5,670, and Pta830, or 5.8 per cent to Pta15,150. Construction stocks were generally strong, Dragados gaining Pta135, or 7.6 per cent to Pta1,920; and Repsol put on Pta190, or 6.4 per cent to Pta3,140 on satisfaction with its first quarter results. LISBON also witnessed high turnover, some three times as large as normal, as a devaluation of the escudo seemed likely. The BTA index climbed more than 1 per cent to close at 1,732.3. Mr John Ferreira of Carnegie International commented that expectations of a substantial fall in the April inflation figure, due for release today, had also helped lift the market. FRANKFURT extended a rally founded on a recovery from an oversold position, the strong dollar, firm bond markets and continued hopes of a further cut in key interest rates. The DAX index rose another 10.33 to 1,639.79 in turnover of DM6.6bn. General strength in banks, with Commerzbank and Dresder up DM5 to DM285.50, and DM7.60 to DM391.60 respectively, backed up the bond market/interest rate argument. Degussa and Metallgesellschaft rose by DM7.80 to DM335, and by DM9.90 to DM321.90, reflecting a recovery from bombed-out levels and the hope that the gold price surge will reflect on sentiment. Wella, the haircare products group, produced good figures and took a thin share price up DM15.50 to DM705. PARIS made a moderate gain after the Bank of France cut money market rates. The CAC-40 index recorded a gain of 7.26 to 1,879.93 in average turnover of FFr2.5bn. Companies with exposure to Spain were affected by expectations of a imminent devaluation of the peseta: Carrefour slipped FFr43 to FFr2,629 and Promodes FFr9 to FFr756. Bouygues, which holds a 25 per cent stake in TF1, the television network, lost FFr15 or 2.4 per cent to FFr624 after the government said that it wanted to lift the limit on single shareholdings in television stations. TF1 advanced FFr21.90 to FFr458.20. MILAN put in an unexpectedly strong performance which was attributed to short-covering ahead of today's end of the monthly account and lingering hopes by many investors that the Bank of Italy might move to cut interest rates this weekend. The Comit index added 6.35 to 540.44, led higher by rallies in Stet, the state telecommunications group, and Fiat. Stet surged L157 or 5.8 per cent to L2,834, for a two day rise of 8.2 per cent, on strong foreign demand after a bullish profits forecast at a briefing for analysts on Wednesday. ZURICH met resistance as the SMI index tried to rally through the 2,200 level. After a firm start which had seen the index 12.0 ahead at 2,203.9, profit-taking left prices 9.2 easier on the day at 2,182.7. Zurich Insurance certificates added SFr35 to SFr1,115 in the wake of plans to switch them into bearers, which shed SFr40 to SFr2,250. Roche certificates dipped SFr10 to SFr4,480 amid some switching into other pharmaceuticals. Miss Virginia Pascoe of Williams de Broe noted that the company's market capitalisation had, for the first time, overtaken that of Nestle, prompting some of the recent demand as investors increased their weighting in the stock. AMSTERDAM registered a fall in spite of a strong performance from Royal Dutch, up Fl 4.40 at Fl 167.80, following strong first quarter results. The CBS Tendency index lost 1.0 to 108.1. DUBLIN was supported by the Bank of Ireland, up 3 per cent to IPounds 2.44, after announcing an unexpected dividend increase. The ISEQ index finished 17.24 higher at 1,560.55. ISTANBUL's 75-share index added 396.6 or 5 per cent to a new record close of 8,349.31. Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders credited reports of heavy subscription in new mutual funds, and an increasingly stable political outlook.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- May 13                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1156.02     1156.80     1156.16     1155.92 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1219.45     1219.52     1220.30     1220.88  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1156.16     1156.11     1154.30     1155.16 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1221.68     1220.73     1218.80     1219.59  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        May 12    May 11    May 10     May 7     May 6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1148.06   1140.44   1142.74   1142.41   1152.03 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1215.04   1206.03   1203.54   1200.34   1205.10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1157.27; 200 - 1222.79 Low/day: 100 - 1153.76  200 - 1218.05.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

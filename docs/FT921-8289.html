			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Virtue unrewarded If the Conservatives lose the election, the reason will be that Mr John Major came to office too soon, and with too little experience behind him, to sail free of Treasury thinking. If they win, it will be because he got nearly everything else right. The prime minister must take the blame if he is defeated, but even if he succeeds by a narrow margin he might ask himself why he placed so much trust in an institution that combines the technical abilities of Dumbo with the political sophistication of Mickey Mouse. Step back, and you will see what I mean. Between June 1987 and October 1989, economic policy was managed by Mrs Margaret Thatcher and Mr Nigel Lawson. The personal antipathy between them is well-known; the result was the Lawson boom, which led to today's Treasury bust. Fate is cruel: Mr Lawson may be partly to blame, but Mr Major cannot avoid carrying the can for the depression that today threatens his political career. He had no experience of high office before the 1987 election; after it, he became chief secretary, the man responsible for the expenditure side of the budget. Then in October 1989, he was suddenly thrust into the chancellorship. His officials loved it. Mr Lawson had had a sufficiently high estimation of himself to make his own mistakes; now they could hope to persuade an untried new chancellor to make the Treasury's mistakes. Mr Major is no puppet. He rightly determined that the overriding objective must be to reduce inflation, which was in danger of ballooning into the higher double digits and out of control. At some time - then or later - he must have been presented with forecasts that suggested that he could conquer inflation in time for an election. He would have been assured that while unemployment might be increasing, the recession needed to bring prices down would be over before the electorate was asked for its verdict. Meanwhile, Mrs Thatcher's 'skittish' attitude to Europe (the adjective is that of one of her erstwhile colleagues) had its own disastrous effect. It took a year for Mr Major to persuade her to take Britain into the exchange rate mechanism, but, either out of conviction or Treasury misdirection, or both, he did so at a challengingly high rate. Then in November 1990, as suddenly as he had become chancellor, he became prime minister. It is a job he has handled well. He was an excellent leader during the Gulf war. He abolished the poll tax. He invented (or developed) the Citizen's Charter, performed excellently on the world diplomatic stage and turned himself into the Conservatives' greatest electoral asset. What he did not do was shake off the curse of the Treasury. This would have been difficult, but not impossible. He could have anticipated the What Mr Major did not do was shake off the Treasury curse political damage likely to result from the ERM decision and tried for a re-alignment. He might have demanded of the new chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, that the 1991 budget should contain the fiscal stimulus currently expected of the 1992 budget. Perhaps he could have bought off the poll tax without raising VAT by quite so much, taking the strain by borrowing. He did not do any of this partly because it was not then certain that inflation would fall away in the summer and partly as a result of a desire to maintain the government's credibility in the markets. Anyway, the Treasury kept forecasting that there would be a resurgence of economic growth, perhaps in the second half of 1991, and, if not then, in the first half of 1992 - but surely in time for a May 1992 election. There were tremors in the autumn, but the increases in spending announced then apply from later this year. They do not have immediate political significance. Mr Lamont cannot be faulted for this. He is not a whizz on TV, but he has done the job he was given, keeping his nerve and sticking to orthodoxy. If your assumption is that the country comes first, and let political consequences fall where they may, Mr Lamont is your man. If Mr Major had wanted a heavyweight chancellor able to deploy deep-seated political instincts as a check on Treasury misinformation, he could have called on Mr Michael Heseltine. Only he would have stood a chance of re-aligning or reflating and simultaneously finessing market reactions. The realisation that the Treasury had led the government up a gum tree dawned on most members of the cabinet at around Christmas time. The previous strategy was based on false Treasury assumptions. Inflation would be down to 4 per cent or less, but the slump would not end before polling day. Nothing could be done about it. Ministers had been so absorbed with Maastricht that the upward creep of German interest rates came as a shock. A campaign time-table, setting out themes for every week until Easter, had been agreed at a November meeting of the 'political cabinet' - ministers minus officials. Prepared by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi under the instructions of the party chairman, Mr Christopher Patten, it was hotted up, re-submitted, and once again agreed. The Christmas plan is the one Mr Major is now working to. It accepts that the Tories may not be floated to victory by a rising tide of consumer spending. Against that, the Conservative machine, perhaps strengthened by desperation, is looking tougher and more professional than Labour's. It had the opposition on the run on taxation in January and it may do further damage this week with its campaign on trade union influences on the Labour party. The proposition to be put before the electorate is twofold - first:(whispered) 'Under her we made a mess of things but John Major has not put a foot wrong' and, second (shouted): 'Labour would make a worse hash of it.' It is not an edifying theme but it is all they have. Fiscal virtue is not always rewarded.</p>

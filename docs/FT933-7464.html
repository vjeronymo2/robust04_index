			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Airtours steps up holiday price war THE DISCOUNTING war in the 1994 summer package holiday market intensified yesterday as Airtours, the UK's third biggest travel group, said it would offer 100,000 children-go-free places to young people up to 19 following similar moves by its larger rivals Thomas Cook and Thomson, Gary Mead writes. The Manchester-based group added that the cost of a two-week holiday on Spain's Costa Brava for two adults and two children would be Pounds 491 for the whole family. The move was followed by Cosmos, another large UK tour operator, which said it would offer free places for 50,000 young people accompanied by their parents at nearly 300 hotels and apartments in 29 destinations, including Florida.</p>

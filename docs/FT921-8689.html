			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Pensions sales show growth SALES OF life assurance and pensions enjoyed strong growth last year, the Association of British Insurers reported yesterday. But its figures also suggested that consumer confidence in the stock market was low. There was a 6 per cent fall in takings for unit-linked regular-premium products, which are directly exposed to stock market fluctuations. Business in non-linked regular premium schemes, which spread risk more widely, increased by 9 per cent. The trend was more marked in single-premium life bonds. In non-linked bonds, some of which invest only in cash or government stocks, there was a 76 per cent rise in new business to Pounds 3.059m. In pensions, new single premiums rose 35 per cent to Pounds 4.164m, while annual premiums increased 8 per cent to Pounds 1.113m. Weekend, Page VI</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / BBC World TV plans African venture BBC World Service Television is about to expand into Africa in a joint venture with M-Net, the South African pay television service. The 24-hours-a-day BBC television service now available by atellite to more than 30 countries in Asia will begin broadcasting next week for 11 hours a day to Africa and will be carried on an Intelsat satellite covering the entire continent. The encoded service will be aimed mainly at embassies, hotels, universities and schools because a satellite dish of at least one metre diameter will be needed to pick it up. The BBC is also negotiating with a number of African broadcasting organisations for the service to be re-broadcast over traditional transmitters. The move into Africa is part of the BBC's strategy to turn World Service Television into a global service within the next two years to compete head-on with Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network. M-Net is owned by Compagnie Financier Richemont, the corporate vehicle of the Rupert family, which also owns Filmnet the European pay television service. It will make available the satellite transponder that will carry the BBC programmes and be responsible for marketing the service.</p>

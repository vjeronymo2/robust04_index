			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Chile's ex-chief of secret police on trial THE already fragile relations between Chile's civilian and military leaders were shaken yesterday by the start of the country's first human rights trial since the return of democracy in 1990. Retired Gen Manuel Contreras, secret police chief during the bloodiest years of Gen Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship, has been charged with the murder of Mr Orlando Letelier, a friend and foreign minister to the late Socialist President Salvador Allende. Mr Letelier and his American secretary, Mrs Ronnie Moffit, were blown up by a car bomb in Washington in 1976. The prosecution of Mr Contreras is seen by human rights groups as a symbolic trial of those who masterminded the worst crimes of the dictatorship. More than 2,300 people were executed for political reasons, died under torture or 'disappeared' during Gen Pinochet's 16-year rule. Mr Letelier's remains were brought back to Chile last week and received a state funeral, with President Patricio Aylwin and his entire cabinet in attendance. Mr Letelier's son Pablo, a Socialist deputy in Congress, said he hoped the Supreme Court would have the courage to administer justice. Gen Pinochet's army is now being besieged on several fronts. It is trying to block other investigations into past human rights abuses. Its intelligence services have also been accused of tapping politicians' telephones. The army has responded by detaining the army officer who leaked information on its clandestine spying activities and prosecuting journalists for sedition. The military have refused to give evidence before a congressional committee investigating the spying charges. These scandals are testing the limits of Chile's new democracy. The army believes civilian leaders are breaking the tacit rules under which Gen Pinochet agreed to relinquish power in the negotiated political transition. Gen Pinochet warned recently that his army was a 'sleeping lion' which could be aroused from its slumber if provoked too far.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: TRAINER'S AIDES' HEARING POSTPONED  </P> <P> An arraignment hearing for the bookkeeper accused of embezzling more than $1  million from thoroughbred horse trainer Charlie Whittingham has been postponed  until Oct. 4. The hearing had been scheduled for Wednesday in Los Angeles  Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Sally Stubblefield, 54, is facing one charge of grand theft and nine charges of  forgery in what has been described by police as a five-year scheme that  allegedly included payroll checks written to Whittingham employees who did not  exist.  </P> <P> Stubblefield, who worked for Whittingham for eight years until irregularities  were discovered earlier this year, appeared in court Wednesday. Bail, set at  $350,000, was described as exorbitant by Stubblefield's attorney, Bruce South,  who said that his client, now a resident of Texas, would enter a plea of not  guilty.  </P> <P> "The bail is excessively high," South said. "The district attorney is still  trying to piece together a case, and this is too much money to ask of a woman  who has no job and no income."  </P> <P> In another case involving a bookkeeper for the Whittingham stable, Janice Karen  Walters, 32, faces three counts of grand theft for allegedly embezzling  $31,000. Walters was released Wednesday on her own recognizance, and her  arraignment also was set for Oct. 4.  </P> <P> Richard Craigo, Whittingham's attorney, said that the shortages have been  resolved, and Walters still works for the trainer. The district attorney's  spokeswoman said there is no evidence of conspiracy between Walters and  Stubblefield. Walters allegedly wrote checks that resulted in her being paid  bonuses that she hadn't earned.  </P> <P> Whittingham has sued Bank of America, which handled his payroll accounts, and  Craigo said discussions are continuing regarding the bank's liability.

The Agrotechnipark's immediate participants are the local  Stir, Pravda, Progress agrofirms, dairy, canning and alcohol  factories, a sewing factory and the Brody forestry. The ATP's  headquarters on the territory of a missile base, which was  dismantled in 1993, is owned by Konza.    On 25 March, 1994, President Leonid Kravchuk issued an  instruction involving "a technical-economic experiment" in  Brody, which served as a legal foundation for setting up the ATP.    The ATP project, which extends to the year 2032, encompasses  a series of economic subprojects, [word indistinct]:     -  A serving station for maintenance, repair and upgrading of  agricultural equipment and machinery. The project involves  Germany's Hagema, which will supply and service equipment and  machinery against credits it has been granted. Hagema will be  entitled to the ATP-Brody's stocks when the latter is converted  into a joint-stock society;    -  The Brody canning factory's  reconstruction (the project is estimated at $8  million);    -  Optimized forestry in zones of intensive  agriculture;    -  Upgrading of the Brody sewing factory (recently,  imported equipment worth about $600,000 has been mounted at the  factory, which has business ties with firms in Germany and  Finland);    -  Application of food irradiation technologies  ($2,631,000).     In June the ATP-Brody expects to receive technical aid from  the US Public Association of agrobusinesses. Similar aid is due  to come from Canada's Association of agrobusinesses in the fall.    According to Yevgeni Pushchik, the Brody district  presidential emissary, the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development is contemplating to invest about $50 million in the  ATP-Brody project in 1995.    In the meantime, the Joint-Stock Society for the  Agrotechnipark-Brody project is reported to have been  established in Philadelphia, Pa. with a view of searching for  partners and setting up the ATP- Brody's affiliates.    Such affiliates are envisaged for setting up in Germany,  Hungary, Russia, China, Slovakia, and Czechia. In particular,  Czechia's FDH and Slovakia's Milispol, whose representatives  attended the presentation ceremony, are reported to have  intimated their willingness to be involved in the ATP-Brody  project.    A governmental decree is expected to be shortly issued,  which  will specify the ATP-Brody project's implementation terms and  mechanisms to make the territorial innovative center functioning.</p>

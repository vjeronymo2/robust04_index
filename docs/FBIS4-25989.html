			<p>BFN     [Text] Changchun, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's  Jilin Province, one of the country's major grain producers, has  scored great achievements in the development of export-oriented  agricultural production.    Making full use of local natural and land resources, the  province has stepped up the construction of processing  enterprises for farm products, especially value-added products.    Last year its total export of agricultural products and by-  products was 880 million U.S. dollars-worth, over 50 percent of  the total export volume of the province.    Foreign funds have been used in this endeavor.    Nearly 100 foreign-funded agricultural firms were founded in  1993, with a total contracted investment of 42 million U.S.  dollars. The actual use of foreign funds by the province was 390  million U.S. dollars last year.    Jilin is well known for its ginseng and wild vegetables on  the world market. The provincial government has issued  preferential policies to support the production and processing  of some key products such as ginseng and mushrooms and flowers.    The province exports chicken meat to Japan, the Republic of  Korea and other countries.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> BROTHER MICHAEL'S MISSION TO CARRY ON  </P> <P> Officers of Brother Michael's Christian Mission announced Tuesday that they  will continue to feed the poor, carrying on the work of Michael Dwaileebe, the  self-styled missionary who died last week at age 80.  </P> <P> For 30 years, Dwaileebe spent six days a week gathering and distributing food  for the needy. Most recently he was doling out beans, rice and eggs to about  150 people every morning at South Coast Christian Church in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Since his death of a heart attack, volunteers have carried on a scaled-down  version of his "one-man show," accepting donations and serving about 50 people  a day, said Bob Ewing, church pastor.  </P> <P> "We hope by Thanksgiving to have it back near where we were before," he said.  </P> <P> Dwaileebe, a "born-again" Christian who called himself Brother Michael,  solicited a special holiday food collection every year, Ewing said.  </P> <P> The church will serve a Thanksgiving dinner for the needy from noon to 3 p.m.  on Nov. 23, he said.

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Firmer dollar helps bourses to rebound A FIRMER dollar lifted most bourses yesterday but dealers cautioned that the rise was mostly technical, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's biggest one day rise for over a year was mainly driven by a rally in futures and short-covering as another batch of good corporate results prompted fund managers to return to the equity market. The DAX index gained 40.14 to 1,513.42 after the FAZ index had seen a rise of 13.88 to 596.22 at midsession. Turnover rose to DM5.7bn from DM5.1bn. Strong interim results from Daimler and Volkswagen set the mood for the day with the former advancing DM20 or 3.4 per cent to DM610.80 and the latter DM10.50 to DM324.50. The Daimler figures were particularly encouraging and above most analysts expectations. BASF was the last of the major chemical groups to report its half-year figures this week and came in at the lower end of expectations. While its shares gained DM4.30 to DM211.40, in line with the market, most analysts recommended a switch out of the stock into either Bayer, up DM7.30 to DM264.80 or Hoechst, DM9.90 firmer at DM237.90. Retailer Kaufhof, which reported a 13 per cent increase in first half sales, advanced DM20 to DM436.50. PARIS rose 1.2 per cent on arbitrage-related buying but turnover was thin at FFr1.52bn. The CAC-40 index closed 19.76 higher at 1,687.56. Elf was one of the day's more prominent gainers, adding FFr8.50 to FFr315.80 as several brokers issued buy notes following its better-than-expected interim results. Eurotunnel, up FFr1.45 to FFr36.05, was also in demand on hopes that the company was close to an agreement with TML. Paribas fell FFr6 to FFr284 on rumours that it was going to bid for the building group Fougerolle and its unit SAE. Trading in the latter two stocks had been suspended earlier in the day. After the close, Fougerolle said it was offering one of its own shares for one SAE share to buy out the remainder of SAE. MILAN finished above the day's low as late buying lifted prices towards the close. But dealers said the market remained vulnerable and trading was thin. The Comit index fell 0.81 to 393.29, a new low for the year, in turnover estimated at L50bn after Wednesday's L53.6bn. Fiat closed at L4,028, down L12, but than recovered to L4,070 after hours. Pirelli continued to firm, as the stock rose L22 or 1.9 per cent to L1,207. OSLO soared 9.4 per cent for its biggest one day rise since 1987. The all-share index rallied 28.67 to 335.44 in turnover of NKr348m. Among active issues, Norsk Hydro gained NKr14.50 to NKr139 while Kvaerner free shares gained NKr12 to NKr141 and Hafslund free shares rose NKr15.50 to NKr156. ZURICH enjoyed a positive day helped by rises in chemical stocks and demand for BBC Asea Brown Boveri. The SMI index 35.6 or 2 per cent to 1,740.6. BBC Brown Boveri bearers advanced SFr190 to SFr3,560 while its certificates improved SFr42 to SFr707. Among chemicals Roche certificates added SFr50 to SFr3,310. AMSTERDAM advanced strongly with DAF putting in one of the best performances of the day. The CBS Tendency Index closed 2 higher at 110.1. The truck group saw its shares leap Fl 2.30 or nearly 14 per cent to Fl 18.80 after reporting strong first half figures and announcing that it was in talks with an unnamed group over forming a strategic alliance. BRUSSELS was less impressive than neighbouring markets as the Bel-20 index put on 2.97 to 1,059.04. Petrofina went against the trend, down BFr190 or 2.1 per cent at BFr8,760 but off an intraday low of BFr8,560. It shares have been losing ground after the group announced a 55 per cent drop in first half earnings earlier this month. Banks were generally firmer with BBL advancing BFr105 to BFr3,155 while Tractebel climbed BFr150 to BFr7,340. STOCKHOLM recouped a further 4.7 per cent on the back of declining domestic interest rates and positive impulses from abroad. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 35.6 to 786.9 in heavy turnover of SKr815m. Astra gained further after its pleasing interims, with the A share adding SKr26 to SKr538 and the B share adding SKr26 to SKr523. COPENHAGEN closed higher in active trading, but East Asiatic Company (EAC) posted a substantial decline after reporting a six-month loss. The KFX top-20 index closed 1.89 higher at 77.66 but EAC fell DKr12 to DKr77. HELSINKI heard that the government proposed lifting foreign ownership restrictions on shares from January. The HEX index rose 1.5 per cent to 567.7. MADRID's general index gained 1.7 to 205.46 in turnover of Pta4.7bn.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 27                          Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open    10.30am   11 am     12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1011.26  1014.58  1015.68  1016.08  1016.97  1017.94  1018.13  1017.14                Day's High  1018.43    Day's Low  1011.26           Aug 26     Aug 25     Aug 24      Aug 21     Aug 20           997.98     993.01     1010.52     1039.54   1030.83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

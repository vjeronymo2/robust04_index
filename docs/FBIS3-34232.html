			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F> Palestinian delegation, in Cairo, by Smadar Peri on 3 February]    [Text] [Sha'th] I do not understand Rabin. We could have  signed the agreement in Davos last week. Rabin, however,  refused. I am telling you this in no uncertain terms -- Rabin  deliberately delayed the signing.    [Peri] Dr. Sha'th, Peres and 'Arafat will meet in Cairo in  three days. Is there any chance they will sign the agreement  this time?    [Sha'th] I have no expectations and I also do not know what  to think. I wish I could put my finger on the real reason that  Rabin is delaying the signing.    [Peri] Is Rabin delaying? 'Arafat was the one who agreed  and then backtracked.    [Sha'th] I want to tell you unequivocally that in Davos last  week we could have signed, but Rabin spoiled it. I do not  understand why he did this. Perhaps it is because the agreement  with Syria is more important for him; because of the  over-sensitivity of your senior defense establishment, or  because of the tension between your number one and number two  men.    I have witnessed this tension between the number one and  number two men on our side as well. I recognize the symptoms.    [Peri] Tell us your version of what exactly happened at  Davos.    [Sha'th] I think that Rabin is now trying to play the game  he believes we played in Cairo when Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas]  and Peres reached an agreement and 'Arafat canceled it at the  last minute.    Let me tell you what happened at Davos. We sat in one room  with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and everything was  almost wrapped up. Peres said: I have to make a final phone  call to Rabin. He was radiant. Then he went to make his phone  call and returned completely downcast. We immediately  understood things did not go well. Peres returned to the table  and said: I am sorry, I do not have time, I have to fly to  Washington. He offered no explanations, but we gathered that  Jerusalem decided to hold back.    [Peri] What happened after Peres left?    [Sha'th] We agreed to continue the talks in Cairo on Tuesday  [1 February]. The Israelis, however, failed to appear. I  phoned Amnon Shahaq, the head of the Israeli delegation, and  asked him why he did not show up. Shahaq said: I did not  receive any instructions. Later I called again, but Shahaq  repeated the same words without offering any explanations. I  asked him: When will you come? Why don't you send Yo'el Singer  meanwhile? Shahaq answered: I do not know.    [Peri] Do you think Rabin does not want to reach an  agreement?    [Sha'th] He is behaving strangely, with a mixture of  positive and negative elements. I think he is acting out of  anger. Since Rabin assumed power he has been changing his  priorities every month. Once it was al-Asad, and then it was  'Arafat. One month he is talking about 'Syria First,' the next  month he opts for the 'PLO First.' Now 'Arafat is the good guy  and al-Asad the villain; next month it will be exactly the  opposite, with Rabin giving al-Asad and 'Arafat opposite roles.    [Peri] You claim that Rabin is conducting his policy out of  anger. My colleague Sever Plotzker wrote that 'Arafat is  conducting a policy of "coitus interruptus."    [Sha'th, laughing] This term is inappropriate. Can anybody  suspect 'Arafat of not being interested in an agreement and a  withdrawal? If you want to speak about "coitus interruptus,"  then look at Rabin-Peres. It is there you will find a coitus  interruptus, not among us.    'Arafat was never as positive, flexible, realistic, warm,  and  humane as he was in Davos. You should have followed the deluge  of telephone calls from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem to the Israeli  delegation. Every five minutes there was a phone call from  Rabin or Baraq. You would think that your entire army and  defense establishment took on your diplomatic echelon at Davos.    [Peri] People in Israel believe 'Arafat wants to delay the  signing of the agreement in order to squeeze more concessions  out of Israel.    [Sha'th] Let me tell you in no uncertain terms: Your boss  does not want the agreement to be signed now. He also does not  want anybody else to do the job for him. At the same time I am  not saying Rabin has backtracked. He is interested in the  agreement, but he is in no hurry to adhere to the timetable,  even if everything has been prepared.    [Peri] How long will it take to finalize the agreement?    [Sha'th] It is possible to finalize it next week. Although  some issues still need to be settled, such as the border  crossings and the security of the Gaza Strip and Jericho area  settlements, altogether we reached reasonable standards in Davos.    If there is a will to sign, it will be possible to wrap  things up. You will not believe how diligent and productive  Singer and I can be. In Davos we worked around the clock. I  did not even see the door of my hotel room. I reached Davos by  helicopter and was driven to the (Zehof) hotel, where we worked  until 0600. Everything went fine. I thought to myself that  this time we are going to finish things up. Peres was very  cooperative and happy -- until Rabin's phone call.    [Peri] What did you think when Peres reentered the room with  such a dejected look?    [Sha'th] It reminded me of my university days. We had a  lecturer who was always late or absent. I decided to punish him  by not coming to some of the lectures, but in the end I lost  credit for that course.    [Peri] If you decide to punish Rabin you could lose the  chance for an Israeli withdrawal.    [Sha'th] Rabin cannot afford to let this go. He stands to  lose too much.    [Peri] What do you think about the criticism leveled at  Peres after everybody saw him holding hands with 'Arafat?    [Sha'th, laughing] I read in the newspapers that Rabin was  angry. Could it be that he was jealous? I do not want to  intervene in this unique relationship between your number one  and number two men. However, I really do not understand why  Peres has to apologize for "holding hands" with 'Arafat, and why  Rabin had to immediately flex his muscles.    'Arafat did not want to get Peres in trouble when he took  his  hand. On the contrary, our number one man tried to evince  warmth, to be communicative and positive with the man you sent  to conduct the negotiations. It was a demonstration of the  desire for peace. Instead of a positive reaction, however, there  was an uproar in Israel. A simple humane gesture was blown all  out of proportion.    [Peri] Now, in this interview from your Cairo home, you seem  to be upset and bitter.    [Sha'th] I have good reason to be frustrated at a personal  level. I was invited, along with Shim'on Peres, by U.S. Vice  President Al Gore, to receive a prize from the "Buds of Peace"  organization. I had to apologize to the organizers and tell  them I was waiting in Cairo for Shahaq and Singer to finalize  the draft agreement. However, they did not come because, as  they put it, "they did not receive any instructions." I know  very well who was it who did not give them those instructions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Xi Yang's Relatives Have Received </F> Notice of the Conclusion of His Trial"]    [Text] MING PAO officers have indicated that the relatives  of MING PAO reporter Xi Yang have already been notified by an  official from the Beijing Municipal People's Court that the  first hearing of Xi Yang's case concluded on 28 March and he has  been sentenced.    Because the notice was made verbally and the official did  not  present any written statement or docket, the two MING PAO  officers remained in Beijing and made great efforts to get in  touch with the relvant authorities to verify the information.    Xi Yang's relatives received a telephone call from a court  official early in the morning of 1 April, and they were informed  that the first hearing of Xi Yang's case of stealing and  gathering state secrets had concluded and he had been sentenced.  This paper immediately sent men to Beijing to learn more about  the situation. Because it was the weekend, the relevant court  officials were not in their offices. That being the case, the  verbal notice still has not been verified by the authorities.    Chang Chien-po, MING PAO executive chief editor, and Chang  Hsi-hong, senior editor of the China page, contacted lawyers in  the hinterland yesterday to learn more about the possibility of  filing an appeal for Xi Yang's case. Chang Chien-po said:  "When I met with Xi Yang's relatives the day before yesterday,  they indicated that they were also thinking of consulting a  lawyer. We will do our best to find a lawyer for Xi Yang's  relatives. To our knowledge, under current Chinese law, Xi  Yang's relatives may consult a lawyer, but we can only offer  assistance from behind the scenes."</p>

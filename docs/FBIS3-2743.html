Xu, 74, a researcher at the Academy of Sciences, said by  telephone that he and the other six mailed their appeal to the  two leaders Thursday.    Their petition was accompanied by a letter telling them to  "pay serious attention to this question, which involves the  future of the state." "Only respect for human rights and the  guarantee of legal rights for all citizens can maintain social  stability," the letter said. "If not," it added,  "contradictions in the heart of society will become so severe as  to risk leading to chaos, or even to an uncontrollable  situation." The senders included a writer, a poet and five  professors.    "Recently, several interrogations and arrests have occurred  in Beijing and Shanghai for ideological or speech reasons...and  international opinion was shocked," they wrote. "China, as a  permanent Security Council member and founding member of the  United Nations, must set an example and respect human rights  principles."    "Therefore, we call for the authorities to courageously put  an end to the custom, several thousand years old, of condemning  someone for his ideas, his speech or his writing, and to free  all citizens imprisoned for this purpose."    The signatories included Xu's wife, Wang Laili, a history  professor at the Academy of Social Sciences and Ding Zilin and  his wife, Jiang Peikun -- both philosophy professors at the  People's University of Beijing. Liu Liao, a professor of the  capital's Normal School, also signed, as did poet Shao Yanxiang  and writer Zhang Kangkang.    Xu, who knows Jiang Zemin and Qiao Shi personally, declared  that he did "not expect to have problems with the police because  of this letter, which is aimed at reducing tensions within  society." He added, however, that the telephone of Ding Zilin  and his wife was cut off Thursday and that their home had been  "surrounded by lots of people."</p>

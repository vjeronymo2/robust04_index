			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: International Rescue launched to prove Clarke Foods' Lyons Maid is FAB HENRY D Clarke, Jr, took one look at the British ice cream market and made an urgent call to International Rescue. Whether he had to pull strings to get Brains and Virgil, he would not say, but the sound and light extravaganza produced for retailers yesterday was nothing short of spectacular. For Mr Clarke, the American chairman and 'Big Daddy' of Clarke Foods, which became Britain's second biggest ice cream manufacturer when it bought Lyons Maid in January, is determined to spare no expense in promoting his assault on the UK ice cream market, including drafting in the Thunderbirds. In a homey and comforting voice, more akin to bedtime story-telling than advertising hype, Mr Clarke told a packed West End theatre about his family's obsession. And one by one, his sons appeared on stage to confirm that ice cream was what kept the Clarke family together. The speeches, interspersed with bright lights and rousing music, had one purpose: to relaunch Lyons Maid and introduce the Clarke brand of super premium ice cream. 'We have got Lyons Maid, the great sleeping giant of the UK ice cream industry and we are going to shake it awake,' declared Henry D. The Clarke credentials for promotion are legendary in the ice cream industry. Mr Clarke was the Brains behind the runaway success of the Klondike bar in the US - America's best-selling novelty ice cream. Clarke Foods has returned to a version of Henry D's first love in the Clarke Bar. But now, says Mr Clarke, he has the chance to do what he never could to Klondike' improve the quality. Quality was the main message in yesterday's production. Clarke has relaunched Lyons Maid with the promise that fruit flavours and sauces would be made with the real thing. A Pounds 3.5m advertising campaign to promote the improved Lyons Maid is waiting to swamp Britain from June, while the Clarke brand will get Pounds 1m in exposure. Packaging of the old familiar favourites, such as the Zoom rocket bar and fruit Mivvi, has even been given a space age look to attract today's Star Wars generation. The Clarke brand will go heavy on nostalgia, perhaps most importantly for Mr Clarke whose photograph at the age of seven appears on the tubs. He claims he was setting off to get a Klondike bar. All this razzamatazz might seem more appropriate to an US election campaign than the relaunch of Lyons Maid and introduction of a new product. But it cannot be denied that there was something almost patriotic in the way Mr Clarke swore his allegiance to the product. The only thing missing was the flag.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] There were no problems this morning for the 64th  Ariane rocket, which has just launched the three satellites it  was carrying, two of them British military experimental  satellites. (Dominique Andre), you were at the launch [from  Kourou space center in French Guiana] and you are now at  Arianespace headquarters in Evry [south of Paris]    [Andre] Yes, and Ariane is back in action again at last. The  European rocket completely succeeded in its 64th mission this  morning by putting into orbit the Intelsat telecommunications  satellite, as well as two small satellites for the British  Ministry of Defense.    This flight has put the smile back on the faces of the  Ariane  engineers. This success is the first of the year, after the  failure in January and the false start at the beginning of June,  but now they are going to have to move quickly, or rather well  and quickly, to quote the head of Arianespace, in order to stick  to the new program--in other words, eight more launches this  year. The Ariane team based in Kourou is going to be beefed up  with technicians and engineers. The next launch is due to take  place on 8 July, in three weeks' time.

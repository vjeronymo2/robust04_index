			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PROBLEMS BEGIN EARLY FOR LIKELY DROPOUTS  </P> <P> Although each case is different, educational experts say many junior high  school dropouts have experienced emotional or academic problems long before  they reach the point of giving up.  </P> <P> "Mentally, a lot of them have dropped out as far back as third or fourth  grade," said Jewell Henderson, a Los Angeles Unified School District adviser.  "Teachers are even beginning to identify children in kindergarten who could be  potential dropouts."  </P> <P> Gary Lenkeit, director of the Institute for Motivational Development's Los  Angeles office, said many parents who bring their underachieving children in  for counseling report that there have been problems for at least two to five  years. "The parents think the problems will disappear if they wait it out," he  said. "But usually they just get worse over time."  </P> <P> What can parents do to help their children? Educators and counselors offer the  following advice:  </P> <P> * Communicate with teachers. A child who regularly doesn't want to go to school  may be experiencing problems that could be easily corrected if educators were  informed.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it can be as simple as changing a child's seat, or finding out that  another child is being mean on the playground," Henderson said. "Parents need  to find out why a child doesn't want to go."  </P> <P> * Seek out educational resources where needed. Experts say a young child who is  falling behind scholastically often develops self-esteem problems, which in  turn can lead to further academic difficulties. Parents can request tutors or  resource specialists in the public schools to assist their children to catch  up. School psychologists can provide free counseling when needed.  </P> <P> * Ask children about any difficulties they may be having. Statistics show that  most junior high school dropouts experience problems early in seventh grade, a  time when they are faced with a new level of responsibility.  </P> <P> "They're starting puberty, there are a lot of social issues coming up for them,  and on top of that they also have to learn how to handle their time better with  changing classes and more teachers," Lenkeit said. "Some of them need help with  that."  </P> <P> * Get involved. "Schools can offer a lot of resources, but they can't take the  place of parents," said Charles Esplain, director of counseling and guidance  services for the Los Angeles district. "If parents don't take the time to find  out what's going on with their child, that sends a powerful message. If they  want their child to care about school, they have to care too."

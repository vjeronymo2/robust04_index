			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkey is ready to use its influence over NATO, the  European Union and the UN to support the territorial integrity  of Ukraine and the presence of Crimea within Ukraine. This was  disclosed to the press by the leader of the Crimean Tartar  Mejlis Mustafa Jamilev who met Turkish President Suleyman  Demirel in Kiev on Monday.    According to Jamilev, Ukraine has made much greater  concessions to Crimean separatists than it should have. He was  satisfied with the fact that now Kiev holds a tougher,  principled approach to Crimea. The head of the Mejlis called  Crimea an illegal republic of colonists.    He said that the future course of development in Crimea  depends on how much Russia and other neighbors are going to  respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Jamilev said  there are signs today that Russia will continue interfering in  the situation.    In his opinion, the pressure of the world community could  have a certain effect keeping Russia from actions that  destabilize the situation in the Crimea.    Jamilev said the Turkish president promised to finance the  construction of about 1000 apartments for Crimean Tatars.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Huang Jian (1806 0256): "The Actual Conditions, </F> Problems, and Measures for Foreign-funded Enterprises in China"]    [Text] An important measure taken by China in its reform  and opening to the world was to introduce foreign funds and  technology into the country and run foreign-funded enterprises.  This measure has achieved great success but, in reality, a lot  of problems also exist. Since it is a long-term policy, it is  necessary to study the actual conditions, problems, and measures  for foreign-funded enterprises in the country.  <H5>  I. The Basic Conditions in Foreign-funded Enterprises </H5>   According to State Administration for Industry and Commerce  statistics, by the end of 1992 there were 84,371 foreign-funded  enterprises throughout the nation, accounting for 3 percent of  all industrial and commercial corporate enterprises. Of these,  34,288 are already in production and operation, accounting for  40.6 percent of the registered foreign-funded enterprises. Of  the registered foreign-funded enterprises, 55,826 are Chinese  and foreign joint ventures, accounting for 66.2 percent of the  total, while 14,180 are Chinese-foreign cooperative enterprises,  accounting for 16.8 percent of the total, and 14,365 are  exclusively foreign-owned enterprises, accounting for 17 percent  of the total. The aggregate investment in foreign-funded  enterprises throughout the nation amounted to $178.46 billion,  with a registered capital of $116 billion and a foreign capital  contribution of $68.66 billion. Of the 10.461 million  employees, 293,000 are personnel working on behalf of the  foreign party.    Trades in which foreign-funded enterprises have become  involved cover almost every aspect of the national economy, with  industry being the major one. Real estate and public utilities  also take up a fairly big proportion. Besides, foreign-funded  enterprises also take up a certain proportion in commerce and  catering. In terms of primary, secondary, and tertiary  industries, the proportions of enterprises are 2.6, 83.2, and  14.2 percent respectively; the proportions of employees are 1.3,  90.4, and 8.3 percent respectively; the proportions of aggregate  investment are 1.5, 67, and 31.5 percent respectively; and the  proportions of registered capital are 1.8, 70.6, and 27.6  percent respectively.    Foreign enterprises throughout the nation are developing  unevenly and they are concentrated in the open, coastal areas in  southeastern China. Along the southeastern coast, they are  concentrated in four provinces and one city, namely, Guangdong  Province, Jiangsu Province, Fujian Province, Shanghai  Municipality, and Shandong Province. Of these, Guangdong has  achieved the most remarkable results in exploiting foreign  funds. In terms of the number of foreign-funded enterprises,  foreign invested funds, registered capital, and foreign capital  contribution, they account for 31.2, 37, 37.2, and 43.2 percent  respectively of the nation's total.    As for the countries and regions from whence the foreign  funds come, for the time being, the overwhelming majority of the  foreign funds come from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao. According  to statistics, 68,887 enterprises are from Hong, Taiwan and  Macao, their aggregate investment stands at $144.2 billion,  their registered capital $93.23 billion, and their capital  contribution $55.76 billion, each accounting for over 80 percent  of the total foreign capital. Besides, the number of  enterprises from the United States, Japan, and Singapore and  their aggregate investment account for around 12 percent of the  total, while enterprises from six countries, namely, the UK,  France, Germany, Canada, Italy, and Australia add up to no more  than 2.4 percent of the total.  <H5>  II. The Main Problems in the Development of Foreign-Funded </H5> Enterprises    1. The relationship between the development of  foreign-funded enterprises and that of state-owned enterprises    The development of foreign funded enterprises plays an  active, as well as a negative, role in promoting the development  of state-owned enterprises. Given that state-owned enterprises  lack vitality, the preferential policies adopted by the state  toward foreign-funded enterprises has put state-owned  enterprises in a very unfavorable position in the intensely  competitive market. In terms of taxation, foreign-funded  enterprises enjoy income tax exemption for the first three years  and a reduction in tax for the next two. In some areas, the  duration of tax exemption and reduction is even longer and the  actual taxation even lower. In 1992, the average tax handed  over by foreign-funded enterprises which had gone into  production or operations was only 68,000 yuan. However, the  income tax rate of state-owned enterprises has just been reduced  from 55 percent to 33 percent this year. Their actual taxation  is still much more than foreign-funded enterprises. In terms of  enterprise autonomy, foreign-funded enterprises enjoy various  decisionmaking powers on manpower, finances, materials,  production, supply, and sales. They feel comfortable as fish in  water in the market. However, the management autonomy for  state-owned enterprises is not fully granted and, consequently,  they often bungle their opportunities. In terms of retirement  and insurance for workers and staff members, the burden om  foreign-funded enterprises is light as they chiefly employ young  people while state-owned enterprises not only have to be  responsible for the insurance of their employees but also their  retirement pay. In terms of import and export rights,  foreign-funded enterprises at large enjoy the right to declare  to customs or the import and export rights and they are not  restricted by the import and export permit system. They also  retain all the foreign exchange and use it without restriction,  whereas most of the state-owned enterprises do not have  corresponding rights. They needs permits for the import and  export of goods. Moreover, they have to hire foreign trade  agents.    They keep a small proportion of the foreign  exchange earnings but cannot use it directly and freely. The  crucial point of restructuring our economy lies in enlivening  state-owned enterprises. The basis and the main force for  socialist modernization lies in state-owned enterprises. Whe,  competing with foreign-funded enterprises which have absolute  advantages, state-owned enterprises will lose repeatedly, the  profit-making ones becoming loss-making ones and the loss-making  ones being driven into bankruptcy because of their imperfect  mechanism, the unequal policies, and their lack of sufficient  strength for technical innovation and management improvement.  This has deviated from the starting point of utilizing foreign  funds, delayed the course of enterprise reform, and impaired the  healthy development of the whole national economy. How to  combine the development of foreign-funded enterprises with the  invigoration of the state-owned enterprises so that we can  attract foreign funds, while protecting and promoting the  rejuvenation of state-owned enterprises, is a problem of first  importance which deserves our study.    2. The investment orientation of foreign funds    The principal demerits of foreign funds in terms of  investment orientation are: Items of general industrial  processing are many while items of agriculture, energy,  communications, and raw materials which the national economy  needs urgently are few; primary processing and labor-intensive  industries are many in number while high-tech and  technology-intensive ones are few; projects of small and medium  enterprises are many while big ones are few. Of the total  investment, agriculture accounts for only 1.54 percent, energy  and raw materials 0.1 percent, and communications and transport,  as well as post and telecommunications, 1.8 percent. From the  foreign businessman's viewpoint, factors affecting their  investment orientation finclude the fact that those small  processing projects need small investment but bring quick  results, yield good profits, involve little risk, and are good  for giving full play to the superiority of manpower. On our  part, the main factors that affect the investment orientation  are that some localities attach importance to quantity rather  than quality. They evaluate their achievements by counting how  many foreign-funded enterprises have been set up without  sufficient knowledge of the investment orientation, technical  level, market orientation, and scale of foreign investment, as  well as the technique and credit worthiness of the foreign  businessmen. The irrational orientation of foreign investment  brings hidden troubles. It is disadvantageous to restructuring  our industry and upgrading technology. In the long run, it will  do harm to the even and healthy development of the national  economy.    3. The management of foreign-funded enterprises    A. Foreign capital fails to show up. According to an  analysis by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce,  5,000 of the 25,000 foreign-funded enterprises across the  country have not invested any money. Some foreign businessmen  withdrew their funds by installments soon after making  investments but continued to enjoy preferential treatment for  foreign-funded enterprise.    B. The deficit rate of enterprises exceeds 40 percent. Some  enterprises lose money because of failure to select the right  project. Some fail in business because the foreign businesses  play an underhand game in import and export. A considerable  number of enterprises actually make profits though they claim  losses.    C. Goods produced by foreign-funded enterprises are not  exported abroad according to the proportion set in contracts.  Instead, they squeeze into and occupy the domestic market,  affecting the state's foreign exchange revenue. From 1991 to  1992, the imports by foreign-funded enterprises stood at $43.3  billion while their exports totaled $29.4 billion. After  deducting $12.7 billion for investment in equipment and other  articles, the international trade deficit was $1.2 billion.    D. Serious tax evasion. In 1991, the average unified  industrial and commercial tax handed over by foreign-funded  enterprises which were in operation, was 242,000 yuan and the  income tax was 76,000 yuan. In 1992, the average unified  industrial and commercial tax handed over by them was 243,000  yuan and the income tax was only 68,000 yuan. Foreign-funded  enterprises pay the salary of employees under the name of  subsidies so that they can evade personal income tax and  individual income regulatory tax. The lack of perfect laws and  regulations contributes to the difficulties in administering  foreign-funded enterprises. What is more serious is that the  Chinese party to the joint venture, proceeding from their local  interests, share the preferential policy with foreign  businessmen at the cost of national interests and the interests  of the whole.    4. The investment environment of using foreign funds    From the angle of the international environment,  international opinion generally holds that China's economic  growth and market have great potential. The number of foreign  businessmen who intend to invest in China keeps increasing. On  the other hand, the economies of some Eastern European countries  are gradually recovering and the momentum of economic growth in  our neighboring countries is not decreasing. So, the  competition to introducing international capital tends to become  fiercer. In addition, some Western countries are wary of us  politically so that, to a considerable extent, transnational  corporations and big financial groups are hesitant and take a  wait-and-see attitude toward investment in China. From the  angle of the domestic environment, some areas are backward in  conditions such as transportation, energy resources, and  communications. The relevant laws and regulations on using  foreign funds are imperfect. The operation mechanism of the  market economy has not been finally established. All this has  brought certain difficulties to the normal operations of  foreign-funded enterprises and, therefore, has affected the  introduction of international capital and the healthy  development of foreign-funded enterprises.    III. Development Tendencies and Some Suggestions    1. The foreign-funded enterprises will indicate the  following characteristics for some time to come:    A. The number of foreign-funded enterprises and aggregate  investment will increase steadily. Sino-foreign joint ventures  will still be the main form of enterprises and the actual  investment funds will exceed the foreign loans of our country.    B. Foreign-funded enterprises will mainly be industrial ones  and will gradually develop towards infrastructure and basic  industries. There will be considerably big development and  breakthroughs in the tertiary industry. However, the  development of new and high-tech projects and capital-intensive  ones will still be restricted in certain extent.    C. The export and import scale of foreign-funded enterprises  will increase fairly quickly. Because quite a number of  foreign-funded enterprises are grafted from town and township  enterprises as well as small and medium state-owned enterprises,  they are small in scale and exports. The contradiction of  imbalanced foreign exchange will exist for a long time and  sometimes will become very conspicuous.    D. Foreign-funded enterprises will still mainly be located  in the economically developed coastal areas, along rivers, and  in the border areas and they will develop in quite a big way.    E. Taiwan and Hong Kong will remain the chief sources of  foreign funds and the investment from the United States, Japan,  the ROK, and Southeast Asian countries will increase steadily.    2. Some suggestions:    A. Emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and  strengthen leadership over the use foreign funds. Three  tendencies should be overcome: First is the tendency to compete  with one another in offering foreign businessmen preferential  policies; second, is the tendency to pay attention to quantity  rather than quality in the development of foreign-funded  enterprises; and third, is the tendency to duplicate imports and  fail in absorption. Exchange of information and project  guidance should be strengthened. A good job should be done in  the introduction, digestion, and absorption of advanced foreign  technology and not just simply taking it over.    B. Continue to improve the investment environment. Further  efforts should be made to improve the hard environment such as  traffic, transportation, energy, post and telecommunications,  and communications. At the same time, the laws and regulations  concerning foreign-funded enterprises should be perfected to  protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign-funded  enterprises. The procedures and links to set up foreign-funded  enterprises should be simplified to raise work efficiency. We  should quicken the steps of the reform, establish the operation  mechanism of the market economy, and reduce the contradictions  and frictions between the current system and the operation of  foreign-funded enterprises. We should also strengthen publicity  on the use of foreign funds abroad, restore and build the  international image of China, and publicize China's economic  achievements and potential for development in a realistic way,  to raise its attractiveness to foreign funds.    C. Stress the main points in strengthening guidance to  foreign investment orientation. The focus of investment is in  projects of basic industries, infrastructure, and high  technology. With regard to projects regarding energy and  communications in particular, we should further relax our policy  and boldly attract foreign funds to serve us. To such  businesses as trading, tourism, and banking, we can liberalize  our policy a bit more so that they can develop appropriately.  As for some high-tech projects, especially products which can  replace imported ones, we should offer a bigger proportion for  internal sale to promote the enthusiasm of the foreign  businessmen for investment and further investment. Some  localities assign large areas of farmland for sale or lease at  low prices to foreign businessmen to develop real estate.  Although this practice brings some immediate interests and  temporary prosperity, its disadvantages outweigh its advantages  in the long run. The lesson to be drawn from Japan's bubble  economy in the 1980s is worth our learning. We should properly  control the excessive growth of foreign-funded real estate.    E. Raise the level of management of foreign-funded  enterprises. It is necessary to formulate laws and regulations  to bring about the timely arrival of registered capital in the  full amount, strengthen inspection and supervision, and change  the existing phenomenon whereby the Chinese party alone takes  the operating risks if the foreign capital does not come. To  strengthen tax management, the state should set the minimum  standard for the policy which offers income tax deduction and  exemption to foreign-funded enterprises and rectify the tendency  for each locality to go its own way. On the other hand, we  should screen pseudo-foreign-funded enterprises, especially  those which still enjoy preferential treatment for  foreign-funded enterprises but which actually have very little  proportion of foreign funds or from which the foreign funds have  been withdrawn. At the same time, we should strengthen  financial supervision to prevent enterprises from evading tax by  falsely claiming losses when they have actual made a profit and  the abnormal phenomenon whereby the state has little increase in  tax revenue while the number of foreign-funded enterprises keeps  increasing. We should strengthen the supervision and management  of imports and exports by foreign-funded enterprises to prevent  them from taking advantage of the preferential policy to import  equipment and raw materials which have nothing to do with  production and then selling them at high prices for profits. We  should also prevent them from selling their products to the  domestic market directly or changing the goods originally  assigned for export into goods for domestic sales without  sticking to the proportion set by contract. The number of  Chinese employees working in the joint ventures now exceeds 10  million. We should protect their legitimate rights in terms of  working conditions, medical insurance, labor insurance, and  endowment insurance and, at the same time, collect individual  income regulatory taxes according to regulations to ease the  phenomenon of inequality in social distribution.</p>

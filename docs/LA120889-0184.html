			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MCCARTNEY CHANGES TUNE ON REUNION  </P> <P> Paul McCartney is singing a slightly different tune now about a possible  Beatles reunion.  </P> <P> When McCartney suggested last month in Los Angeles that he, George Harrison and  Ringo Starr might come together for a reunion, Harrison responded that there  wouldn't be one "as long as John Lennon remains dead."  </P> <P> McCartney said Thursday he understood. But he still held out hope for a  reunion.  </P> <P> "There can't be a Beatles reunion because John died," McCartney told a news  conference before his concert at the SkyDome.  </P> <P> "And I don't think any of us would be interested in substituting someone for  John, even (his son) Julian, which has been suggested. But there is a film we  might get around to in a couple of years that we've been meaning to do, and  there might possibly be some involvement there where we play together."  </P> <P> He said the group wouldn't call it a Beatles reunion, but the media probably  would.  </P></p>

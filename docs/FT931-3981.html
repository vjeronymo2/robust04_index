			<p>930312 FT  12 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Airtours raids Owners The battle for control of Owners Abroad, Britain's second biggest holiday tour operator, grew more heated as its smaller rival Airtours, which is seeking to acquire Owners, picked up just over 4 per cent of the equity at an average of 144p a share. Dealers said that Airtours' joint broker BZW had been attempting to buy around 10 per cent of Owners shares, although a spokesman for Airtours refused to confirm this. Owners shares closed 1 1/2 better at 141p in turnover of 13m. Airtours climbed 4 to 333p. Rumours suggested further spice could be added to the takeover battle today with the announcement by one leading institution over which side it will support. Owners claimed yesterday that summer bookings were good, but Airtours hand was further strengthened when Paribas became the latest broker to support its Pounds 290m bid, joining Smith New Court, Hoare Govett and Panmure Gordon.</p>

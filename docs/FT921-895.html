			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Takeover rate at 25% since '86 A QUARTER of the 2,525 companies quoted in the UK at the start of 1986 had been taken over by the end of 1991, according to a survey of the mergers and acquisitions industry. The review's author is the LEK Partnership, a strategy consultancy group. Over the six-year period, only 41 per cent of companies receiving a hostile bid escaped. Targets of larger bids - worth more than Pounds 1bn - have a greater chance of survival at 55 per cent. The main reason for failure is price. The study also concludes that agreed bids can often be made at similar premiums to hostile bids, but have a much better chance of success. In hostile bids the initial bidder has only a 45 per cent chance of winning. During 1991 there were 70 successful bids for UK public companies, and 30 per cent of the top 1,000 UK companies were involved in bid activity, although it was a relatively quiet year. Three quarters of the bids, by value, involved UK targets. It seems that survivors of failed bids gain a share price advantage, at least in the short term. Typically a survivor's shares fall to a level of between 10 and 15 per cent above their price a month before the bid, allowing for market movements.

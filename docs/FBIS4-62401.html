			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abdullayeva, </F> Viktor Shulman]    [Text] Baku 13 May, TASS -- Vladimir Kazimirov, Russia'  plenipotentiary representatives and special envoy of the Russian  Foreign Ministry, described today's meeting in Baku attended by  Azeri President Gaydar Aliyev and leaders of the CSCE Minsk  Group as an event of great importance.    "It is not accidental that the world community and all the  people of good will interested in the cessation of the  Armenian-Azeri conflict have focused their attention on the  meeting in Baku," Kazimirov said. In the opinion of the Russian  envoy, "in any case, a prospect for the continuation of the  bloodshed should be rejected," he said.    Kazimirov welcomed the concept of beginning a peace-keeping  process from a cease-fire. "The most important thing now is to  prevent the cease-fire and cessation of military operations from  being disconnected from the next stage, in other words, to  prevent the situation from coming to a deadlock, Kazimirov said.    "We must ensure the integrity of the process of settlement,  and strictly consistent actions should be a reliable commitment,  rather than a promise, by all parties concerned," the Russian  envoy said. In his opinion, this can be achieved by means of a  tangible political agreement binding the sides to observe it and  on which the world community can rely on with certain confidence.    According to Kazimirov, the main goal of the Russian side as  a mediator is to promote reliable, rather than prompt settlement  of the conflict. The talks between the Azeri president, leaders  of the Minsk Group and the special envoy of the Russian  president were held behind closed doors and continued about four  hours.    Late on Friday [13 May], the mediatory mission is leaving  for  Yerevan.</p>

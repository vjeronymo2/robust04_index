			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (7): A good place to be - Inward investment has been impressive The 1980s was a good decade for inward investment inthe West Midlands, a region covering the shire counties of Shropshire, Staffordshire, Hereford, Worcester and Warwickshire, and the seven metropolitan areas of Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton. When the West Midlands Development Agency (WMDA) was established in 1984 it was attracting 4 per cent of total inward foreign investment to the UK (measured in terms of projects). By 1990 the West Midlands was drawing 24 per cent of the UK total - a level matched only by Wales. Nearly 900 foreign companies had invested a cumulative total of Pounds 1bn in the area. Domestic relocations and expansions are more difficult to quantify because the WMDA deals only with foreign investment. But Mr Chris Tillett, senior economist at Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Birmingham, estimates that the foreign investment would easily have been matched by domestic relocations, start-ups and expansions. Telford, a new town corporation until 1991, was at the forefront in attracting foreign companies. Using liberal government financing and aggressive marketing it attracted 120 foreign companies into the town - and 1000 relocations or start-ups. Thirty-three of these companies came from the US, including Johnson Controls and Fruit of the Loom. Twenty-four were Japanese, including NEC Technology and Makita, a power tools concern. Other parts of the West Midlands also did well. In Wolverhampton, the Connecticut-based Elm Energy and Recycling is building a Dollars 86m waste tyre to energy power station. The investments have not been confined to manufacturing. Barclays Bank set up a back office operation in Coventry employing 700 people. The TSB has established a presence in Birmingham itself - also employing about 700 people. New investment has either created or protected more than 100,000 jobs. The West Midlands is an intermediate development area, and therefore it qualifies for regional selective assistance from the UK Government and funding from some of the European Community programmes. But apart from Telford and Redditch in Hereford and Worcester there has been no extra aid in the form of generously funded specialised bodies such as the Welsh Development Agency or Locate in Scotland. The attractions have been: good central location in the middle of the UK; and the perception of a skilled labour force and the availability of modern greenfield, B1 light-industrial factories and offices. While manufacturing and new high-technology industries have gone, on the whole, to business parks, some attached to the six universities in the area (such as Warwick University outside Coventry and Aston University in Birmingham), service industries have found abundant office space in Birmingham. Plenty of space remains. The Telford Development Agency says it has 1,000 acres of industrial space outstanding. Only 60 per cent of the 150 acre Birmingham Business Park has been occupied, and other business areas are being established. Filling the space, however, looks like being a more difficult struggle than in the past. Recession has hit relocations, just as it has affected other industries. Although figures for inward foreign investment for 1992 have not been officially released, Mr Tillett estimates that the West Midlands share of the cake dropped to 13 per cent (measured by number of projects). Domestic relocations probably slumped more severely, he thinks, because fewer companies moved out of the hard pressed south-east. But even without recession the 1990s were bound to be harder because competition for investment both domestically and internationally is becoming more intense. Mr David Rogerson, chief executive of the Telford Development Agency, says: 'A lot of the big US and Japanese companies wanted to be in Europe before the single market of 1992. These large investments are not going to come along again. It is now a question of finding smaller companies from places like Taiwan.' The British government is redrawing the regional assistance map. There is a distinct possibility that Telford will lose its development status and that areas in the south-east, in Dorset, Kent and East Sussex, will receive assistance. This will probably mean more development agencies chasing mobile investment. Mr Rogerson says: 'At the moment we are competing with about 100 agencies domestically, and something like 1,000 internationally. When we launch an initiative in Japan we often find ourselves following a group of Dutch people around, who stress how well they speak English. English speaking countries are attractive to Japanese businessmen because they have a low level of competence in other European languages.' Mr Tillett agrees with Mr Rogerson. He says: 'Most of the big players such as Toyota and Nissan are in the UK. The West Midlands needs to continue as a manufacturing centre because there are not enough service jobs to go round. It is a question of 'upskilling' and attracting small high-technology companies and automotive component concerns. These will often be joint ventures.' Mr Paul Richards, chief executive of WMDA, agrees that the going is getting tougher. But he believes that the West Midlands could enjoy another good decade of inward investment - it will be different kinds of investment. He says: 'We will be looking for smaller companies which will be involved in international strategic alliances, technology transfer arrangements, joint ventures for research. and so on. I believe the diversity of the industry we have built up will help us. We never got the humdingers, like Toyota, which went to the east Midlands. But with our skills base we attracted a broad range of industries from automotive components to electronics to food processing.' Great emphasis is placed on attracting automotive components companies - partly because Toyota, near Derby, will provide a ready market for them. A favourable sign came last month when Johnson Controls announced that it is to become the first tenant on the Black Country Development Corporation's new 115-acre Automotive Component Park. The US-based company is making a Pounds 10m investment which will create 160 new jobs. The development corporation is hoping that this move is the first of many.</p>

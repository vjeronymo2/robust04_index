Our parliamentary correspondent Milan Repka  reports.    [Repka] Jiri Payne should have left for a two-day official  visit to Libya today. According to our information, he decided  not to go. Deputy Chairman Jan Kasal told Czech radio that the  Chamber's leadership did not cancel any foreign trips.    Pavel Seifer, deputy from the Liberal Social Union, said  that, in his view, this indicates the Civic Democratic Party's  [ODS] preparation to quietly dismiss Payne from the post of the  chairman of the Chamber's Foreign Committee. But ODS press  spokeswoman Jana Petrova denied this. She told Czech radio that  the ODS leadership proposed nothing of the kind to Payne.    Regarding the connection between Payne's pronouncements  during his visit to the United States and the abolition of his  trip to Libya, Petrova said that she did not know why Payne was  not going to Libya.    A meeting of the Chamber of Deputies is due to open on 15  February. It is likely that a proposal to dismiss the present  chairman of the foreign committee from his post will be  submitted there.</p>

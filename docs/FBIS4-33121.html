			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with deputies-elect Frank Vargas and Fabian </F> Alarcon by Miguel Rivadeneira; place and date not given]    [Text] Substantive reforms will soon be formally proposed  that will enable Congress to function more effectively after it  opens on 10 August 1994.    To accomplish this, once the election results have been  proclaimed the deputies-elect will have to meet informally to  outline their working plans.    The subject of perspectives for the new Congress and for the  country in general was examined by deputies-elect Frank Vargas  of the Ecuadoran Revolutionary Popular Action and Fabian Alarcon  of the Alfarist Radical Front while taking part in Radio Quito's  program "Controversy," directed by Miguel Rivadeneira. Marco  Flores of the Social Christian Party was also invited but did  not attend.    Alarcon said that the new deputies-elect "cannot make  mistakes this time and must salvage Congress' image by hard  work."    He recognized that the people are unhappy and frustrated  about political activities and legislation, and that urgent  action is needed to remedy the situation.    Vargas also recognized a certain culpability on the part of  politicians, but he said that they are not the only ones to  blame, but the problem involves everyone, and therefore there is  a responsibility to redeem Congress' work and actions for the  benefit of the people.    [Rivadeneira] Frank Vargas, is it possible to change  Congress, which has not responded to the needs of the people,  and place it at the service of great national interests?    [Vargas] I believe that a moral decision is indispensable to  put aside personal and group interests, and emotional  considerations, forgetting for the moment the desertion of  deputies who have become "independents." This is currently the  case with 21 persons who have seriously damaged the image of the  parties and Congress in the eyes of public opinion.    [Rivadeneira] Would not freedom of thought be restricted by  party pressures on a deputy to act according to his leaders'  wishes and not his conscience?    [Vargas] I believe it is important that there be maturity  and  conscience, or the people will make their demands heard that  Congress keep their promises. The people can even request that  someone be replaced if that person does not obey the popular  mandate. For my part, I will be very reliable. I will never miss  a meeting.    [Rivadeneira] Are these changes feasible and will Congress  be  disposed to cooperate in the process?    [Vargas] I am certain that the changes are feasible, and  this  is why it must not be undertaken lightly. I believe that today,  more than ever, there should be a different attitude, of  responsibility, of patriotism, of work, of reliability. In any  case, legislation as well as oversight are fundamental for the  country to come out of its crisis.    [Rivadeneira] Will General Vargas support the modernization  that the current government has begun?    [Vargas] Nobody can oppose an improvement or a restructuring  of the state because evolution demands it, but as it has been  presented and is being carried out, there is no modernization as  such, but rather a consolidation of power that is very far from  the country's collective and sovereign interests.    [Rivadeneira] Fabian Alarcon, how would you go about  improving Congress' performance in the next two years?    [Alarcon] In the past two years Congress has touched bottom.  The Congress has not made laws, nor has it exercised oversight,  nor has it met any of its responsibilities. The Ecuadoran people  sent a very clear message to the country, the politicians, and  the parties on 1 May: it wants a change in attitudes at all  levels of the state, and especially with regard to Congress.    [Rivadeneira] Is it possible to satisfy this popular demand  and change attitudes in Congress?    [Alarcon] Yes, those attitudes can be changed. I remember  that when I presided over Congress we worked intensively. About  180 proposed bills were drafted and 80 were passed into law,  many of which were very important for the country. The work was  performed with responsibility and discipline.    [Rivadeneira] Fabian Alarcon, to what do you attribute the  change?    [Alarcon] Unfortunately, these past two years changed the  face of what Congress had been, and this basically is because  the government greatly interfered during that time, buying  deputies of the various parties. Therefore, I believe that the  government is responsible for what has happened in Congress  during the past two years.    [Rivadeneira] What corrective actions must be taken to  prevent Congress from continuing in this state of deterioration?    [Alarcon] The needs of Ecuadorans must be transformed into  proposed laws. First, Congress must be made to work and to  exercise self-discipline. Congress oversees everyone, but who  oversees Congress?    [Rivadeneira] Fabian Alarcon, how can Congress be  supervised?    [Alarcon] It has to be by self-supervision through laws. We  will submit a proposed law that says a deputy who does no work  is a deputy who gets no pay, that requires punctuality and  regular attendance at the legislative commissions. If a  nonperforming deputy maintains this attitude during a succeeding  month he will be sent home, with the people's approval.    [Rivadeneira] What about the independent deputies?    [Alarcon] As for the famous "independent" deputies, a law  should be passed to the effect that deputies who disaffiliate or  who are expelled from their parties will automatically cease to  be deputies, out of a sense of political morality. Finally, I  propose that we deputies-elect start to work along broad  guidelines, on legislation, as well as on oversight matters, to  be able to go to work right away on 10 August so that the  country can see a new image of Congress.    [Rivadeneira] Fabian Alarcon, will you support the changes  the country needs and the process of modernization that the  government is carrying out?    [Alarcon] No one can be opposed to change and modernization,  which are necessary. However, as it has been presented, one must  ask where the change is headed. If it is to consolidate the  privileges of the few, we are absolutely opposed to  modernization. If it is to benefit the vast majority, we are for  it. Unfortunately, the government is confusing modernization  with privatization.</p>

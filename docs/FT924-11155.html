			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Survey of Sri Lanka (4): An astute campaign - Privatisation THE government's programme to privatise state-owned enterprises had a slow start after first being mooted in 1987. The programme was born when three other issues dominated the government's agenda: civil war in the north of the country, insurrection in the south and a presidential election in December, 1988. It took until November, 1989, for the first company, United Motors, to be freed from state ownership. Since then, 21 companies have been divested, raising more than SLRs5bn in revenue. Government officials are confident they can sell off the remaining 40 of those currently on offer by next June. This may be over-optimistic given the limited resources at the government's disposal to value and market the assets, and to evaluate bids. The government has also sold off some of the best companies first and may struggle to persuade private investors to take up the serious loss-makers. As with the privatisation of the plantation and transport sectors, which have been conducted under separate programmes, a rump of unprofitable companies is likely to remain in government hands. The issue of whether to continue subsidising or to liquidate these companies remains unresolved. The privatisation programme, however, is gathering momentum and most potential pitfalls are behind it. It has been backed by an astute awareness campaign which, using an ancient fertility symbol as its mascot, has renamed privatisation 'people-isation'. Mr Tissa Jayasinghe, who heads the privatisation programme at the Ministry of Finance, explains that the media campaign was 'written in a provocative manner, because we wanted feed-back. We wanted to provoke debate.' One advert detailed the cost, about Dollars 500m, of subsidising state companies between 1984-86. 'Nobody had really exposed this before. There was a lot of hue and cry,' says Mr Jayasinghe. The privatisation of United Motors, through the sale of 90 per cent of its listed shares to the public, took place against the backdrop of the People's Liberation Front (JVP) insurgency. The remaining 10 per cent holding was split between the company's employees and Mitsubishi of Japan. The privatisation commission warned that the issue would fail but the government pushed ahead, determined not to allow the insurgency to undermine its economic programme and to fulfil its commitments to international donors. Underwriters were left holding more than two-thirds of the shares at an issued price of SLRs11 per share. 'Banks were crying about it at the time,' admits Mr Jayasinghe, and opposition parties called for the programme to be scrapped. The government's response, now considered by officials to have been a mistake, was to sell the next company, Thulhiriya Textile Mills, to a single buyer, Kabool Spinning and Textile of South Korea. In commercial terms, the sale was a success. Kabool paid Dollars 6m for the company and has since invested a further Dollars 20m. One fifth of the 3,000 employees were surplus to requirements when the company was sold, but the workforce has since been expanded to 3,600. The method of privatisation - selling a company in its entirety to a foreign buyer - was controversial. As Mr Jayasinghe explains, in theory 'state enterprises are owned by all the people, and when you divest you must allow people a right to take a share'. The government has now produced a formula which, although flexible, provides a standard for privatisations to follow. The government aims to sell a majority shareholding, usually 60 per cent, of a company to a corporate investor based on the criteria of price, credentials and future plans for investment. A 30 per cent tranche of shares is then sold to the public with the aim of creating a broad base of about 35,000 shareholders. The remaining 10 per cent of shares are distributed to employees on the basis of length of service. With the value of the shares they receive often many times their annual salaries, there has been little employee resistance to privatisation. The opening up of the stock market to foreign investors, and the imminent arrival of five foreign broking houses in Colombo, should help the government's drive to find investors for forthcoming issues. The most serious question hanging over the programme is the viability of those companies yet to be sold, some of which carry a heavy burden of debt. A government policy barring privatised companies from making employees compulsorily redundant is also likely to hamper the sales of the more marginal businesses, especially those which currently enjoy high tariff protection.</p>

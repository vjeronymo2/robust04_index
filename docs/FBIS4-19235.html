			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carola Kaps: "In Washington Scharping Shows His </F> Affinity for Clinton"]    [Text] Washington, 13 Apr -- In his Washington lecture on  the subject "Challenges and Options: the SPD's Agenda for  Political and Economic Change in Germany," the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] chancellor candidate Scharping hardly  omitted a single important keyword that would not have been all  too familiar to his U.S. audience from the mouth of their own  President. Just like Clinton, Scharping is also convinced that  only he who stands on firm feet in domestic policy can act  strongly and make himself heard in terms of foreign policy. The  creation of jobs, the promotion of growth and securing social  justice are, thus, the most important tasks in terms of foreign  policy for both of them. Scharping has also taken up the cause  of fighting crime.    Just like Clinton before him, the chancellor candidate  speaks  of the necessity "to renew and modernize Germany." The demand  to "reinvent the government and to trim bureaucracy" and to  increase the efficiency of state services are to be found here  and there. Clinton's call for public welfare reform contrasts  with Scharping's reform of the welfare state. For both it is  clear that the modernization of the economy can only be achieved  through close cooperation between the state and the private  economy. The state does not only have the task to provide a  reliable framework for the economy but it also must participate  in training and retraining employees, promotion of high  technology, and speeding up the innovation process. Scharping  does not forget either to support the call for "information  highways," and, by trying to emerge somewhat from Clinton's  shadow, he adds as a personal suggestion that the information  highways should be extended across the Atlantic. Scharping  emphasizes his similarity to Clinton also when responding to  questions regarding his tax reform that just like Clinton he  wanted to take some burden off investments and ask more money  from high-income earners. Nobody from among his U.S. audience  cared to ask whom Scharping counts among the high-income earners  and where he would draw the line. The question how Scharping  wanted to create jobs and maintain the high German wage level at  the same time, is not being asked either. The lines along which  Scharping is thinking become, however, obvious when he speaks of  the nonsense of spending more than 100 billion German marks a  year on unemployment benefits. He says that it is cheaper to  keep unemployed on state job-creation schemes.    Differences to Clinton do appear when the SPD chancellor  candidate speaks about restoring social justice. He speaks  convincingly about the industrial nation's duty to take care of  "sustained global development" to preserve the environment. He  remains vague in describing his social agenda; it also remained  unclear what he has in mind when he speaks of the reform of the  welfare state. His statement that "in Germany there are no  excesses in the social system, but quite the contrary," met with  lack of understanding. In a country in which such a social  network does not even exist and in which "welfare as we know it"  should be abolished and be replaced by the obligation to work,  there is little understanding for the German social system.</p>

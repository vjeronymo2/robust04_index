			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (2): Analysts stress the ratios that matter - Andrew Hill examines the banks' efficiency Italian banks are usually ranked according to their total assets or equity, a list in which the laurels are always taken by the biggest credit institutions. These are the so-called banks of national interest, like Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano; the six former 'public law credit institutions', like Istituto San Paolo di Torino and Monte dei Paschi di Siena; and the largest savings banks (casse di risparmio), such as Cariplo and the Banca di Roma grouping. The spate of recent merger and takeover proposals has, however, reminded Italy that, wherever its banks stand in the national ranking and whatever the outcome of the current bid battles, its credit institutions still have a comparatively lowly place in world rankings. The question is whether this lack of bulk matters, and whether a rush to consolidate might distract banks from the more important aim of improving internal efficiency. Many bankers and banking analysts are now looking at other criteria to judge Italy's biggest financial houses. They suggest the banking sector should be paying more attention to its efficiency ratios - the relationship between profit and assets, for example, or, quite simply, the net profit figure. Attempts to assess the relative efficiency of Italian banks in this way produce a quite different ranking. For example, Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), preparing to fight off a bid from Credito Italiano (Credit), has made great play of a list of Italy's top 20 banks, which sets 1993 gross operating profit against assets, and ranks Rolo as the fifth most profitable bank, and Credit only 13th. Similarly, Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, which seems to have successfully blocked attempts at a takeover, ranks seventh, while its erstwhile suitor, Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), comes in 11th. All such rankings can be misleading if one-off elements are not taken into account, of course. If one compares gross profit, for example, the level of provisions - an important element in judging banks' accounts - is not included. But if, for example, only net profit is judged, then the distorting effect of tax charges can blur the ranking. In any case, both BCI and Credit have fought back against the implication that they may be less efficient or profitable than Rolo and Ambroveneto. They point out that all four banks are efficient institutions relative to the sector overall, and that during the recession both Rolo and Ambroveneto have been working in slightly easier markets (respectively, the prosperous areas of Emilia Romagna and the Veneto) than their suitors. Credit's supporters argue, moreover, that Rolo lacks the international presence of the larger bank, which would ease the way for Emilia Romagna's many exporters. Looking at the whole European banking sector, Mr William Vincent, European banking analyst with Schroder Securities, says that the banks which stand the best chance of succeeding are not necessarily the biggest, but those with a definite niche in the market. That sounds positive for Italy's myriad smaller banks, particularly as they have the closest links to the small and medium-sized companies which are the backbone of the Italian economy. On the other hand, as Mr Vincent himself points out, it is the same small companies which have suffered most in the recession, and as a result many of Italy's smaller banks have been hit by heavy provisions against bad loans. Mr Luigi Coccioli, deputy chairman of the Italian banking association (ABI), sees both sides of the problem. He is also chairman of Banco di Napoli, one of Italy's biggest and oldest banks. But Banconapoli's customers also include a large proportion of small and medium-sized enterprises, based in the south of Italy, which has been particularly hard-hit by recession. The bank had to announce a heavy first-half loss this year, and suffered the indignity of having its credit rating downgraded by Moody's because of 'deteriorating asset quality'. Mr Coccioli still defends the ability of a larger bank to provide a better service than its smaller competitors, however - especially for expanding companies: 'The local cassa di risparmio can certainly take care of a small textile company in its home town, but if that company wants to export its products to Guatemala or Kuala Lumpur, the small cassa is unable to guarantee all the paraphernalia of bills of lading, export credits and so on.' He is adamant, however, that enthusiasm for expansion must be matched by a desire to confront the difficult challenges of rationalisation and improving efficiency. In this, Italy's biggest banking groups need to learn from their past mistakes. Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, for example, erred when it indulged in what one observer close to the bank describes as an 'imperial' phase during the 1980s. New subsidiaries were started up, the Rome head office expanded, and international branches were added without paying enough attention to the quality of staff recruited overseas. The phase culminated in the embarrassing scandal of unauthorised loans to Iraq made by the group's Atlanta branch. Now, under new management, BNL is amalgamating its subsidiaries into the group structure, and will concentrate on efficiency improvements to consolidate its position as the third or fourth largest Italian institution. In the same way, IMI, the diversified financial services group which until the recent reforms was one of Italy's few medium-term lending institutions, tried to expand internationally in the 1980s, but had to rein in its ambitions when it realised that to achieve its aim of becoming a global operator at that time would have been, in the words of one banker, 'very expensive and very risky'. The risks of domestic expansion are less obvious, and all bankers talk of the need to reduce the number of banks in Italy from over 1,000 to nearer the 200 or so which analysts believe the market can support. But, as Mr Coccioli of ABI points out, there is still a heavy cost to rationalisation. To realise efficiencies, management must take on powerful banking unions, backed by rigid labour agreements; local politicians, who identify the regional bank with the future prosperity and identity of their constituency; and the technological challenge of linking up different computer systems. As one analyst puts it: 'You can see the advantages for Italy and Italians of consolidation - a greater range of financial products, and so on - but it's far harder for the banks themselves to see the benefits.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------                         ITALY'S BIGGEST BANKS  --------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Total                                 customer     Net profit                                 deposits       (loss)*    Number of                                  (L bn)        (L bn)     branches**  -------------------------------------------------------------------- San Paolo di Torino             109,477         479          959 Cariplo                          70,308         320          651 Banca di Roma                    70,102         110        1,225 Banca Nazionale del Lavoro       54,363       51.15          582 Banca Commerciale Italiana       52,637         268          689 Banco di Napoli                  50,127         174          800 Credito Italiano                 45,409         219          641 Monte dei Paschi di Siena        42,378        24.6          684 Banco di Sicilia                 31,140        (849)         384 Crediop                          27,988         201          na Banco Ambrosiano Veneto          24,843         175          500  -------------------------------------------------------------------- *After transfers to reserves.  -------------------------------------------------------------------- **In Italy  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: 1993 company reports and Mediobanc  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

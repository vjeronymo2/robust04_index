			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Rover to introduce second shift at Cowley ROVER is to introduce a second production shift early next year at its Cowley assembly plant at Oxford, where it plans to increase output next year by about 50 per cent. Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, also plans to raise output at its Sunderland assembly plant by 50 per cent next year. Rover, a British Aerospace subsidiary, is expected to start volume production of the new 600 large family saloon at Cowley in February. The new range, which will replace the Montego, will be added to output of the Rover 800 executive car at the plant. The 600 has been largely developed by Honda of Japan, which owns a 20 per cent stake in the Rover vehicle operations. Honda began production in October of the sister car, the Accord, at its Pounds 370m Swindon car assembly and engine plant. Rover has redeveloped and rationalised the Cowley plant with an investment of about Pounds 200m. The plant now has capacity to produce about 110,000 cars a year. Rover said output at Cowley would rise to about 75,000 next year from fewer than 50,000 this year. The company said the second shift would be introduced without adding any jobs at the plant, which has a workforce of about 4,700 people. Nissan Motor said output at its Pounds 900m Sunderland plant had risen by 43.5 per cent this year to 179,000 from 124,700 last year. Mr Ian Gibson, managing director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK, said the company was planning to raise output by a further 51 per cent next year to 270,000 cars with about 84 per cent of production being exported. Output of the Nissan Primera large family car is expected to fall by 8 per cent next year to 130,000 from 141,800 this year, while production of the Micra small car, which began in August, is forecast to rise to 140,000 next year from 37,200 in the last five months of this year. About 87 per cent of Primera output has been exported this year. Mr Gibson said that productivity at the Sunderland plant for the Primera was now slightly ahead of Nissan's sister plant in Japan. Productivity for the Primera had been improved by 8 per cent this year with the hours per car reduced by one hour to 12.5 hours.</p>

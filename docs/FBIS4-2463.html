			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan] </F>   [Text] The Xiamen People's Congress may pass its first  piece of legislation as early as next month, the head of the  legislature, Li Xiuji, said yesterday. He said the congress,  which was given its own legislative power by the National  People's Congress last month, would promulgate a procedural law  governing the lawmaking process when its standing committee met  next month. It will be followed by a law on how to implement  China's first Taiwanese investment protection law. Mr Li said  he was hopeful this second piece of legislation might be ready  in the first half of this year.    But the long-term aim is to set up a legal framework that  matches the needs of a "socialist market economy" by 1997 in  Xiamen, which is the closest mainland city to Taiwan. According  to Mr Li, who is also Xiamen's Deputy Communist Party Secretary,  the congress will at this stage focus on three types of  legislation. These are: protection of Taiwanese interests,  bringing the legal system up to par with other countries, and  urban planning, management and public order. A meeting had  already been held between the congress and Taiwanese investors  in Xiamen to solicit their opinions, Mr Li said.    Although Xiamen now has its own power to legislate, Mr Li  said the Special Economic Zone would not become independent from  the rest of Fujian. Instead, he said, the power would provide  other Fujian cities with a "very valuable experience". Being  able to legislate, Mr Li said, was important to enable Xiamen to  become the third free-trade port in China. The congress will  try to upgrade some of its existing regulations in order to  speed up the process.</p>

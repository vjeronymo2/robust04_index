A spokesman for the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry told KUNA that  this horrendous crime had moved the human feelings and  conscience in Kuwait by its hideous and savage nature, and that  denunciation is not enough to condemn this deliberate slaughter.  He said that the Security Council and the superpowers in it are  required more than ever before to take decisive and firm  measures to protect the Palestinian people against such  concocted crimes.    He added that by its protection of the settlements in the  heart of the occupied Arab areas, the Israeli Government bears  legal, material, and moral responsibility for this massacre. He  said that while offering its sincerest condolences to the  relatives of the martyrs and the Palestinian people, Kuwait  believes that more international efforts should be made to  secure the full Palestinian rights for setting up their own  state on their national territory, because this is the sure  guarantee for a safe future for them.</p>

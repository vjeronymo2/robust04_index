			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Zhang Junsheng Stresses that the </F> Higher People's Court Has Affirmed Original Judgment on Xi Yang  Case According to Law"]    [Text] Yesterday, while reporters asked Zhang Junsheng,  deputy director of the Hong Kong Branch of XINHUA News Agency,  questions about the Beijing Higher People's Court rejection of  Xi Yang's appeal and affirmation of the original judgment, he  pointed out that the inland [nei di 0355 0966] judicial  department independently handled and passed judgment on Xi Yang  case according to the criminal facts on the basis of judicial  procedures. This is completely a question of violating inland  laws because of stealing state secrets. This does not concern  freedom of the press, nor has it anything to do with normal news  coverage.    Zhang Junsheng made the remarks while attending the  inauguration ceremony of the Hong Kong General Publication  Association. He added that he learned from news reports that  the Beijing Higher People has passed judgment of the second  trial on Xi Yang case. According to inland laws, the second  trial is a ruling of the final instance. Interpretation of the  judgment in Xi Yang's case is a matter for the relevant judicial  department. We can only answer some of your questions to help  you clear up doubts according to our understanding of the laws.    Zhang Junsheng stated: Freedom of covering news is protected  according to law in the interior. With regard to Hong Kong  reporters who cover news in the interior, as long as they do not  violate inland laws, it is very free for them to do news  coverage. Enormous assistance has been provided for Hong Kong  reporters who are covering news in the interior not only by  relevant departments in the interior, but also by the Hong Kong  Branch of XINHUA News Agency. You all know this very clearly.</p>

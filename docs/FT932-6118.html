			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Packer and his assassins - In the free-spending world of top-level polo POLO MUST have considerable magic if it can make Kerry Packer an Englishman. The Australian media tycoon is a fanatical player and the biggest spender in the British game. His two teams, Ellerston White and Ellerston Black, based in the West Sussex village of Stedham, probably will cost him more than Pounds 2m to run this season. A goodish chunk will go to his South American professionals, Gonzalo Piere and Adolfo Cambiaso. These 'hired assassins,' as the top players are known in the game, command six-figure fees for three months' work. They will play with Packer and young Briton Tarquin Southwell; yet, the rules of the venerable Hurlingham Polo Association, the sport's governing body, say that 50 per cent of the team (two players) must be British. 'Every patron is deemed an honorary Englishman for the duration of the season,' says HPA secretary Buff Crisp, explaining how Packer changes nationality each May. Indeed, while the green meadows of southern England stage the world's best polo each summer, few of the players or backers in its high-goal format (the sport's equivalent of motor racing's Formula One) are British. Almost every 10-goal player (the best possible handicap) in the world will be playing for one or other of the 14 teams entered in the top division, a phenomenon that could be a tribute to the British administration. 'Why do they come here and spend - or earn - God knows how many millions of pounds?' asks Crisp. 'We're good at organising tournaments and the games will be totally fair.' Professional umpires will be used for the first time this season but Crisp says it is difficult to acquire completely impartial umpires since, unlike other sports such as rugby or soccer, there is virtually no pool of players sidelined by age to draw upon. 'Retired polo players simply don't exist. They either go broke or die.' Since Prince Charles has done neither, why all the headlines about him 'quitting' the sport? In fact, he has simply withdrawn from the high-goal game and will continue to play at a more modest recreational level with a team called the Maple Leafs. The other notable retirement has been England captain Julian Hipwood who, on a handicap of seven, had been the country's top player since the mid-1970s. Hipwood, 46 and a polo professional all his life, is unashamedly nostalgic for a past with more fun and fewer hired guns flying in. 'People like Kerry Packer don't have a budget,' he says. 'He wants to win the Gold Cup so badly he will simply spend what it takes. In the old days, out of a season's cost of Pounds 100,000, the patron would spend Pounds 10,000 on players and ponies and the rest on having a good time. Not any more, I'm afraid.' Don't such owners - businessmen, not athletes - risk looking silly playing alongside professionals? After all, a tycoon might buy a football club but he would not play at centre-forward. 'You do find one or two people sniggering, but on the whole the patrons do very well,' says Hipwood. Where he does find a tension is between the imports and the struggling British journeyman. 'They fly in with hat and stick and get Packer's best pony put underneath them, while the English pro is out there grooming and slaving away. We're friends on the field but, underneath, there's an uneasiness about them coming in and taking our jobs.' This, of course, is simply the part of polo beloved of the glossy magazines and Jilly Cooper novels. At the grass roots the game is thriving and growing, without any recourse to plane tickets to Buenos Aires or Australian millionaires. 'Seventy-five per cent of our members have a handicap of one or below (equivalent, roughly, to a 15 golf handicap). That's where the strength is in this country,' says Crisp. 'Over 100 pony clubs now have polo teams.' So, why are the top players called Carlos rather than Charles? 'We've got more concrete than pampas in this country and our season is only a quarter of the year,' Crisp explains. 'Maybe it's also temperament.' Even if the chances of being put on the Packer payroll range between slim and zero, the number of people rolling up to learn polo at Anthea Hartley's Chiltern polo centre, an hour north-west of London, is soaring. Why? 'It's very difficult for Joe Bloggs to have a go at polo without making a major financial commitment,' she says. 'It's also like learning to play in a goldfish bowl if you go to a club. Everybody's watching you and you're bound to feel inadequate. Unlike tennis, you can't go out and practise in private.' Her clients range from property men to policemen who pay Pounds 30 for a two-hour evening session, plus Pounds 25 to hire a pony. They start by poring over a table-top pitch with plastic players and horses to learn rules and tactics. 'They want to jump straight on a horse and hit the ball but it can be dangerous and you need briefing,' says Hartley. 'A lot of girls come. Women tend to be enthusiastic and do it as a fun thing. The men are often dedicated towards becoming serious players.' Since she does not play herself, I (wrongly) imagined Anthea as the wife of a polo fanatic. 'Actually, we don't mention the P-word in front of my husband,' she confides. 'He's a rugby man, but very tolerant of all these horses.'</p>

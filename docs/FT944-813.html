			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Dow buys 80% stake in east German chemical complex Dow Chemical of the US has bought a majority stake in one of east Germany's former state-owned chemical complexes, giving it a strategic position in Germany and eastern Europe. The price for the enterprise, which has been making losses, was not disclosed. The US company will take an 80 per cent stake in Buna/Bohlen and invest DM1bn (Pounds 400m) while the Treuhand privatisation agency will retain the remaining 20 per cent and provide DM3bn in investment. The Treuhand had sought buyers for one of the most polluted and inefficient industrial complexes under the former communist regime. Dow will buy the steam cracker facilities at Sachsische Olefinwerke in Bohlen, the electrochemical units and derivative operations at nearby Buna, and the intermediate chemical operations at Leuna. All are based in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, and are one of the last remaining large industrial enterprises under the Treuhand, which winds up operations at the end of 1994. The investments will be spread over four years. Dow will make an initial payment, followed by additional sums as turnover increases. It will also guarantee 2,700 jobs. Buna employed more than 18,000 workers before 1990. All sectors of this petrochemical complex are losing money. Buna is expected to lose DM300m this year but its turnover is expected to have increased by two-thirds from the 1993 figure of DM600m because of the upswing in the chemical industry. Bohlen will lose about DM160m for this year. Privatisation of the east German chemical sector was resisted by the west German industry, which maintained that Dow's investment in Buna would increase capacity levels. The Treuhand, backed by the finance ministry, has picked up the DM3.5bn debts of the whole Buna/Bohlen/Leuna chemical complex and has invested a further DM5.5bn. Treuhand energy experts yesterday confirmed that Bohlen would have the annual capacity to produce 450,000 tonnes of ethylene. The ethylene will be converted at Buna into polyethylene and propylene, the basis for synthetic materials used, among other things for the car industry. Buna will have a 200,000 tonnes annual capacity for propylene.</p>

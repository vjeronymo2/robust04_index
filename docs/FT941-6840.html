			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: R&amp;D systematically undervalued in UK Sir, The question of reporting R&amp;D expenditure is not just an issue for accounting standards ('Companies breach R&amp;D accounting standards', February 24). MSF, the largest union for scientists and technologists in the private sector, believes the contribution of R&amp;D expenditure to the future wealth of the UK is being systematically undervalued. At present there is no requirement for companies to report properly defined R&amp;D expenditure in their company accounts and reports. According to a 1993 study by Company Reporting, of the 43 per cent of companies that reported R&amp;D expenditure in their annual reports, 25 per cent gave no further details in their accounts. Is it no wonder that this creates an image among brokers that R&amp;D expenditure is not important? The government and both sides of industry must promote the importance of R&amp;D expenditure. MSF has long argued that this debate could properly be stimulated by introducing legislation to make reporting of properly defined R&amp;D expenditure compulsory. However, we suspect that the government would oppose any such move as 'red tape' and over-regulation of industry, even though this would send a message to investors, customers and employees alike, about a company's commitment to product development.

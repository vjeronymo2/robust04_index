It also shows a high  rate of drug consumption. He offered to furnish evidence of this  to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR).    Remarking that small planes are often observed landing in  various parts of the state, he said that this should be  investigated by the PGR and the counternarcotics authorities.    He questioned the effort of the PGR, noting its failure to  publicize the results of investigations conducted in the case of  small planes loaded with drugs that crashed in BCS territory  months ago.    He asserted that, to date, the Attorney General's Office has  maintained secrecy regarding the crash of a plane carrying five  tons of cocaine. It occurred during April 1993, in this  municipality's Los Barriles community, 60 km south of here.    He revealed that he, personally, had reports from an  ex-official pertaining to the drug traffic, adding: "I would be  willing to give details to the PGR authorities."</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / The real reasons why science is under attack: In the Weekend FT last month, Professor John Postgate posed the question: 'Religion: are we better off without it?' Here Hugh Dickinson, the Dean of Salisbury, gives his reply 'The age-old dispute between science and religion has resurfaced. But science has the moral high ground.'  - Professor Postgate The clarion call by Professor Postgate in defence of science sounds a bit like a nervous Roman legate warning his troops of impending rebellion by wild Germanic tribes across the Rhine. He pictures a rational scientific elite having to defend itself against repeated onslaughts of religious fanatics. But is it really like that? This is not the first article in the FT by a contemporary scientist expressing a sense that 'science' or scientists are somehow beleaguered or under threat, and to attribute that threat to the malign influence of 'religion', specifically Christianity and Islam. Postgate devotes much space to the fruitless game of balancing the profit and loss accounts of religion and science - a sort of tit-for-tat of 'you've done nastier things than we have'. The enterprise is naive and pointless unless he defines what he means by 'science' and 'religion'. Both are complex, pluriform concepts, not single unitary entities. 'Science' stretches all the way from the abstractions of theoretical physics through the Cern cyclotron, via molecular biology, keyhole surgery, ceramic saucepans, and on to the hill farmer using the latest herbicide sold to him by the agri-chemical multi-nationals. 'Religion', likewise, stretches from human sacrifice in the Amazon basin through the sack of Constantinople, the prophet Mohammed, Giotto, George Herbert, Salisbury Cathedral, Francis of Assisi, Lord Shaftesbury and the Sermon on the Mount. Both religion and science (in that general sense) do have dark episodes and great achievements; both have a history of terrible distortions. But unless religion is fundamentalist and science positivist and systematically reductionist, there is no necessary collision. It is cheap to accuse the many first-class scientists who also have deep religious conviction of keeping their minds in two water-tight compartments. The innuendo of intellectual dishonesty is inescapable. Science and religion occupy different realms of discourse, each with its distinctive appropriate language. Religion is about meanings, purposes and values; science about physical phenomena and their relationships. Religion is about the quality of things, people and experiences; science is about enumeration, measurement and quantity. The most profound human experiences cannot be measured or enumerated, and the integrity required for honest measurement is only one segment of a broad spectrum of moral imperatives needed by human society. Alone, it offers no specially high ground. But there are two issues raised by Postgate which are of real interest. Why is there a widespread distrust of 'science'? And what kind of morality can 'science' offer humanity? The distrust of science is not generated by religion - it is far too widespread for fundamentalist hostility alone to account for it. Admittedly, there are fundamentalist groups in all religions whose authoritarian hold over their adherents is threatened by a modern understanding of the universe. But the unease about 'science' is a deeply felt anxiety in secular society at large. It arises from the fact that applied science is not value neutral - it has immense economic and political and environmental consequences. The public knows that 'science' is an often ambivalent benefactor - like the Greeks bringing gifts, its contribution to the welfare of society is not always beneficial. More sinister, who pays for science - who calls the tune? Scientists must be paid by someone. And too many have manifestly sold their objective independence to governments, multinational corporations or interest groups. They are happy to be called as witness on opposite sides of public inquiries  -who are we to believe? Of course, pure scientists are not like that - they are as pure as the driven snow. Except that, for the layman, it is hard to understand how one generation's heresies become the orthodoxy of the next - plate tectonics, for example. The trouble is that the general public does not see the pure scientist at work in his beautiful ivory laboratory of moral integrity - it sees the results down the line: the experiments on embryos, the extravagantly expensive high-tech surgery, the environmental consequences of Chernobyl, the genetic engineering, the astonishing array of lethal substances designed to kill or maim. It sees Hiroshima. And, quite simply, it is scared stiff because it feels the whole huge techno-scientific machine is out of control, and that the global environment is going to be damaged irreparably. Of course, it is not fair. That is not what real science is about. I know that. You know that. But if Postgate is really wanting to know why science is under attack, it is more to do with the loss of butterflies from toxic spray than from fanatical Christians rejecting a scientific world view. I owe my life - twice - to modern medical science. No complaints there. More intriguing, to my mind, is the issue of moral superiority. Let us turn the question round. Can science offer humanity a moral code to live by? The scientific method of meticulous observation and controlled experiment, from which human factors are excluded as far as possible, does require qualities of integrity and truthfulness of a high order. But science can never tell us the value of anything. What is the moral status of the human foetus? Is life sacred? Should we act with altruism? Why is Rembrandt so important? What has King Lear to tell us about the human condition? Why has Jesus of Nazareth won the hearts and lives of so many people? Why is it important to care for grossly handicapped children? Is eugenics as a political programme morally wrong? All those questions, and many more like them, cannot be addressed by pure science - nor are Fellows of the Royal Society better qualified to address them than moral philosophers, historians or theologians. Yet, these are the kind of religious questions which we have to address if we are to set out to live the good life or create a humane society. Science has often tried to dismiss these fundamental human issues by a systematic reductionism with an arrogance which itself has, in the past, been cause enough for an instinctive distrust in the non-scientific community. But it seems to me that more and more scientists are now open to a new awareness of the boundaries and limitations of their own discipline's contribution to human wisdom. There is nothing like a bit of chaos to teach us humility. Science at its best is - or can be - the paragon of intellectual integrity proclaimed by Postgate. But religion also has its better aspects. Should not an objective scientist list and acknowledge them - and gladly? Is that not part of his moral integrity? Would the extraordinary shift of power from white to black majority in South Africa have taken place with such astonishing speed and calm if the Christian churches, and the values of reconciliation and multi-racial community which they preached, had not been a constant and pervasive influence in the leadership for 50 years? They, at least, would not have been better off without that moderating moral influence. The backlash against science - where it really exists - is a genuinely worrying feature of a secular society increasingly prone to mystical imaginings from a world of fantasy, science fiction and New Age gurus. But it must be equally worrying to the thoughtful Christian, for whom the rational pursuit of truth is just as important as it is for the FRS. And it is worth noting that some Fellows are also thoughtful Christians.</p>

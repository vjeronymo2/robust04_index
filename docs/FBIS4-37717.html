			<p>BFN     [Text] Kathmandu, June 17 (AFP) -- The head of the ruling  Nepali Congress (NC) party Friday [17 June] again called for the  removal of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, a party source  said.    Ganesh Man Singh returned to the capital Friday after  launching a five-day "Remove Prime Minister Girija Prasad  Koirala and save democracy" campaign in southwestern Nepal.  Singh also boycotted an NC Central Working Committee (NCCWC)  meeting which was attended by the prime minister and other NC  members including party president, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai.  The NCCWC meeting was held 10 weeks after its last meeting at  which the committee authorized Bhattarai to take action against  Koirala for his alleged role in upsetting Bhattarai's election  chances in a February by-election.    Bhattarai supporters have said that speeches made prior to  the election by Koirala were detrimental to the party chief and  damaged his election chances. But at the meeting the party  chief appeared to signal a change in his stand, party sources  said.    "Bhattarai had earlier wanted to remove Koirala for the  deceptive role played against him but now he seems to be growing  a soft corner for the prime minister," a highly placed NC source  said. "Now Singh is not happy with Bhattarai because he is  trying to save Koirala's head," the source said.    The next meeting of the NCCWC is scheduled to be held in  Pokhara, west of here, on June 22 after it ended Friday  inconclusively, the source said.    During his five-day whirlwind tour Singh spoke to party rank  and file, attacking the prime minister's alleged failings and  the "deceptive role" played by Bhattarai who, he said, was  trying to save Koirala. Singh told the NC youth members,  activists and district leaders that he would not compromise on  the issue.    "If Koirala continues to be in office for the remaining two  years, the Nepali Congress will lose the May 1996 general  elections, not to talk of getting a two-thirds majority of  votes," Singh said.</p>

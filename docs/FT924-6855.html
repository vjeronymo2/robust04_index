			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / People: Recharging at Lucas Sir John Fairclough and Louis Tomasetti were yesterday appointed to the board of Lucas Industries as non-executive directors. They replace Lord Armstrong, who has been on the board since 1989 and is 65, and 56-year-old American Des O'Connell, who has been on the board since 1988. Sir John, 62, was chief scientific adviser to the cabinet between 1986 and 1990. He is a director of NM Rothschild, chairman of the Engineering Council and non-executive director of Oxford Instruments Group. Louis Tomasetti, 61, and also American, retired as executive vice president of the aerospace business of General Electric of the US in 1990. Lucas has been rocked by the sudden departure last month of Tony Edwards, the boss of the aerospace division who had also been expected to take over as chief executive from Sir Anthony Gill, who still combines the roles of chairman and chief executive. Lucas moved quickly to fill Edward's gap earlier this month by naming Frank Turner from Rolls-Royce as his successor in charge of aerospace. ***** Geoffrey Whalen, deputy chairman of Peugeot Talbot Motor and chairman of Coventry and Warwickshire Tec, is appointed a non-executive at Coventry Building Society.</p>

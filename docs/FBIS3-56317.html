Kazmin explained that in accordance with the interstate  agreement concluded last November, the Central Bank of Russia  has granted a cash credit to Tajikistan totalling 120 Bn rubles  due to the difficult political and economic situation in the  country. "This does not mean that the republic has actually  entered "the ruble zone," underlined Kazmin.    In his words, the interstate credit has been granted for  half  a year under the pledge of gold-currency reserves and real  estate. The first part of this credit, 30 Bn rubles, was already  delivered to Tajikistan in early January, 1994.    Kazmin reported that the issue on Tajikistan's entering "the  ruble zone" is in the stage of development and it is premature  to speak about unification of monetary systems.    Tajikistan has already declared its readiness to accept  Russia's conditions providing for gradual entering into "the  ruble zone of a new type" and intends to use this credit to  exchange "old" Russian rubles for "new" ones.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO'S GRAFFITI  </P> <P> Regarding the unwelcome appearance on Irvine walls of the ugliest of all of  man's graphic efforts, the ubiquitous graffiti; may I offer to the good  citizens of that community an Italian phrase that just might offer them solace:  "Muraglia bianca, carta di matto." That translates as: "The white wall is the  fool's paper."  </P> <P> Cold comfort, I admit, but better than nothing.  </P> <P> THOMAS M. VIZE  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

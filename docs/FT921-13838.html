			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Perkins wins Dollars 1bn Caterpillar order PERKINS GROUP, the Peterborough-based diesel engine manufacturer, has won a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 568m) 10-year contract to supply engines to US-based Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment group. The deal, won against stiff competition from the Far East and continental Europe, is a big boost for Perkins, and comes during a recession that has hit the diesel industry's sales across the world. Perkins said yesterday that the deal would help safeguard jobs at Peterborough, where the engines will be built for export to Caterpillar plants worldwide. The workforce has been cut by about 300 to 3,200 over the past year because of difficult trading conditions. Perkins, which has supplied power units to Caterpillar for nearly 20 years, will provide Caterpillar with special versions of its high-technology four-cylinder and six-cylinder 1000 Series industrial range. The engines will carry the Caterpillar name, and will be used on smaller earthmoving and other equipment as well as for sale to customers. Caterpillar said the engines filled a gap at the smaller end of its product line which would have been too expensive to fill by developing its own range. Mr Tony Gilroy, Perkins Group managing director, said the deal represented a big customer's expression of confidence in Perkins' ability to meet increasingly stringent environmental and performance standards.</p>

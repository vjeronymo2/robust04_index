			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Peru to privatise 19 state companies PERU is to sell 19 state companies, its most serious venture yet into privatisation. President Alberto Fujimori said the government had designated small 'privatisation committees' for each of the companies, charged with selling this initial group of companies 'at the best possible price ..and in the most transparent fashion possible'. The first sales are expected within two months. Privatisation revenue will be used for development projects, improvements to infrastructure and job creation schemes, but not to balance the state's budget, Mr Fujimori said. The companies for immediate disposal include mining concerns Minero-Peru and Hierro Peru; bus company Enatru-Peru; two petroleum industry service and transport companies; and the liquid gas concern Solgas. Some loss-making state companies are to be wound up, including the heavily-indebted state steamship company Compania Peruana de Vapores, fishing companies Flopesca and Lilly SA as well as fishmeal producer San Jose. State-owned Banco Popular is also to be privatised. Mr Fujimori said his government's aim was to promote competition in the financial sector, which he called 'a cartel, or at least an oligopoly'. The state-owned Banco Continental could be sold to 'an international entity' - competition, he believed, would force local banks to cut costs and interest rates.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT BACK IN SERVICE  </P> <P> Operations were back to normal at John Wayne Airport today after the blast from  jet engines damaged new electrical cables Monday night, causing the new runway  lights to fail, officials said today.  </P> <P> Workers had not yet had a chance to bury the cables underground, and the jet  blast blew off sandbags that were protecting the electrical line, airport  manager George Rebella said. "It was kind of a freak situation," he said. "The  jet blast stretched the cables and exposed them to water, causing shorts."  </P> <P> The new cables, at the north end of the main runway, would not have been  affected by jet blast if air traffic controllers had not reversed the take-off  pattern because of weather conditions, Rebella said. The new electrical system  replaces a decades-old system that had shorted out repeatedly because it was  worn out, Rebella said. More than a dozen airlines' flights were diverted or  cancelled because of the electrical failure, and some incoming passengers were  bused to John Wayne from other airports late Monday night.  </P> <P> Airport officials said service was back to normal this morning. Airport  spokeswoman Kathie Rutherford said the affected cables will be buried  underground when the airport closes at 11 p.m. tonight, the normal curfew for  incoming airline flights. She said the airport will also be closed to small  general aviation aircraft at that time.  </P></p>

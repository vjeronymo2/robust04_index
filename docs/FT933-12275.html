			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / How to Spend It: Office gossip - how the power brokers work and play / Santa Raymond, a practising architect and interior designer, looks at the offices that three movers and shakers have created GARY WITHERS, of the public relations company Imagination, Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, and Lynne Franks, the public relations consultant, all work in offices which express clearly the culture of their businesses as well as their personalities and preferences. Although the businesses with which Franks, Withers and Young are involved are technologically sophisticated, the primary work of all three is face-to-face communication. This is reflected in the design of their offices. None of them is setting out to impress from behind large desks. Each office is comfortable and unpretentious, a place in which people may be encouraged to talk openly and effectively. Withers is himself a designer by trade, Franks has worked with her designer, Ben Kelly, over many years, and though Lord Young only came in on the design process when he joined the company half way through the building works he has 'no hang ups about talking with designers.' Each has had a highly creative relationship with their designer, and for each the result has been an office which fits them as individuals, and which portrays to colleagues and visitors the essence of their company culture. Here, in a nutshell, is how their offices help them succeed . . .</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAYOR WANTS COUNTY TO POLICE COMPTON  </P> <P> The mayor of Compton is seeking voter approval to hire Los Angeles County to  provide law enforcement and fire protection services because he said the city  can no longer afford its own departments.  </P> <P> Mayor Walter Tucker said the city is caught in a budget crunch and must cut  corners. By contracting with the county, the city could reduce law enforcement  and fire expenditures, which exceed $19 million annually, by about 50%, Tucker  said.  </P> <P> Already Tucker's proposal has drawn sharp criticism and the threat of a recall  from residents and city officials who claim that fire and police protection  will suffer if the county takes over.  </P> <P> Tucker said he will seek to place the question before the voters during the  general election next June. He must gather about 10,000 signatures -- 25% of  the registered voters in the city -- to put the issue on the ballot.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Thailand and the United States will on 7  February hold another round of negotiations on the signing of a  double taxation treaty. More than 20 such talks were held  before but failed to produce any success because the Finance  Ministry, which is in charge of the country's taxation policy,  considered the conditions proprosed by the U.S. side  execessively disadvantageous to Thailand.    A source in the Finance Ministry noted that the outcome of  this round of negotiations, which will last until 10 February,  will be crucial to both countries because its success means the  breakthrough of the over 16-year-long stalemate.    During his meeting with U.S. Secretary of Treasury Lloyd  Bentsen on 18 January, Finance Minister Tharin Nimanhemin  reaffirmed his endeavors to make the negotiations successful for  the benefit of the the two countries' trade and investment.  However, he stressed that the agreement must not put Thailand  at a disadvantage.    However, this will be a tough job for Director General of  Revenue Department M.R. Chatumongkhon Sonakun, who will conduct  the negotiations with the U.S. side. He also knows full well  that several U.S. demands were detrimental to Thai interests and  caused failure of the past talks.    In addition to that, the United States itself is also  influenced by pressure from various interest groups and thus has  to carefully consider the impact on them. Otherwise, the U.S.  Government will face assults from professional lobbyists of  these groups. [passage omitted]    A source said: "Our estimation of the percentage of success  for this round of negotiations is very low because the  conditions proposed by the United States are too disadvantageous  to Thailand. It is unlikely that the United States will adopt a  compromising stand during the talks. Although Bentsen said when  he came here that efforts would be made to ensure flexibility,  the U.S. side will attach more importance to the interests of  their people. If we yield to some of their demands, we will be  in a disadvantageous position. In short, it is very likely that  no agreement can be reached this time."</p>

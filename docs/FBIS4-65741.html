			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cypriot Government launched a protest today with  the United Nations and sought explanations for the delay in the  submission of the UN secretary general's report. Government  Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis stated that it is no longer  certain that the UN secretary general's report will be  circulated today or tomorrow, as expected.    The protest was made by Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis  to Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's deputy special  representative in Cyprus. The foreign minister also asked the  UN official to explain whether Turkish press reports that the  United Nations submitted a series of proposals to the Turkish  Cypriot side during the deliberations in Vienna are true. The  proposals reportedly satisfy many of the Turkish demands on  implementing the confidence-building measures.    Specifically, the Turkish press reports note that the United  Nations and Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special  coordinator on Cyprus, made the following proposals to the  Turkish side: First, two separate customs departments should be  established; second, there should be an equal number of flights  for the two sides from the Nicosia Airport; third, the Greek  Cypriots' access to Famagusta will be monitored by Turkish  Cypriot policemen in civilian clothes; and fourth, within one  year, before the operation of the Nicosia Airport, France,  Germany, Canada, and Australia will accept the entry of Turkish  Cypriot citizens using Turkish Cypriot passports. The press  reports also note that Feissel accepted that access to Famagusta  will be controlled by the Turkish side.    Kasoulidhis repeated that the confidence-building measures  process has ended, and that a Cyprus solution be promoted only  through alternative methods. He also said that if the submission  of the UN secretary general's report is delayed beyond Tuesday  [24 May], it would mean that the actions of the pseudostate in  convening the so-called council of ministers and the pseudostate  itself receive consideration. The spokesman stressed that the  21 March document clearly refers to all the issues. He added  that the elements noted in the Turkish Cypriot press are new.</p>

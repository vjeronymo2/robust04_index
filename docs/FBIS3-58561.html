			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] The Chief of the General Staff's Office has issued a  statement saying that a report carried by a private television  station on 10 January tried to alienate the people from military  service. The statement added that the nation has reacted to the  program as it is directed against the Turkish Armed Forces,  which comes from the heart of the nation.    The statement issued by Hursit Tolon, secretary general of  the chief of staff's office, recalls that various soldiers and  noncommissioned officers participated in the program in  question, which carried a report on the government decision to  defer discharges from the military. Pointing out that the armed  forces are continuing the necessary administrative and legal  action against the personnel who participated in the program,  the statement adds:    According to the investigation and information obtained from  the soldiers and noncommissioned officers who participated in  the program, some soldiers on furlough were intercepted and  interviewed so they would express views against the government  decision, thereby alienating the people against military service  and creating discontent within the ranks under the guise of  fulfilling a lofty mission.    An atmosphere that will induce the Turkish soldier -- whose  love of the country, sacrifice and discipline is written down in  history -- to act in violation of the hierarchic structure and  tradition of the Turkish Armed Forces has been created under the  guise of informing the public.    The statement notes that the program sends the message that  a  group of soldiers and noncommissioned officers are against the  government decision. What is more grave, it encourages these  people to disobey the laws, the regulations, and their superior.  The statement goes on to stress that despite this negative  propaganda, the Turkish Armed Forces will continue their  training and their war preparation activities that will enable  them to succeed their duties in both peace and war, and adds:  The announcement of this statement was necessary because of the  reaction of our lofty people, who could not tolerate such a  program that targeted the Turkish Armed Forces, which emerged  from its bosom, and the army personnel.</p>

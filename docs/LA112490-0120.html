			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF SKINS GAME;  </P> <P> THE PRIZE MONEY EXCITES EVEN THE QUIET PLAYERS  </P> <P> Gary Player wasn't expected to win the big one. Neither was Arnold Palmer. No  chance.  </P> <P> In the first Skins Game, played in 1983, the big winners were expected to be  Jack Nicklaus and/or Tom Watson, who was then considered the best player in the  world. Everybody knew that.  </P> <P> "So when Player sank that (four-foot) putt on the 17th hole for $150,000, he  got so excited he started hyperventilating. He really did," said Don Ohlmeyer,  founder and co-producer of the Skins Game. "And then on the 18th hole, he was  still so excited that he duck-hooked his tee shot."  </P> <P> Player, who said at the time that the most he had gambled on any hole was $10,  came away the winner that first year with $170,000. Palmer, who said he had  played a hole for $25 once, finished second at $140,000, with the majority won  on a 40-foot putt.  </P> <P> "When Arnold sank that putt on the 12th hole, he started running around the  green like a 20-year-old kid," Ohlmeyer said.  </P> <P> And so it goes with the Skins Game, the eighth of which begins today on the TPC  Stadium course at PGA West with prize money of $450,000. Call it unpredictable.  </P> <P> "You can play good golf and not win a skin. It's embarrassing," said Curtis  Strange, the defending champion who was shut out his first year, then came back  last year and won 11 skins and $265,000. He will compete in the two-day,  18-hole event against Nicklaus, Nick Faldo and Greg Norman.  </P> <P> The first six holes are worth $15,000 each, the second six $25,000 each and the  final six $35,000. The prize money is carried over if a hole ends in a tie.  </P> <P> Faldo, considered one of the best players in the world, and Norman, the PGA  money leader this season, are the newcomers. Nicklaus has played every year.  </P> <P> "About the only thing we don't have this year is one player that might have a  big mouth, like Lee (Trevino) or Fuzzy (Zoeller)," Strange said. "We don't have  a comedian. It will be quiet this year."  </P> <P> Added Nicklaus: "It was quiet the first year."  </P> <P> Then Zoeller came along in 1985 and Trevino in 1986.  </P> <P> "I remember one year Fuzzy giving Jack a kiss after he made a putt to carry the  money over," Ohlmeyer said.  </P> <P> Zoeller played in the Skins Game three years and is the record money winner at  $695,000. Nicklaus is second at $580,000, followed by Trevino, who played the  last four years, at $435,000.  </P> <P> Two of the four players are chosen by a PGA Tour panel and the third by a  sponsor's exemption. The defending champion has an automatic invitation.  Trevino was not asked to return.  </P> <P> "Lee has been a delight for us," Ohlmeyer said. "The hole in one he made on the  17th (in 1987) helped make the Skins Game what it is. And he is going to play  in the Senior Skins Game this year. But adding some new faces helps keep this  game unique."  </P> <P> The TPC Stadium Course, a Pete Dye-designed layout, also lends to the event's  uniqueness. Long noted for its difficulty, the holes are surrounded by railroad  ties, rocks, huge crater-type bunkers, water and rolling terrain. The course,  which is also a site for the Bob Hope Classic, plays to 7,271 yards from the  black tees and has a rating of 77.1. This is the fifth year for the event here.  </P> <P> "It's a tough course for me," Strange said. "But it's match play, and it only  takes a couple of holes to come home a winner. For skins, it's more of full  throttle. A go-all-out, let-her-go-type of format."  </P> <P> Before Faldo played the course this week, he said he had heard it was crazy.  Friday, he said it was great -- for match play, that is.  </P> <P> "I think if you had a scorecard in your hand, you would tear every hair from  your head," he said.  </P> <P> Norman, whose style of game seems well suited to the course, appeared eager for  the challenge.  </P> <P> "It's a driver's course," he said.  </P> <P> The veteran of the group had this advice for the newcomers.  </P> <P> "Watch this year." Nicklaus said to Faldo and Norman. "Then come back and play  hard next year."  </P> <P> No chance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Skins Game Notes  </P> <P> ABC-TV will telecast the Skins Game live today at 12:30 p.m. and delayed Sunday  at 3:30 p.m. . . . All four players have designated a portion of their winnings  to charity: Jack Nicklaus to the Junior Golf program; Greg Norman to the  Australian Junior Golf program; Nick Faldo to an orthopedic research program in  London and Curtis Strange to the Virginia Boys Home. . . . Most money on one  hole was won by Nicklaus in 1984, when he sank a 10-foot birdie putt on the  18th hole worth $240,000.  </P></p>

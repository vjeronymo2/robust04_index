			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The police arrested of the 17 anti-Burmese  Government elements of the Mon ethinic group on charge of  illegal entry into the country early in the morning of 25  February. One of those arrested was identified as Chaiyot  Pinsukan, alias "Nai Phayap," a former Kuomintang military  officer who is regarded as a key man in the Mon leadership. He  was charged with sheltering illegal immigrants. The arrest,  which took place only one day before the celebration of the Mon  ethnic group's national day scheduled at a stronghold at Hub  Phak border pass in Marid township near the Thai- Burmese  border, served as a warning for the Burmese minority groups that  are now engaging in the rebellion against the Burmese Government.    A source close to Chaiyot told PHUCHATKAN that the arrest  was  definitely politically motivated because Chaiyot and other Mon  leaders were known to have been active in opposing the  cease-fire talks between the New Mon State Party and Burmese  regime. They believe that the cease fire agreement will bring  an end to their struggle for national liberation.    On 24 February, the Mon arrestees lodged a letter with the  United Nations Office in Bangkok to demand the separation of  their area from Burma and complain about Mons being deprived of  their human rights by the Burmese Government and the eviction of  the Mon refugees in Kanchanaburi Province.    The source disclosed that the arrest took place at about  0600  on 25 February when immigrantion police and officers from the  Police Special Branch raided a house on Soi Ramkhamhaeng in  Bangkapi District of Bangkok. Chaiyot reportedly used the house  as his office and a shelter for the Mon during their stay in  Thailand.    However, some of the Mon were later released because they  could produce official permits allowing them to travel outside  the restricted areas.    Meanwhile, Chaiyot is still being detained at the  Immigration  Police Command Headquarters. His Taiwanese wife is seeking  legal help to bail him out. Earlier, Special Police Branch was  keeping a close surveillance on Chaiyot's movements because the  Thai Government feared that the activities of the Mon rebels on  Thai soil might damage relations between Thailand and Burma and  create obstacles to the ongoing cease-fire talks between the  Burmese Government and minority groups.    During an interview granted to PHUCHATKAN prior to his  arrest, Chaiyot claimed that he had 5,000 Mon soldiers under his  control to fight the Rangoon regime. He stressed that he would  continue to lead the struggle against the Burmese Government  even if the New Mon Party signed a cease-fire agreement with the  Burmese authority, saying that he was not afraid of being  arrested. He said: "You only die once. They can do anything  with me."    However, Nai Aung Tin, secretary general of the executive  committee of the New Mon State Party, told PHUCHATKAN in an  interview during the celebration of the Mon national day in  Marid that Chaiyot does not play any role in the party. He is  an outsider who used to support the party.    It was reported that the Burmese Government and four ethnic  groups, namely Kachin, Red Wa, Kokang, and Palaung have now  agreed to a cease-fire. The Karen, Karenni, and Mon are the  only three groups that are still at odds with Rangoon. The  Karen once requested Thailand to host peace talks, but the Thai  Government rejected their request.</p>

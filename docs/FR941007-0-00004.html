			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``Date''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this rule or the application of the provisions, all applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the NSLP, the administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures are set forth under the following regulations: (1) school food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority appeals of State agency findings as a result of a Coordinated Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must follow State agency hearing procedures as established pursuant to 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 210.18(q); (2) school food authority appeals of FNS findings as a result of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Coordinated Review must follow FNS hearing procedures as established pursuant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 7 CFR 210.30(d)(3); AND (3) State agency appeals of State Administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Expense fund sanctions (7 CFR 235.11(b)) must follow the FNS Administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Review Process as established pursuant to 7 CFR 235.11(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NSLP is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10.555 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR Part 3015, Subpart V and final rule-related notice at 48 FR 29114, June  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24, 1983).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No new data collection or recordkeeping requiring Office of Management and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3501 through 3502) are included in this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background: On March 27, 1974, the Department published final regulations (39 FR 11248) which defined enriched macaroni products with fortified protein as a food item meeting the NSLP meal pattern requirements specified in 7 CFR 210.10 under specified terms and conditions. At that time, the PER was the only recognized test for determining the biological quality of protein in foods. At present, there is another recognized method for determining the biological quality of protein in foods, the PDCAAS method. Several international bodies, including a Joint Expert Consultation on Protein Evaluation of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO) (1989), have concluded that PDCAAS, in which a score of 1.0 equals 100 percent of the 1985 WHO essential amino acid requirement patterns for 2 to 5 year olds, is an appropriate method for evaluating food protein quality. The 2 to 5 year old requirement is the most inclusive of those recommended and thus may be used for all age groups, except infants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PER is based on the assumption that proteins which are equivalent to casein meet the amino acid and protein requirements for the various age groups  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consuming a particular food. The specification of this methodology, which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based upon rodent nutrition requirements, was assumed to correlate to human  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements when PER was adopted as the sole regulatory method for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining protein quality. Extensive studies have since been conducted on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> human amino acid requirements which demonstrate that the essential amino acid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of humans are significantly different from those of rodents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This was recognized as early as 1980 by a conference of protein scientists and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutritionists held to assess protein quality in humans. A report of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working conference indicated a dissatisfaction with the PER method. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report further recognized that an amino acid scoring system, corrected for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> digestibility, is an appropriate alternative for measuring protein value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

During the  signing ceremony, Der'i hoped that the government would expand  further. Our party affairs correspondent Sefi Handler reports  from the Knesset:    The Labor-SHAS coalition agreement was initialed about 15  minutes ago. Why was a full agreement not signed? Because SHAS  is waiting for Knesset approval of the Meat Law, which could  take all night. Prime Minister Rabin is due to leave for the  United States at 0100 [2300 GMT] and he wanted to prevent the  opposition from filibustering the bill. It was therefore  decided to initial the agreement first, and wait for Rabin's  return home for the full signing, since by then the institutions  of both parties will have approved it. This is what Prime  Minister Rabin had to say after signing the accord.    [Begin Rabin recording] I am happy that we agreed on a  framework for a coalition agreement with SHAS. We initialed it  tonight because it will go into effect only following two more  stages. The first stage is approval by Labor institutions and  SHAS Rabbi 'Ovadya Yosef -- as long as they have not approved  the document, it is an initialed framework -- and after that it  will be presented for Knesset approval. [end recording]    At the signing ceremony, SHAS leader Arye Der'i hoped that  the coalition would continue to expand. Any faction interested  in joining the coalition is welcome, he said.    The coalition accord states that the agreement and  appendices  signed between the two parties in 1992, on the eve of the  government's establishment, would continue to be valid, except  for the amendments to the basic law. It also stipulates that  SHAS will receive the Religious Affairs Ministry and the  Interior Ministry, portfolios although it is still not clear  whether they will have one minister or two. SHAS has also been  promised two deputy ministers, which also has to be decided  between the prime minister and Der'i.</p>

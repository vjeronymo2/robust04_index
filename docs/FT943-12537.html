			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / CBI survey fuels 'short-termism' debate As the Confederation of British Industry's investment appraisal survey comes out today, the main topic engaging the analysts is how far it might explain the elusive nature of UK business investment. For the evidence that many companies are setting high hurdles - minimum rates of return - for investment projects has given new statistical input to the debate about the alleged 'short-termism' of UK businesses. On one side of the debate stands Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, who has repeatedly criticised businesses in recent months for failing to adjust to low inflation. By demanding high rates of return on investment, the argument goes, businesses are fuelling inflationary expectations and stifling viable investment projects. On the other side of the line, however, stand many City analysts and businesspeople. They argue not only that companies are right to be cautious about inflation in light of past events, but that inflation expectations are not the only factor holding back business investment. Mr Kevin Gardiner, economist at US investment bank Morgan Stanley, said: 'These concerns do not reflect business realities. High hurdles are the most economic way of weeding out weak projects.' The debate has taken on particular urgency, given that investment is lagging behind other parts of the recovery. The CBI's previous industrial trends survey, in April, suggested investment would rise only modestly this year, and its next quarterly report, issued tomorrow, is not expected to change this scenario significantly. Today's survey is unlikely to settle the debate either way, not least because it suggests that companies employ a hotch-potch of methods for appraising investment. Of the 438 companies surveyed, about 90 per cent were found to use quantitative ways to evaluate investment, based on three main methods. The most popular was the 'pay-back' method, which assesses a project in terms of how soon a company can recoup its investment. However, a significant proportion, particularly among the larger companies, used more sophisticated calculations based on nominal and real 'rates of return' and 'cashflow', often in combination. Of those which used the pay-back method, only 14 per cent used a pay-back period of five years or more. Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, recently announced it was lengthening its pay-back period by two years in light of low inflation. In spite of this, two-thirds of companies have not adjusted their pay-back period to the new conditions, the survey found. Among those companies using rates of return, the picture was more mixed. About two-fifths of those using nominal rates of return said their hurdle rate was above 20 per cent. Surprisingly, a similar proportion of those using real rates also employed a 20 per cent hurdle. Meanwhile, only a third of investors using real rates of return said their hurdle rate was 8 per cent to 11 per cent, while 28 per cent using nominal rates said they used hurdles of 11 per cent or less. However, only a third of the companies using nominal rates based these on explicit inflation forecasts - for which the average was an annual rate of 5 per cent. But other factors such as profit growth, risk and the opportunity cost of capital also affected nominal hurdle rates. Significantly, interest rate expectations were considered less important. The Bank of England and the Treasury's own verdict from these findings is, unsurprisingly, that companies need to adjust to the new environment. The Treasury said: 'Ministers have made clear their determination to deliver the government's inflation target, and if companies assume higher inflation they will miss out on construction and investment opportunities.' Yet Professor Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at London Business School, suggested that the finding that most companies calculated rates of return on a pre-tax basis might paint an excessively negative picture. A pre-tax rate of return of 20 per cent, for example, might correspond to a post-tax hurdle of only 13 per cent, he said. He added: 'One reason for these high hurdles may be that businesses simply do not have a lot of investment projects.'</p>

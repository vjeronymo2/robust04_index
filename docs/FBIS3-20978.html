Other  German companies are exhibiting alongside Siemens: only by way  of innovations in the "high-tech" technologies can the crisis be  overcome with invigoration. Several items in the area of  electronics manufacture which demonstrate this are displayed at  the 9-13 Nov 1993 PRODUCTRONICA Exhibition in Munich, but is  this enough?    Since 1990 have Siemens and IBM been working in expectation  of this day. As to the public response to their success,  managers and developers have indeed been more than disappointed.  Hardly anyone seemed to take notice when at the end of September  the first in the world 64 Mbit chip was shown. The newspaper  BERLINER ZEITUNG found this event to be worthy of only three  full lines in the WIRTSCHAFT (Economy) Section.    Some samples had already been previously distributed among  select customers. The size of a single chip is 10.7x18.1  mm[.sup]2[/]. The finest DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory)  structures, only 0.35 m wide, had been produced by the  photolithographic process in far-ultraviolet light.    Because of the most readily achievable symmetric and regular  DRAM structure, production of this type of memory is so  important to a semiconductor manufacturer that methods of  producing ever finer such structures are being explored and  developed for such memories. This type of memory is, in effect,  the stimulator of technological innovations in microelectronics.    With this chip, a German enterprise has finally knocked the  Japanese and the North Americans hard in the key technology  dominated by them. What the significance of this success will be  in the long run remains to be seen. Meanwhile, a 256 Mbit chip  is already being worked on by Siemens together with IBM and  Toshiba.    This example indicates that there are some German  enterprises  which do not participate in general wailing about the recession  but rather channel their strengths toward a leading position in  the field of electronics. They are pursuing their chances  particularly in specialty sectors of the market.    In electronics processing technology and production  facilities, strongly emphasized at the PRODUCTRONICA, overseas  competition is certainly still ahead. But even overseas  innovations have helped German enterprises find a few niches. An  example is the new LA 440 S sputtering apparatus, a joint  development by the Von Ardenne Anlagentechnik (Equipment  Engineering) Ltd in Dresden and the Balzers Hochvakuum (High  Vacuum) Ltd in Wiesbaden. This apparatus facilitates deposition  of thin films on wafers. It can be easily re-equipped to suit  most diverse technological processes and sputtering methods,  which is ideal for research and development. It demonstrates a  high potential for electronics and machine manufacture in West  and East Germany.    Another example is the Karl Kuess Ltd in Garching, worldwide  leader in manufacture of x-ray stepper drives. They are used for  x-ray lithography, a method of most highly integrated microchip  structurization. This company has found a market in the U.S.A.,  since hardly any x-ray lithography is being done in Europe.    Recently Jenoptik is competing with its x-ray lithographic  equipment against Karl Kuess in that overseas market. Its new  X-Ray Scanner has attracted worldwide attention of professionals  in this field.    Germany is also strong in communications engineering:  Siemens, still the world master of innovations, has cropped a  winner with its ATM (Asynchron Transfer Modus). This is a  multiplexing and exchange system for the future broad-band  telephone network. While synthesizing and standardizing this  system, Siemens has simultaneously developed the now classical  technology based on use of ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrated  Circuits); just as it did for the GSM mobile radio system and  for the cordless telephone in the DECT Standard.    New developments are budding even in East Germany, where the  electronic industry sector quickly collapsed after having been  previously subsidized while cut off from the international  market. A scientific and technical potential is still to be  found here: LSI Logik in Erfurt, VLSI Technologie in Dresden,  Elektronikwerkstoffe (Electronic Materials) Ltd in Freiberg,  Jenoptik in Jena, and many smaller candidates for niche  positions in the market are vying for them.    In Soemmerda (Thuringia), where once the Robotron combine  was  manufacturing office machines, Germany's most modern computer  factory is now in place and production has resumed beginning  last October. In this new plant the ASI Computer Ltd will employ  about 600 workers and produce at least 300,000 personal  computers annually, which will make this enterprise Europe's  largest PC producer. By manufacturing them in Germany,  management hopes to respond faster to a fluctuating market  demand and to thus extract pricing advantages better than is  possible with imports from the Far East.    Take the Electronic Materials Ltd in Freiberg, the sole  manufacturer of GaAs single crystals in Europe. After the West  German previous manufacturer Wacker had closed shop, the  Freiberg company was able to take over its European customers  despite a few initial difficulties.    However, top-notch German electronic specialists are rather  an exception: "There are no white elephants among the electronic  companies" deplores Tom Sommerlatte. At the end of last October  the Arthur D. Little consulting team had concluded its  investigation of German companies. The objective was to identify  those which had in the past three years, despite crisis and  recession, realized above average output and profit gains. The  list includes quite a few well managed medium-size industries,  but no electronic companies.    By the way, Sommerlatte has nothing particularly good to say  about the German economy anyhow. The enterprises, he claims, are  far too frozen into their old business molds and originate very  little innovation.    The Federal Republic is a land deficient in raw materials,  which the Research Minister Paul Krueger is quite aware of.  Therefore, it can retain its position as a leading industrial  country only by top performance technologically and not being  last in the field of electronics. Its only chance is investment  in intelligence and creativity.    Jens Uwe Fuhrmann of the Bavarian VDMA [Verein fuer  Deutschen  Maschinenbau und Anlagenbau = German Machinery and Equipment  Construction Society] agrees with the Research Minister on this  point. But on the foreground of PRODUCTRONICA '93 he has also  accused the intolerable power wrangle in Bonn of being  responsible for the fact that future-oriented decisions made  regarding Germany's research and industrial status are  exceptions rather than the rule.    "Discussion about the status, though certainly needed, are  missing the main point" believes Dr. Ekkehard Suess, chairman of  the Productronic technical group within the VDMA. He demands  more recognition for technical science, because it is the source  of prosperity and jobs. "It is even helpful in protecting the  environment" he said when addressing the PRODUCTRONICA '93 in  Munich.    In the long run, Doctor Suess warns, "Germany will not be  able to keep up with the international competition if chip  production is left more or less to the Siemens company alone."  For this key product line competition in Japan, Korea, Taiwan,  and now also in China is being backed by the "entire government  machinery." Poor Germany!    Industrial manager Suess calls it outright pure nonsense  that  ensuring and promoting microelectronics production be entrusted  to the Ministry of Research, already burdened by shortage of  funds, instead of also involving the Ministry of Economy. As far  as the Research Minister Paul Krueger is concerned, Ekkerhard  Suess crashes open doors. The minister wants to focus his policy  on "the new technologies which have good chances both  economically and technically" so that the results of research  can be faster converted into competitive products and processes.  A top product line under consideration for the next ten years is  electronics.    In order to push this through, Paul Krueger had formed a  strategizing team which held its first meeting last September.  Its task is to set in motion the needed dialog between  scientists, economists, and politicians. Members of this team  include Hubert Markl (former president of the German Research  Society), Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker (director of the GenCenter),  Heinrich von Pierer (on Siemens board of director), Edzard  Reuter (on the Daimler-Benz board of directors), and Lothar  Spaeth (business manager of Jenoptik). Krueger's model is  Japan's innovation model. Eventually he will also bring about a  general consensus in Germany.    The BMFT (Federal Ministry of Research and Technology) has  just pushed through a project involving effective division of  tasks between the Government and economic management, namely  promotion of the Laser 2000 concept. As a part of this project  there have been set up and are being tracked five sub-projects,  with diverse objectives ranging from heavy-duty diode lasers to  medical instruments.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (33): Michael Milken - monster or media myth? / A book that attempts to get inside the mind of the junk bond king DANGEROUS DREAMERS by Robert Sobel John Wiley &amp; Sons Dollars 27.95 247 pages TEN YEARS from now Michael Milken, whose junk bond takeovers were the scourge of US corporations in the 1980s, may be forgotten. Even today, as he languishes in prison, after being convicted on some fairly minor technical counts, the public is only vaguely aware of what he actually did. With his enormous pay from Drexel Burnham Lambert, which in 1987 alone amounted to Dollars 550m, he has simply come to epitomise in many people's minds what was wrong with the greed decade of the 1980s. In this book, Robert Sobel explores the Milken phenomenon. At one level it is a lucid and entertaining read about Milken's life and the colourful characters such as T. Boone Pickens, with whom he became involved. Sobel is good at explaining, in a not too technical way, how junk bond financing worked, why it became popular and how the likes of Pickens and Carl Icahn were able to enrich themselves by applying it to takeovers. At another level Sobel tries to discover what makes men like Milken tick. He points out that Milken was not an isolated example of an outsider who has come to challenge the financial establishment. Men like Louis Wolfson and Jimmy Ling, who made LTV into the one of the first conglomerates, have risen to prominence only to be broken by an establishment they had come to threaten. A common thread is that they seem to be clever outsiders with an obsessive approach to work. Milken himself was no academic genius, but he well understood the role that debt could play in a company's expansion. When he moved his family and his Drexel operation back to California in 1978, he relished the opportunity to come to work at 4.00am, two hours before New York opened. But the arrangement also gave him more opportunity to spend time with his children and he gave heavily from what he earned to charity. The 1980s were an age well-suited to junk bonds. Interest rate deregulation meant savings and loans were looking for higher yield assets, for example, while corporate taxation rules favoured debt over equity. In that sense Milken was simply a product of his age. For all that, he remains something of an enigma. The authorities never managed to prove the worst charges against him, and the extent to which short cuts were taken and favours bestowed on clients to secure Drexel's extraordinary placing power remains obscure. Likewise the predators of the 1980s had a point when they said they were picking on companies that had failed to realise shareholder value. In his attempt to be impartial and explain, Sobel is perhaps too reluctant to judge. There is no doubt that leveraged takeovers did a great deal of harm. In the final analysis this was because the extra value that the predators purported to bring was not real value at all. Had he taken a more robust line, Sobel's conclusions might have been different. Instead he suggests at the end of the book that, without the indictment, Milken might have gone on to become a figure of global importance, 'the greatest banker of the age.' Possibly, yes. But then again, given the fundamentally anti-social nature of his approach, probably not.</p>

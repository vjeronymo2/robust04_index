			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Pillar Property flotation rests on expectations being realised - The future over the past as 1980s developers assume the reins Pillar Property Investment, which issued its pathfinder prospectus yesterday, is at an important crossroads which will inevitably colour perceptions of its offer of up to Pounds 90m of shares. Set up as a vulture fund to prey on institutional quality properties in the collapsing market of 1991, it has built up a Pounds 352m investment portfolio, under the guidance of Mr Robert Maxted, formerly a director of Speyhawk, the collapsed property developer. However, the company has taken on board two of the better-known developers of the 1980s, Mr Raymond Mould and Mr Patrick Vaughan, and the story of Pillar is now more about the future than the present. The success of the flotation will depend on expectations that these two men  -founders of the enormously successful Arlington Securities property business - can deliver returns a second time. Backers of Arlington should have fond memories of the Pounds 278m buy-out by British Aerospace in 1989, but the new vehicle is very different. When Pillar was set up, with the backing of British Aerospace, General Electric of the US and Electra, it had detailed and demanding criteria for investment in high grade property. At present, 64 per cent of its properties are let to either FT-SE 100 companies or government bodies, and there is an average unexpired lease length of 22 years. More surprisingly, the company estimates that 85 per cent of its leases are now at, or below, current market prices, indicating rental growth from the anticipated upswing. Pillar estimates that income from existing leases, even if none could be renewed or increased, would exceed current interest and administration costs until 2010. The company is raising up to Pounds 50m in new money from the flotation  - the additional shares will come from leading shareholders GE and Electra while management will retain their 11 per cent stake. Debt will fall to Pounds 166.6m, with gearing reduced from 168 per cent to 92 per cent, improving interest cover from its Pounds 25.2m rent roll. This provides an attractive, but not unique, investment base, and investor interest will focus on the direction under Mr Mould and Mr Vaughan. Their previous achievements has already won them one significant coup, the tying up of a joint venture agreement with Canadian investment group Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec. The joint venture plans to invest up to Pounds 240m on shopping centres, which will add to the 41 per cent of Pillar's portfolio that is already retail. The fact that the Canadians chose Pillar, when they could have picked almost any partner, demonstrates confidence that the Arlington business park skills are transferable. The pricing is due to be announced on July 28. The company is expected to have a market capitalisation of about Pounds 175m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Teleconference by President Fidel Ramos with journalists in </F> Davao, Cebu, Baguio, and Bacolod and panelists in the PTV-4  television studio, moderated by Ricardo Puno at the PTV-4 studio  in Quezon City -- live; passages in italics in Tagalog]    [Excerpts] [Godofredo Roperos, SUN STAR DAILY, in Cebu  City] Mr. President: President Clinton has just lifted the  economic embargo on Vietnam. The floodgates for investors to go  to Vietnam is now wide open. Don't you think that this will  affect the Philippines' potential for investment in our part of  the globe?    [Ramos] You know, within three hours of our hearing of the  lifting by President Clinton of the trade embargo in Vietnam, I  issued a statement -- which already has been published in our  newspapers, and that should already be there in Cebu by now  because that was last week -- supporting the lifting of the  trade embargo because in the overall, our assessment -- my  assessment -- is that the opening up of trade all over the world  -- especially here in Asia and the Pacific; our region -- will  lead to advantages to the Philippines also. And we need not be  panicked again by a possible competitor on the part of Vietnam  in regard to the capturing of investments as well as the sale to  the world market of similar products.    As far as I'm concerned, there could be some complimentarity  between the Philippines and Vietnam. We can even be partners  with each other to put out cheaper and high quality goods, even  if our raw materials are about the same. We can also help  Vietnam, as we have helped them in the deepest moments of their  crisis since the middle 60's. We have good rapport with the  people of Vietnam, and now even the government of Vietnam. We  can help them in certain types of expertise because of our  higher level of technical experience.    But I think most of all we should look at the advantages  inherent in the Philippines itself. Labor costs are higher here  than Vietnam, but I say that we are more strategically located  in terms of Asia and the Pacific. We're the gateway here, with  access both to the mainland of Asia as well as the Pacific rim  of North America. We're also, I would say, better -- much better  -- in communications. We don't need an interpreter in the  Philippines to do international business in the Philippines.  [passage omitted]    [Angelo Abarico, in Davao City] Mr. President: Prime  Minister Mahathir of Malaysia was here last Sunday and he spoke  about the need for intensifying trade among ASEAN members and  spoke about AFTA, which is the Asean Free Trade Area. Today,  Ambassador Negroponte of the U.S. Embassy in Manila was here in  Davao and he also spoke about the need for more trade and less  aid to this country. In fact, he said that the United States  Government is phasing out aid to foreign recipients. He also  spoke about the NAFTA, or the North American Free Trade Area.    Mr. President, are we prepared to take advantage if there  are  any advantages in the AFTA? And are we prepared also for the  possible adverse effects that might come through NAFTA?    [Ramos] [passage omitted] AFTA itself as a program was  launched 1 January 1993 -- during my time -- as a result of that  summit decision. So we are into it. What it envisions over the  next 15 years after 1993 is a gradual reduction of tariffs  within our six countries in ASEAN, so that at the end there is  nothing bigger than a 5 percent tariff. Now, in between are  milestones that we must achieve also, meaning we lessen the  number of items which are to be benefited by protective tariff.  At the same time, we reduce the rate of tariffs. In general,  that is what is the agreement in AFTA.    With NAFTA, I have said that there are  complimentarities in NAFTA and AFTA. It is not necessarily one  against the other, or they are not necessarily mutually  exclusive. Although in two areas... [pauses] You people  in Bacolod, listen to this. Regarding sugar, that might be  threatened. Garments might also be threatened, because these  are Mexican products, and it is easy to bring them into the  United States. Under a NAFTA situation, there could be  lowering of tariffs also, and so their products -- coming from  Mexico for sugar and garments -- might be more competitive than  ours. But so far, we have been assured by the U.S. Government  that Philippine sugar and garment products will not be  jeopardized. In fact, the quota for garments has  been increased as between the Philippines and the United  States, and we're seeing this as a very good opportunity for  expanding exports in garments to the United States.    During the APEC meeting in Seattle last November, I  emphasized that since we are in the middle of it -- we have both  AFTA and NAFTA historical connections -- we should try to look  for the complimentarities between the two systems. Meaning  our garments have an advantage, because it is not  necessarily true that just because Mexico is nearby, that they  can produce products needed in the United States better than  those of us in the Philippines. That is not necessarily true.  So let's look for our comparative advantage, even if there is  NAFTA. Then let's press on that because we have also this  advantage of proximity if we are looking at the Pacific states  of the United States and even Canada itself. [passage omitted]    [Hector Villanueva, MANILA CHRONICLE, in the PTV-4 studio]  What are the most urgent reforms or legislations are you  pursuing now?    [Ramos] Well, I told you Chito that out of that  legislative- executive minisummit, or caucus, we came up with  about 15 agreed key priority, urgent legislative proposals.  Now, when we discussed this with the people in the  multisectoral survey, or summit, this ballooned to about 93  executive-legislative proposals. But we have refined that since  then, and this was done as a result of the agreement to cease  fire the unicameral issue, about three weeks ago.    Before they resume their sessions on 24 January, and the 15  top bills, if I remember, are: Amendments to the BOT  [build-operate- transfer] law -- this is now being done in the  Senate under Senator Arroyo; the liberalization of the banking  system; the amendments to the Foreign Investments Act, FIA; the  so-called higher education bill; the dual education and training  system, meaning private sector must come in to help in the  transfer of science and technology to our young people;  refinements to the VAT [value added tax]; the improvement of our  geothermal exploration effort, because certain incentives will  be added there; the upgrading of science and technology in our  country; and then there is that body of laws, resolutions,  ratifications, related to the Uruguay round of GATT so that the  Philippines can accede to the forthcoming world trade  organization; and then there is a set of bills on population  stabilization.    Now, it is not all tax measures, but some of them are  revenue  enhancement in terms of organization, policy, computerization,  etc., and I think they agreed on this being the calendar for the  next several weeks in both houses in Congress. [passage omitted]    I am very confident that our economy is on the verge of  take-off. In 1993, the economy performed very well in spite of  the fact that we achieved targets not as high as our neighbors.  We are also enjoying unprecedented stability as well as social  cohesion. If we use as a base the fine cooperation  between the executive and the legislative, that is something in  our favor.    We are also seeing now a greater appreciation of our  neighbors around us of the value and the worth of the  Philippines as an investment, tourism, and trade destination.  The result is the influx of investors and visits by high  government officials and just plain tourists. One of the  fruits of our making visits abroad last year are the return  visits of our colleagues in government, and they always bring  with them large trade and investment delegations, like  last week, when Prime Minister Mahathir came here, and  yesterday, very quickly, President Li of Taiwan, and there  will be some more coming as scheduled.

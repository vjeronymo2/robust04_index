			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Jinghuai (0491 2417 2037) and Zeng Mingzi (2581 2494 </F> 1311): "Rights, Interests, and Dignity Brook No Infringement--  Worries About Protection in `Foreign-invested' Enterprises  (Second and Last Part)"]    [Text] The serious problem of infringing the rights and  interests of employees in foreign-invested enterprises has  caused a sharp contradiction between the enterprises' "bosses"  and the "employees." In some cases, it has caused serious  consequences in the economic, social, and other aspects of  endeavor. We must pay close attention to the problem.  <H5>  Where Does the Root of the Problem Lie? </H5>   The cases of infringing the rights and interests of  employees  in foreign-invested enterprises are emerging one after another.  In the final analysis, where does the root of the matter lie?  Our survey shows that there are both institutional defects and  manmade factors behind the problem.    First, in examining and approving foreign-invested  enterprises, the "green light" is being given at random.  According to the stipulations of China's labor laws and  regulations, when carrying out production projects, an  enterprise is required to report to the labor and public health  departments, and the trade union organization, for a joint  examination and approval so that safety and health facilities  and the principal parts of the projects are designed,  constructed, and put into operation simultaneously. This is  called the principle of "undertaking three things  simultaneously." However, to accelerate the absorption of  foreign capital some local governments and departments, taking a  one-sided approach toward the building of investment environment  and worried that setting strict demands on safety and health  would frighten away foreign investors, would lopsidedly stress  simplifying the examination and approval procedures of projects  and give "the green light" to the projects at random.  Consequently, labor protection for the enterprises' employees  and fire prevention facilities were "simplified" to almost  nothing; the soundness of safety and health work was not  ensured; and foreign-invested enterprises suffered an inherent  shortage in such areas as labor, safety, and health.    Some enterprises engaged in "processing with supplied  materials or samples, assembling with supplied parts, and  compensation trade" with simple and crude equipment, backward  technology and management, poor protection facilities, and even  without any protection facilities, started their operations  hastily. Therefore, once problems cropped up, it was already  too late for them to remedy and they could neither stop  production nor close down even if they wished to, thus causing  great problems for the management.    Second, labor laws and regulations are imperfect. China's  existing labor protection laws and regulations were enacted  mostly for domestic enterprises. The "Regulations Concerning  Labor Protection" ["Regulations"], currently in force, were  enacted in 1951 and revised in 1953. They were the outcome of  the planned economic structure. As enterprises have become  market-oriented, some of the contents of the "Regulations" have  not kept abreast of the changing situation. Nevertheless,  township and town enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises  have been implementing the "Regulations" in terms of labor  protection, thus making labor protection legislation even more  imperfect and undefined.    China has promulgated the "PRC Law on Foreign-Funded  Enterprises," the "PRC Law on Cooperative Ventures," and the  "PRC Law on Joint Ventures Using Chinese and Foreign  Investment," three special laws applicable to foreign-invested  enterprises but they all lack specific stipulations on labor  protection, safety, and health work in foreign-invested  enterprises. Therefore, some foreign- invested enterprises, in  particular fully foreign-owned enterprises, when availing  themselves of legal loopholes, were not abiding by China's laws  and the "Regulations" concerning enterprise labor protection and  health work other than those in the three laws mentioned above.  By availing themselves of the loopholes whereby in China there  are no stipulations on minimum wage and maximum working hours,  some foreign businessmen deliberately prolonged working hours  and deducted part of the pay of the Chinese employees.    Third, government management and labor supervision are not  effective. All enterprises which are set up in China, including  foreign-invested enterprises, must strictly abide by China's  laws. However, when the employees of some foreign-invested  enterprises lodged complaints or took action to share legitimate  rights and interests, some government officials one-sidedly  stressed absorption of foreign capital and let the bosses of the  foreign side have the final say on everything, thus giving  unprincipled protection to the foreign side in foreign-invested  enterprises for their failure to abide by labor laws and  statutes. Some local governments went so far as to call out  police to arrest the so-called "troublemakers' at the request of  foreign businessmen and forcibly resolved labor- capital  disputes. Moreover, labor departments in many localities have  not yet established labor supervision institutions. Even though  such institutions have been established in some localities, they  find it difficult to effectively supervise the labor management  of foreign-invested enterprises as there are no laws to follow.    Fourth, trade union organizations are not well formed and  they are weak and flabby. The trade union undoubtedly plays an  important role in safeguarding the employees' rights and  interests. In foreign countries, the enterprise trade union is  also very powerful. In China, there are trade union  organizations in all state-owned and collective enterprises  through which workers can exercise their rights as masters of  the enterprises and effectively inspect and supervise their  enterprises' safety in production and their employees' rights  and interests. However, in many foreign-invested enterprises,  there are no trade unions at all. Our survey shows that in  1992, of Jilin Province's 76 foreign-invested enterprises, only  10 percent had trade unions and, in Qingdao City, less than 30  percent of the enterprises under operation had trade unions.  Even where there were trade union organizations, more often  than not they were looked after by the departments concerned,  with their strength repeatedly weakened and their activities  restricted. As a result, they could not bring their proper  supervisory role into full play.    Fifth, the sense of legal system of some employees in  foreign-invested enterprises' is becoming blunted and the  quality of employees is low as a whole. In October 1993, in a  certain locality during his inspection tour of his factory, a  foreign businessman saw several young female workers chatting.  He quickly rushed up to the worker who was speaking and slapped  her face without saying anything. After the event, somebody  told the boss that the factory was having the machines  overhauled that day and the workers need not have come to work  but the female workers were staying in the factory to see if  they could offer any help. The next day, the foreign  businessman called the slapped worker to his office, gave her an  envelope, and let her go, also without saying anything. The  worker opened the envelop and found 400 yuan in it and she was  inwardly pleased. Instead of being roused to righteous  indignation against the foreign businessman, the other female  workers admired the slapped worker thinking that she had gained  an extra advantage. Does this not show that the quality of some  employees in foreign- invested enterprise is too low?  <H5>  What Role Should the Government Play? </H5>   The government is duty-bound to safeguard the legitimate  rights and interests of employees in foreign-invested  enterprises employees. In the final analysis, what role should  the government play?    According to international practice, in handling  employee-employer relations, the "three-party principle" should  be followed. Put another way, the trade union acts on behalf of  the employee and holds talks with the employer on the contents  of employee-employer relations, labor interests, and enterprise  interests, and the government plays the role of coordinator, its  task being to supervise and rectify the behavior of the employee  and the employer and protect both sides' legitimate rights and  interests.    China has it own national conditions. The CPC leadership and  the socialist system have guaranteed themselves the "three-party  principle" and enabled the three parties to cooperate with one  another. The problem now is that China's labor supervision has  just begun; the relationship between supervision and  rectification of the behavior of the employee and the employer  has not yet been harmonized; there is a gap between the  conceptions of some leaders and the legal system and they still  cannot coordinate the two sides in a just and reasonable way,  even showing excessive partiality to the foreign investors.    When the department concerned investigated the boss of a  Taiwan- funded enterprise who traded foreign exchange in large  quantities at a profit or illegally, a provincial leader urged  the department not to do so instead of supporting their action.  When the enterprise's Chinese manager reported to the  department that the Taiwan businessman was importing shoddy car  safety belts, engaging in the illegal procurement of foreign  exchange, and evading customs duties and the manager had  disputed this with the businessman, the leader gave a written  instruction on the report submitted to him by the department,  ordering the "arrest" of the manager and calling this act by the  fine-sounding name of "improving the investment environment."  Was this action not too excessive?    The government is now changing its functions in line with  the  requirements of the market economy. As far as foreign-invested  enterprises are concerned, the government should genuinely  coordinate its labor supervision; safeguard the relations,  rights, and interests of the employee and employer; and act as a  fair-minded "judge" and "law-enforcement officer."    Labor supervision should be carried out simultaneously  regarding the employee and the employer. However, the current  outstanding problems with foreign-invested enterprises, such as  confusion in the relations between the employee and the employer  and poor safety facilities and labor hygiene conditions, have  repeatedly infringed upon the employees' rights and interests.  This being the case, at present, attention should be paid to  correcting the erroneous enterprise actions and promptly  discover and handle the enterprises' violations of China's labor  laws and "Regulations." When it comes to the inspection of  labor recruitment in foreign-invested enterprises, it is  necessary to: Inspect and supervise the signing of labor  contracts between the enterprises and workers, examine and  certify their labor contracts according to law, and put an end  to the use of contracts based on factory "Regulations";  strengthen supervision over wages, working hours, social labor  insurance, and employees' welfare in foreign-invested  enterprises; and necessary to improve their working environment,  supervise their working conditions, prevent safety incidents  from endangering the employees, and ensure the safety of  workers' lives and their health.    Some people worry that this will frighten away foreign  businessmen. A person in charge of the newly established  department of labor relations and supervision under the Ministry  of Labor said: "In operating enterprises in China, foreign  businessmen must abide by China's labor laws and "Regulations."  This is common sense. Carrying out labor supervision is an  international practice which foreign businessmen can also  understand. What most worries them is the absence of  corresponding laws or imperfect laws. Therefore, strengthening  labor legislation and carrying out supervisory activities  according to law is precisely conducive to the creation of a  sound legal environment for foreign investment.   <H3>    Trade Union--There Must be No Blank Space in  Foreign-Invested Enterprises </H3>   The special role of the trade union cannot be replaced by  any  individuals or organizations. This is particularly the case  with foreign-invested enterprises. According to the survey of  foreign- invested enterprises, people, be they enterprise  workers, government officials, or far-sighted enterprise bosses,  have increasingly realized the deep importance of trade union  organizations. Making speedy preparations for the setting up of  trade unions has become the consensus of more and more people.    The trade union is, in fact, not the invention of socialist  countries. However, the role of the Chinese trade union as a  bridge is unique.    There is no denying that some foreign bosses do not  understand the nature, tasks, and work characteristics of the  Chinese trade union, and many bosses of foreign-invested  enterprises believe that: The main duty of the trade union is to  represent staffers and workers to fight the bosses for better  pay rather than organize the workers to strike. Therefore, they  try every possible means to restrict trade-union activities and  prohibit contacts among workers. They just let trade unions do  such things as "beating drums, blowing trumpets, playing  guitars, singing songs, playing ball games, and taking photos."  Most enterprises are even afraid of organizing trade unions and  find a variety of excuses to refuse to set them up. These bosses  of foreign-invested enterprises have not genuinely realized the  special role of the trade union as an "intermediary."    At an interview with reporters, Teng Yilong, vice president  of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions said: The guiding  ideology of the trade unions in foreign-funded enterprises is  very clear, that is, safeguarding the employees' legitimate  rights and interests, cooperating and working together with the  investors, and serving the employees, the promotion of reform  and opening up to the outside world, and economic construction.  The trade union will firmly support the foreign-invested  enterprises's legal operations on the condition of not  infringing upon the interests of the state and the broad masses  of employees. No one, no matter what he is, is allowed to act  by transcending the law.    In foreign-invested enterprises, the characteristics of the  Chinese trade union determine that it has natural and  inseparable ties with the masses of employees. First, it can  teach the employees to abide by laws and observe discipline, at  all times and everywhere, implement the enterprise leadership's  decisions by appropriate means, or remove misunderstandings and  mediate disputes when they occur between the employee and the  employer. Second, as the spokesman for the employees, it can  promptly report their wishes, demands, suggestions, and even  dissatisfactions to the employer and supervise and urge the  employer to abide by China's laws and protect the Chinese  workers' legitimate rights and interests. In the development of  foreign-invested enterprises in China in the last dozens of  years, there is no lack of successful cases in this regard. In  promoting earnest talks between the employees and the boss, the  trade union organization in the Baowei Company in Beijing acted  as the representative of the employees, thus enabling the  foreign management personnel to have the opportunity for direct  dialogue with the Chinese employees. The foreign management  personnel issued circulars on a regular basis, informing the  employees of the company's production and operations and the  measures to be taken. The Chinese employees could express their  opinions, demands, and suggestions directly to the company's  management. Thanks to the mutual understanding and  communication between labor and management, the company's  economic efficiency shot up and its workers' pay and benefits  continuously improved. Practice has shown that the relations  between the employee and the employer in foreign-invested  enterprises where trade unions are set up are relatively  harmonious and many conflicts can be solved in the embryonic  state. On the contrary, the contradiction between the employee  and the employer is easy to intensify. In 1993, strikes  occurred in more than 100 foreign-invested enterprises, of which  90 percent were enterprises where trade union organizations did  not play the role of mediator. After having seen the role of  the trade union, a Japanese boss who was previously biased  against the trade union said emotionally: "Foreign-invested  enterprises cannot afford not to have any trade unions."    According to the stipulations in China's laws, all  enterprises in the Chinese territory must organize trade unions.  The 12th Congress of Trade Unions, which ended last year, also  demanded: All enterprises which have started operation must  organize trade unions according to law as soon as possible and  newly established enterprises must make simultaneous  preparations for the setting up of their trade unions. For  foreign-invested enterprise to achieve a greater expansion in  China, they must act according to law and also organize trade  unions according to law.  <H3>  Labor Laws and "Regulations" Must Be Perfected As Quickly As  Possible </H3>   The market economy is based on the legal system. In the  process of China shifting to the market economy,  foreign-invested enterprises must, all the more, be among the  first in the legal system building. Only when the rights and  interests of foreign- invested enterprises's employees are  protected by relying on laws can they develop on a sound and  orderly track.    While conducting this survey, these reporters were informed  that: Of the total number of foreign-invested enterprises, 10  percent have "sacked" their own bosses and this has become an  upward trend. In 1992, a certain joint-venture enterprise in  Zhuhai recruited a number of female workers from Jiangsu.  Because they could not bear the excessive overtime and the  delays in and embezzlement of wage payments, 99 percent of the  workers either changed jobs or returned home within four months.  People of insight believe: Only when foreign-invested  enterprises act in strict accordance with the law and establish  proper relations between the employee and the employer according  to law can they and their employees benefit therefrom. A sound  legal system is the only way for the healthy development of  foreign-invested enterprises.    China still has a lot of work to do in this regard. On the  one hand, it is necessary to speed up the pace of central  legislation and the enactment of two major laws on state labor  protection--the "Labor Law" and the "Law on Prevention and Cure  of Occupational Diseases" and bring the labor protection of  foreign-invested enterprises into the system of state  legislation on labor protection as soon as possible, so that  barriers between departments and regions at different levels  will be removed and the unsound and uncoordinated state of  legislation will be put to an end; there will be laws for  foreign-invested enterprises to abide by in areas such as worker  recruitment, wages, social insurance, labor protection, and  professional sanitation, and a sound and harmonious labor  relationship will be established. The bosses of  foreign-invested enterprises must realize that as they do in  other countries, they must take the path of legal system and  manage their enterprises and safeguard their employees' rights  and interests according to law.    On the other hand, it is necessary to expedite local  legislation. Before the state's basic law on labor is  promulgated, localities must make full use of their right to  make laws, speed up the pace of legislation, and step up their  efforts to enact and improve their own "Regulations" on labor  protection in foreign-invested enterprises. Those localities  which have not yet enacted any "Regulations" concerning the  management of foreign-invested enterprises must speed up the  pace of legislation in the light of their own conditions and by  using the experiences of the localities which already have their  own "Regulations" in this regard for reference.    The enactment of a law is just half of the process of social  development according to law. To complete the other half of the  task, it is necessary to enforce the law strictly. After the  enactment of a law, the government law-enforcement departments,  particularly the labor supervision departments, must enforce the  law strictly, the bosses and employees of foreign-invested  enterprises must observe discipline and abide by the laws, and  the trade union must bring its role into play. On the other  hand, at present, while the legal system is imperfect, the  departments concerned must make use of the current central and  local relevant laws and "Regulations" in accordance with the  "three conducives [san ge you li 0005 0020 2589 0448]"  principle, use the successful experiences of foreign enterprises  as reference, and strengthen the inspection and supervision of  the labor protection, safety, health, and welfare in  foreign-invested enterprises. When examining and approving  foreign-invested enterprises, it is necessary to strictly  implement the examination and acceptance procedures of  "undertaking three things simultaneously." If we discover any  hidden accidents and job- related harmful things, we must boldly  track, supervise, and correct them within a given time. We must  deal with foreign-invested enterprises which cause serious  injuries and death by using ideological education and economic  and legal sanctions, investigate and hold those who violate the  criminal law responsible for their crimes, and on no account  must we be overly lenient toward their crimes and let them go  unchecked. When discussing this issue, Zhu Jianzhen, vice  minister of labor in charge of labor supervision work, stressed:  Although the labor supervision department of the Chinese  Government has just started its work, it will strictly enforce  labor laws and "Regulations" and thus safeguard the legitimate  rights and interests of both foreign-invested enterprises and  their employees according to law.    In addition, it is necessary to concentrate efforts on  better  propaganda and education work and let foreign, Hong Kong, Macao,  and Taiwan investors and the Chinese personnel in  foreign-invested enterprises realize that the Chinese laws and  "Regulations" should not be trampled upon. Multiple forms  should be adopted to give wide publicity to China's laws and  standards concerning labor safety and health work in  foreign-invested enterprises to persuade them to improve labor  conditions, abide by labor laws and "Regulations," and to  respect the employees' dignity. At the same time, it is also  necessary to teach the employees of foreign-invested enterprises  to act according to law and boldly safeguard their own rights  and interests and their enterprises' interests.    Foreign-invested enterprise have made important  contributions  to China's reform and opening up to the outside world and also  to economic development. Nevertheless, the bosses of  foreign-invested enterprises must also realize that the  political status and economic rights and interests of their  enterprises' employees, in particular, the Chinese personnel,  are protected by China's "Institution" and laws. To safeguard  China's national policy of reform and opening up to the outside  world, and to enable foreign-invested enterprises to develop  more healthily, please bear the following in mind: Acting  according to law will benefit both the enterprises and the  employees and infringing upon the latter's interests will  ultimately infringe upon the former's own interests.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: No. 111 (601); </F> compiled by reporters Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy;  and edited by Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk has submitted to  parliament proposals on measures that are to be taken if the  Crimean parliament fails to make the Republic's laws in line  with the Ukrainian Constitution. The statement was made to  INTERFAX-Ukraine by the spokesman for the president Nikolay  Mikhalchenko. However, he refused to specify what concrete  measures the president wants to take. IF Note: Kravchuk  fulfilled the decision adopted by parliament on 1 June about the  drafting of a list of measures which may be used by Ukraine's  state organs if Crimean law-makers cancel the laws which run  counter to the Ukrainian Constitution. It is a matter of the  Crimean decision to reinstate the Constitution adopted in 6 May  1992, which provides for dual citizenship for the inhabitants of  the peninsula and the relationships between the Crimea and  Ukraine based on agreements. Following the results of the talks  in Simferopol of 2-3 June the delegations of the Ukrainian and  Crimean parliaments signed a communique where they fixed the  mutual "understanding" of the fact that the Crimean Constitution  of 6 May 1992 has provisions, which run counter to the Ukrainian  legislation. It was decided to create a joint working group to  improve Ukrainian legislation concerning the division of powers  between the bodies of state power of Ukraine and the Crimea.  The group started activities in Simferopol on Thursday [9 June].    In an interview with INTERFAX, the Ukrainian co-leader of  the  group, Vladimir Stretovich said that political problems will not  be included in the discussion. We will use legal ways to find  acceptable reservations which will reinstate the Crimean  status-quo, he said.    Stretovich said that the group consists of lawyers who will  study the Crimean and Ukrainian legislations from the  professions point of view.    The use of force in the conflict is inadmissible unless all  negotiating method are used. This is the position of the  Ukrainian parliament, said the deputy.    Meanwhile, the head of the delegation of the Crimean  parliament Sergey Nikulin in an interview with INTERFAX said  that Simferopol will try to use legal means to solve the current  situation in such a way so that the relations between Ukraine  and the Crimea be based on principles of agreements as it was  said in the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992.    We do not pose the question of the Crimea's secession from  Ukraine. We want to have Russia to be as open to us as Ukraine  is, said the Crimean deputy.</p>

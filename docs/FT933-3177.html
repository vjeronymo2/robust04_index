			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Observer: Presidential problems Poor Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He desperately wants an east German, or Ossie, to succeed Richard von Weizsacker as president. Yet the candidate he has in mind is currently enjoying a miserable 5 per cent popularity rating in national opinion polls, while the candidate he least desires is scoring 55 per cent. The favoured contender of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party is Steffen Heitmann, 49-year-old justice minister of Saxony. Before reunification Heitmann had been active in the Lutheran Church, a focal point for opposition to the communist regime. He is something of a traditionalist, preaching the virtues of nationhood, security and the need for German womanhood to spend more time at home. Despite such credentials, Heitmann has not yet been folded fully into the bosom of the CDU. But having struggled to get Heitmann accepted in the first place, the CDU's movers and shakers in Saxony are determined to see it through. Nevertheless, Hans Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, is still the runner most favoured by the Free Democrats, the junior partner in the governing coalition. Genscher has said no many times; but then so did Mae West. Genscher has distinct advantages. He is easily the public's favourite; he can also boast Ossie credentials - he was born in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt. His only handicap, it appears, is that Kohl would not wish to see his former rival bask in such limelight.</p>

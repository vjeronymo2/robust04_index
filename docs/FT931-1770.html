			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: BBA Last week BBA sold an Australian business, this week it buys in Switzerland and Germany and throws in a rights issue too. The pace of deals and issues in the past few years is such that shareholders might be forgiven for being confused about what the company actually does. The management says it is focusing on eight core businesses; yesterday's offering makes a total of four rights issues in eight years. The market forgives such shuffling from the likes of Hanson because it has a consistent earnings record. But BBA's earnings were 8.4p in 1985, hit a peak of 20p in 1989 and were back to 8.3p in 1992 - or 5p on the new accounting basis. BBA stresses growth in shareholders' funds, yet since 1985 the majority of that has come from rights issues. Granted, turnover has risen from Pounds 230m to Pounds 1.32bn while the dividend is up fourfold. And the recession has been particularly severe in engineering. The dividend, however, is now out of line with the underlying performance of the business. Those buying the rights for the 6.7 per cent yield may thus not see much growth. Investors might be more comfortable if the dealing was slower and the earnings more predictable.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Technology: Software scheme may mean final goodbye to Mr Chips - Plans for a 'community learning utility' taking multimedia into Britain's classrooms Tell me and I forget Teach me and I remember Involve me and I learn Benjamin Franklin's injunction was the tag for a lecture at the Royal Society of Arts in London last night on the prospects for a 'community learning utility' taking multimedia into classrooms across the country. The idea behind the scheme is simple: establish a national, not-for-profit utility with a bank of curriculum-related software, and deliver it to participating schools and colleges on a pay-as-you-use basis. The scheme is the brainchild of Alan Benjamin, a former director of corporate communications at ICL, the UK computer comnpany owned by Japan's Fujitsu, and a member of the board of the Docklands Development Corporation. He has monitored the birth of community learning utilities (Clus) in the US. Nine states now have a learning utility: the scope of their networks ranges from a handful of schools in some states to around 50 in Florida, Utah and Arizona. Utah's utility dates back to the late 1980s. Within schools, local area networks make it cheap to run programs from one 'server'; and free local telecom calls give classroom communication at no extra charge. 'The concept of the learning utility is first and foremost an idea about how to enrich and reconstruct education and empower educators,' said Benjamin. 'It is only secondly a technological system'. He said there were already 6,500 educational software programs in the UK, but 'the updating and enhancement of software is better organised and less expensive to achieve at a central point than at many locations. The utility will also be a source of user support and trouble shooting'. A demonstration will take place in London at Southwark's South Bank Technopark in March, with software and personnel from the US utilities. Benjamin hopes it will prompt the establishment of the first community utility in the UK, possibly this summer. The vision is of classrooms equipped with up to 30 workstations connected to a 'classroom storage level device', which would be used by the teacher to put together appropriate material for lessons from the utility's resources. Transmission could be at off-peak hours to cut telecom costs, with lesson planning and research done in advance. Who will pioneer the utilities, and how will they be financed? Benjamin believes the pioneering role would be ideal for training and enterprise councils, the local private-sector run bodies in England and Wales, which are keen to become more than deliverers of statutory government training programmes. 'A Tec could provide the standards, some of the programmes, the training framework and some of the finance of the partnership.' Schools would have to find much of the funding from their budgets, taking advantage of their new financial autonomy. Shortage of trained teachers is also a challenge. Benjamin envisages a new career for 'educational technologists', with degree courses in the subject. If Benjamin's Clus take off, Mr Chips and his blackboard could soon be museum pieces.</p>

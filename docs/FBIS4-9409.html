			<p>BFN     [Text] Lublin, 25 Apr--Sejm Deputy Izabella Sierakowska,  deputy chairwoman of the Social Democracy of the Polish  Republic, said at a news conference in Lublin on 25 April that  the present strikes organized by Solidarity are political.    Sierakowska said: "The government is taking steps, wants to  negotiate, and does negotiate, and I think that a typical  political struggle is now taking place. Any blow against the  power sector, the linchpin of the economy, amounts to a real  tragedy. We are already importing electricity, and a situation  may arise whereby some power-generating sets will never work  again, and what will happen to the people working there?    "The wages in the power sector are very high, and extremely  good social benefits, to which any other professional group is  not entitled, are envisaged for people who may be sacked from  this sector," Sierakowska said. She added that she is concerned  about Mr. Krzaklewski's personal involvement and the fact that  he keeps repeating: You must talk to me separately. "As it  happens, Solidarity is just a trade union, like any other  union," she said.</p>

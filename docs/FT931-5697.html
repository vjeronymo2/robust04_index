			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: CRA ahead 9.6% against falling commodity prices CRA, the Australian mining house, has held out against the tide of falling commodity prices to report increased sales and earnings for 1992. Strong contributions from coal and diamonds helped the company to report a 9.6 per cent rise in equity-accounted net earnings to ADollars 411.4m (USDollars 293.8m) from ADollars 375.4m in 1991, on a 5.8 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 5.24bn from ADollars 4.95bn. The annual dividend has been raised to 45 cents a share from 34 cents. The result was also helped by the falling Australian currency and a substantial cut in tax and financing charges. This allowed the company to further boost its already strong balance sheet. Tax and other government charges took ADollars 600.5m, compared with ADollars 744.9m, and financing charges were down to ADollars 62.2m, from ADollars 115.0m. The directors said gross balance sheet debt had fallen to ADollars 1.20bn, from ADollars 1.51bn, reducing gearing to 20.8 per cent, from 24.9 per cent. The company's position was further improved by a halving of capital expenditure to ADollars 520.3m from ADollars 1.09m, while cash-flow rose to ADollars 1.1bn from ADollars 1.0bn. Iron ore remained the company's biggest contributor to earnings, but profits eased to ADollars 349.1m from ADollars 416.3m. Coal increased its profits to ADollars 102.4m from ADollars 67.1m and diamonds jumped to ADollars 82.3m from ADollars 52.0m. The copper/gold division turned a ADollars 24.2m loss into a ADollars 22m profit. The contribution from aluminium more than doubled to ADollars 31.1m from ADollars 14.6m. The lead/zinc/silver operations reduced their losses to ADollars 6.8m from ADollars 32.1m. The directors said the company had conducted an asset review resulting in a ADollars 322.8m write-down of assets. They described 1992 as another disappointing year for mineral producers and said any improvement in the current year was highly dependent on the US, Japanese and German economies. 'The supply side of the metal equation remains one of over-supply,' they said. 'A major contributing factor is the Commonwealth of Independent States, which is maintaining high levels of metal exports into markets characterised by substantial inventories and low price levels.'</p>

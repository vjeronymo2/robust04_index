			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Letter: Purpose of poll tax in the retail prices index Sir, Dominic Hobson objects (April 16) to the inclusion of the poll tax in the RPI by saying it is not a price and therefore has no place in a retail prices index. The real issue is not the name of the index but its purpose. We believe that the purpose is to measure changes in costs to the consumer, and as such, tax burdens which are not a function of earnings should be included. Our own Consumers Price Index has always included these taxes since its inception in 1972. RF Couldrey, managing director, The Reward Group, Stone Business Park, Staffordshire</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Grundig reverses to DM296m loss GRUNDIG, Germany's leading home electronics group, returned a loss of DM296m (Dollars 175.1m) last year as falling prices, exchange rate movements and rationalisation costs and poor industry conditions took their toll. The company, which is owned 32 per cent owned by Philips, the Dutch electronics group, said last year's deficit compared with a relatively modest loss of DM18.6m in the previous year. Extraordinary costs were DM119m. The result was worse than the loss of DM200m which the company forecast in the autumn of last year. It blamed the increased losses on overcapacity in the worldwide home electronics industry - which hit the group's margins - as well as the cost of reducing its own capacity through the closure of plant and the reduction of the workforce. Turnover fell to DM3.71bn from DM4.24bn. Mr Pieter Harmsen, chief executive, said yesterday that falling prices and exchange rate movements trimmed sales by DM270m last year. Mr Harmsen warned that further rationalisation was necessary. Last year, total jobs fell to 16,706 from 20,473 and the chief executive said agreement had been reached with workforce representatives for a further 2,000 job cuts across the group in the current year. Stripping out the effect of price falls and exchange rate changes, sales would have risen by 1 per cent, Mr Harmsen said at yesterday's press conference in Nuremberg. This was a sign that the group had improved its market position despite the poor conditions for the sector. The loss on ordinary trading activities was DM187m, against a profit of DM75m in the previous year. Domestic turnover fell to DM2.07bn from DM2.31bn while abroad it dropped back to DM1.64bn from DM1.93bn in 1991. In March, Philips reported a loss of Fl 900m (Dollars 473.6m) last year, blaming 'unprecedented conditions' in worldwide consumer electronics markets. It said then that in response it planned to cut 12,000 to 15,000 jobs worldwide and that it would work to eliminate duplication of production and development activities between the parent company and Grundig.</p>

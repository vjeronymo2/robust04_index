			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (15): Helicopter deal at risk - Canada THE AEROSPACE industry has more than a passing interest in the campaign leading up to Canada's general election later this year. One of the hottest political issues in recent months has been a CDollars 5.8bn order signed by the Progressive Conservative government for 50 European-designed EH-101 helicopters. Mr Fred Sutherland, president of the Aerospace Industries Association of Canada, says that as many as 400 Canadian companies, led by Montreal-based Paramax, stand to benefit from the contract. They would also gain valuable export work for future EH-101 sales to other countries. The helicopters are required for search-and-rescue and anti-submarine work. But by common consent, they are among the most costly of their type on the market. Coming at a time when the squeeze is on many other areas of public spending, the contract has given the government's political opponents an irresistible opening. The issue has been blown up even further by the coincidence that the defence minister, Ms Kim Campbell, is both the frontrunner to succeed Mr Brian Mulroney as prime minister and is in charge of the department which ordered the helicopters. The opposition Liberal party has promised it would try to cancel the contract if it wins at the polls. Few would be surprised if the Conservatives scaled back the order even before the election. Any cut, however, would be a further setback to companies which are already being forced to retrench as orders shrivel for both military and civilian aerospace equipment. Canada's aerospace industry is the world's sixth biggest. It has been hit by many of the same blows inflicted on its counterparts elsewhere - the recession, cuts in military spending and the deep slump in the civilian aircraft market. In a trend typical of the industry, Canadian Marconi, which is 52 per cent owned by the UK's GEC, has chopped its workforce by a third over the past three years. Marconi relies on military orders - the bulk of them from the US - for three-quarters of its work. Like other companies, it is diversifying in an attempt to lower its reliance on defence orders. It has already bought a stable of global positioning products, and is on the look-out for other acquisitions of products, technology or companies. Bombardier, by far Canada's biggest aerospace company, has been able to soften the blow somewhat by rationalising the activities of the businesses it has bought over the past few years in north America and Europe. For instance, the Canadair Regional Jet division, based in Montreal, has pooled its marketing and customer support resources with de Havilland, the commuter aircraft maker in which Bombardier bought a majority stake last year. De Havilland's plant in Toronto has been assigned paintwork and interior fitting for the RJ. It is also supplying wings for the latest model of the Learjet, Bombardier's US subsidiary. Yet another Bombardier company, Short Brothers of Belfast, Northern Ireland, is designing the Learjet 43 fuselage. Still, intense competition in the commuter market has taken its toll on Bombardier. De Havilland is closing its assembly line for two months this summer. The RJ production line, currently producing two aircraft a month, will reach full capacity of four a month, at least a year later than planned. With the airframe market so crowded, Mr Sutherland predicts that the brightest spots in Canada's aerospace industry will be companies able to find a specialised corner of the market. Those which have already sprung to prominence include CAE Industries, a world leader in manufacturing sophisticated flight simulators; Spar Aerospace, the satellite communications company whose best-known product is the 'arm' attached to US space shuttles; and Vancouver-based MacDonald Dettwiler, which specialises in satellite-based data collection, also known as remote sensing.</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH HORSE  </P> <P> Having just read Aram Saroyan's review of Robert Ferrigno's "Horse Latitudes"  (April 8), I have a suggestion for The Times: Why don't you choose reviewers  who either write in, are familiar with, or like the genre they're critiquing?  It is obvious from the review that Saroyan does not like the "noir" or  "thriller" novel. . . .  </P> <P> His criticisms revolve around the book's pacing, which is, indeed, fast; and he  decries the novel's lack of character development.  </P> <P> On the contrary, "Latitudes' " characters are very well-developed and  consistent throughout, even if we don't know each character's family tree.  </P> <P> If I had wanted to read an overdeveloped, boring book, I'd have bought another  of Saroyan's.  </P> <P> Also, Saroyan criticizes Ferrigno (by) calling him a "journalist," as if it  were an epithet. Luckily, such journalists as Hemingway, London and Twain  didn't see journalism as a barrier to good literature. . . .  </P> <P> In short, how can anyone complain when an author writes a book that the reader  can't put down? In the future, please select your reviewers with more care.  </P> <P> CANDY NALL  </P> <P> TORRANCE  </P></p>

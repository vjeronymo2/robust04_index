			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Press Review: Candidate with a Real chance of being elected - Latin America The presidential election today in Brazil and the likely victory of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a sociology professor turned inflation-conquering finance minister, are prompting optimism throughout Latin America about prospects for growth, if the region's biggest economy remains stable. But for thousands of Brazilian twins, the issue is more straightforward: will they get the vote? The twins were disenfranchised when election authorities, noting that such details as dates of birth and parents' names were identical, suspected they were fraudulent attempts to create votes for 'non-existent' people, a common practice in parts of Brazil. Last-minute appeals by desperate siblings appear to have persuaded the authorities to let the twins vote. But as SBT, Brazil's second TV station, reported on Saturday night, the change of policy has not yet been officially sent to the provinces. Boris Kasoy, the station's anchor, whose catch phrase 'it's a disgrace' is used nightly to criticise the government, described the episode as plain 'stupid'. Despite such late hitches, campaigning has been peaceful and debate, at times, serious. The main newspapers agreed that Brazil's democracy has matured since the vicious 1989 presidential campaign won by Mr Fernando Collor, who later resigned amid corruption charges. 'In 1989 polarisation, radicalism and passions predominated. In 1994 we have reached polling day with less turbulence,' according to an editorial in Folha de Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest selling daily. The media, which have supported Mr Cardoso throughout the campaign, also agreed that his expected victory showed the country wanted stability rather than change. As finance minister, he planned the country's new currency, the Real, which led to a fall in monthly inflation from 50 per cent to less than 2 per cent. Voters seem attracted by that record of success rather than by the rhetoric of Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the left winger who promised to tackle social problems and build a 'fairer' Brazil. Ms Maria Tereza Souza Monteiro, a polling specialist interviewed by Veja news magazine, said: 'The majority voting for (Mr Cardoso) are acting out of caution to prevent things changing unpredictably. What has struck me is that the elector, trying to be more rational, has this time refused to dream, which was always an inseparable part of our election campaigns.' Mr Cardoso is well known throughout Latin America, where his work as a left-of-centre sociologist is still studied. His victory will be welcomed by the continent because he is likely to accelerate Brazil's integration with its neighbours. For example, he is strongly committed to Mercosur, the customs union with Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which comes into force on January 1. The weekend press in Buenos Aires was unanimous in its assessment that the inflation-battling Plan Real had wooed the Brazilian people and was certain to catapult Mr Cardoso to power. Newspapers pointed out the added importance of Brazilian elections for Argentina, given the close economic ties being forged between the two countries within the customs union. In a piece entitled 'Brazilian elections: An event viewed through a magnifying glass in Argentina', La Nacion said it was now commonly held that 'with Mercosur, everything that occurs in one country has infinite importance in the other.' It was also genuinely accepted, said La Nacion, that Argentina was rooting for a Cardoso victory so that Brazil could be 'once and for all converted to a market economy'. Mr Cardoso, it said, had borrowed heavily from Argentina's inflation policy under economy minister Domingo Cavallo. 'Here, they joke that the Plan Real is the Plan Cavallo written in Portuguese (Brazil's language).' The tabloid Clarn warned that winning the elections was the easy part. Mr Cardoso had to push crucial budgetary reforms through congress, it said, or 'Brazil would once again become ungovernable'. In a separate article, Clarn contrasted the personalities of the presidential frontrunners as a symbol of Brazil's yawning social division. As a child, the academic Cardoso 'adored the classics' and studied with a private tutor, while factory worker Lula 'ate bread for the first time when he was seven'. Left-wing Pagina 12 ran a similar piece contrasting the lives of the bronzed Ipanema beach set with life in a Rio slum, Rocinha. It found much support for the Plan Real in both. 'The inhabitants of the biggest shanty town in Latin America were also seduced by the new money.' In this, it said, lay the secret of Mr Cardoso's likely success. In Chile, where Mr Cardoso lived for a spell during Brazil's 1964-1985 period of military rule, El Mercurio, the country's leading daily, reported Mr Cardoso's increasing lead in opinion polls while the main TV channels concentrated on the pre-election atmosphere. La Epoca newspaper went into greater detail and pointed out that the two main candidates, Mr Cardoso and Mr da Silva, had the backing of organised political parties. As such, they differed from 'outsider' politicians such as Mr Alberto Fujimori, who was elected president of Peru in 1990, or Brazil's Mr Collor, who won the presidency in the previous year without the help of the main political parties.</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Police arrested 109 anti-abortion demonstrators for blocking the entrance to a  Planned Parenthood clinic in Salinas, although officers said the protest was  generally peaceful. Those arrested were taking part in one of a series of  Operation Rescue demonstrations that have been staged in recent months  throughout the country. Police Lt. Scott Miller said the demonstrators were  charged with misdemeanor counts of trespassing and resisting officers. Some of  those taken into custody were "uncooperative in the booking process," Miller  said. They refused to identify themselves, be photographed or fingerprinted.  Miller said they will remain in jail.  </P></p>

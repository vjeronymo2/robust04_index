			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SLOW RECOVERY;  </P> <P> 2 YEARS AFTER QUAKE, WHITTIER FAR FROM END OF REBUILDING  </P> <P> On the second anniversary of the earthquake that violently shook the Southland,  Whittier officials have doubled to 10 years their estimate of how long it will  take for their shattered city to fully recover.  </P> <P> Repair of homes and businesses in Whittier -- with $78 million in damage, the  city hardest hit by the 5.9 temblor on Oct. 1, 1987 -- has been stalled by  problems with contractors, the lengthy process of obtaining earthquake recovery  loans and disputes over how the city should be rebuilt.  </P> <P> Complicating matters, city engineers are seeing the first signs of escalating  deterioration of the community's aging sewer system, which they attribute to  the quake.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 10-Year Effort Expected  </P> <P> Last year, civic and business leaders predicted that it would take about five  years to rebuild.  </P> <P> "Building was going rapid-fire right after the earthquake, and then it  stopped," said City Manager Tom Mauk. "It took time for homeowners to get  funding and figure out what they wanted to do. That was when I realized this  was a 10-year process."  </P> <P> More than 5,000 homes and businesses in the community of 73,000 residents, 20  miles southeast of Los Angeles, were damaged in the temblor. The quake, the  largest in Southern California in 16 years, caused $368 million in damage  throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties and three deaths.  </P> <P> Today, roughly 20% of the damaged buildings in Whittier are still under  reconstruction. About a dozen vacant lots stand as reminders of what's left to  be done.  </P> <P> Some city officials say there have been tremendous strides in reconstruction,  despite the problems. Others say rebuilding has not gone fast enough.  </P> <P> Signs of the powerful temblor are easily spotted, especially in the historic  Uptown area, where many of the Victorian-style homes were built 60 years ago.  Scores of quaint houses near the picturesque stretch of Beverly Boulevard are  in various states of disrepair.  </P> <P> Recently, the city had to dig up a half-mile of Painter Avenue to replace a  70-year-old sewer line that split in several places. Assistant City Engineer  Leon Yehuda said similar breaks are expected to be found in the city's 200  miles of sewer lines in the future, although at present "it is impossible to  predict the scope of the damage."  </P> <P> Jumpy residents have called city building inspectors to complain that their  earthquake-shaken homes now creak, apparently caused by the settling of wooden  frames and shifting ground.  </P> <P> "It makes people nervous," said Richard Hubinger, the city's director of  building and safety. He said he assures the "numerous" callers not to worry,  that "the house is not going to fall down."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outsiders Surprised  </P> <P> People often are surprised to learn the city is still rebuilding, said Larry  Haendiges, president of the Uptown Merchants Assn. and a Planning Commissioner.  </P> <P> "It's easy for an outsider to say, 'Well, just fix it. Why is it taking so  long?' " he said. "It takes time and money. People who are impatient just can't  survive this."  </P> <P> Marie Moore, who lives with her husband and three children in a historic,  two-story Uptown home, knows patience all too well.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago the family moved back into their still-damaged home. Two separate  contractors reportedly took Moore's money and walked off the job, bringing work  on the house to a halt several times in the last two years. The Moores are now  on their third contractor and hope to see the house, in which several rooms are  uninhabitable, finished next year.  </P> <P> The house is on stilts, exposing a gaping hole where the cracked foundation  once stood. Mounds of dirt bury the front yard. Boards cover the front windows.  </P> <P> "Not in my wildest dreams would I think that it would take this long," Moore  said. "I want to go forward. I just want to put everything behind me and go  forward."  </P> <P> Bill Lewis, the city's building rehabilitation manager, said at least 4% of the  residents who had repairs done on their homes experienced problems with  contractors.  </P> <P> As contractors descended upon the city by the dozens -- some from as far away  as Alaska -- to seek work repairing thousands of damaged homes, the city tried  to weed out those who were untrustworthy.  </P> <P> "Three or four times we would tell people, 'Hey, this guy is no good,' " Lewis  said. "No matter how much you tell them, some just wouldn't listen. They were  desperate to get their lives back in shape."  </P> <P> One contractor went through neighborhoods grossly underbidding jobs. When he  received down payments, he disappeared, Lewis said. Another took on too many  projects, then could not finish the jobs. One went out of business, others left  the state. The stories go on and on, Lewis said.  </P> <P> Robert Bolin, a researcher from New Mexico State University who is studying the  lasting effects the quake has had on Whittier, said the pattern surfaces time  and again. "You get unqualified contractors" who prey on disaster-stricken  areas around the country, he said.  </P> <P> And even when residents found reputable contractors, many of them had to wait  at least six months to obtain federal, state or city loans, Lewis said. As a  result, in some areas construction had barely started eight months after the  quake because of "the lengthy bureaucratic process," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Waiting for State Aid  </P> <P> Today, a dozen residents still are waiting for funding from the state, Lewis  said. One out of 10 homeowners who applied for loans were turned down often  because they already were too much in debt, Lewis said.  </P> <P> "There are always people who fall through the cracks," he said.  </P> <P> Pete Wilson, who owns a house near Beverly Boulevard, is a perfect example.  </P> <P> Wilson has been waiting since the quake to receive a loan. Recently, he was  told he soon will receive state funds to repair his home.  </P> <P> "It's been a bloody nightmare," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Burden on Elderly  </P> <P> Some elderly people living in homes they had paid off prior to the earthquake  had to obtain large loans to repair the damage, Lewis said. In some instances,  older people had to go back to work or put off retirement just to get money the  cover their loan payments, he said.  </P> <P> Regardless of the problems, Whittier's residents feel strong allegiance to  their community, according to studies and city leaders. But fast-paced change,  much of it brought on by reconstruction, is having an impact on how people view  the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Longer Sleepy  </P> <P> "This is what they used to characterize as a sleepy, quaint, historical  village," said Joe Holiday, the president of the Uptown Homeowners' Assn. "Now  it's changing to a more modern commuter, typical Southern California-type  community."  </P> <P> Shortly after the temblor, developers began approaching owners of ravaged homes  in areas zoned for high-density construction, urging them to sell rather than  take on the tiresome and costly repair process.  </P> <P> Some sold and, quickly, apartment complexes started to spring up.  </P> <P> Soon community activists discovered that the city was allowing developers to  build apartments in violation of the city's General Plan, a long-range  blueprint calling for single-family homes in much of the quake-stricken area.  The residents joined together and demanded that the building be stopped.  </P> <P> "The residential areas were up for grabs," said Helen Rahder, a researcher for  the Whittier Conservancy, a powerful citizens' group formed after the  earthquake. "We were not going to sit by and let those homes be destroyed."  </P> <P> Eventually, city officials listened and adopted a plan to protect historical  property and the city's small-town atmosphere.  </P> <P> "Growth is never achieved without controversy," said Manny Ocampo, assistant  city manager. "We're making the best out of a tragic situation. It just takes  time."  </P></p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Arts: La Fille du Regiment DONIZETTI'S Tyrolean opera comique needs an intrepid titular soprano, a lusty romantic tenor with some style, and a ripe mezzo of interesting character. On Monday, the Royal College of Music Opera School fielded just such a team, young though they were. With the student orchestra playing admirably for Michael Rosewell, whose expert brio was a tonic throughout, it was an evening of many pleasures. The piece was sung and spoken in courageous French, heartened by the fact that the appealing heroine Anne-Marie Panzarella is French. Her bright soprano is surprisingly full-toned already, and ascends confidently (a hint of steam-whistle at the top would probably vanish in a larger theatre); the personality is broad-gauge and direct, but there was much graceful feeling in her sad Act 2 air. No divination is needed to predict a happy career for her. There was odder French from her sweetheart Tonio and her lofty 'aunt', La Marquise. That, however, was part of their exotic charm - for the tenor Ya-Lin Zhang is Chinese, and the mezzo Naoko Noma hails from Osaka. He has a forthright Italianate ring, with real metal in his timbre, and is presentably handsome (but somewhat plump: nothing became him like trading in his Tyrolean Lederhosen for a decent French uniform). She wields a vocal instrument of intriguing potential and colour, and an ultra-mannered persona which may develop into something striking and dramatically valuable. Only the baritone Laurence Whitehead sounded hampered by too-cautious French, in the lengthy comprimario role of Sulpice. It wants a lot of fluent character: he was competent, but rather a dull stick. The young chorus made a brave noise that belied their numbers, and their high spirits were a consistent asset. The production by Vernon Mound is eager but raw (strong on formation-marching, helpless with individual character). Robert Lloyd's sets are kitschy-peculiar, and impossible to light well - as David Whittlestone evidently discovered: his self-conscious lighting-tricks were mildly irritating. None of that mattered much. Monday's principals and conductor appear again on Thursday; the final performance on Friday features an alternate solo team and a different conductor. Both are sold out.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Groupe Salomon advances 43% GROUPE Salomon, one of Europe's leading ski equipment companies, continued its recovery last year with a 43 per cent increase in net profits to FFr94.8m (Dollars 16.8m) in the year to March 31 from FFr66.3m in the previous year, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The group, which has been restructured in the two years since the arrival of a new management team led by Mr Jean-Francois Gautier, said it expected profits to stabilise this year but to return to growth in 1994-1995 due to its product development plans. Salomon fell into the red two years ago after a series of poor skiing seasons in the Alps. It returned to profit in the 1991-1992 financial year and made further progress last year. Turnover rose by 6.5 per cent to FFr3.15bn in 1992-1993 from FFr2.96bn in 1991-1992 with operating profits increasing by 53.6 per cent to FFr312m from FFr202m. The group's pre-tax profits doubled to FFr177.28m from FFr86.36m over the same period. The board proposed raising the dividend by 75 per cent, by paying a dividend of FFr14.00 and a tax credit of FFr7.00.</p>

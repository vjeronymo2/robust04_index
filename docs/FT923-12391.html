			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Ministers urged to speed CFC phase-out GOVERNMENT experts meeting in Geneva have agreed to recommend an accelerated phase-out of the main ozone-destroying chemicals by the end of 1995 and reductions in production and use of other known ozone-eaters. Their recommendations will now go to a ministerial meeting in Copenhagen in November of the 82 members of the Montreal Protocol, the United Nations-sponsored accord on protecting the ozone layer. The protocol currently calls for the elimination of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), halons and some other ozone-depleting chemicals by the year 2000. Faced with accumulating evidence of rapid and widespread loss of atmospheric ozone, officials agreed a complete phase-out of production of CFCs, carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloride in industrialised countries by the end of 1995. These chemicals are used in refrigerants, aerosols and solvents. They also agreed an end to halon production by January 1 1994, with essential uses to be met from existing supplies. Halons are used in firefighting equipment. Officials will be recommending a timetable for the phase-out of CFC substitutes, such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons, if possible in time for the November ministerial meeting. These substitutes also destroy the ozone layer, though to a lesser extent than CFCs. However, to the dismay of environmentalists, the two-week meeting took no firm decision on methyl bromide, a pesticide widely used as a fumigant, which is now known to be a highly potent ozone-eater. Tight controls were strongly resisted by developing countries. Pending a detailed report due next year, the recommendation to ministers calls merely for a freeze on production and consumption at 1992 levels by 1995, with a 25 per cent cut by the end of the century.</p>

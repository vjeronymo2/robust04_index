			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Concerning the international efforts to support  the Middle East peace process, the proceedings of the fifth  session of the multilateral working group, which has been  charged within the framework of the Arab-Israeli conference with  developing the countries of the Middle East region, continued  this morning in Rabat. Like the previous proceedings, this  session was held behind closed doors and lasted for more than  five hours. [passage omitted]    The Palestinian delegation taking part in this session held  a  news conference today in which it gave an initial evaluation of  the meeting, which is expected to conclude its proceedings this  evening. Concerning the subjects discussed in this morning's  meeting, (Muhammad Shitiyah), a member of the Palestinian  delegation, said:    [Begin (Shitiyah) recording] We have listened to numerous  reports dealing with different issues submitted by the  sponsoring countries. In particular, we have listened to a  report by the Spanish Government on the agricultural issue, from  Japan on tourism in the region, a summary study from Germany on  the issue of trade in the Middle East and its international  ramifications, and also a report from the United States on the  issue of training. We have also listened to a report from the  Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, a committee for coordinating aid to  the Palestinian people, which convened in Paris last week.  There were also numerous interventions from the different  sides. There was a proposal presented by the European  Community. Basically, it requested that more weight be given to  the Middle East region in determining its priorities, as we said  yesterday. The proposal has been modified many times, and the  international dimension was retained. [end recording]</p>

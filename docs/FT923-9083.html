			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK equities There was other news, besides BP, for the London bears to picnic on yesterday. A warning from Barclays darkened the economic gloom, BET's rights issue received a lukewarm response, and sterling finished the day nudging that bit closer to its absolute D-Mark floor in the ERM grid. In the circumstances, perhaps, it was surprising that the Footsie managed to claw back more than half its initial 32-point fall. At current levels one can argue that investors are at last discounting a lower growth economy in the mid 1990s, and that the 0.75 percentage point rise in the market's average yield since early May represents a substantial adjustment. The view that most of the risks are in missing the upside, though, looks questionable given that nervousness over sterling interest rates is likely to be here for some time. Mr Lamont will doubtless fight tooth and nail to avert dearer money - as demonstrated by this week's pandering to the building societies - but his very reluctance is an open invitation to foreign exchange dealers to test the government's ERM resolve to the limit. The contrast between UK policy and recent determination to defend the lira has certainly not been lost on the markets. While signs of weakening in the German economy have probably lengthened the odds against a rise in DM rates, political pressures nearer home are just as dangerous. UK equities are assuming interest rates will remain at current levels for some time, but anything worse is not in the price.</p>

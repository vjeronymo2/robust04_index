			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Germans may avert pay war: It all appears to be over except for the shouting The annual German wage round yesterday began in earnest, as formal negotiations were launched in three key regions of the mighty 3.4m-strong engineering industry, and public sector pay talks began with the 250,000 postal workers. If the rhetoric from both employers and trade unions is to be believed, then a long and bitter pay round is in prospect. Most employers are demanding an absolute pay freeze, while the unions insist that incomes must be protected, and working hours reduced to provide new jobs for the unemployed. Yet many commentators outside government and industry believe that the worst is already over, and only the shouting remains. They hope that a 2 per cent pay deal for the chemical industry, agreed this week after arbitration for the 170,000 workers in the north Rhine region, will set a clear signal of moderation and good sense. There certainly will be a good deal of sound and fury in a pay round coming on the eve of a mammoth election year, with a whole series of state elections leading up to a general election in October. On the other hand, the prospect of unemployment reaching 4m this year, and the memory of the sharpest downturn in the west German economy since the war last year, have certainly caused the trade unions to moderate their militancy. It is employers who are making headline-catching demands for cost cuts in 1994, while the unions are simply attempting to hold the line. The chemical industry may prove to be important psychologically, most analysts believe, especially for the rest of the private sector. Yet the most important message from the deal is probably not in the agreement on a 2 per cent pay rise, after a two-month pay freeze, meaning a real cut in wages. As far as the employers are concerned, the best part of the agreement is a significant shift towards more flexibility. In the first place, the deal provides for a 'working time corridor' for the industry, with individual enterprises free to negotiate working hours at plant level between a 35-hour and a 40-hour week. Secondly, it allows companies to take on new workers from the dole queue at only 90 per cent of the agreed basic wages, an important concession by IG Chemie, the chemical workers' union, in order to promote job creation instead of redundancies. But employers warn against any overhasty calculation that the rest of German industry will now fall in line. 'We cannot assume that there will be the same sort of deals throughout industry,' according to Mr Johannes Gobel, deputy head of the wages department at the German employers' federation (BDA). Top priority for the employers now is to see real cost cuts emerging from the talks between IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, and an increasingly militant Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers. Their aim is a pay freeze on basic rates, and abolition of extra holiday pay, thus leading to an overall 10 per cent cut in costs. Talks began yesterday between the two sides in North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, where the union is calling for a 5.5 per cent pay rise to match inflation and higher productivity, and in northern Baden-Wurttemberg (home of Daimler-Benz), where it is seeking 6.0 per cent. Few believe they will emerge with anything better than the chemical workers, but Mr Walter Riester, the deputy leader of IG Metall, is not ready to capitulate yet. The public sector union, OeTV, is also adamant that it will not accept a pay freeze, as sought by the three levels of employers in the public service - central government, the 16 states, and the local authorities. Ironically, it is the lower levels of government, where the opposition Social Democrats are most often in control, where the financial constraints are most severe. OeTV has already lowered its sights to 4 per cent, loaded in favour of the low paid. 'There is a clear expectation amongst the workers that we will and must do better than a nominal pay freeze,' Mr Rainer Hillgartner, the union spokesman, said yesterday. What the employers hope is that sector by sector they can negotiate similar deals to the chemical industry, providing a real element of flexibility for individual employers to set their own plant-level agreements.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GERMAN WAGE ROUND  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Industry          Union        Workers   Claim                                covered  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Engineering       IG Metall       3.4m   5.5-6.0 per cent Public sector     OeTV           2.65m   4 per cent to match inflation Banking           HBV/DAG      430,000   DM270 per month + cut in hours Paper             IG Medien    123,000   5 per cent Construction      IG Bau          1.4m   Not decided Printing          IG Medien    180,000   Not decided Wholesale         HBV             1.0m   Not decided  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Midland Global Markets &amp; FT  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

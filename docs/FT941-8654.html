			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Heavy weather delays Hartstone sale Hartstone was well and truly snowed under yesterday as the freak cold weather threatened to put the skids on the refinancing being negotiated by the hosiery and handbags group. News that the roof had caved in under the weight of heavy snow at a French hosiery factory on Monday caused Courtaulds Textiles to call for a delay in its proposed Pounds 45.4m purchase of Cogetex, the French company acquired by Hartstone in 1991. The disposal is a fundamental part of the refinancing package which was due to be completed earlier this week. Courtaulds Textiles has the right to withdraw from the transaction if the damage to the factory's packaging and storage premises exceeds the insurance cover by Pounds 4.5m. Hartstone is understood to be covered for damage of up to Pounds 50m. Hartstone is currently operating without a standstill arrangement, which expired on January 16, as it had believed medium-term financing arrangements would have been in place by the end of this month. These are now likely to be delayed by at least two to three weeks. Mr Shaun Dowling, the chairman who has sought to turn round the struggling group for the last eight months, said yesterday he felt this was merely 'one more aggravation to add to all the others'.</p>

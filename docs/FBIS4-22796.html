			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu.I. Polavskiy, program director: "The T-407 </F> Skvorets Light Transport Plane"]    [Text] An analysis of the demands of potential customers  shows that there is a need for a light-transport plane, capable  of taking on board up to 600 kg of payload and conveying it for  a distance of up to 600 km, and operating at airports with a  runway of up to 600 m. This concept is known as the  "600X600X600." The basic version of the plane should have the  possibility of being re-equipped in the following  variants:     -  Ambulance and emergency-rescue;    -  Forest patrol,  with the potential for air-dropping  fire-fighter-parachutists;    -  Patrol, to monitor electric power  lines and oil and gas pipelines, as well as to serve the state  motor vehicle inspectorate;    -  Performing hydrometeorological and  ecological survey;    -  Aerial photography;    -  An air taxi to perform  official transport;    -  Instruction and training.    In 1990,  GosNIIGA [State Civil Aviation Scientific Research Institute]  was given the technical assignment of working out this type of  light, multi-purpose airplane on a competitive basis, with the  participation of A.V. Medvedev, the institute's chief  specialist. Because of the lack of financing and numerous  organizational problems, however, the competition was not held.    One of the most important criteria for determining the size,  and to a considerable extent, the design of the plane was the  type and amount of payload. In our case, the payload of 600 kg  may lie in quite a broad products list -- from fuel drums and  computer boxes to six people with luggage. The measurements of  the cargo-passenger compartment should be determined on this  precise basis.    For convenience of loading and unloading there must be a  large cargo door. This requirement makes it preferable for the  transport plane to have the wing placed high, which ensures  transport vehicles convenient approach and access to the cargo  door. Having a strutted wing reduces the weight and simplifies  the structural scheme of the plane as a whole. The aerodynamic  loss (the struts) will be fully justifiable in the given range  of speeds -- up to 250 km/hr. It is also quite important for the  high-wing monoplane to have good stability characteristics at  large angles of incidence. This simplifies the technique of  piloting the plane at low speeds and makes it accessible to  fliers with average qualifications. The design adopted for the  high-wing monoplane successfully complies with the task of using  the patrol version of the plane, where a good range of vision of  the lower hemisphere is needed, and also for dropping  parachutists.    Since the payload is a given value in designing the plane,  the choice of power unit variants is as a rule quite limited.  Since the plane that we are talking about was needed, as they  say, "yesterday," it would be extremely imprudent to incorporate  in its design any promising, but not yet series-produced engine  or propeller. Orientation toward engines and propellers produced  in the West entails "cutting off" a considerable number of the  plane's potential buyers within the country, in view of the  impossibility of their paying part of its cost in currency.    There is only one series-produced aircraft piston engine  acceptable for us in the country today. This is the 360-hp M-14P  engine. True, calculations show that to obtain the required  combination of take-off and landing features and a flight  cruising speed of at least 250 km/hr, a more powerful engine is  needed. The M-14P has substantial merits, though. In the first  place, its weight is quite low in relation to its power. In the  second place, it is reliable, which was proven by its long  operation in the Yak and Su sports planes. The 435 hp M-14NTK  engine is a further development of the M-14P. The only  series-produced propeller for the M-14P engine produced in our  country is the V530TA-D35 two-blade variable-pitch tractive  propeller.    As for a choice between landing gear systems with nose and  tail support, then given the planned operation of the plane on  the basis of the airports of local airlines and the landing  strips of the former DOSAAF [All-Union Voluntary Society for  Assistance to the Army, Air Force and Navy of the USSR], it is  very tempting to settle on the system with nose support, which  gives well-known operating advantages: convenience in loading  and unloading, a good range of vision when taxiing and less  likelihood of a nose-over during a rough landing. To perform the  tasks involved in landing on an unprepared area, however, a  plane of the basic design with tail support may be suggested.    The conditions for operating the plane must also be taken  into consideration when selecting the type of shock absorbers.  Since it will not just be operated at concreted airports, the  need arises for shock absorbers which will absorb the  considerable energy of the shock when hitting uneven dirt areas  during take-off and landing. Landing gear with traditional  liquid-gas shock absorbers have this ability. Springs may also  be used, but only in combination with a reverse liquid damper.    Since we are talking about a plane that is simple, quite  reasonable in price, undemanding and reliable in operation, the  question of retractable or fixed landing gear is clearly  answered in favor of the "fixed type." On the other hand,  retractable landing gear, in addition to complicating the  structure, entails a number of operational inconveniences,  stemming, for example, from the fact that the recesses for the  landing gear get choked with dirt or snow when the machine is  operated from dirt landing strips. All this speaks in favor of  using the simple fixed landing gear on airplanes of this class.    The low cost of the plane is also achieved only by using  simple structural designs and already developed materials and  technology. The high level of technological feasibility and  manufacturing simplicity incorporated into the design makes it  possible to develop series production of the plane in the  shortest time possible. This may prove to be the decisive factor  under the present-day conditions of economic instability.    The structure, which has a welded truss made of pipes and  sheathed with non-supporting panels as the air frame of the  fuselage, may provide great advantages in this plan. As  practical experience shows, the technological equipment for  assembly of the truss fuselage is considerably simpler than the  equipment needed to assemble a fuselage with a "semi-monocoque"  type of structure, the most common in aviation today, the  assembly of which is carried out with the basic parts of the  frame following an exterior theoretical contour.    In the case of a truss structure, the basic load-bearing  element -- the truss -- may have a simple geometric shape.  Moreover, there is no need to maintain small tolerances on the  outside of the fuselage contours. The latter are formed by the  non-load-bearing panels, which considerably simplifies their  manufacture. Precision in adhering to the outlines is ensured by  compensators, when the panels are installed on the truss. It is  not possible to use thinner sheathing and supporting elements of  the non-load-bearing panels than is dictated by technological  considerations. In this case, of course, we have a certain  weight disadvantage as compared with the traditional structure.  This is a sacrifice which must be borne for the sake of  production feasibility and repairability during operation.    Unfortunately, as experience in working with truss  structures  in domestic aircraft building has shown, very careful selection  of material is required. The heat treatment necessary after a  structure made of 30KhGSA steel is welded often leads to its  deformation. VNS-2 steel retains its strength characteristics in  the area of the weld, and without subsequent heat processing,  but is a quite expensive and scarce material. The overwhelming  majority of light planes of similar structure, built in the  West, use as truss material steel analogous in its  characteristics to our 20 steel. This is what is advisable for  use in the truss structures.    The sheathing panels of the fuselage can be made of aluminum  alloy, fiberglass-reinforced plastic or dacron. To simplify the  technology, they can be made flat or with a slight single  curvature.    Based on the above-discussed considerations, the  Aeroprogress  enterprise is developing the light-weight multi-purpose T-407  airplane. It is a strutted, high-wing monoplane with a normal  aerodynamic design, a single-piston engine and a tractive  propeller.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Basic Flight-Engineering Data                                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Engine:                                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |--number                 |1                        |1                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |--type                   |M-14P                    |M-14NTK                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |--horse power            |360                      |435                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Crew/passengers, persons |1/6                      |1/6                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Take-off weight, kg      |2,080                    |2,080                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fuel reserve, kg         |300                      |300                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Payload, kg              |600                      |600                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Flight speed, km/hr      |220                      |260                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Flight altitude range, m |0-4,000                  |0-4,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Flight range, km                                                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |--with maximum payload   |600                      |500                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |--with maximum fuel rese-|1,600                    |1,200                    |  |rve                      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Take-off distance (up to |400                      |300                      |  |N=15 m), m               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Landing distance (up to  |550                      |550                      |  |N=15 m), m               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Overall dimensions of co-|4.3 x 1.34 x 1.3                                   |  |ckpit-cabin: length x wi-|                                                   |  |dth x height, m          |                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      THE WING AND TAIL ASSEMBLY have a traditional structure made  of aluminum alloy. Single-slot swivel flaps are placed along the  rear edge of the wing.    THE FUSELAGE is a truss structure. The truss material is 20  steel. The panels of the sheathing are made of aluminum alloy.    THE LANDING GEAR is non-retractable, triple support, with a  free-oriented nose wheel. The shock absorbers are main and front  strut --liquid-gas. The wheels of the main struts, the braking  wheels, with 500X150 mm tubeless tires, can be equipped with an  automatic anti-skid system, if the buyer wishes. The wheel of  the front strut has a 400X150 mm tubeless tire.    THE POWER UNIT. A series-produced M-14P 360 hp air-cooled  piston engine with a V530TA-D35 double-bladed variable pitch  tractive propeller is installed on the plane. The fuel tanks,  with a total capacity of 380 l, are located in the rear parts of  the wing brackets.    THE CABIN AND CARGO-PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. In the basic  version of the plane, only the pilot's seat at the left is  equipped with controls. The possibility of equipping the  instructor's seat at the right with controls is provided for in  the training variant.    The cargo-passenger compartment is designed to accommodate  cargo with a total weight of 600 kg or seats for six passengers.  Its floor is designed for a unit load of 400 kgs/m[.sup]2[/].  The floor and side of the compartment are equipped with hitches  to moor the cargo and with installation points for the passenger  seats. The measurements of the door of the cargo-passenger  compartment, located on the left side, are 1.2 x 1.2 m. The  pilot's cockpit is entered through doors at the right and left  side. There is a footboard in the area of each door which is let  down at the same time the doors open and retracted when it is  closed. There is passage between the crew seats to the  cargo-passenger compartment. An emergency exit is located along  its right side.    AIRPLANE SYSTEMS. The electric power supply system is 27 V,  direct current. The electric power sources on the plane are a  3kWt generator and a 25 Amp-hour-capacity storage battery. The  air system provides the engine startup and basic (differential)  and emergency wheel braking, as well as retraction and lowering  of the flaps. The fire-fighting system consists of a fire-signal  system in the engine compartment and a fire-extinguishing  system. The pilots' cockpit and the cargo-passenger compartment  are equipped with a ventilation and heating system.  <H8>  Onboard Equipment </H8>   The plane's piloting-navigation and radio-communication  equipment provide manual plane piloting along the air routes of  local airlines, in the second daytime category, at any time of  year, in accordance with the rules of visual flight over dry  land if no thunder activity is expected, piloting in accordance  with homing radio beacons, manual approach for landing at  airports not equipped for landing by radio-engineering systems,  and also approach according to homing radio beacons. If the  buyer demands it, the plane may be equipped with a  meteorological locator and an autopilot.    The plane's radio equipment consists of two USW-range radio  stations, ensuring two-way voice communication with air-traffic  control services on the ground and other airplanes. In addition,  an air-traffic control transponder and onboard registration  device are installed on the vehicle.    The make-up of all the airplane systems and onboard  equipment  was organized solely on the basis of units and instruments found  in series production.    The basic features of the new aircraft are:     -  Reliability  and good repairability;    -  Simplicity of technological and  structural designs;    -  Use, in the structure, of reasonably priced  materials and domestic units and systems in series  production;    -  Ease of piloting and technical service;    -  The  possibility of operation on the existing network of local  airline airports;    -  Convenience of loading and unloading;    -  Low  cost.    In the development, the task was posed of creating a  simple, inexpensive airplane, meeting the demands of potential  buyers, which could be produced both at large aircraft  enterprises and at small aviation plants.    At the buyer's demand, a T10-540-AE2A Lycoming engine and  set  of Bendix King equipment can be installed on the plane.  <H8>  The State of Development </H8>    -  Manufacturing plan ready;    -  All  experimental and research work completed;    -  A full-scale mock-up  has been built, and the placement of the units and systems on it  has been worked out, as well as the routes and communications  (the mock-up was exhibited at the International Air-Space Show,  Room 93);    -  Manufacture of experimental models of the airplane is  in progress;    -  Contracts have been concluded with Peru and New  Zealand for joint manufacture of series-produced  airplanes.

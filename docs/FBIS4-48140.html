			<p>BFN     [Text] Our special envoy in Rwanda, Jean Helene, met Major  General Paul Kagame, RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] commander,  yesterday in Byumba in the north of the country. He asked him  if he would be in favor of sending foreign troops to Rwanda:    [Begin Kagame recording, in English with superimposed French  translation] We are not bothered about their number; what  concerns us is their role. We have no problem whatsoever with  troops being sent here under the aegis of the United Nations or  any other entity if the intention is to provide humanitarian  assistance. On the other hand, we don't agree with what some  call an intervention force. Given the fact that the genocide  has already taken place with complete impunity, we don't  understand what the role of an intervention force would be. An  intervention force would be inappropriate in the current  circumstances. Such a force would in fact protect those who are  responsible for the genocide. [end recording]</p>

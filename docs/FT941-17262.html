			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Glaxo acts over patent Glaxo has begun further patent infringement action against Genpharm, a Canadian drug manufacturer which wants to make a generic version of Glaxo's Zantac, the world's best selling drug. At stake is a slice of a market that is worth Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a year to Glaxo in the US alone. Glaxo's move is a response to a new challenge to Zantac's patents by Genpharm in the wake of a court ruling in favour of Glaxo in September 1993. Genpharm is now challenging two of Glaxo's US patents on the drug.</p>

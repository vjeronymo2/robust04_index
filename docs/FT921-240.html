			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Crisis for Israeli government asforeign minister Levy resigns THE Israeli government was plunged into crisis last night when Mr David Levy, the foreign minister, announced his resignation after launching a furious attack on Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, for damaging Israel's relationship with the US and dividing the ruling rightwing Likud party. Mr Levy, seething with indignation, transformed a split within Likud ranks that had been festering for a month into a damaging wound just three months ahead of the June general election with an emotional and bitter speech to a meeting in Tel Aviv of his supporters within the party. 'One thing I must certainly do, for the sake of the Likud, for the sake of days to come, for the sake of the state: I have decided to resign from the government,' Mr Levy said. He took care to stress he was not leaving the Likud, as some of his supporters wanted. His resignation will not be submitted until next Sunday, leaving time for efforts to persuade him to rethink, as several senior Likud figures last night said he should. But there was no doubt Mr Levy's move was electoral mannah for an opposition Labour party already marginally ahead of Likud in the opinion polls. The row began in earnest in February when Mr Levy and members of his Likud 'camp' were reduced to lowly positions in the party's list of candidates for the election by an alliance between Mr Shamir, Mr Moshe Arens, defence minister, and Mr Ariel Sharon, housing minister. Subsequent negotiations to mollify Mr Levy came to nothing. Instead, his long-standing differences with Mr Shamir, highlighted by the premier's decision to attend last October's Madrid Middle East Peace Conference as the Israeli delegation head in Mr Levy's place, were exacerbated. Mr Levy's anger at the overruling of his more moderate approach to the peace process by Mr Shamir was clearly evident in his speech last night. He said the recent deterioration of relations with Washington was a 'fundamental mistake' as there was no substitute for close ties with the US, which had arranged the peace negotiations on Israel's terms. Mr Levy also gave vent to the deep resentment he and his supporters - mostly Sephardi, or Oriental Jews - hold towards what they see as the contemptuous attitude shown them by Mr Shamir, Mr Arens and Mr Sharon - all Ashkenazi, or European.</p>

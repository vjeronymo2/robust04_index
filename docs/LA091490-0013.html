			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PACIFIC 10;  </P> <P> IT'S A LONG WAY FROM PARITY TO CORVALLIS  </P> <P> Pacific 10 football coaches constantly talk about parity, saying that the  conference is relatively strong from top to bottom.  </P> <P> Not quite, if early-season results are any indication.  </P> <P> The league apparently has a doormat in Oregon State. The Beavers have already  played the two weakest teams on their schedule, losing to Montana, 22-15, and  to Kansas, 38-12. If Oregon State can't beat Nevada Las Vegas Saturday, it  figures to be a long season for Coach Dave Kragthorpe's team in Corvallis.  </P> <P> Nebraska lies ahead, and so do seven Pac-10 teams -- Stanford, Arizona,  Washington State, UCLA, Arizona State, USC and Oregon.  </P> <P> Kansas, coming off a 59-10 rout by Virginia, recorded eight sacks for 70 yards  in losses while building a 31-0 halftime lead.  </P> <P> The Jayhawks, a perennial second division team in the Big Eight, aren't  accustomed to routing anybody. The Jayhawks haven't had such an easy time since  they beat Kansas State, 38-7, in 1985.  </P> <P> It's the oldest ruse in any playbook, but it still works.  </P> <P> We're referring to the gimmick play, the fumblerooskie.  </P> <P> It worked for Air Force against Notre Dame last year, and it worked again for  Arizona against Illinois Saturday night in Tucson.  </P> <P> Guard Rick Martin ran 24 yards for a touchdown around the right side with a  purposely fumbled handoff as his teammates -- and Illinois players -- dashed  off in the opposite direction.  </P> <P> The ploy gave Arizona a 21-3 lead on its way to a 28-16 victory over the  previously 11th-ranked Illini.  </P> <P> Quick Quiz: California's John Hardy ran 100 yards to a touchdown with an  intercepted pass against Wisconsin, tying a Pac-10 record held by five other  players, three from UCLA. Can you name them?  </P> <P> Glyn Milburn originally wanted to attend Stanford and signed a letter of intent  to that effect. It was invalid, however, because it wasn't signed by a parent  and Milburn was 17 at the time.  </P> <P> So the former Santa Monica High star enrolled at Oklahoma, the school his  stepfather favored.  </P> <P> Milburn played as a true freshman under Barry Switzer in 1988, gaining 124  yards in eight carries, and scoring a touchdown.  </P> <P> As soon as he turned 18 and no longer needed his parents' approval of his  choice of schools, he transferred to Stanford.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-9, 175-pound Milburn sat out the 1989 season but is now a  multipurpose threat as a ballcarrier or kick return specialist for the  Cardinal.  </P> <P> Milburn is a cousin of Rod Milburn, the 1972 Olympic gold medalist in the  110-meter high hurdles.  </P> <P> "We couldn't have beaten USC today," said Washington center Ed Cunningham after  the Huskies had hung on to beat San Jose State, 20-17, Saturday.  </P> <P> Two years ago, San Jose State also extended Washington before losing, 35-31.  </P> <P> In barely getting by the Spartans, the Huskies maintained a recent trend, as  noted by guard Dean Kirkland.  </P> <P> "Ever since I've been here, this team plays to its level of competition," he  said. "Every game is close. For some reason, we rise (or fall) to the level of  the opponent, whether it's the No. 1 or No. 100 team."  </P> <P> Quiz answer: California's Jim Jurkovich against USC, 1940; UCLA's Jimmy Allen  against Cal, 1973; UCLA's Alan Dial against Oregon State, 1986; Arizona's Chuck  Cecil against Arizona State, 1986, and UCLA's Dennis Price against California,  1987.  </P> <P> Cal Coach Bruce Snyder said he has a physical football team after the Bears'  28-12 victory over Wisconsin Saturday.  </P> <P> Cal had 38 running plays and threw 22 passes. Last year, the Bears passed on  seven out of 10 plays with quarterback Troy Taylor.  </P> <P> Wisconsin, though, may not be an accurate gauge of Cal's new prowess. The  Badgers were 2-9 last season. More will be known about Cal after it plays Miami  Saturday at Berkeley.  </P></p>

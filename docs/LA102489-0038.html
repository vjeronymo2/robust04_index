			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NORTH CAROLINA;  </P> <P> 40-YEAR PRISON TERM SOUGHT FOR BAKKER  </P> <P> The Justice Department asked a federal judge to sentence Jim Bakker to at least  40 years in prison, saying that he "lived like a sultan" off donations from the  PTL television ministry. The prosecution's 16-page memorandum to the U.S.  District Court in Charlotte, N. C., said that Bakker, 49, "told his viewers  half-truths, lies and concealed the truth from them to induce them to send  money." Bakker, who founded the ministry but was forced out in a sex scandal in  1987, has been convicted on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. He could receive  up to 120 years in prison when he is sentenced today.  </P></p>

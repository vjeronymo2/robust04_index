			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Wall Street listing for Chinese group Shandong Huaneng Power Development yesterday became the first Chinese company with a primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange following an initial public offering of 23.3m American depositary shares at Dollars 14.25 each. The issue represents about 27 per cent of the outstanding share capital, with each ADS representing 50 common shares. A tranche of additional 3.5m ADSs was allotted to the underwriters to cover over-subscriptions. In early heavy trading the share price held steady at Dollars 14.25. The company, which has interests in coal-fired power plants in Shandong province, south-east of Beijing, is raising about Dollars 337m through the offering. Proceeds will finance an expansion programme aimed at quadrupling generating capacity by the end of the decade. Power demand in the province, which has the second fastest growing local economy in China, already exceeds supply by 14 per cent. Mr John Hennessy, chief executive of CS First Boston, the global co-ordinator of the deal, said the decision to list the stock exclusively on the NYSE and to register it with the US Securities and Exchange Commission was significant for the future of Chinese privatisation. By agreeing to conform to US accounting standards and quarterly reporting requirements, the Chinese were trying to improve investor confidence in the long-term stability of its enterprises, he said. The decision to list on the NYSE also underscores Shandong Huaneng's hearty appetite for foreign capital. It is the first of four Chinese power companies scheduled to launch international IPOs this year. One of them - Huaneng Power International - also plans a primary listing on the NYSE after its flotation this autumn. Four Chinese companies have dual listings on the New York and Hong Kong exchanges.</p>

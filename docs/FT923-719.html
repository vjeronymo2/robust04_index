			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Waterman halves dividend to 1p The increasingly rapid decline in the property and construction markets led to Waterman Partnership making a loss of Pounds 2.72m in the year ended June 30, against a profit of Pounds 113,000. However, this group of consulting engineers continued to generate cash, and is recommending a final dividend of 0.5p, which halves the year's total to 1p, from losses per share of 10.6p (earnings 0.2p). Work done fell from Pounds 11.09 to Pounds 6.26m and there was an operating loss of Pounds 1.21m (profit Pounds 466,000). There was an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.73m (Pounds 609,000) mainly for bad debts and long term contracts.</p>

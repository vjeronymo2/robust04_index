			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / US, Germany clinch air deal Germany and the US signed an agreement on air transport yesterday, paving the way for closer co-operation by Lufthansa, the German national carrier, and United Airlines. The negotiations, which involved Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Bill Clinton, will lead to ticket code-sharing by the two airlines and give their clients reciprocal rights to incentive packages, such as frequent-flyer programmes. The deal came after a separate US decision on Thursday night to extend for a year a similar agreement between British Airways and USAir. A memorandum of understanding, signed by Mr Matthias Wissmann, German transport minister, and Mr Federico Pena, US transportation secretary, also leaves the possibility of other US airlines gaining limited access to the code-sharing arrangements. Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chief executive, said the deal, allowing the two airlines to market each other's flights under the same ticketing code, would come into effect on May 1. It will last four years before leading to a broader agreement between the two countries. The deal gives Lufthansa better access to Caribbean and South American routes, while United can increase flights to eastern Europe and beyond. Under the code-sharing provisions, passengers will be able to make connecting flights on both sides of the Atlantic with only one check-in and will benefit by better connections between the two airlines. Lufthansa will also have more access to destinations in the US, the west's largest aviation market. German officials said the deal would correct the imbalance between US and German carriers which was created by a 1955 post-war agreement. Under that, US carriers captured 76 per cent of traffic between the two countries. The officials said the talks had faced 'incredible pressure' from other US carriers seeking greater access to Germany and trying to block the United-Lufthansa partnership. The number of US flights to Germany will be frozen for the next two years and increase modestly in the next two. The code-sharing is expected to increase Lufthansa's trans-Atlantic revenues as the carrier prepares for privatisation. On Thursday, the company announced lower losses of DM50m (Pounds 19.4m) for 1993, through progress in its restructuring. That is compared with DM297m for the previous year.</p>

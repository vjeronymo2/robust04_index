			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Arts: Abstracted memories - Recent work by Anthony Whishaw and photographs from the Hulton Deutsch collection The curving Concourse Gallery of the Barbican is a notoriously difficult space for painters, who would rather put a flat canvas on a flat wall. The gallery is also enormous. But Royal Academician Anthony Whishaw, at 63 one of our more senior and distinguished artists, fills it without apparent difficulty, and only with his work of the last eight years. The paintings are abstracted rather than abstract, in that they simplify and re-order the reference they make to real experience and the visible world. Whishaw has said of his associative landscape paintings of the earlier 1980s, that he was extremely alive to the sensation one has at the periphery of vision in walking through a wood, with twigs and moths flicking now this way, now that. This sense of sublimated visual activity remains, though turned now to the movement or presence of the figure, or groups of figures, or of waves crashing on the beach. He refers as much to art as to nature, to Japanese screen painting and, most of all, to the Spanish masters, from Velasquez to Picasso and Tapies. Spain is a country and culture he finds all-absorbing. The influence is clear enough, yet in the studio interiors and courtyards, in his reworking of cubism, and in his stiffer handling of the paint itself, he is closer, perhaps, to Picasso's high-cubist colleague, the Frenchman, Braque, and most of all to Braque of the last great studio still-lifes. And like all his heroes - like Picasso himself, Braque, Goya and Velasquez, indeed like all and any artist - whatever else he is, Whishaw is a symbolist, concerning himself, openly and on a grand scale, with great themes and universal experience. Even images of the landscape or the sea, l'immensite of Courbet, readily take on such possibilities, but here, in such series as his 'Blind leading the Blind', they become explicit. Memory and Reflection is the subtitle to this exhibition. Whishaw makes much of meeting an old woman whom he came upon, sitting alone in the village of Bulcayado, now quite deserted, that was still her home. The paintings he has made of her, 'Reverie', sitting in her empty house or by the sea, are at the heart of his work, as they are at the heart of this memorable exhibition. On the upper level of the Barbican's Art Gallery is All Human Life, a personal selection of some 500 images from the Hulton Deutsch Collection. Bruce Bernard, the photographic historian, was left to make his choice quite unhindered by theme or prescription, which must have been a daunting, if enthralling, undertaking. The collection is based on the old Hulton Picture Library, set up in 1944 as the archive of Picture Post. It has since taken over a number of other press archives and collections, and now amounts to something over 15 million items. Bernard, quite rightly, has trusted to nothing more than his eye for an image and an idiosyncratic humour that is by turns sardonic, surreal and very funny. Victorian and Edwardian photographs are included, and the period of selection extends to the late 1950s, but no chronology is attempted. The substance of the show is set in the golden age of photo-reportage, from the 1920s to the 1950s and the end of Picture Post itself. Those times were as desperate as any, and here are horrors enough to account for them, images of destitution and disaster, brutality and carnage. Yet always it is the personal image that haunts the imagination, not the soldiers dead in a ditch so much as the young, rapt faces of Nazi Youth, Dr Goebbels running from his car, Stalin smiling. But not All Human Life is so sinister, least of all in Bernard's mischievous eye. Life goes on even though a child crawls in the Berlin gutter, or homeless families camp in the mud of the New Forest. The Office Window Box must still be dressed, the invoices still despatched from the Wax-Model factory where a disembodied hand sits on the desk. There are still children to feed, birds to stuff, races to be run, bikes to ride on the high-wire in the back-garden, fun to be had. Anthony Whishaw: On Memory and Reflection; Barbican Concourse Gallery until March 6, then on to Ayr, Exeter, Huddersfield, Dublin, Newcastle, Newport and Bolton. All Human Life: photographs from the Hulton Deutsch Collection; Barbican Art Gallery until April 24.</p>

According to the poll, taken throughout 1993  on the initiative of the newspaper's editorial board and the VP  Public Opinion Study Service, the final list of more than 100  most influential politicians of Russia in 1993 is headed by  President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.  The newspaper also carries chronology of all most significant  dates and events in Russia in the past year.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA on Russia's military doctrine and reforming  of the country's armed forces:    "As far as the development of the country's armed forces is  concerned, the year 1994 will be notable for the fact that the  country already has available a practically complete 'military  package' of laws, right up to basic military regulations.    "The 'basic provisions of a military doctrine of the Russian  Federation', adopted at the end of last year, make the work on  the development of the armed forces still more conscious  politically, militarily, economically and from the viewpoint of  military technology.    "However, all that does not at all mean that the new  parliament will have nothing to do in the field of military  legislation. On the contrary, rather. Life brings forth new  and new tasks aimed at fostering a sense of patriotism in  Russian people, pride for one's native land, and readiness to  defend it. We must maintain and enhance the defence capability  of the state and the combat readiness of the army".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with President  Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who dwelt in detail on  Kazakhstan-Russia relations and their role in the rallying of  other sovereign CIS countries.    Having pointed out in particular that "unity is the way to  the prosperity of Russia and Kazakhstan", Nazarbayev explained  that "strategically Kazakhstan should be in alliance with  Russia. Both Kazakhstan and russia now need each other".    Noting the multi-ethnicity of his country, Nazarbayev said  this is why "sovereign Kazakhstan is responsible for the  equality of other nations".    TRUD runs an interview with Arkady Volsky, one of the  leaders  of the Civic Union, who, upon having recognised the setback  suffered by the bloc at the December 12 elections in Russia,  nevertheless pointed out that "the Civic Union representatives  in the State Duma are intent on constructive work".    "We are prepared to back any realistic and welllfounded  bills  aimed at promoting real reforms that are of benefit to all  people in Russia," Volsky said.    Touching upon a possible participation of representatives of  the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, headed by  him, in the work of the Russian Government, Volsky said "We are  redy to join the government but, naturally, such a government in  which our philosophy of reforms without 'shock' and unnecessary  social by- effects would be shared. We are ready for the most  resolute steps towards reforms but according to the principle:  Measure seven times and cut off once".    PRAVDA on U.S. President Bill Clinton's forthcoming tour  (beginning on January 8) of a number of European countries,  including Russia and Belarus:    "The busy schedule of the U.S. President's European tour is  believed to demonstrate the activeness of U.S. foreign policy  and Washington's leadership in the post-Cold-War period."    The tour "does not promise to be simple and easy. In the  changing world, American claims to leadership are in need of  continuous backing by specific deeds or new ideas capable of  taking the fancy of allies and partners. So far, there are not  so many such ideas in the new administration's foreign-policy  bag".    On the eve of Christmas, celebrated in Russia on January 7,  all today's newspapers carry articles calling on people to do  good and show tolerance in the country's present-day difficult  situation, relate the history of the holiday, its peculiarities  and traditions.</p>

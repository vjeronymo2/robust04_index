Quality Control_Compliance Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FSIS agrees with the commenters' views regarding the lack of need for a requirement for a mandatory approved quality control program. After reviewing the comments and re-examining the Agency's current regulatory agenda, FSIS has concluded that because there are efforts underway within the Agency to study and address ways of reducing the potential for situations that would render any meat or poultry product adulterated, unwholesome, and/or misbranded it is premature to address the need for a mandatory quality control program for meat derived by this one distinct type of system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, although FSIS has concluded that a mandatory quality control program is not needed, recordkeeping, a certain provision that would be part of any mandatory quality control program, as set forth in 9 CFR 318.4, is still needed to prevent noncompliance with the definition of meat and to minimize the likelihood of manufacturing products that do not comply with regulatory requirements. FSIS has concluded that a records maintenance program for assuring product complies with the calcium content criteria is still needed and that the records must reflect data compiled in a prescribed way, i.e., the compliance procedure set forth in its proposed regulation. In regard to this matter, the proposed regulation stated that a prerequisite for label approval for meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems was that it should be produced by an establishment under an approved quality control program, which had to be approved in accordance with 9 CFR 318.4 (d)(1), (d)(2), and (e). The proposed regulation also indicated that the quality control system should provide the controls and information necessary to ensure it meets the requirements for the product and enables establishment personnel and program employees to monitor the system for effectiveness. Furthermore, as part of the approval process, 9 CFR 318.4(d) requires a letter to be submitted by the establishment which indicates that all data and information generated by the program will be maintained to enable the Department to monitor compliance and it also requires that the length of time the records will be maintained be stated. Thus, recordkeeping was clearly part of a quality control program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The records of data from testing must be available to the inspector or any other duly authorized representative of the Agency. The availability of these types of records for review was part of FSIS' proposed regulations for a required quality control program. The quality control program was required to provide the information necessary to enable program personnel to monitor the system for effectiveness, and it set up the method for determining calcium content compliance, which is being adopted as part of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The goal of preventing misbranding and adulteration are key issues with regard to meat products produced by mechanical meat/bone separation, and can be achieved effectively and efficiently where a monitoring and testing program incorporates appropriate methods and monitoring techniques, and adheres to good manufacturing practices. FSIS believes that product exceeding the calcium limit should not be classified as meat because it would reflect unacceptable incorporation of bone in the product during processing. To ensure that product satisfies the calcium requirement, FSIS is maintaining the position that a compliance program, as described below and set forth in its proposal, be used by manufacturers of meat from advanced systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to obtain the data to ensure compliance with the calcium requirement, a sample of at least 1 pound from each lot of production would be taken and analyzed for calcium. A lot would consist of the meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems, designated as such by the operator of the establishment or his or her agent, from the product produced from a single species of livestock in no more than one continuous shift of up to 12 hours. The results from chemical analyses would be compared to the requirement of 150 mg/100 gm of product within a tolerance of 0.03 percent or 30 mg. If statistical evidence exists that product may not be in compliance, then further sampling of the product would ensue to demonstrate that the product is in compliance with requirements for meat derived from meat/bone separation and recovery systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statistical evidence of non-compliance exists when an individual analytical result is more than 0.03 percent (i.e., 30 mg) above the requirement, i.e., greater than 0.18 percent (i.e., 180 mg). (This tolerance is derived by equating it to three times the expected standard deviation (i.e., 0.1 percent) of the analytical procedure used by FSIS to measure the calcium contents in samples.) <FOOTCITE> <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> </FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Data from a FSIS study are available in the FSIS Docket Clerk's Office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

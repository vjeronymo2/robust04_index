			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Crisis fails to boost the dollar THE POLITICAL crisis in Moscow continued to throw a shadow over the D-Mark in Europe, but the dollar weakened in spite of President Yeltsin's difficulties, writes James Blitz. The German currency's recent strength inside the European exchange rate mechanism was sapped, as dealers believed that turmoil in the former Soviet Union provided a serious political and economic challenge to Germany. The French franc rose above FFr3.40 to the D-Mark at one stage, closing almost unchanged at FFr3.404. But the dollar closed at DM1.6315, down more than  1/2 a pfennig on the day. In times of international crisis, the dollar tends to rally because of perceptions that it is a safe haven currency. Its weakness yesterday may have been due to a belief that the Russian crisis had not yet reached boiling point. A more concrete factor was the feeling that the Bundesbank was showing a new caution about easing its money market interest rates. The German central bank announced yesterday that it would be offering wholesale funds to German commercial banks at variable interest rates in its weekly money market operation today. This may cause its main money market rate - or repo - to rise above the current level of 8.25 per cent due to the strong competition for funds among commercial banks, which are aiming to meet the end-of-month minimum reserve requirements. The latest inflation figure for North Rhine Westphalia, which rose 0.4 per cent in February for a year-on year rise of 4.2 per cent, was also higher than the market expected. 'All of these factors underlined recent statements from Bundesbank officials that they have done as much as possible to ease rates for the time being,' said Mr Jeremy Hawkins of Bank of America in London. Mr Steve Hannah of IBJ International in London believes the scene may be set for a dollar fall below DM1.60 in the next few days. In his view, German call money is unlikely to fall very far before the end of the month, making it expensive for dealers to stay long of dollars. There will also be little to support the dollar until the end of next week when the Bundesbank council meets and the US non-farm payroll figure for March appears. The dollar was sharply weaker against the yen, falling to a new record closing low of Y115.33 in Tokyo on Tuesday. In London, the dollar closed a little stronger at Y116.2. The Japanese currency continues to be buoyed by repatriation of funds by Japanese banks and corporates before the financial year-end on March 31. There are also signs of green shoots in the Japanese economy, with the industrial production figures yesterday showing their first month-on-month rise since last September.</p>

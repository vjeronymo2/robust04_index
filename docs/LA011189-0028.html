			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POETRY READING REVIEW;  </P> <P> PERSONAL MOMENTS WITH ALICE WALKER  </P> <P> Alice Walker is unexpected -- simpler, smaller and far more understated than  one anticipated.  </P> <P> Her works are so strong in their convictions, so self-assured and direct in  their statements, that to find them emanating from an imperturbable slender  woman, her corn rows lightly brushing girlish shoulders, comes as a vast  surprise.  </P> <P> Yet that was precisely the impression received Monday, when this poet and  novelist, who won a Pulitzer Prize for "The Color Purple," put in an appearance  at the Los Angeles Theatre Center as part of the center's ongoing poetry  series. Making it happen, said series producer Alan Mandel in his introduction,  took three years of relentless pursuit.  </P> <P> "It took three years," Walker said when she came on, "because some things take  three years."  </P> <P> The statement was not facetious, defensive or playful, but evenhanded -- a key  to the woman before us who, in the next 80 minutes offered not only poetry and  prose from her own collections (published and to be published), but just such  tempered wisdom as well.  </P> <P> Unfazed by the bombed-out set for the center's current production of "Stars in  the Morning Sky" on which she stood, Walker diligently, but without hurry, set  about the task at hand. Within seconds, the background was forgotten. Her  informal mix of earthiness and ethereality flooded the room.  </P> <P> By way of introducing herself to the packed auditorium, she read the only poem  printed in the program: "How Poems Are Made/A Discredited View." It was as much  a personal credo as a springboard from which the evening would take off, with  its other poems, prose passages and candid sharing of selective information  ("poetry is so difficult, but at the same time, I was saving my life when I  wrote").  </P> <P> Walker took her audience through excerpts from her "Revolutionary Petunias" (a  collection of poems), spoke of growing up in Eatonton, Ga., with her brothers  and sisters and making a choice in her late teens between going to West Africa  or moving to Mississippi. "On the morning that I was going to Senegal, I went  to Jackson and stayed there for seven years," she said, important years, during  which she became a woman and began to see this different South with new eyes.  </P> <P> She invited us to share her losses with the same curious mix of passion and  detachment that she had applied in writing (and now reading) about them,  telling us of her sister, Molly, "who, in the '50s, left us . . ." and the  burial of her father's grandmother ("Not pretty, but serviceable, a hard  worker," who mothered seven children). "I cried," she said, reading, "not for  the dead, but for the memories . . . seen from the angle of her death."  </P> <P> There was humor in a light poem about the challenge of exercise and, among  other work, fleeting but telling references to herself (". . . me, destined to  be wayward . . .") or the larger womanist self ("I am the woman dark, repaired,  healed . . ." who brings two flowers with twin roots: Justice and Hope, Hope  and Justice.)  </P> <P> Walker's selections, much like her books, seemed made to instruct by  indirection. There were statements that half-qualified as confessions but never  went too far. "Expect nothing," she had read from another poem. "Live frugally  on surprises. Be nobody's darling. Be an outcast. Be pleased to walk alone.  Uncool."  </P> <P> This is an artist who values her insularity and carefully guards her mystery.  She tells enough to startle, never to satiate.  </P> <P> Her poem "The Mornings of Rain," for example, was written, she confessed, to  celebrate the rebirth of her ability to create poetry after a longish period of  drought; "First They Said," an amusing litany of complaints against all black  people with a serious twist ending, is Walker's own humorous but sober comment  on bigotry everywhere.  </P> <P> For a change of pace and tone (and dialect), she read from "The Color Purple":  Celie's letter to her sister Nettie about giving up writing to God. The evening  ended with two passages from her just-finished novel, "The Temple of My  Familiar" (to be published in May), which Walker described as covering 500,000  years of history and mystery, a book "about remembering and trusting your own  innate ability . . . ."  </P> <P> The first segment was a wife's seriocomic effort to divorce her husband while  still wanting to remain with him in an unmarried state that she considers "more  fun." The second picks up on "Color Purple's" Shug after Celie's death. It  seems Shug found religion and wrote a "Gospel According to Shug." As Walker  dispensed its meticulous, eloquent invocations, it became clear that this was  also a gospel according to Alice.  </P> <P> Why do people love to listen to poets reading their own works? Is it because  the poet, like the groundhog, tends to remain elusive? Is it a quest for  demystification? Some poets -- though not Alice Walker who reads her work like  an angel -- don't even do it very well. It boils down to something simpler:  Knowing the words and wanting to know the person; loving the words and wanting  to "touch" the person.  </P> <P> When the late Joseph Campbell wrote about "finding your bliss," he was being  neither coy nor deliberately obscure. He knew it was a thing one would innately  recognize -- either in oneself upon achieving it, or when one came across it in  someone else who had.  </P> <P> The lucky people who saw Walker on Monday were in the presence of a woman who,  at least momentarily, had found her "bliss." She stood at the radiant epicenter  of her being where everything becomes possible -- and touched us all.  </P></p>

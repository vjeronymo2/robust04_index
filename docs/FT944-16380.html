			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: Weyerhaeuser's profits disappoint Wall Street Continuing strength in timber prices and rebounding pulp and packaging markets boosted Weyerhaeuser's third quarter earnings, but the profits jump fell short of Wall Street's expectations, the company's stock price closing down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 41 3/8 yesterday. Weyerhaeuser, the world's largest private owner of saleable softwood timber, reported third-quarter earnings - before extraordinary charges  - of Dollars 144m, or 71 cents a share, compared with income of Dollars 67m, or 32 cents, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 2.68bn, up from Dollars 2.22bn last year. Analysts had expected Weyerhaeuser to earn about 77 cents a share in the quarter. For the year to date, Weyerhaeuser earnings total Dollars 399.8m, or Dollars 1.95, on sales of Dollars 7.6bn, compared with Dollars 477m, or Dollars 2.33, on sales of Dollars 6.9bn for last year's corresponding period. The company's pulp, paper and packaging arm saw operating earnings jump to Dollars 63.5m in the quarter, from Dollars 2.5m in 1993's third quarter. Weyerhaeuser's big forest product division's operating earnings rose to Dollars 246.1m, from Dollars 165.8m. 'The company continues to realise steady improvements in earnings as the momentum in the recovering pulp, paper, and packaging markets continues,' Mr John Creighton, president, said. 'At the same time, our timberlands and wood products performance remains strong in spite of increasing interest rates. While it appears that housing starts in the US have peaked, we are in the early stages of the economic recoveries in Europe and Japan which bodes well for continued strengthening in our pulp and paper businesses.' Weyerhaeuser is the second US forest products group to fall short of analysts' estimates this quarter. On Tuesday, International Paper's stock fell after it revealed a 47 per cent third-quarter profits rise. Tenneco plans to spend Dollars 73m upgrading the linerboard capacity at its Packing Corporation of America division. The investment will boost PCA's linerboard output by 16 per cent and give Tenneco a stronger hold in the rapidly rebounding containerboard market. Linerboard is used to make corrugated boxes. The investment in its packaging division is part of Tenneco's strategy to redeploy capital into high-return growth opportunities in its packaging, automotive parts and natural gas businesses. Last week, the company announced a Dollars 60m acquisition for its Tenneco Gas unit.</p>

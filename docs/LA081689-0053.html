			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> N.M. AGENCY GETS STATIC AFTER BEAR SUFFERS 7,200-VOLT JOLT  </P> <P> A state agency was criticized Tuesday for tranquilizing a black bear atop a  25-foot utility pole without shutting the power off or using a net to break its  fall.  </P> <P> To the horror of spectators, the woozy 150-pound bear fell off the pole Monday,  bounced off a transformer and tumbled to the ground amid a cascade of sparks.  The bear became tangled in electrical wire as it fell and received a 7,200-volt  jolt when it hit the transformer, a utility spokesman said.  </P> <P> The female bear, believed to have wandered into town from the nearby Sandia  Mountains, was taken to the Rio Grande Zoological Park, where she was doing  well, officials said. The bear suffered an electrical burn on her right hind  leg.  </P> <P> "We've received quite a bit of calls -- primarily criticism," said Mark  Birkhauser, a conservation officer with the New Mexico Department of Game and  Fish. "Public opinion in general seems to think it wasn't handled as well as it  could have been."  </P> <P> A department officer shot a tranquilizer dart into the bear after it had been  chased through a residential neighborhood. The bear was believed to have been  searching for a lost cub. A 6-month-old cub was captured Sunday in a mulberry  tree in Albuquerque.  </P> <P> The cub, which was being kept separate from the adult bear at the zoo, is fine,  Birkhauser said.  </P> <P> "The main concerns of callers was that the bear was tranquilized while too high  on the utility pole and no attempt was made to cushion its fall, and that  electrical power wasn't shut off before the animal was shot down," Merrilyn  Segrest, deputy supervisor at the Animal Humane Assn. in Albuquerque, said.  </P></p>

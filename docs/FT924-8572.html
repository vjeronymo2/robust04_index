			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TURNOVER IN stock index futures fell to its lowest level for nearly a year, as investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of the chancellor's autumn statement on Thursday, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,727, the December contract on the FT-SE Index briefly sprang to life, moving forward to 2,733 within minutes of the opening. But with no enthusiasm for dealing, December quickly lost its early momentum and fell back to register the day's low of 2,717. Thereafter, the contract was traded in a fairly narrow range of 2,720 and 2,731, but with little in the way of actual buying or selling. Dealers pointed, however, to the continued healthy premium to fair value, which some put down to lack of liquidity in both cash and futures. December ended the session at 2,723, down 9 from Friday's close and around 9 points above its estimated fair value premium of about 17. Turnover, at 3,932, was the lowest recorded since December 1991. Traded options suffered from the same malaise and volume reached a meagre 17,563 lots. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was 6,330, up from Friday's 4,556. Among stock options, J. Sainsbury was the most actively traded, recording a total of 2,002 trades. This was followed by Tesco with 1,806 deals and Asda on 1,146. Hanson also had a busy day with some 1,132 lots dealt in its options.</p>

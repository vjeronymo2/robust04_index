			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> PORT DISTRICT FUNDS APPROVED BY HOUSE  </P> <P> Breakwater improvements and annual funding for dredging in Ventura Harbor have  been approved by the House of Representatives.  </P> <P> If passed by the Senate and signed into law, $1.27 million would be budgeted  for dredging and $300,000 for the breakwater improvements for the 1990-91  fiscal year beginning Oct 1.  </P> <P> "We're optimistic that the Senate will approve appropriations similar to those  of the House," said Richard Parsons, general manager of the Ventura Port  District.  </P> <P> The $300,000 would go toward preliminary engineering and design for fortifying  and extending the breakwater. The total cost of the project is estimated at  $6.5 million.  </P> <P> The breakwater would keep some ocean debris from the harbor, so dredging could  be done every two years instead of annually, officials said.  </P> <P> The House also voted to give $300,000 to the Army Corps of Engineers to help  Ventura and Santa Barbara counties evaluate emergency water supply options  during the drought.  </P> <P> "Almost anything having to do with water requires a permit from the corps, so  we decided to get a head start and involve them right away. Plus they have the  technical expertise to help out," said John Doherty, an aide to Rep. Robert J.  Lagomarsino (R-Ventura).  </P> <P> Options the corps and local agencies will evaluate include shipping in water  from Canada, recycling used water for irrigation and using desalination units.

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Shipping group faces cartel fine COMPAGNIE Financiere Delmas-Vieljeux (CFDV), France's leading shipping group, is likely to be fined by the European Commission today for its involvement in a cartel which allegedly eliminated competition between freight lines operating between France and West Africa. The Commission is also expected to impose conditions on the operation of freight services between France and French-speaking West African countries. Officials refused to comment on the level of the fine, or the extent of the restrictions ahead of today's full Commission meeting, but the punishment is likely to be severe. The Danish government and the Danish shipowners' association complained to the Commission that CFDV - part of Bollore, the French transport and industrial conglomerate - was at the centre of a shipowners' cartel called Secretama, which managed shipping trade with African countries. Other French and European companies involved will also be fined. Bollore was forced to buy out the minority shareholders in CFDV for FFr1.1bn (Pounds 110m) last year, following a landmark stock exchange ruling. The group has claimed that CFDV never revealed the extent or seriousness of the Commission's investigation.</p>

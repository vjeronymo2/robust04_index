			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EASTERN PILOTS AGREE TO INTERIM 25% PAY CUT THROUGH MEDIATOR  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines today announced an interim contract agreement with its pilots  union that calls for a 25% wage cut and said the pact does not call for  rehiring those who walked out in March of last year.  </P> <P> Eastern also warned that the pact was temporary and would have to be  renegotiated by July 1 because it allows for only about half the cost  reductions the debt-plagued carrier requires to emerge from Chapter 11  bankruptcy reorganization.  </P> <P> Eastern insisted the National Mediation Board would have to continue efforts to  reach a permanent agreement to further cut costs. Spokesmen for the pilots  union could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> "If expedited mediation is not successful in leading to such an arrangement,  Eastern . . . will have to promptly seek bankruptcy court permission to achieve  full cost reductions on a long-term basis," the carrier said in its release.  </P> <P> The pilots and the airline have been meeting since September under the auspices  of the mediation board.  </P> <P> Eastern's approximately 850 pilots are being paid at the pre-strike wage rate  of about $72,000 a year and under the agreement would take a 25% cut.  </P> <P> Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the cuts would not affect approximately 950  replacement pilots, who earn $27,500 a year. Their pay would not be raised to  the same contract levels as pre-strike pilots.  </P></p>

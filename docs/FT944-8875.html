			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Economic news drives equity prices higher - Market Report An impressive set of domestic economic data, which drove UK gilts sharply better after an uncertain opening, came to the rescue of a London equity market showing distinct signs of running out of steam early yesterday. The FT-SE 100-share Index finished another busy session a net 11.1 higher at 3,146.5, but well below the day's best of 3,168.1 reached shortly before Wall Street opened for business. Demand for equities was not confined to the leaders; the FT-SE Mid 250 index put on another powerful performance, closing 22 stronger at 3,582.7. All the economic details released yesterday pointed to lessening inflationary pressures in the UK. This news, combined with the minutes of the recent meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, which revealed that the two agreed there was no need for further increases in UK interest rates in the short term, gave a strong shot in the arm to gilts and equities. Before the economic news was announced, London's stock market had wilted after the late slide on Wall Street following the 75 basis-point rise in the Federal Funds rate. The extent of the increase took the US market by surprise; most US analysts had expected the Federal Reserve to lift rates by 50 points and to warn of more rises if economic indicators pointed to further inflationary pressure. But it was believed that yesterday's higher than expected US retail sales figures and other economic data had tipped the balance in favour of the larger rise in the US. Leading dealers said the market had blazed ahead after the inflation news, with solid institutional demand driving the FT-SE 100 above 3,155, a level regarded as a major upside break point. 'It was all one-way traffic until we reached 3,155,' said one, 'but once we got above that level it was all sellers; we seem to have reached a crucial trading level and we could face a bout of profit-taking tomorrow.' On the other hand, the head of marketmaking at one of the UK securities houses was unequivocally bullish of the London market. 'There was never any real selling pressure and I feel that we could go further as long as Wall Street behaves,' he said. Strategists adopted a positive tone about the market. Mr Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull described yesterday's inflation news as 'the perfect background for the chancellor to present a positive Budget; fears of an interest rise in the near term have diminished substantially'. While Mr Richard Jeffrey, equity market strategist at Charterhouse Tilney, said the economic statistics were 'a reminder that the UK is still doing very well'. Another bull point, observers said, was the upsurge in activity in the market in the past two sessions which have witnessed a series of big individual trades, via institutional trading programmes, bought deals and buy-backs. Tuesday's surge of activity included customer business worth an extremely heavy Pounds 2.62bn, the highest for many weeks and inflated by Boots' Pounds 500m share buy-back and Goldman Sachs' Pounds 160m trading programme. Turnover yesterday totalled 815.2m shares, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for 58 per cent. The water and electricity stocks came in for strong support from the institutions, the latter after the electricity industry regulator indicated his willingness to see the individual regional electricity companies sell their holdings in the National Grid. Optimism over dividend prospects helped drive the water stocks forward. Hints of imminent moves in the VSEL takeover battle produced keen support for the group, while dealers reported more murmurings of possible predatory moves against SG Warburg.</p>

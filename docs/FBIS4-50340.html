			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Singapore Prime  Minister Goh Chok Tong urged the West today to stop seeing Asia  as a threat and trying to slow Asia's growth.    Speaking at the opening session of the Asia Society  International Corporate Conference, which will run through  Thursday [19 May] with the theme "Waves of the Future - ASEAN,  Vietnam and China: Opportunities for World Business", Goh said  if the West continues to see Asia as a threat and tries to slow  its growth, both Asia and the West will lose.    "If the West blocks the emerging Asian countries, especially  China, from world markets, it will force them to turn inward.  They will be less open and be less cooperative  internationally," he said.    As a consequence, the West will be threatened not merely by  the loss of exports and slower domestic growth, but with global  insecurity, including the risks of losing the assets it already  has in Asia, the prime minister warned.    In his speech, entitled "Asia - Opportunities, Not Threats",  Goh said China's emergence will be the largest phenomenon in the  world economy over the next few decades.    The entry into the international market by countries like  China, India and Vietnam has changed the pattern of world trade  and investment, he noted.    Unfortunately, as the prime minister said, the West was  ambivalent in welcoming and encouraging the growth of these  countries. Some Western leaders, politicians, trade unionists  and opinion-makers see Asia's emergence as a threat rather than  an opportunity.    He said attempts to check imports from Asian countries,  where  wages were low, betrayed the West's fear of competition from  Asia and its growing sense of economic insecurity.    Referring clearly to the recent efforts by some developed  countries to introduce social clauses on workers' rights and  minimum wages into the international trade agreements, Goh said,  "These thinly-veiled protectionist measures are short-sighted."    He said that Asia's growth will be slowed, but it will not  be  stopped, given the region's diversity in natural resources, wage  levels, skills and technology, and capital, as people in Asia  save more than the rest of the world.    He urged the United States to heed what Richard Nixon wrote  in his last book, that the Chinese may one day threaten to  withhold most-favored-nation status from the U.S. unless it does  more to improve living conditions in Detroit, Harlem and South  Central Los Angeles.    "Whichever the scenario, the West would have much to lose by  not being a partner in Asia's growth," Goh said.    The conference, organized by the Asia Society, Dow Jones and  Company, Inc. and the Institute of Policy Studies, Singapore, is  attended by some 800 delegates from 21 countries and regions.    In addition to Goh Chok Tong, New Zealand Prime Minister  James Bolger, Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, Senior  Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, and Vice Premier of China Li  Lanqing, and other high-ranking government officials from the  participating countries are also scheduled to deliver their  keynote speeches at the conference on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>

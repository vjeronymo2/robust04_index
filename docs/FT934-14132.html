			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US ultimatum over Japan building bids - Tokyo rejects November 1 deadline THE US will impose sanctions on Japan on November 1 unless Tokyo agrees to open its construction market to bids from foreign companies, according to US officials in Tokyo. Feelers have been received indicating that the Japanese might have further proposals during the overall 'framework' talks in Tokyo this week. However, anything less than a deathbed conversion is unlikely to be unacceptable. The US and Japan have for seven years been at odds over US demands that Japan open its construction market further to foreign companies and increase transparency in its bidding system. After all the grandly trumpeted agreements, US companies have achieved only a 0.07 per cent share of the Japanese public sector construction and design market and 0.003 per cent share of the private sector market. The US set an initial deadline for Japan to meet its demands in opening the construction market in July, which was extended to November 1 by the US Trade Representative. The US has indicated that unless an agreement between the two sides is in place on November 1, barring intervention by President Bill Clinton, sanctions covering all government procurement that is not covered by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would automatically go into effect. How many projects and sales this covers has not yet been determined, but it is expected to be modest. In June the US indicated that it was looking to Japan to fulfil four principles in opening up its construction market: an open and competitive bidding system, application of such a system in all big projects above a certain level, greater enforcement of anti-monopoly laws, and the enhancement of annual data collection to assess progress made. Mr Kozo Igarashi, Japan's construction minister, has recently indicated his determination to try to solve the construction row before the November 1 deadline, but so far a Japanese proposal to reform its bidding process has not been received very well by the US. The Japanese authorities are offering to introduce a conditional open bidding system which would allow companies ranked as 'A-class' by the Construction Ministry to bid in certain projects. The proposal has not gone over well with the US, in part because as far as the ministry is concerned no foreign company has ever been 'A' ranked, according to a senior US official. 'This whole problem sounds a lot like a Catch-22,' the official remarked. The Japanese proposal also includes a disqualification process but no guarantee that companies would be told in advance of how they might be disqualified, the official said. Washington believes that as Tokyo has wide discretion about who can bid, there will be considerable room for discrimination. Meanwhile, Japanese officials continue to refuse to accept the deadline, which they claim was set by the US without warning and although the formal deadline for US sanctions is fast approaching, no talks have been arranged so far between the two sides. 'The deadline was announced out of the blue,' protested a Japanese Construction Ministry official dealing with the negotiations. 'No country is going to change its own domestic way of doing things because it is being threatened with sanctions by another country.' In Washington, officials scoff at the suggestion that the US is rushing the process. They have fully expected US-Japan trade relations to worsen before they improve. They are poised to take a tough stand here and elsewhere both to show Tokyo they mean business and to send the same message to a restive Congress.</p>

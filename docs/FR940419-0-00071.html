			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Removal of Alternate I to paragraph (e). One commenter recommended that Alternate I of paragraph (e) of the clause, which applies to non-Superfund contracts, be removed. We disagree. Since the types of work exempted from flow down in paragraph (e) are unlikely to be performed in non-Superfund contracts, it would be confusing to include this language in such contracts. In the event these types of work are included in the contract, the Contracting Officer may authorize exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;73, Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding Personnel, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is added for Superfund contracts to ensure that contractors notify the Contracting Officer of actual or potential personal conflicts of interest prior to incurring costs for an employee where the contractor is aware that the employee has a personal conflict of interest. The clause also identifies specific subcontracts and consultant agreements for which this clause is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of public comment, the following changes have been made: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _The term ``apparent'' has been removed in response to comments that the term is vague and difficult to define.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Paragraph (a) has been modified slightly to make the language clearer that the provisions with regard to employee personnel performing under this contract shall apply until the earlier ``of the following two dates: the termination date of the affected employee(s) or the expiration date of this contract.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Paragraph (b) has been rewritten to clarify that a contractor is responsible for reporting personal conflicts of interest regarding its subcontractor employees and consultants when such conflicts have been reported to the contractor. This clarification is made in response to public concern that a contractor is unlikely to have knowledge of the personal conflicts of interest of its subcontractors' employees and should not be held responsible for identifying such personal conflicts of interest unless they have been brought to its attention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The prescription to this clause, paragraph (c)(2) of EPAAR 1509.508, Solicitation provision and contract clauses, has been redesignated as paragraph (b), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause, to conform with recent numbering changes to FAR Subpart 9.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The prescription language to this clause has also been changed to be consistent with the prescription to the Organizational Conflict of Interest Clause. The final prescription, paragraph (b), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2 Contract clause, includes a small purchase limitation threshold. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other comments and EPA's response include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Personal conflict of interest certification and disclosure. A number of commenters expressed concern that it is unfair and too burdensome to require contractors to certify that all personal conflicts had been reported. They stressed that since contractors have to rely on their employees to report such conflicts that all that should be required is a good faith effort to obtain such information. Some requested that disclosure be limited to those personal conflicts of which the contractor has knowledge. A concern was also raised that prime contractors should not be put in a position to certify that there are no personal conflicts of interest regarding subcontractor employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree and have eliminated the personal conflict of interest certification that was included as part of the annual certification and the work plan/work assignment certification in the proposed rule. Under the final rule, all that contractors must certify, as part of either a work assignment or annual conflict of interest certification, is that they have informed their employees, working under the requirements of the work assignment or EPA contract, of their obligation to report organizational and personal conflicts of interest. (See EPAAR 1552.212&hyph;71, Work Assignments. Alternate I, and EPAAR 1552.210&hyph;80, Annual Certification.) When a contractor has been informed of a personal conflict, either by an employee or a subcontractor, or has knowledge of such a conflict, it should then report this to the EPA Contracting Officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicability of Privacy Act of 1974 and collection of records. One commenter raised concern that this clause could have the effect of requiring contractors to develop and maintain ``systems of records [as defined in the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a)] on individuals on behalf of the agency to accomplish an agency function.'' Commenters also stated that the systems of records needed would be excessively burdensome. Some also expressed concern about the flow down provisions of the clause to subcontractors in terms of records and the use of this material at the prime contractor level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

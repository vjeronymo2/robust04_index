			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Group to be voice for private investors PROSHARE, an organisation which aims to encourage wider share ownership, launched an association for private investors yesterday, with an introductory offer of a free half-hour consultation with a stockbroker. The annual subscription is Pounds 30 and the association aims to provide investors with independent information and to act as a mouthpiece for private shareholders. The number of private investors in the UK was about 3m when the Conservatives came into office in 1979. It is now about 10m, much of it in the form of small holdings in privatised stocks. The proportion of the market owned by private investors is less than 20 per cent, compared with nearly 70 per cent in 1957. ProShare argues that a combination of investor ignorance, tax disadvantages and a shortage of good-quality advice has been a barrier to wider share ownership. The organisation has received funding of more than Pounds 3m from the Department of Trade and Industry, the Stock Exchange and leading companies. It hopes to become self-financing. Members of the association will receive a handbook, a monthly newsletter and a voucher for eight free copies of the Saturday edition of the Financial Times. More information available on 071-971 0061.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 8 May -- "I see Crimea's future relations with  Ukraine as friendly," Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov said,  answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent following a  working meeting on 7 May in Simferopol between government  delegations of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea. "They ought  to be based solely on treaties."    At the same time Ukraine's acting Prime Minister Yukhym  Zvyahilskyy said he regarded Crimea as an integral part of the  Ukrainian state, and therefore believed that it was not  necessary to conclude any special agreements. "We have nothing  to divide; we are one family," he believes.    Journalists were told the two sides discussed a number of  economic issues and reached understanding on some of them. This  concerns, in particular, the provision of funds, oil products  and seeds to the Crimea. A decision was also made to examine  all arising issues at the level of heads of relevant ministries  and departments.</p>

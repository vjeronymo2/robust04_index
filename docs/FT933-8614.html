			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: New London agrees disposal terms New London, the UK quoted oil and gas exploration and production company which operates in the US, has finally agreed terms for the sale of its International Drilling Fluids unit to Schlumberger of the US. In May the UK company signed a letter of intent with Schlumberger which involved the US energy services company taking a 10 per cent stake in the vendor, but New London cancelled the deal last month when it received revised terms. Under the latest agreement, New London will receive Dollars 12m (Pounds 8m) cash, subject to adjustments, for IDF, which will be sold with Dollars 30m of bank debt. New London, which bought IDF two years ago for Dollars 21m, said proceeds would be used to remove virtually all of the group's existing bank borrowings.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUSPECT INJURED AFTER OFFICER'S GUN  DISCHARGES  </P> <P> A 27-year-old unarmed Norwalk man was critically wounded Thursday when a  sheriff's detective's revolver went off accidentally as the officer tried to  stop the man from driving away in a stolen pickup in Bellflower, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Investigators say Scott Fierro was driving the same stolen truck Wednesday when  he allegedly threatened a K-Mart security guard with a knife when the guard  tried to stop him from leaving with $100 worth of stolen drill bits.  </P> <P> Detectives spotted Fierro in the truck in a parking lot on Rosecrans Avenue on  Thursday, Deputy Dean Scoville said. Believing that Fierro was going to rob the  market, officers surrounded the truck and ordered him out. Instead, Scoville  said, Fierro put the truck in reverse, throwing the deputy who was holding onto  the passenger side off balance. His gun went off and the bullet struck Fierro  in the chin.  </P></p>

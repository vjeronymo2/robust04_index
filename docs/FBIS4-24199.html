			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Edyth Bulbring] </F>   [Text] Promotions in the police over the past year are to  be reviewed in the next few weeks following complaints about  irregularities and dissatisfaction with standards. The  discovery of irregularities would lead to the establishment of a  commission of inquiry headed by a judge to assess, and if  necessary, reverse promotions, according to the newly  established police advisory team.    One of the irregular incidents known to the advisory team  was  a case in which members of the Transkei police force forced  their superiors to promote them at gunpoint shortly after the  election. These promotions were suspended, but there were also  allegations of irregular promotions in some of the other police  forces.    The 10-man advisory team, which met in Pretoria on Friday,  must amalgamate the 11 police forces into one national police  service.    A key issue which arose at the meeting was the criteria used  by the different police forces to promote their members, and the  advancement of members during the year before the election.  The advisory team will recommend to Safety and Security  Minister Sydney Mufamadi that these issues be investigated over  the next few weeks.    A member of the team said one of the problems the team faced  in rationalising the police forces was the different standards  and criteria employed in promoting members.    Following an investigation, the team would finalise new  standards for promotion. These would include new criteria for  affirmative action.    Should the team discover gross irregularities, President  Nelson Mandela was empowered by the constitution to establish a  commission of inquiry to examine all promotions between April  last year and September this year. The commission would have  the power to confirm, reverse or amend these promotions.</p>

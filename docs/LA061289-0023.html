			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN CHINA;  </P> <P> THE STRUGGLE FOR POWER;  </P> <P> CUTTING CHINA TIES WOULD BE WRONG, U.S. ENVOY SAYS  </P> <P> The U.S. ambassador to China said Sunday that despite current tensions between  the United States and China over last weekend's bloody crushing of the  pro-democracy movement in Beijing, it would be a "terrible mistake" to abandon  the relationship between the two countries.  </P> <P> "We've gone through many ups and downs with China, and I think right now we're  going through a down," Ambassador James R. Lilley said from Beijing in an  interview broadcast on CBS-TV. "But I don't think we should sort of give up on  it; I think that would be a terrible mistake."  </P> <P> Lilley said the Chinese leadership was battling for control of the country and  that U.S. comments and actions would have little impact in the midst of the  crisis. He said the United States could exert influence through Voice of  America broadcasts, day-to-day business dealings and the training of Chinese  students at American universities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reflected Cautious Stance  </P> <P> Lilley's remarks on "Face the Nation" reflected the cautious stance toward the  Chinese crisis adopted by policy-makers in Washington.  </P> <P> President Bush, while cutting off all government and private military sales to  Beijing last week, has refrained from sharply criticizing the Chinese  government. He has not threatened to cut all economic and diplomatic ties to  China, nor has he recalled Lilley as a sign of U.S. displeasure at the massacre  and arrests of student demonstrators.  </P> <P> Lilley, echoing Bush's moderate language, said: "At the moment, you have an  overwhelming desire (by Chinese leaders) for survival, and that takes  precedence over anything. What we do is we play for the long term, and we don't  look for a quick fix -- a 'feelie-goodie' about this thing. We look for a  long-term solution."  </P> <P> Lilley declined to discuss what the United States plans to do about Fang Lizhi,  China's most prominent dissident, who has been given refuge in the U.S. Embassy  in Beijing since last Monday. The ambassador said he had had talks in the past  several days with senior Chinese officials about Fang, but he would not reveal  the content of the discussions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Best to Shut Up'  </P> <P> "It's a very sensitive thing and it's best to do it and shut up," Lilley said.  </P> <P> The ambassador said he hopes the confrontation over Fang can be resolved soon.  </P> <P> "I don't think we want irritants in the Chinese-American relationship," Lilley  said. "But we Americans stand for certain things, and I don't think we're going  to change. And I think the Chinese stand for certain things and they're not  going to change. And then you strike a deal."  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's moderate approach does not sit well with many members  of Congress. Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), reflecting broad sentiment in  Congress for stiffer sanctions against the Chinese government, called for a  halt in high-technology exports and for multilateral efforts to press China to  end repression of the student pro-democracy movement.  </P> <P> "Certainly an immediate cutoff or break in relations or all economic trade, I  think, would have been precipitous," D'Amato said on "Face the Nation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No 'Business as Usual'  </P> <P> "But we've got to let the Chinese Communist leaders, those old fellows who are  clinging to power, understand there is not going to be business as usual, that  there will be economic sanctions, that there will be a curtailment of our  normal relations," said D'Amato, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.  "And we've got to lead the world community in this direction."  </P> <P> But Roger Sullivan, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, interviewed  on the same program, said the United States should think twice before imposing  harsh economic penalties on China.  </P> <P> "They have made it very, very clear by those pictures (of students being beaten  by security forces) and by their statements and by their actions . . . that  they really don't care what world opinion is," Sullivan said.  </P> <P> "We have to be careful that in trying to punish this government -- we're  certainly not going to influence it -- we do not unintentionally and  inadvertently create a situation where it's going to be more difficult or  impossible to rebuild this relationship when it becomes possible to do so."  </P></p>

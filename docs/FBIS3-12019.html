General Director Beatriz  Pages Rebollar; place and date not given: "In Light of Mexico's  Difficult Transition, `A Political Agreement Is Necessary'"]    [Text] In light of a confused and tense national scenario  marked by an armed uprising that on 1 January shook the  foundations of the system and in light of the confrontation  between the three most important presidential candidates and the  clouds of violence that may unleash their fury following the 21  August federal elections, SIEMPRE! set out to find a serene  thought capable of untangling the puzzling scenario left from  the latest events.    Fernando Gutierrez Barrios broke his customary silence and  decided to speak about the most sensitive topics of the moment:  guerrillas, elections, democracy, political parties,  negotiations in Chiapas, social peace, crisis in the system,  participation of the clergy in politics, and the controversial  personality of Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis.    With his prudent but also energetic style, Fernando defined  concepts, marked routes, and warned about the dangers that may  affect the country's stability if no serious political agreement  is reached with all national forces, "not only with the parties,  but also the different representative organizations that take  part in Mexico's life."    A man of institutions, principles, and values and a man of  unquestionable moral righteousness and deep nationalism,  Gutierrez Barrios commented and made remarks with the authority  bestowed upon him by his vast knowledge of the Mexican political  system.    "Beatriz, before starting this interview," Fernando  Gutierrez  Barrios explained, "I first wish to thank you for your kind  presence here, as well as for giving me the opportunity to have  an open and cordial dialogue with a person whom I respect and  admire. I am at your disposal."    [Pages] Fernando, what are, in your opinion, the elements  that characterize the Zapatist National Liberation Army compared  to other guerrilla movements in Latin America?    [Gutierrez] To answer your question, one would have to  analyze in detail different Latin American societies in each  historical period and later understand the specific conditions  of the guerrillas.    The armed struggle in the form of guerrillas has an old  tradition in Latin America which dates back to even before the  Cuban Revolution which, due to its proximity, is the most  well-known. All guerrilla movements had varied ideological  inspiration, ranging from radical liberals to nationalists to  even Marxists.    Cuban revolutionary theory, the best example of which was  Ernesto "Che" Guevara, can be summarized in a few points.  First, "armed struggle" as the only way to reach power; second,  "continental" projection of the revolution due to the similarity  of "objective conditions" in Latin American countries; third,  the socialist character of the revolution; fourth, the thesis  that peasants, and not the working class, were the segment of  society with higher revolutionary potentiality; and fifth, the  concept of a vanguard composed of intellectuals, professionals,  and students.    The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), where  father Camilo Torres briefly served, acted with that same  orientation.    We must also mention that the Poor People's Guerrilla Army  of Guatemala is also of Cuban inspiration and also includes  Indians in its ranks. The other Guatemalan guerrilla group:  Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms (ORPA) also  placed great emphasis on the Indians.    The leading guerrilla movements of the late sixties and  seventies separated themselves from Cuban theory, especially by  focusing on nationalism rather than socialism as well as by  their urban origin and influence. The 19 April Movement [M-19]  of Colombia, the Montoneros of Argentina, the Tupamaros of  Uruguay, the National Liberation Army of Carlos Marighella of  Brazil, famous for his Minimanual of the Urban Guerrillas, are  examples. The first two groups -- the M-19 and the Montoneros  -- have in common that they are organized by populist forces and  struggled for a true democracy as their main demand.    The Sandinist National Liberation Front of Nicaragua ruled  the country as the government after its victory, and today it is  acting within the framework of democracy. The Farabundo Marti  National Liberation Front of El Salvador, after the peace  agreements, is seeking power through elections today.    Finally, we must mention the Shining Path, a unique Peruvian  organization, which despite the serious defeats it has  sustained, continues to harass the government.    The ones I have mentioned are only a few of the nearly 100  guerrilla movements in Latin America from the days of Carlos  Prestes in Brazil in the 1920's to now. You can, therefore, see  that the elements that must be analyzed are extensive.    The so-called "Zapatist National Liberation Army" has taken  heterogeneous elements from the aforementioned experiences, and  its unprecedented character consists of the way it reunites  these experiences. The overwhelming Indian presence shows an  identification with the Guatemalan movements, and the emphasis  placed on democratic demands, social justice, and land ownership  as well as its flexible ideological inclinations, identifies it  with the M-19 and the Montoneros. The spectacular actions, on  the other hand -- bearing in mind the difference of scenarios --  identify it with those of the Tupamaros and the MIR [Movement  of the Revolutionary Left] of Chile. The participation and  influence of certain sectors linked to the Church is an element  that coincides with those of certain groups from El Salvador --  especially the FPL [Farabundo Marti People's Liberation Forces]  -- Colombia, and Argentina. In sum they are carrying the banner  of poverty, ideological syncretism, and of the work to persuade  Indian communities, as well as the skillful use of psychological  warfare and its expression in political propaganda. As for  their military capability, it appears to be reduced and limited  to a certain geographical area. Their activities are conducted  with the tactic of guerrilla focus. That is why it is not  accurate to establish a mechanical analogy with other Latin  American movements.    [Pages] What is your opinion of the government's reaction  with regard to the guerrillas? Was it not paralyzed at the  beginning?    [Gutierrez] A fundamental element of the guerrillas is the  element of surprise. If the guerrillas lose the initiative to  attack where it is most advisable for them, it will not proceed  according to its own nature. It is evident that they took  advantage of this element in addition to the skillful use of  information and psychological warfare, as well as its effects on  national and international public opinion. We should be pleased  to see that the government's response was one of great maturity.  Prudence and composure and civilized dialogue instead of the  temptation to harden the government's positions and react  violently prevailed. The government declared a unilateral  cease-fire, an amnesty was offered, and cabinet changes were  made without demands being made. Even though what has happened  is the result of an accumulation of unsolved problems, mistakes  were honestly recognized, the state's governor was changed,  multiparty commissions were created, and the National Human  Rights Commission, in the fulfillment of its duties, visited the  area of conflict. They have all been political solutions of  conciliation. A peace commission for Chiapas was even  appointed. The president of the Republic held a dialogue in  Tuxtla Gutierrez with the leaders of the different ethnic  groups. This is how the government has irreproachably responded  within the framework of the state of law by supporting the  actions of the Mexican Army and avoiding situations of armed  pressure against the country's institutions given that the  political times of the end of the current six-year period and  the proximity of the federal elections could be used against the  government both by the guerrillas themselves as well as by  heterogeneous groups, which, stimulated by the presence of the  so-called "Zapatist army," could try to take advantage of the  opportunity to make innumerable demands through different forms  of pressure.    [Pages] Don't you think that the big loser in this  conflict has been the Army?    [Gutierrez] The Army is strictly carrying out the orders it  receives as stated in the Constitution. It is undeniable that  circumstances have been difficult. Efforts have been made to  irresponsibly discredit the Army. The Army went from being  attacked to being the aggressor, with the obvious manipulation  of ideological change, which is another form of propaganda of  ideological warfare. The National Army is an exemplary  institution with a revolutionary and popular origin. Its  sacrifice and service to the Republic, inseparable in its role  as guarantor of the country's sovereignty, cannot be questioned  by an obviously biased campaign of discredit. The Mexican Army  has once again proven its serenity, maturity, discipline, and  institutionalism.    [Pages] What would be the alternatives for solving the  conflict in Chiapas?    [Gutierrez] I think that the ideal solution would be a  dignified negotiation for both sides. Priority attention must  be given to the just and reasonable demands made by the rebels  who must end this conflict by turning over their weapons. There  can be no ambiguities on this point. If a serious, just, and  dignified negotiation cannot be conducted because of dogmatic  intransigence, the problem would prolong itself, most certainly,  until 21 August came with elections subjected to a perverse  pressure. If law and order is not restored in that area of the  country and the conflict continues, it will be a negative burden  on the electoral process, the transfer of power, and the  country's tranquility.    [Pages] How do you think violence in Chiapas will affect the  upcoming electoral process?    [Gutierrez] Objectively speaking, no one can deny that the  country was upset, as was the political situation. Worried  about Chiapas, the social forces demand a clean electoral  process and thus new reforms to Federal Code of Electoral  Institutions and Procedures, something that will certainly be  accomplished during the special period of sessions.  Psychologically, citizens have been subjected to different  influences. A large portion of the population has been affected  as to their political preference. Citizens will study their  vote more carefully. Consequently, it is important that the  parties and their candidates face social problems through more  updated, redeeming, and honest speeches. It is indispensable to  have more social sensitivity and political keenness. The  citizens have been exposed to unpredictable reactions, caused by  actions that are foreign to them, such as that which occurred in  Chiapas, and which move them to profound meditation.    [Pages] How do you view the panorama of political parties?    [Gutierrez] Politics, it has been said, is the art of the  possible, but it is an art of imagination to see beyond what is  immediate. Political parties are going through a crisis of  representation and credibility throughout the world. This is  evident in the voters' rejection and abstention. I think that  political speeches must be better drafted, making them more  accessible, specific, and comprehensible. Today's Mexicans  deserve to be spoken to with a simple language of great truths,  respecting their intelligence and dignity. Old formulas must be  pushed aside, alliances must be sought, the political space must  be widened, and we must include, not exclude. This must be done  here and now. Those with the lowest standard of living and the  worst jobs require special attention. I think that it must be  emphasized that without social justice and commitment to  specific situations, democracy becomes an abstraction without  any relation to the country, the social sector, or the people of  flesh and blood. We must take care of those who have not as  well as the middle class, because the delicate balance between  order and freedom cannot be subjected to the dangerous extremes  of opulence and misery.    [Pages] What specifically is your opinion of the PRI?    [Gutierrez] As a member of the party, although somewhat  distanced from active politics, I would venture to say that  because of the strength of its structures and traditional  organization, the PRI has managed to reach the people and  maintain its position as a ruling party. The great civic  awakening among the people, however, has affected it. No longer  can a candidate to any given office be selected arbitrarily,  either because of friendship or popularity. Dialogue has  replaced monologue. Within this new open and pluralist society  -- a society whose influence is becoming increasingly strong --  the PRI defines its ideals by nurturing itself from the  ever-present principles of the Mexican Revolution. These are  the principles that identify the party and its supporters; these  principles comprise its raison d'etre. The pluralist society,  which is ever more knowledgeable and critical, has taught us  hard lessons through its credibility, honesty, and knowledge of  reality. Nowadays, in order to win we must first convince the  voters, because votes do indeed count and are indeed counted.  As I said before, nowadays we need dynamic, open campaigns --  campaigns that challenge the people, address the problems that  grieve us, and offer solutions. We must continue to consult the  people on a broad in-depth basis to enable them to express their  social concerns, make their demands, and, consequently, receive  an answer. This is the new policy. It is consistent with our  times and with the current circumstances. I believe the PRI  will have to reaffirm its doctrine; strengthen its  organizations, rank-and-file, and electoral structures; and  basically revitalize its convictions and winning spirit to  effectively support its candidates and lead them to victory.    Candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio is carrying out an  enthusiastic campaign in which he is giving all of himself. It  is a dynamic campaign, consistent with the current circumstances  and with the political, economic, and social requirements of the  specific stage the country is in. His proposals as outlined in  his speeches have received a warm welcome among the people --  especially those regarding PRI autonomy and the reform of power,  which is understood to be a greater balance among various  powers, as well as those that address social justice,  sovereignty, human rights, democracy, and freedom with respect  for the Constitution and the laws of the state.    [Pages] What is your opinion of the candidates from the  other  parties?    [Gutierrez] I know all of the candidates, because I met some  while I was interior secretary and others some years before that  during my long political career. All deserve my greatest  respect, whether or not I agree with their political positions.  They are all good Mexicans who think of the higher values and  interests of the nation before their personal or partisan  interests. Despite their political differences, they all agree  that democracy, and not violence, is what can bring about change  with stability, change with social justice and freedom, and  change that should emanate from society itself.    [Pages] There are three candidates from three, let us say,  strong political parties, who will face each other in the  presidential race. In general terms, what does each one  represent to the nation?    [Gutierrez] They represent a historic opportunity. Partisan  institutions are the expression of democracy. They will have to  debate with civility and discuss the alternatives and programs  each contender has to offer. Mexico gains by this. Debate is  the best way to put the strength of any political party's ideals  to the test. The Mexico of today comprises a pluralistic society  that brings together various ideologies and trends represented  by the different political parties. The unchanging nature of  democracy is that the majority rules, but the minorities also  have their place in the country's everyday life. That is the  country's future.    [Pages] What is your view regarding the role played by the  media in the elections?    [Gutierrez] The media are the loyal conveyors of the  political situation. The media will play a pivotal role in the  1994 electoral process. They will allow society to obtain  information on the candidates, their programs, and leadership  capabilities. That is exactly what the new Mexico implies.  Once more, the media's responsibility will be decisive, and  this can only be achieved in a country such as ours, where  freedom of expression is respected.    [Pages] The opposition has indicated that there could be a  popular uprising if the election results are not respected.  What do you think about violence?    [Gutierrez] I am convinced that social peace is based on  respect for the individual, life, and liberty, without allowing  the exercise of our rights to impinge on other people's rights.  The Mexican people reject violence. No one can live amid  anarchy and chaos just as peace cannot be imposed with  authoritarian measures. The Mexican Government, in addition to  the legal norms that rule the institutions, wields one of the  best weapons: dialogue, reason, and law, because moving away  from it would be the worst path to follow. The political  parties, even with their ideological differences and their  projects, have a common goal -- to achieve the advancement of  Mexico and the benefit of the majorities as well as to preserve  the de jure state. Even when the debates are at times harsh,  which is normal considering the emotions political campaigns can  stir, today a higher level of maturity on the part of the  parties and society as a whole is perceived. This higher  maturity, combined with a respect for electoral laws and the  individual right to vote, will lead to a peaceful transfer of  power.    [Pages] Do you believe that what has been called the Mexican  political system is still in effect?    [Gutierrez] The Mexican political system is still in effect;  it is on its own a revolutionary project and not a rhetorical  abstraction. It constitutes a project that includes all  political trends -- left, right, and center; professional groups  from the social and business sectors; organizations of young  people, women, and intellectuals; political parties; urban  popular movements; and so on, all of whom participate in the  political arena in the manner they deem most appropriate. It is  fundamental to point out that all of the country's political  parties have freedom of expression. No one is denied the right  to fight for Mexico. We are not a monolithic society. The  revolution has given birth to several trends, and it welcomes  those who represent them.    Nevertheless, excessive pluralism is not desirable because  it  divides and ideologically confuses the population. I believe  the course for Mexico is that of a moderate pluralism with the  respectful coexistence of our current political and ideological  groups so that they can contribute to the country's progress.    [Pages] What is your view regarding the dialogue taking  place  in San Cristobal de las Casas?    [Gutierrez] As I told you before, this dialogue is positive.  A mature dialogue leads to peace and harmony. While a dialogue  is held, the cannon remains silent, but what is important is to  move from dialogue to negotiation. A negotiation could become  stagnant if it lacks the will and understanding of all to seek  solutions with honesty and realism. This stage is a civilized  and worthwhile chance to find peace. The deliberate confusion  between politics and the spiritual aspect must be avoided. The  baseless presumption that the "Zapatist National Liberation  Army" can be maintained as a pressure group until the August  elections and is allowed, because of this, to assume a higher  role than the de jure state to supervise the legality and the  purity of the elections must be overcome through dialogue and  negotiation. In turn, it is vital to separate the Chiapas  conflict from the presidential elections; strive to make the  latter trustworthy, convincing, and irreproachable; and prevent  the post-electoral period from becoming troublesome.    [Pages] According to the difficult times the country is  experiencing, what should be next?    [Gutierrez] It is difficult to state one's opinions when one  is not responsible and, above all, does not have total and  objective information of the national problems. However, the  situation can be summed up in the following basic aspects:  adequate and honorable negotiations with the "Zapatist army," a  task aimed at strengthening what unites us all and the  construction of better bridges between society and the  government; a political agreement based on strong foundations  accepted by all with the country's political forces, not just  the parties, but the different representative organizations that  participate in the country's life.    [Pages] Regarding the clergymen's intervention in politics,  which becomes more evident each passing day, and which you  addressed as interior secretary, what is your viewpoint now?    [Gutierrez] My opinion is the same. The important thing is  that Mexican clergymen do not behave as clergymen do elsewhere  on this continent, where their intervention and influence is key  to government actions. That is why the wise decision of  President Juarez separating church and state, leaving each  sector with its legal and spiritual responsibilities, becomes  important these days.    [Pages] What is your opinion about the political personality  of Manuel Camacho Solis and regarding his latest statements?    [Gutierrez] Camacho Solis is fulfilling, as it has been  said,  the responsibility entrusted upon him by President Salinas to  overcome the conflict in Chiapas. Regarding Camacho's political  opinions, he made use of his freedom to express his ideas, as  all Mexicans can do. However, at this moment what our country  -- which is immersed in political confusion that generates  financial instability and social problems such as poverty,  sometimes extreme in some regions -- needs is to avoid useless  confrontation, confusion, division, and skepticism. This will  permit us to achieve peace and harmony among Mexicans, so as to  preserve the political stability which is the foundation of our  progress and development.    [Pages] Which are the main issues that should be addressed  in  the next six-year term?    [Gutierrez] Undoubtedly, the economic program of President  Salinas has yielded satisfactory results, particularly insofar  as the macroeconomic indicators. However, emphasis must be  given to the social demands of poor sectors, without  disregarding the fight against inflation, which has been  successful. Emphasis must also be placed on continuing the  economic reactivation to allow the broadening of the job base  and offer decent jobs to all Mexicans. Without job  opportunities, it would be illusory to think of social welfare.    Another public general demand that must be heeded, because  it  is a priority, is public security, as well as protection of  persons and properties. This necessarily entails an in-depth  reform in the police corps, professionalizing them and making  them really serve the community.    Tied to the previous point, the fight against corruption in  all its forms must be strengthened. Said forms of corruption  range from corruption against citizens on the streets to the  more complex forms such as inexplicable enrichments and  inefficiency, which is another form of corruption. Within this  framework, we must include the basic topics of social justice,  health, education, justice administration and implementation,  housing, and roads.    To conclude, I would tell you that aware of the difficult  problems the country is facing at this moment, Mexico has a  challenge for the future but we must have confidence in our  abilities and fundamentally human resources. It is evident that  we have come a long way in the post-revolutionary decades, but  we must be aware of the fact that there is still much to be  done. The policy of paying the social debts we have with the  have-nots in the country and the city must not be overlooked.  However, we also know, without eluding responsibility for  neglect or deficiencies, that it will be a long time before we  can definitely resolve these long-time problems. The resources  and the economic capacity of the Mexican State are limited and  are subject to internal factors, among them demographic growth  that demands each day more health centers, more schools, more  housing, as well as external factors that do not depend on our  will.    [Pages] You once predicted the end of the era of the  vertical power structure. Luis Donaldo Colosio is now proposing  "a power reform." Is there compatibility?    [Gutierrez] We agree on the need for change in the face of  hegemonical ambitions and the complex social, political, and  economic problems of our times. We are approaching the third  millennium amid political, economic, and social convulsion in a  world where something collapses and something else emerges each  day. We are witnesses to ideological collapses, the presence of  religious, ethnic, and nationalist fundamentalisms, and the  birth of a globalization process from which we cannot separate  ourselves. We will persist in maintaining our nationalism and  on safeguarding our culture, traditions, customs, and identity.  We must, however, realize that what is described as a  paternalistic and centralized policy is a thing of the past.    [Pages] The IFE [Federal Electoral Institute] recognized  that the hegemony of the PRI was lost and that the alternation  of power is feasible. What is your opinion?    [Gutierrez] In fact, the end of the single party system was  predicted. The end of the PRI's prevalence was also predicted.  There are some people, however, who think the opposite based on  the legacy of social peace and development achieved in its 65  years of life, without denying the failures and mistakes that  were made. Let us view this as follows: alternation of power  as mandated by electoral preference is as feasible and  legitimate as the efforts [atigencia] that the PRI rank and file  is making to adjust to a changing society. A PRI based on  caudillo origins is not the same as a party that has adjusted to  national mobility. That is precisely the key to its survival:  nonparalyzation of its strategies and programs and its  permanent attempts to adjust to national reality.    [Pages] It is said that certain states of the republic are  at the brink of social explosion. How can the discontent of the  citizens be moderated? How have we failed? Is the government's  prevalence over?    [Gutierrez] An old saying on democracy by Francisco Bulnes  [Mexican politician and sociologist] comes to mind. He said:  "When people say at noon that night has come upon us, we must  start turning on the street lamps." Today the country's  transformation, the construction of the new Mexico, the Mexico  of the 85 million citizens with its shortages that could lead us  to desperation, makes us see the need for unity with equality  that can bring about change with the participation of all  political forces as well as the consolidation of a state in  which solutions can be implemented without trauma, excesses, or  any messianic role-playing.    [Pages] The third millennium is approaching. The world has  changed. What are the challenges for our country?    [Gutierrez] The challenges are visible. Civil society,  increasingly perceptive, marks the changes. In the social  field, the demands are self-evident; in the political field,  society demands an opening toward pluralism; and in the economic  field, it demands the need to strengthen the well-being of our  families to achieve development.    The world is changing today. Mexico seeks to be consistent.  We are moving along a difficult path that can be overcome with  the observance of the law and with the support of dialogue and  concerted effort. I believe that is the path. Our national  fate is at stake. The best heritage of the nation should be  based on stability with social peace, democracy, social justice,  unity, harmony, and composure. It seems repetitive, but in  Mexico we must change -- not in order to stop existing but to be  better.    [Pages] What can we expect from the 21 August elections with  an increasing and violent opposition?    [Gutierrez] Fatalism or manifest destinies do not function  in  Mexico. We do not expect the 21 August elections to be easy.  We expect them to be intense and participatory. Today more  than 40 million Mexicans have the right to vote and, without a  doubt, it will be the best demonstration that democracy has been  ratified. The electoral framework has been created, and  political offers are visible. Now the important thing is to  settle the electoral process through the polls and not through  violence.    Experience shows us that disorder and violence only benefit  the hegemonic forces promoting backwardness. I am sure that  social peace is based on respect for the human being, life, and  freedom without the exercise of our rights having to adversely  affect the rights of others.</p>

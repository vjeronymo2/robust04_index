			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (17): This airport makes its city tick - Hubs / Atlanta Atlanta, born humbly as 'Terminus' at the end of a railroad line in the early 19th century, has long seen that its fortunes are tied to transportation. Today, no Atlantan would deny that Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, the world's fourth-busiest, is what makes this flamboyantly commercial city of 3m tick. In a conscious strategy to make Atlanta the business capital of the south-east, Hartsfield was built from the 1950s through the 1980s into the leading commercial and passenger air hub of the region. It is credited with being the city's main economic generator, pumping an estimated Dollars 7bn into the local economy annually. But this has not been enough to satisfy the city's ambitions. It now wants Hartsfield to become an international hub - matching its aim to be one of the world's top cities. To this end, Atlanta's Hartsfield is completing a new Dollars 300m international concourse which is scheduled to open next year. It is expected to have the latest in accommodation and amenities for international travellers and to be the largest 'all in one' international terminal in the US. Since 1980 when it was revamped, Hartsfield has claimed it has the world's largest passenger terminal, covering 2.2m square feet. The new international terminal, which will have 12 baggage carousels and be able to accommodate at one time as many as 24 narrow or 18 wide-body aircraft, will add an additional 1.2m sq ft. The new international terminal is largely an outgrowth of the city's increased international business. The Atlanta metropolitan area is home to more than 500 international companies and 39 international banks. Foreign investment in the state of Georgia, of which Atlanta is the capital, reached a cumulative Dollars 7.5bn from 1984 through 1991, according to a recent study of KPMG Peat Marwick. With 10 international carriers, including British Airways, Lufthansa, Japan Airlines, and Swissair, and services to 27 cities in 18 countries, Hartsfield already handles more than 2m foreign travellers a year. Atlanta has also had a special spur for its expansion of Hartsfield for foreign travellers. It will be the site of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games and is girding itself with a number of large public projects for the onslaught of tens of thousands of foreign visitors. Hartsfield handled a total of 48m passengers last year, back up to its 1990 level after weathering a drop in traffic in 1991 to 37.9m. The decrease in 1991 came generally as a result of the US airline industry's problems, but most particularly from the demise of Eastern Airlines, the only US carrier other than Delta Air Lines (the third-largest US airline, whose headquarters are in Atlanta) that a operated out of Hartsfield as a hub. The failure of Eastern, which had handled one third of of Hartsfield's activity, left 33 gates open, four of which have now been taken over by a revived TWA. A gradually recovering US economy no doubt lifted passenger traffic at Hartsfield last year. But the bounce back was also helped by that fact that Atlanta is one of the largest convention and business meeting centres in the US, rather than a tourist destination, which has a higher level of discretionary visitors. The bulk of Hartsfield's passengers are on business. While many gripe about the droning electronic voices on its people movers and its lack of creative concessions, the business travellers who use Hartsfield rate it highly. In a recent survey for the magazine Business Traveller International, Hartsfield ranked as the best airport in North America for the fourth consecutive year. It was followed by Dallas-Fort Worth, Tampa, Chicago and Washington-Dulles. Unfortunately, while the airport wins much praise, all is not as rosy at Hartsfield as Atlanta's city fathers would wish. Most importantly, Delta, which has lost more than Dollars 1bn since the airline industry began its slump in 1990, is being forced to cut staff and service. In a break with its 36-year-old policy not to sack permanent employees, it announced last month that it would lay off some 600 pilots. It will also reduce its fleet by 28 aircraft and eliminate some unprofitable flights, both foreign and domestic. As Delta is the dominant carrier at Hartsfield - accounting for 80 per cent of the airport's connecting and originating traffic - this is unwelcome news for Atlanta. Hartsfield's officials, who were already working hard to bring in new foreign airlines to use its new international terminal, will now face added pressure to step up their domestic marketing efforts. They are likely to find it an uphill battle, given that the airline industry on the whole is losing money and downsizing. Other airlines have also stayed away from Hartsfield because of the entrenched position of Delta which, as one of the city's largest employers, can influence decisions in its favour. At the moment, Mr John Braden, marketing chief, is focused on drumming up new Latin American cargo customers and luring Latin American airlines, which would normally use Miami. He hopes, for example, to have Varig, the Brazilian national airline, flying four jumbos into Hartsfield soon. To add to Hartsfield's worries, the city of Atlanta has failed for more than a year to appoint a new aviation commissioner to run the airport. Mr Max Walker, who had retired as deputy commissioner, has been standing in as acting commissioner. The city's search has been complicated because it has been unwilling to pay an annual salary of about Dollars 120,000 which is what airport chiefs make elsewhere, offering instead only some Dollars 80,000. Despite these concerns, the airport is soldiering on and attracting more, if small, airlines. AeroCancun, for service to Mexico's resort of Cancun; American Eagle, the commuter affiliate of American Airlines; GP-Express, another commuter carrier; and Kiwi, a small East Coast airline, have set up at Hartsfield over the past year. Yet, perhaps more importantly, with the south-east as the fastest growing region in the US, Hartsfield seems on a relatively sure footing for the future.</p>

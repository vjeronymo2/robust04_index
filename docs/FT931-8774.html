			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Cummins forges diesel engine link with Komatsu CUMMINS ENGINE of the US and Komatsu, Japan's biggest construction equipment group, yesterday announced agreement in principle to establish a co-operative business relationship in diesel engines. The deal is one of the most important recent link-ups in the diesel industry, and represents the first significant co-operation between a western diesel engine producer and an integrated Japanese user and producer of engines. The announcement raised questions among observers on which company would be gaining most from the arrangement, and which of Cummins' plants would be affected. But Mr Henry Schacht, Cummins' chairman and chief executive, said the deal was both mutually beneficial and a 'logical extension of the pressures being exerted on diesel engine producers and end-users.' It was a deal, he indicated, that would not have been contemplated 15 years ago. The diesel engine industry has been spending heavily to produce engines that comply with increasingly tough emissions regulations. The two companies said yesterday they would 'apply their technological expertise to the joint development of high-quality engines able to meet the standards of tomorrow's diesel engine industry'. Cummins and Komatsu have had links since the 1960s. The Japanese company was a Cummins licensee before it developed its own engines in the 1980s, while Cummins already supplies engines to Komatsu in the US, Latin America and part of the Japanese company's European production at Birtley in the UK. But the latest relationship, which has been under discussion for several years, goes much deeper. The companies plan to review their product lines, eliminating areas of redundant investment and reducing costs by unifying certain engine models and promoting combined production. As a first step, the two companies are considering producing Cummins' small B series engines in Japan, to be installed in Komatsu equipment or sold by Cummins in its regional markets. They are also considering producing a large Komatsu engine at an unnamed Cummins facility with distribution planned through the Cummins network. In the UK, Cummins' Daventry plant would appear to have the best chance of getting the work. Mr Schacht said both companies would benefit by being freed from the need to develop these engines. For Cummins, the deal offers increased volumes to support its technical spending and local production in Japan, while Komatsu gets access to Cummins' diesel engine expertise. Mr Allan Rawnsley, a UK-based consultant, said Cummins had spent heavily to comply with emissions regulations. The deal with Komatsu was a low-cost route to replacing the ageing 28-litre Vee-form engines, currently made only in India. The two companies said the new relationship would lead to joint ventures in Japan and the US. They hope to reach a definitive agreement later this year.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Ecuador strike hits business and transport A nationwide strike called by Ecuador's main trades union federation to protest against increases in petrol prices yesterday shut public and private enterprises and hit public transport. The United Workers Front is demanding a reversal of the petrol price rise, which was announced at the weekend. It is also seeking a general increase in wages for workers and the dismissal of Mr Cesar Robalino, the finance minister. Riots continued for the third day yesterday. In an attempt to overcome a fiscal crisis, the government of President Sixto Duran raised petrol prices by 25-71 per cent. Now prices stand at Dollars 1.22-Dollars 1.46 (Pounds 0.81-Pounds 0.97) a US gallon. Public transport prices remain fixed through subsidies. Mr Alfredo Corral, labour minister, said the government was 'studying the possibility of a limited wage increase,' but would not repeal the petrol price rises. Union leader Mr Edgar Ponce reiterated his members' opposition to privatisation of strategic state-owned enterprises; if the government did not give in to the demands, an indefinite general strike and an uprising by the indigenous peoples 'could result'. The government maintains that an estimated Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m deficit in the projected 1994 budget was largely caused by the fall in the price of crude oil, exports of which make up nearly half of the government's revenues.</p>

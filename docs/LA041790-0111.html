			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REEBOK PICKS INFINITI AD PRODUCER AS NEW AGENCY  </P> <P> Reebok International on Monday awarded its estimated $40-million advertising  account to Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos, the Boston-based agency that  created the controversial campaign for Infiniti cars.  </P> <P> Hill Holliday replaces Los Angeles-based Chiat/Day/Mojo, which in February  announced that it and Reebok had agreed to break off their three-year  relationship.  </P> <P> Chiat/Day/Mojo, which will continue to handle Reebok's international  advertising, was later asked to submit a presentation, said an agency spokesman  in New York.  </P> <P> Hill Holliday President Jack Sansolo, who was visiting the agency's Los Angeles  office on Monday, said his firm's presentation to Reebok called for a  significantly different campaign than that created by Chiat/Day/Mojo. But he  would not reveal any details of the new advertising, which is scheduled to  break during the back-to-school season.  </P> <P> Reebok "was looking for the best work that would take them over the long term,"  said Sansolo. "Everyone here is very excited."  </P> <P> Reebok will become one of Hill Holliday's three largest accounts, which include  Hyatt Corp. and Infiniti, Nissan Motor Co.'s new luxury automobile division.  The agency's campaign to introduce Infiniti created a stir because it featured  images of forests, streams and rocks, but no cars. More recent ads feature the  automobile.  </P> <P> Other firms competing for the Reebok account included Levine, Huntley, Schmidt  &amp; Beaver; Waring &amp; LaRosa, and DDB Needham Worldwide.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with presidential candidate Ernesto </F> Perez Balladares in Panama City by Jacobo Zabludovsky; from the  "24 Hours" newscast on 10 May -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Zabludovsky] Presidential elections were held last  Sunday in the Republic of Panama. The winner of the elections  was Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares, who is in Panama City. Good  evening, Dr. Perez Balladares.    [Perez] Good evening.    [Zabludovsky] How do you feel after the elections?    [Perez] Obviously, I am quite satisfied. I think this has  been an extraordinary civic process by the Panamanian people. I  greatly appreciate the massive support received through votes.  Also, I am greatly appreciative of my adversaries, because we  managed to conduct an extraordinary campaign with a high level  of civic-mindedness and specific proposals. I am very proud --  truly very proud -- of the Panamanians and of the level of  culture and political development we have demonstrated in this  campaign of 1994.    [Zabludovsky] Everyone is asking the question: Who is Dr.  Perez Balladares?    [Perez] I am an economist. I graduated in 1967, obtained a  masters degree in economics in 1969, and a masters degree in  finance in 1970. After that I was a banker for five years. I  then joined the government of Omar Torrijos, where I served from  1976 until one year after his death until 1983 -- excuse me,  1982. I was finance and treasury minister. I was planning and  economic policy minister. Since then I have been an active  member of the Democratic Revolutionary Party.    [Zabludovsky] One of the topics that was raised by your  enemies during the campaign was that there could be a rebirth of  militarism with your victory in Panama.    [Perez] I think that, more than anything, that was an  electoral attack, which has now ended. Many knew that was  obviously false. First, all military regimes have been  dismantled throughout not only the American continent, but also  in Asia, Africa, everywhere. The justification that was used  for its existence, the alleged retaining wall to curb the  progress of what the United States identified as its enemies --  international communism -- has vanished. Now democracy is in  vogue, and this is something we applaud.    The same thing is happening in Panama. Because of  international geopolitical conditions, and because of domestic  conditions, there cannot be a return to militarism. This is so  true that today I dare say the next foreign minister of my  government will be Gabriel Lewis Galindo, a man who, from the  United States, strongly opposed the former military regime.  Therefore, there can hardly be any threat of a return to the  past.    [Zabludovsky] What type of government will you try to  promote  in your first 100 days?    [Perez] We have based all of our government proposals, our  entire campaign, and all of our efforts on achieving the  reconciliation of Panamanian society. This society was deeply  divided during the final years of the military government and by  the invasion. We have to achieve this, and we must take  specific steps. This cannot remain a mere electoral pledge or an  expression of goodwill. I have to dedicate myself to building  on this pledge in the first 100 days, striving to achieve a  government of national consensus and unity, to enable Panama to  enter the 21st century as a united country and as a country of  equal opportunity. Obviously, I must work to ensure this at a  later date, but the first thing is to make sure that everyone  perceives us as a government of unity, as a government disposed  to making the best efforts with the best men and women available  in order that this can be our goal within the next five years.    [Zabludovsky] For nearly 100 years, one of the most  controversial topics in Panama has been the U.S. military  presence there. A poll was conducted and many people believe  the U.S. military should remain. What is your view on this?    [Perez] Let me clear up something first. What we have are  polls, and it has been proven that polls in Panama somehow are  not totally reliable, as was shown in the recent elections.  What does exist is a statement by many who have been polled in  the sense that there is a feeling of apprehension, of fear  perhaps, regarding the possible departure of the U.S. military  from Panama.    We cannot give into this fear, which in the majority of  cases  is unfounded, because we Panamanians have not only the  capability but also the willingness to oversee the  administration of the Panama Canal. Most of these fears respond  to things that the people themselves do not understand, perhaps  because of a certain degree on evil within some people who have  instilled this in the people's minds. For example, some say  that if the North Americans leave, the U.S. dollar will leave.  These are two completely different things, and yet, the man on  the street does not understand that the U.S. dollar is  circulating on the street, not because of the U.S. presence  here, but because it is our sovereign decision to have this  currency circulating in Panama, which we Panamanians earn with  our sale of services and goods abroad.    The presence of U.S. military bases in Panama is defined in  the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. They clearly state that by 31  December 1999, there should not be one single U.S. soldier in  Panama. The presence of bases in any part of the world by any  foreign power cannot be justified by economic issues. Military  bases exist in any part of the world when there is a military  interest in protection or aggression [as heard]. I do not think  this is the case in Panama. The historic justification for the  existence or presence of military bases in Panama, which was to  defend the interoceanic waterway when the U.S. strategic weapon  was the Navy, has disappeared. Nor is the Panama Canal  threatened. In turn, we Panamanians do not see any reason from  a military standpoint for there to be bases in Panama, at least  not with the justifications used in the past.    If there is any other reason for a small or medium-sized  U.S.  military presence in Panama, the United States would have to say  what it is and propose it to the Panamanians. Then we would  have to look at our national interests, strictly from a security  and military viewpoint. The positive or negative consequences  of the permanence of U.S. troops in Panama because of economic  issues is not a basis for such a decision. That is something  altogether different, and it cannot be the fundamental criterion  for agreeing to or opposing a U.S. military presence in Panama.    Let us suppose there is an additional interest on the part  of  the United States to maintain some presence in Panama. I can  think, for example, of let us say the struggle against drug  trafficking. If there is an interest on the part of the United  States in this, then we would have to see what the terms and  conditions are. Anything that might be agreed upon would then  have to be submitted to a national referendum, because that is  not a decision that can be made exclusively by the executive or  legislative branch. It would have to be subjected to a  referendum by the Panamanian people.</p>

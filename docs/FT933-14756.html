			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Compensation urged for fuel VAT GOVERNMENT advisers yesterday urged ministers to make an extra Pounds 400m a year available to people on social security benefits to compensate for the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. And in the Commons last night the government's majority was cut to 8 (307-299) when three Tory backbenchers joined with opposition MPs in voting against the extension of the tax. Mr William Powell (C Corby), who moved an amendment to remove the relevant provision from the Finance Bill, was accompanied by Mr Nicholas Winterton ( C Macclesfield), and Mr Geoffrey Dickens ( C Littleborough and Saddleworth) in voting against the government. Anxiety among Treasury ministers was heightened when it became clear that a number of government supporters, including Mr John Biffen, MP for Shropshire north and a former cabinet minister, had failed to reach the Chamber before the doors to the voting lobbies were locked. Mr Powell was cheered by Labour backbenchers when he recalled that during last year's general election the Conservative party gave an unequivocal promise that VAT would not be extended to domestic fuel. He said: 'I also gave that promise to my own constituents - I meant it and I propose to keep it'. The report from the social security advisory committee said increases promised by the impact of the VAT on the formula for benefits would meet only 'something under half' of higher fuel bills. It estimated that compensating some 8m people for higher fuel bills once the full rate of VAT was charged from 1995 would cost about Pounds 720m. Calling the additional Pounds 400m a 'modest proportion' of the revenue expected to be generated from the VAT increase, the report said: 'We would hope that Treasury ministers can be convinced that this unavoidable increase in the social security budget is fully justified and should not be seen as an increase in public expenditure.' The committee urged a look at how people on benefits unrelated to income could be compensated. This has particularly worried Tory MPs concerned at the plight of pensioners whose savings or income makes them ineligible for income support.</p>

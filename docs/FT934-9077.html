			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / NUM to hold pay strike ballot THE National Union of Mineworkers is to hold a postal ballot next month on plans for an overtime ban and selective strike action in support of a pay increase. NUM members have not had a pay increase for more than two years. Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM leader, said on BBC TV last night that the union would demand a pay rise of 1.5 per cent from British Coal. The ballot plan was agreed at a meeting of union delegates in Sheffield yesterday. Delegates were told that miners' productivity was 3 1/2 times higher than it was seven years ago. The union's executive has had no formal pay talks with British Coal since the 1984-85 miners' strike.</p>

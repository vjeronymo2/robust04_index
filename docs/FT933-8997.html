			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Hospital audits to go to tender: Accountancy firms welcome pilot scheme in market testing AUDIT SERVICES for hospital trusts and local authorities are to be opened to competition next year in a market testing exercise by the Audit Commission. The move was immediately welcomed by large accountancy firms, many of which are anxious for new sources of business. Sir David Cooksey, chairman of the commission, which this year received gross fee income of Pounds 76.6m for auditing public bodies with a total turnover of about Pounds 85bn, announced today that the commission's district audit service is to be made administratively separate. The commission will then work as a purchaser of services provided by the district audit service or outside accounting firms. About 30 per cent of the commission's work is already shared between eight firms of private auditors, and the district audit service itself contracts out 15.3 per cent of its workload. However, rival bids are assessed only on quality, and all firms are paid a uniform audit fee, making it 'very difficult to pass on the benefits of competitive tendering', according to Sir David. Under a pilot scheme due to start in April next year, 2 per cent of the commission's audit work will be awarded on the basis of price competition. Most contracts will involve new National Health Service trusts, but some local authority contracts will be included. The scheme will then be monitored for at least a year before deciding whether to extend the programme. Sir David said: 'We are able to do this because with the next wave of trusts coming through in April next year there is an increase in workload.' He said the scheme remained on a limited scale because the review of local government structure in England by Sir John Banham, former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, is still in progress. 'Once the outcome of the local government review is fully understood, a much larger tranche will be put up for tender,' Sir David said. Price Waterhouse was one of several large accountancy firms which expressed interest in bidding for the new contracts. Mr Gordon Cartmell of Touche Ross said: 'It is very early days but we are interested in pursuing these contracts.' He said the firm would make a judgment on each potential tender, based on what services it might be excluded from by taking on the audits. Auditors might, for example, be barred from offering computer consultancy, tax advice or general management consultancy. The commission has promised 'full discussion' with interested parties before the first pilot. Funds 'at risk' in opt-out schools, Page 6</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Belgian justice reforms sought Belgium's government came under renewed pressure to reform its criminal justice and prison systems yesterday after the man accused of masterminding a series of bloody hold-ups, and the kidnapping of a former Belgian prime minister, committed suicide in his cell, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The death of Patrick Haemers, Belgium's most notorious prisoner, will further upset preparations for the trial of the so-called 'Haemers gang' which has already been delayed once for lack of a jury and undermined by the escape of two of the eight people accused alongside Haemers. He faced a four-month wait for trial, while the Belgian parliament rushed through emergency legislation on jury selection.</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Missouri basketball Coach Norm Stewart is not likely to return to the team this  season, a doctor said, adding that Stewart's prospects for beating cancer were  excellent.  </P> <P> "His chance for a complete cure could be as high as 90%," said Walter Peters,  the surgeon who operated on the 54-year-old Stewart, removing about a third of  Stewart's colon.  </P> <P> Stewart collapsed last Thursday as the team was flying to Oklahoma City.  </P> <P> and after spending the night in the hospital there he was returned to Columbia,  Mo., for further tests. Doctors began treating him for bleeding ulcers, then  discovered he also had the cancerous tumor in his colon.  </P></p>

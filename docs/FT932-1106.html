			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Midwest speaks up for Nafta FARM and manufacturing interests in the US midwest have grown weary of holding their fire against foes of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Like business groups and public officials across the country, they believe anti-Nafta forces, particularly labour unions and Mr Ross Perot, last year's independent candidate for the presidency, need to be answered if the pact is to be implemented next January on schedule. In Illinois, the defence will be taken up by a coalition of 200 of the state's largest companies, representing agriculture, manufacturing, electronics, oil, steel and finance. The objective is to regenerate political momentum for the pact. In Washington, a business coalition, USA Nafta, has the same goal. It is attracting support from across the country. The nation's governors, particularly those in the west, are also coming out for the pact. According to a survey by the heritage foundation, 40 of 50 governors strongly support the agreement, with 10 undecided or not responding. 'If Nafta is to become a reality, the White House has to be behind it,' said Mr Bill Lane, of Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker. He said the group will work with the Illinois congressional delegation to create a pro-Nafta force in Washington. Illinois, with its farm and manufacturing base, has a lot at stake. Mexico is its second largest foreign market, with exports of Dollars 16.5bn annually. Group members include drug maker Abbott Laboratories; electronics manufacturer Motorola; the giant retailer, Sears; Amoco Oil; and a variety of farm organisations and food companies. Caterpillar stands to gain Dollars 45m in additional sales under Nafta. In 1992 it sold Dollars 200m in engines and equipment to Mexico.</p>

Iranian Scheme To  Partition Iraq. The Iranian Intelligence Services Prepare  Terrorist Cells From the Iraqi Opposition, Distribute Them Among  European States;" date not given--all names as transliterated]    [Text] Three years after Operation Desert Storm, Iraq's  future is still "at a precarious position." Some observers  expect that Saddam Husayn will remain the head of a country that  is militarily destroyed, politically isolated, and economically  besieged. Meanwhile, others await the toppling of Saddam through  a military coup or a popular revolution.    A surprising analysis, however, comes from Tehran, where the  mullahs expect serious changes in the next few months that will  partition Iraq. Hence, Iran is preparing to gain the "lion's  share" of "Saddam's heritage." Iran has prepared a  comprehensive scheme to exploit the new situation by adopting,  supporting, and entrusting opposition Shiite factions with  military and terrorist missions in and outside Iraq. AL-WATAN  AL-'ARABI reveals the details of the Iranian scheme designed to  use Iraq's Shiites in the partition scenario, which includes  Baghdad, Beirut, and European capitals.    At the beginning of February, the Iranian Higher National  Security Council, the highest political and military authority  in Iran, held a top secret meeting devoted to discussing an  important report prepared by the foreign intelligence service  led by 'Ali Fallahian in cooperation with the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. This security-political report was devoted to  future Iranian-Iraqi relations, particularly the future  situation in Iraq and its possible repercussions on Iran.    This report was prepared in light of secret information  Tehran received through its diplomatic missions, particularly  its permanent representative in New York, Kamal Kharrazi, and  its intelligence offices in several Western capitals concerned  with what is taking place in Iraq, as well as through its  embassy in Baghdad.    The little information leaking from this meeting says senior  Iranian officials expressed their conviction that the situation  in Iraq will see important changes in the coming phase. They  believe Iraq's future will not remain uncertain indefinitely,  and that all options are still open, including possibilities of  internal revolution, military coup, assassination, and  partition. In this meeting, 'Ali Khamane'i, leader of the  Islamic revolution, revealed that the situation in Iraq is  burning under the ashes, and that talk about Saddam Husayn's  success in controlling the situation may not last long in view  of the economic problems, social crises, blockade, and popular  grumbling.    Khamene'i added: Any change in Iraq will reflect on the  situation in Iran. We are interested in Iraq. Consequently, we  should be ready to consider such change and deal with it before  it actually takes place. He continued: The policy of double  containment, which the U.S. Administration reinstated, is only a  pressure card adopted by the Clinton administration. This card  is linked to the extent of our ability to contain this U.S.  threat and to Saddam Husayn's ability to convince the Americans  to use him as a weapon in order to confront what the powers of  global arrogance term the Iranian threat, and also to prevent  the establishment of a Shiite entity in southern Iraq.    'Ali Fallahian pointed out that the reports he recently  received from several big capitals interested in the situation  in Iraq do not rule out the occurrence of regional changes.  Some reports even talk about redrawing a new regional map,  including Iraq's partition, fragmentation, and division into  several sectarian and ethnic entities.    Fallahian added: Naturally, regional and international  reasons were behind the world's refusal to partition Iraq in the  wake of the Gulf war. The same reasons are still behind keeping  Saddam Husayn in power as a guarantor of Iraq's unity.    Fallahian continued: But the current situation in Iraq  cannot remain as it is. Any possible scenario, whether a coup,  a popular uprising, an assassination, or any other possibility,  will eventually lead to the breakout of ethnic, sectarian, and  political conflicts leading to civil war and chaos. Most  probably, this will lead to partition. Therefore, we should be  prepared to exploit any future developments in Iraq and use them  in our interest, especially since such developments will have  clear effects on us.    Informed Iranian sources told AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI that the  higher authorities in Tehran have for a while been acting as if  Iraq is heading toward partitioning. The sources add that the  Iranians want to take a lion's share from the changes that may  occur in Iraq. Toward this end, they are strengthening their  relations with the Shiite majority, especially after Iran  managed to move the Shiite religious authority from al-Najaf to  Qom. To prove their point, the sources recall a recent  statement by Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to KAYHAN, the  Arabic edition, in which he stressed that Iran, first and  foremost, has the right to look after the affairs of Muslims in  Iraq.    AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has learned that at the conclusion of the  Iranian Security Council's meeting, a committee comprising  political, military, and security experts was entrusted with  preparing a detailed future working plan to deal with such a  scenario. This scenario is preferred by Tehran, contrary to  most Arab and Western capitals, which unfailingly stress their  rejection of the partitioning of Iraq and their interest in  having its unity maintained.    According to information obtained by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI, the  Iranians have actually begun preparing a plan to reap the fruits  of the expected changes in Iraq. Thus, they have intensified  their contacts with the Iraqi Shia to reinforce their influence  inside Iraq, especially in the areas with a Shiite majority.  AL-WATAN AL- 'ARABI has also learned that the Iranian plan  focuses on organizing the fundamental Iraqi opposition factions  to use them as a Trojan horse to implement its plan. For weeks,  there have been disclosures about Iranian practices, activities,  and intensive contacts with fundamental opposition factions,  some of which have been briefed on the situation. Reports  affirm that Iranian Ambassador in Damascus Shaykh Ahmad 'Ali  Akhtari recently met with Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, head of the  Supreme Assembly of Islamic Revolution in Iraq, and told him  explicitly that important changes will happen in Iraq within the  next few months. He told him that the international changes  will eventually arrive in Iraq, which will be divided in  accordance with a confederation system after international  troops are sent into it. He also told him that many regions in  Iraq will become autonomous.    Information obtained by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI from very  reliable  sources in Tehran says that officials from the "Liberation  Movements Bureau," which is headed by Iranian 'Ali A'qal  Mohammadi, head of the Iraq Affairs Center, began to prepare  plans for bolstering the position of the Iraqi opposition,  especially the fundamental opposition, both inside and outside  Iraq. According to this plan, action cells will set up in Iraq,  and they will be ready to intervene when the zero hour arrives.  As for foreign action, Iraqi opposition elements will be  recruited. They will be linked with the terrorist cells  affiliated with the Liberation Movements Bureau and foreign  intelligence. They will work to strike at Iraqi interests,  embassies, and institutions in a number of European countries.  They will also carry out assassinations.    The plan calls for seeking the help of a large number of  Iraqi opposition elements residing in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and  some Arab countries. They will be urged to travel to Sweden,  Britain, Denmark, Italy, France, Cyprus, and other countries.    Iranian embassies in these countries will get in touch with  Iraqi opposition groups and terrorist cells and organize their  activities and plans and establish their objectives. It was  learned that the Iranian embassies will issue Iraqis with forged  passports and equipment suited to their operations. These  embassies will provide information and details about movements  of Iraqi diplomats and mission staff.    It seems the Iranian authorities are anxious not to raise  suspicion that they are directing these operations. It was  noticed that their activities and contacts with the  fundamentalist Iraqi opposition have, for some weeks, focused on  Lebanon. In fact, the Lebanese security agencies have been  surprised by the strength of the Iraqi fundamentalist presence  on Lebanese territory and the increased activity of Iraqi  fundamentalists.    Some reports speak of intensive meetings by Iraqi  fundamentalists in the central al-Biqa' region chaired by an  Iraqi called Abu- Haydar. According to information obtained  from security sources, the al-Biqa' meetings are preparatory.  They represent one of a series of intensive, secret sessions  that take place in the Iraqi opposition office in the southern  suburb of Beirut, chaired by Abu-Maysam, the Da'wah Party  representative in Lebanon. The reports mention the name of  another Iraqi called Fakhir, who was charged with providing  forged Iranian, Kuwaiti, and Bahraini passports for a large  number of the Iraqi opposition members, some of whom actually  began travelling to a number of European nations.    It was learned that this official holds meetings for Iraqis  in Bi'r al-'Abd in the southern suburb of Beirut. The  information indicates that the external Iranian intelligence  services began cementing their links with elements of the Iraqi  opposition some time ago. For instance, in the German city of  Aachen, Iraqi opposition elements have joined hands with Iranian  intelligence presonnel to launch an Arab language daily under  the name of AL-JIHAD for distribution among Iraqi, other Arab,  and Islamic communities in Germany. A version of the paper  printed in Tehran arrives in Lebanon where it is distributed  among Muslim and revolutionary extremists.    Lebanese security agencies recently noticed that Hizballah  has been tightening its ties with Iraqi fundamentalists,  sponsoring their operations. It has been learned that financial  remittances have been transferred in the past few weeks from  Iran to a number of Iraqi opposition members stationed in Syria  and Lebanon to finance their activities and moves. According to  some reports, the Iraqi Affairs Bureau in Tehran has requested  additional funds from the Iranian Foreign Ministry's  intelligence section to meet potentially increasing foreign  operations.    The Iranian project to organize opposition Iraqi factions  calls for merging the Iraqi organizations and fundamentalist  parties in an expanded front led by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim,  president of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in  Iraq. The front is supposed to have a secretariat, committees,  general secretariat, and a central shura council. It was  learned that the front would incorporate some Iraqi Kurdish  factions.    These are some of the Islamic forces that could join the  expanded front:    1. SAIRI, which is headed by Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim.    2. The Iraqi Islamic Movement, represented by Shaykh 'Ali  'Abd- al-'Aziz.    3. The Iraqi Islamic Grouping, represented by Hojjat  ol-Eslam Muhammad Bahr al-'Ulum.    4. The Islamic al-Da'wah Party, represented by  'Abd-al-Hamid Kashani.    5. The Islamic Action Organization, headed by Hojjat  ol-Eslam Muhammad Taqi Mudaressi. Ayatollah Taghi will  represent the organization.    6. The Imam Soldiers Movement led by Sami al-Badri.    7. The Islamic Movement in Iraq led by Shaykh Jawad  al-Khalis. The Islamic Scholars Organization in Iraq,  represented by Hojjjat ol-Eslam Muhammad Baqir al-Naseri.    The following are some of Kurdish organizations that could  join the expanded front:    1. The Kurdistan People's Democratic Party, led by Sami  'Abd-al- Rahman.    2. The Kurdistan Socialist Party, led by Rasul Mamand.    The Iranians seek to hold negotiations with Sa'd Salih Jabr,  leader of the Free Iraqi Council which was formed in the United  Kingdom during the Gulf war. However, Jabr so far has refused  this Iranian proposal saying it serves the Persian aspirations  in the Arab region and conflicts with the Council's objectives.    This heightened Iranian interest in the Iraqi opposition's  activities has raised many questions among large sectors of the  Iraqi opposition, including some fundamentalists. In the past,  the Iraqi fundamentalist opposition faced some harassment in  Tehran and at times has been explicitly told to look for another  refuge country. The Iraqi opposition in Iran has often feared  that Tehran would conclude a deal with the Iraqi regime at its  expense by sacrificing it for the Mojahedin-e-Khalq which  Baghdad sponsors. Actually, the Iranian authorities had in the  past moved many Iraqi opposition members to Lebanon. But, it  seems that Tehran has found a new and important role for the  Iraqi fundamentalist opposition to play. Thus, it began getting  closer to it and emphasizing it is ready to fulfill all its  demands.    Observers believe that Iran, which originally was not ready  to give up this Iraqi opposition without exacting a price for it  from Baghdad--which could at a minimum be Rajavi's head--is now  more ready to placate this opposition as a card that Iran can  use in its as yet ambiguous plan unless the Iranian rulers  already have secret components which are part of some deal.  The coming months will reveal how the Iranian regime plans to  use the Iraqi opposition.</p>

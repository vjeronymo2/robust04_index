			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / People: Sir Sydney's true and fair views The accounting world should be braced for a shake-up in the new year as Sir Sydney Lipworth, QC, takes on the chairmanship of the Financial Reporting Council. Sir Sydney (right) turns his hand to company accounts after his role as chairman of the tough-minded Monopolies and Mergers Commission from 1988 to April 1993. He replaces Sir Ron Dearing, former head of the Post Office Corporation, who is retiring from the world of accounting while staying on as head of the Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority. Sir Ron had been in the unusual position of attempting to implement his own recommendations - he chaired the 1988 report which argued for the council and its two main subsidiaries, the Accounting Standards Board and the Financial Reporting Review Panel. Sir Sydney, 62, who was selected by representatives from the Department of Trade and Industry and the Bank of England, takes on the job for three years; his tenure may then be renewed. He is holding fire on his ideas for the new job, but says: 'It's a fascinating area and one which one wants to see absolutely right.' He wants to see 'consistency' in accounts, and a format that 'best represents the achievements of the year'. Sir Sydney studied accountancy as part of his first degree in commerce and law at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, before coming to the UK in 1965. He worked for Abbey Life Assurance, and joined Allied Dunbar Assurance, rising to become deputy chairman in 1984. He was also a director of BAT. He is currently deputy chairman of National Westminster Bank and on the board of Carlton Communications.</p>

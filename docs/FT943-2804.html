			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Hope for Peru bank debt talks Creditors to commercial banks in Peru are set to re-open formal negotiations regarding the restructuring of Dollars 7bn of commercial bank debt, a senior banker said yesterday. Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank, which heads the country's bank advisory committee, is to meet Peru's minister of the economy around the time of the International Monetary Fund's Madrid meeting early next month. The way for reopening talks has been cleared by a recommendation from a Peruvian congressional committee this week that loans made by two US banks - American Express and Chemical Bank - should be recognised. Peru's Congress is expected to discuss the recommendation on the loans next week, and the committee's view is expected to have a strong bearing on the decision. The two banks claim some Dollars 36m, as well as perhaps twice that amount in unpaid interest. The loans were repudiated by the 1985-90 government of Mr Alan Garcia.</p>

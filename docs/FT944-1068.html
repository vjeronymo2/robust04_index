			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Fresh milk runs out of bottle - As prices rise, dairies are adopting new strategies It will come as a surprise to most British milk-drinkers that, in a recent Gallup survey, 96 per cent of the people sampled could not taste the difference between longlife and fresh milk. Most British consumers insist the taste of UHT (ultra heat treated) milk puts them off. Unlike their French and Spanish counterparts, UK shoppers have resisted the pull of convenience over what they perceive as the superior taste of fresh milk. But Tetra Pak, the international packaging and milk processing company that commissioned the survey, plans a wide marketing campaign to try to remove some of the shoppers' prejudice. 'Longlife has never been actively marketed, positioned or explained in the UK market and it will be difficult to persuade consumers that it is acceptable and palatable,' says Steve Milne, marketing manager at Tetra Pak. But the company believes the time is right to try to build a market almost from scratch - UHT represents around 5 per cent of the 5.8bn-litre UK milk market. The Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales is currently in a state of flux following the liberalisation of supply in November which introduced competitive forces for the first time in 60 years. The uncertainties in the market and the continuing decline of doorstep sales could provide an opening for longlife, Milne believes. At the same time, improvements in processing techniques have made UHT more palatable. 'The public's perception of UHT is lagging the reality and we're coming up with an information and communication campaign to try and explain that,' says Milne. The company is considering widespread TV and media advertising in the new year, but it is also testing the results of a range of different marketing techniques. In the run-up to Christmas, it plans to stress the convenience of having a cupboard-full of longlife milk instead of jamming the fridge full of bottles of fresh. The company plans to drop leaflets at half the homes in the UK in coming weeks, it is paying for promotional features in leading food magazines and sponsoring the Christmas edition of the TV Times where a cookery article will stress the benefits of longlife. At the same time, it is hoping that UHT taste testings at supermarkets across the country will help change attitudes. Milne says that, while improvements in processing techniques have made longlife taste better, the real break for UHT could come from consumer preferences for lower fat products. It is the cream that is affected by the heat treatment process causing a slight caramel taste. But semi-skimmed and skimmed UHT milk differ little in taste from fresh, pasteurised milk since they also contain less cream. When asked to rank the milk they liked best in blind tasting, a majority of the 535 people sampled in the Gallup survey chose semi-skimmed UHT ahead of semi-skimmed pasteurised and skimmed fresh milks. In addition, seven in 10 of the respondents found the taste of the UHT milks acceptable. Milne stresses that longlife milk can solve a variety of problems for the dairy industry which is still coming to terms with the new competitive market. For one, processing of UHT milk can be an outlet for supply surpluses that are created at certain times of the year when cows are having calves. Dairies are rapidly closing excess capacity for producing butter and skimmed milk powder, traditionally used to cope with excess supply. Longlife milk could also help to boost overall milk consumption in spite of the decline in doorstep sales. 'Our survey found that 48 per cent of the households headed by people in the 16-44 age range had run out of milk at some point in the past six weeks,' he said. 'When that happens people start to develop a taste for black coffee and use less milk.' He wants to position longlife as a top-up product to ensure that shoppers never run out - UHT has a shelf life of six months. A growth in longlife use will reduce the need for supermarkets to provide costly refrigeration equipment as more consumers turn to them for milk. The ease of distribution of longlife milk has been a factor in its growth on the continent where French consumption has risen to around 60 per cent of the market in the past 20 years. Longlife has proved so successful in Mediterranean countries because it keeps better in the hot climate. UHT has expanded in Spain from an almost negligible share of the market to a share of around 80 per cent of sales in the past 10 years. Tetra Pak does not expect longlife to take over in the UK, which is the only market in Europe where fresh milk dominates. But the company hopes sales may double in the next three years so that eventually it will resemble the German market where consumption is split evenly.</p>

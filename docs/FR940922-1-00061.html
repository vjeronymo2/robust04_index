			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also believes that a determination that model year should be determined on a ``model-by-model'' basis is more appropriate than an interpretation that ``model year'' should begin at the same time industry-wide because the two-year lead-time of section 177 is better fulfilled through a ``model-by-model'' approach. Manufacturers determine the start date for manufacture of vehicle models on a model-by-model basis. Therefore, individual manufacturers are in the best position to determine when each model they produce in a model year will begin production. The lead-time provisions of section 177 were designed to give manufacturers sufficient lead-time to produce California vehicles necessary to meet the supply needs of any state that promulgates standards under section 177 (``177 state''). There is no indication that Congress intended that states be unable to regulate vehicle models that do not begin production before the two-year deadline. Nor is there any practical reason why a particular vehicle model should not be covered. Manufacturers are well aware of their own production schedules and can assure that any vehicle models that begin production after the two-year lead-time ends meet the California requirements in a particular state. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 78  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 78 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Automobile dealerships in an affected state would be able to contact their manufacturers to find out which vehicle models must be sold to California standards in a particular state. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA does not agree with the Second Circuit that an ``industry-wide'' approach to model year would be more appropriate in the context of California's NMOG fleet averaging program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 79  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In fact, though a ``model-by-model'' approach might be more complicated, it actually provides to manufacturers more control over the particular engine models that will be subject to an averaging program for a particular model year, especially compared to an ``industry-wide'' approach. Under the ``industry-wide'' approach, a manufacturer commencing production of its vehicles after the lead-time expires cannot determine for itself what models would be subject to the California requirements, but must instead find out whether any of its competitor manufacturers have begun production of a model for that model year prior to the deadline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 79 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA notes that this model year determination must be geared toward application to all programs that may be promulgated by California, not merely the programs promulgated as part of the LEV program. Therefore, application of the model year determination to a particular program should not be given overwhelming weight in our determination. As the First Circuit noted, ``[f]leet averaging for emissions programs is a concept devised by California, not Congress.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, the increased complexity that may be caused by different emission requirements for different vehicles in a single model year is not unique to the Agency's approach to the term ``model year'' under section 177. In fact, any program that includes a phase-in of standards ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the ``Tier I'' requirements of section 202(g)) results in different standards for different cars within a model year. Moreover, the California LEV program itself contemplates that different cars will be certified to different standards during a single model year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, any increased complexity must be balanced against the emissions benefits of such a decision. The best example of the severe emissions detriment that will occur if the ``industry-wide'' approach is used is the example of Massachusetts' implementation of the California vehicle program for model year 1995. Massachusetts' promulgation of rules requiring model year 1995 cars to meet California standards was completed by January 31, 1992. This gave manufacturers a full two years of lead-time for any vehicle model that began production after January 31, 1994. However, model year 1995 could begin, under EPA rules, by January 2, 1994, and a few vehicle models had begun production by that time. If the ``industry-wide'' approach had been used for the Massachusetts situation, then, conceivably, all manufacturers could continue to provide all of their model year 1995 vehicles to Massachusetts until December 31, 1995 without meeting the California standards for any of the vehicles. Thus, there would be close to four years between promulgation of the Massachusetts rule and full compliance with such rule by manufacturers. Moreover, the ``industry-wide'' rule would require that California standards not be enforced for any vehicles manufactured in the 1995 model year. Since the 1996 model year does not begin for any vehicle until, at the earliest, January 2, 1995, the ``industry-wide'' rule would provide almost three full years between promulgation and any enforcement of California standards. The emissions increases that would result from the loss of a full model year from the California program could have a significant impact on air pollution in ``177 states'' and on the ability of such states to meet the attainment deadlines provided in the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``model-by-model'' approach is also preferable to the ``manufacturer-by-manufacturer'' approach <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 80  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> because it substantially lessens the competitiveness concerns that could otherwise result. Given that under the ``model-by-model'' approach, the determination of model year would be based on when each individual model begins production, there would be less of an opportunity for a manufacturer to exempt its entire vehicle fleet for a full model year by beginning production of one vehicle model before the two year deadline. Thus, there is considerably less likelihood that two manufacturers will have to meet different emission standards for all of their vehicles for a particular year based only on when one model for a particular manufacturer began production. Instead, the ``model-by-model'' approach is likely to result in similar percentages of vehicles for each manufacturer being covered by California rules for the ``split'' model year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 80 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The ``manufacturer-by-manufacturer'' approach would allow any manufacturer that had begun production of any model before the two year deadline to escape enforcement of the state regulations for every model produced by that manufacturer during that model year. This approach had been mandated by the trial court in the New York LEV case before the Second Circuit opinion was delivered,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see MVMA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> NYDEC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 831 F.

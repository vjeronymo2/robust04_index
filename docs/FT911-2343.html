			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Government Bonds: Bunds hold nerve after G-7 interest rate pressure THE GERMAN government bond market showed resilience yesterday following calls for lower global interest rates from the weekend meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialised countries. The benchmark 9 per cent 10-year Bund closed yesterday at 103.86, for a yield of 8.39 per cent, against 8.41 per cent on Friday. On the London International Financial Futures Exchange, the long bund futures contract closed at 85.42, against 85.19 at Friday's close. Although the G-7 statement contained a commitment to lower global interest rates in the longer term, there is no sign that the German authorities will ease monetary conditions. Indeed, figures released yesterday confirmed that inflationary pressures persist within the German economy. Money supply data for March showed the M3 measure of broad money growing at a yearly rate of 4.4 per cent over the last quarter of 1990, for a year-on-year increase of 20.3 per cent over the first quarter last year. Statistics also showed inflation rising in March by 0.5 per cent over February, for an annualised rate of 2.8 per cent, against 2.5 per cent last time. Moreover, money market conditions remain tight. Yesterday German call money interest rates were only just below the 9 per cent Lombard rate, the Bundesbank emergency funding rate. Hence the bund market will watch Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting in anticipation of higher, rather than lower, interest rates. Analysts will be watching industrial production and manufacturing orders figures this week for signs of overheating. However, yesterday the Bundesbank signalled that it would supply short-term liquidity to the market at an unchanged fixed rate of 8.6 per cent at its regular repurchase operations today. This might indicate that any tightening of monetary conditions will be postponed beyond this week. Lex, Page 22 US GOVERNMENT bond prices eased after a variety of economic data provided a mixed view of the state of the economy. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue was down  7/32 at 96 1/16 , to carry a yield of 8.224 per cent. The short end was also weaker, with the two-year note  1/32 lower at 100 3/16 , to yield 6.881 per cent. Among the welter of economic statistics, it was the 0.6 per cent gain in personal consumption for March that created the biggest stir. The rise was larger than forecast and, allied to a 0.2 per cent rise in personal income during the period, suggested that the economic recovery was gradually picking up pace. The market was also surprised by figures showing new home sales rose 1 per cent in March, and a revised 18.6 per cent in February. New home sales are traditionally regarded as a useful indicator of future economic trends. Any evidence of an economic upturn strengthens the hands of those at the Federal Reserve who see no further need for an interest rate cut, and who believe policy should be left unchanged to prevent a return to high inflation. Activity through the day was light, although in the afternoon bond prices fell further on reports of a large seller of bond futures contracts and a large seller of two-year notes. In the credit markets, the Fed intervened to push the Fed funds rate back up to its target of 6 per cent. UK GOVERNMENT bonds weakened slightly, continuing the upward correction in yields seen on Friday in the face of sterling's weakness on the foreign exchange markets. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt maturing 2003/2007 closed down just 1/16 of a point on the day at 109 31/32 for a yield of 10.258 per cent. The long gilt futures contract closed at 91.17, after opening at 91.20. The market is focusing on Thursday's local government elections for pointers to the timing and outcome of a general election expected this year. The Confederation of British Industry industrial trends survey for March, released today, is expected to show a marginal upturn in business confidence and an improvement in forward indicators. JAPANESE government bonds moved higher in London in lacklustre trading, with the Tokyo market closed for a public holiday. The benchmark government bond issue No 129 closed on a yield of 6.71 per cent, against 6.74 per cent on Friday. Although trading is likely to remain thin for the rest of the week, analysts are watching for signs of the Bank of Japan's reaction to G-7 pressures for lower global interest rates. THE DUTCH government raised Fl 1.6bn through tap sales of its 8.5 per cent bond due 2006 yesterday. The tap price was lowered to 99.40 from 99.55 on Friday, raising the yield by two basis points to 8.57 per cent. The sales brought the total raised to Fl 3.1bn since the tap sale was opened last Thursday.</p>

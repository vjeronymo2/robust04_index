			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Merseyside covets neighbour's lifestyle: Ian Hamilton Fazey on the contrasting fortunes of two cities in the north-west of England Market forces are playing havoc with north-west England. The European Community this week proposed Merseyside should be downgraded in Europe's league table of economic distress to Corsican levels, qualifying for extra funding. Yet only 35 miles away, its old rival Manchester is celebrating. Next week the Pounds 265m first phase of Manchester Airport's Terminal 2 will open - a symbol of economic resurgence. This week, the city beat off London and Santiago de Compostela in Spain to stage this summer's world chess championship match between Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short. In September, the city hosts the second Earth Summit and will hear if its bid for the 2000 Olympic Games has succeeded against the front-runners, Sydney and Beijing. This is the league a buoyant Manchester is playing in. But Merseyside wants to spoil the party: local leaders say Liverpool airport should be expanded from 400,000 to 12m passengers a year. Their proposal would preclude the need for a second runway at Manchester airport, which Manchester wants to handle 30m passengers a year by 2005, compared with its present 12.4m. Since the second runway would intrude into the affluent Cheshire green belt, Merseyside will join some of the north's richest residents next year to fight it on both environmental and economic planning grounds at a public inquiry. Planners estimate that every 1m passengers a year passing through an airport generate about 1,000 jobs. The five Merseyside boroughs - Liverpool, Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton and Wirral - want them funnelled where they are needed most. Merseyside's unemployment rate of 17.5 per cent compares poorly with Greater Manchester's 11.4 per cent, which is nearer the national average. The latter's economy is diversified and has withstood the current recession well, while Merseyside's has continued to struggle. Indeed, the economic tide has been running against Merseyside for most of the century. The Right Reverend David Sheppard, bishop of Liverpool, says: 'In every recession, Merseyside has gone down further and faster than anywhere else and has never recovered to the level from which it started. Unemployment here is not cyclical, but chronic and structural.' Changing patterns of trade, coupled with new technology in bulk shipping and stevedoring, have continuously reduced demand for unskilled labour and port-related services in the Mersey docks. The catalyst for reversing decline, says Mr Ian Berry, chief executive of Liverpool Chamber of Commerce of Industry, 'is to improve strategic sites and create a better image'. Many of these sites are derelict and near Liverpool airport. Mr Harry Rimmer, leader of Liverpool City Council and an airport director, says EC money would go towards reclaiming derelict land and improving road and rail links between the airport, motorways, railways - and Manchester. He says Merseyside was already on the slide before the financially disastrous period of 1983-87, when Militant, a Marxist grouping he has helped purge from the Labour party, controlled Liverpool council. The area had 619,000 jobs in 1977, but by 1981 this was down to 560,000. The figure dropped further to about 480,000 by 1986 and about 420,000 in 1990. Most lost jobs were manual. Most of the area's employment is now in service businesses, which require an educated or skilled workforce. An exodus of people with the wrong skills, unable to get work locally, saw Merseyside's population shrink by 276,000 to fewer than 1.4m between 1971 and 1991 - the most rapid rate of contraction in Britain in that period. Paradoxically, depopulation has not seriously damaged the tax base and local spending power, because the remaining workers are better paid. What drags Merseyside down to EC disaster levels, however, are 47,000 long-term unemployed. Mr Peter Stoney, a Liverpool University economist, says more than three-quarters of these are male manual workers and half live in council houses, so they cannot move. 'We need the type of economic growth that will match the quality of the labour available. Retraining has not had a noticeable effect,' Mr Stoney says. 'We need more port-related and 'brown' (manufacturing) industries. Leisure and office developments push land values above what manufacturers can afford.' No-nonsense business parks for manufacturers, clustered around an expanding airport, might do the trick, thinks Mr Rimmer. But if Manchester gets its second runway - never mind the Olympics - Merseyside's fear is that it will always be the poor relation.</p>

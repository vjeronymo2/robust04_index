"It would be controversial to play a role in a neighboring  state's problem when I have not done it in my own country,"  Menchu said at a news conference, where she deplored the fact  that the Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity (URNG) have not asked her to mediate.    Menchu said she was expressing her view on this matter  because of the expectations that had been raised concerning the  EZLN proposal, although, she stressed, the request to mediate  was not made officially in a written document.</p>

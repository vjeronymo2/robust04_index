			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / New Delhi bolsters securities watchdog The Indian government yesterday gave more teeth to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), its stock-market watchdog, by announcing regulations intended to provide greater transparency during substantial acquisitions of shares and takeovers. Under the new rules, any investor holding or acquiring 5 per cent of a company will have to make one-off disclosures to stock exchanges where the shares being purchased are listed. Those with 10 per cent holdings will have to make half-yearly disclosures. Those intending to acquire 20 per cent of a target company may be required to make a public announcement . Officials said the regulations would provide trigger points for disclosure, while giving the board more power to supervise takeovers and acquisitions in a newly liberalised economy. The exchange board was set up in 1992 amid the chaos that followed the multi-million-dollar stock market scandal in Bombay, the country's largest exchange. Bankers and stockbrokers colluded to use inside information and money illegally diverted from interbank securities to play on Bombay's then overheated stock market. News of the scandal sent share prices diving, and challenged the credibility of Mr P V Narasimha Rao's government. In the first few months after it was set up, decisions taken by the securities board, such as the introduction of brokers' fees in November 1992, met resentment and countrywide strikes. In March 1993 a row erupted between the Bombay stock exchange and the board over the SEBI's first inspection of stockbrokers' books. Brokers complained of its heavy handedness, and said it would stifle growth. But the Finance Ministry was determined to make the board more powerful to avoid yet another scandal erupting. The board proved it had come into its own when it banned the age-old practice of badla, or carry-forward trading on the stock exchange, in 1993. Under the badla system, brokers and buyers could carry outstanding purchases from one settlement period to the next without paying for them in full, and so acquire large volumes of shares with relatively little money. The informal forward market, which accounted for 70-90 per cent of all transactions before the ban was imposed, allowed for liquidity of cash in the market, with buyers and sellers always able to strike a deal at any price. But the practice encouraged speculation and stunted growth of the Indian stock markets, some of which are older than developed countries' exchanges. The ban, followed by the appointment of a new chairman, Mr S S Nadkarni, to head the board, paved the way for Indian stock markets to start operating like their international counterparts. While trading began to thin out, with buyers having to pay for shares, speculators who made millions milking the system were weeded out.</p>

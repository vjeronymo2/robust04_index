			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Call for new breed of transport entrepreneur A new breed of entrepreneur able to master a wide variety of business skills will be required if the private sector is to be brought into transport projects, according to Mr Pen Kent, the Bank of England member of the government's private finance panel. It was unreasonable to expect a single group to have all the skills to design, build, finance and operate transport projects such as road bridges or railway lines, he told a Financial Times conference on transport in Europe. The government had come a long way in its approach to the involvement of private finance, Mr Kent said. But further changes were needed if private funding was to be found for the more than 100 projects, which covered health, education and prisons as well as transport. The panel's role is to encourage private and public sectors to work together. Treasury guidance on the private finance initiative issued earlier this year had still not fully sunk in in the public sector, he said. So many companies were being asked to tender for some projects that their combined costs of preparing bids were higher than the value of the contract. Detailed specifications must also be provided to win the commitment of the private sector. 'Evaluation sometimes costs not just thousands but millions,' said Mr Kent. 'When there is no contract at the end it leads to cynicism and a mind set which makes subsequent joint ventures harder to negotiate.' But the private sector should not forget that civil servants were taking risks in agreeing contracts which they might have to defend before the public accounts committee. In the present untried market, early deals might later appear to be uncommercial or 'soft'. Civil servants were taking a risk with no opportunity to share in the upside of projects, he said. The government needed to take a portfolio approach to the private finance initiative. Sometimes public accounting conventions, including the government's insistence on not committing funds for more than one year, posed a real difficulty for the private finance initiative. 'We need somehow to find an equality in planning horizons for both sides, especially for the very large lumpy projects typical of the transport sector,' Mr Kent said.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Climbdown over Maastricht TWO IMPORTANT procedural decisions on the Maastricht bill yesterday sparked chaotic scenes in the Commons as MPs pleaded with Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, to reconsider his ruling not to allow a vote on a potentially crucial Labour amendment. Proceedings eventually ended with the government accepting an embarrassing but not disastrous reverse by declining to challenge a Labour motion that the day's debate be brought to an early close to afford time for 'a cooling-off period'. Mr George Robertson, Labour's Europe spokesman, immediately hailed the government's climbdown as a tactical victory, saying it showed it was in a minority and without authority. Mr Morris's ruling - delivered amid rowdy scenes on government and opposition benches - had been followed by no less than an hour of varied and sometimes heatedly expressed points of order. The ruling confirmed that MPs would not be given a chance to vote on Labour's amendment 27 that would remove the protocol containing Britain's opt-out from Maastricht's social chapter. His announcement came half an hour after the government indicated it would accept a separate Labour clause - new clause 75 - that would make final ratification contingent on a subsequent debate on this opt-out. The conjunction of events suggested MPs would have no opportunity to vote on the controversial social provisions of the treaty during the Maastricht bill's committee stage. Leading the cross-party chorus of dissent, Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, provoked loud cheers from the Tory back benches when he said the ruling set 'a very odd and dangerous procedural precedent'. The case for a vote on amendment 27 remained 'as overwhelming as it always has been'. Many would feel the house had been 'cheated'. Mr Cunningham made clear that Labour would 'demand' the right to reintroduce the matter at the report stage, which is due to follow the completion of deliberations in committee and which will be presided over by Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker. There were particularly angry exchanges when Mr Cunningham said ministers were briefing reporters that they proposed to ignore the vote triggered by new clause 75 after it eventually took place. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, Europe minister, challenged him to name the ministers concerned or withdraw the remark. Mr Garel-Jones later prompted hilarity when he said he found it 'an extraordinary proposition' that it should be a majority which decided whether or not there was a vote on any given issue. One Labour MP commented that such a remark would 'look good on the 6 o'clock news'. Announcing his intention to take votes on a total of four amendments, Mr Morris said the 'easy' option for him would have been to accept amendment 27.</p>

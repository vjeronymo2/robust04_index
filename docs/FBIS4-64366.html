			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Reaction in the Greek press to Greece's  being brought before the European Court of Justice over the  embargo it imposed on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  (FYROM) has dwelled on how responsible the European Union (EU)  and the United States are for this action.  <H5>  United States, EU Equally Responsible </H5>   "Greek public opinion is left with the impression that  Europeans are the villains and the Americans are the good guys  on the Macedonian issue," writes Potis Paraskevopoulos in the 10  April Athens weekly KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA. While this  impression has been reinforced by the decision of the EU  Commission to refer Greece to the European Court of Justice, he  argues, it is an erroneous impression because there is complete  cooperation between the EU and the United States. According to  Paraskevopoulos, the EU was too hasty in referring Greece to the  Court of Justice while UN mediator Cyrus Vance's efforts were  still ongoing. The move encouraged FYROM President Kiro  Gligorov's intransigence and destroyed Greek trust in the EU.  However, President Clinton coordinated his deadline for  progress on the Skopje issue with the EU Commission, which had  set 13 April for talks in New York between Vance and Greek and  FYROM representatives, Paraskevopoulos maintains. On the other  hand, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government was  wrong in hastily breaking off the UN- sponsored dialogue with  FYROM, as was Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in imposing the  embargo on that country. In so doing, Papandreou misjudged  Clinton's intentions, Paraskevopoulos contends. The U.S.  President's support for Gligorov became obvious with the  dispatch of a U.S. military contingent to FYROM, and it is clear  that the EU believes the existence of FYROM is necessary to  peace in the region. While Papandreou hesitated to impose the  embargo for fear of the European reaction, he was counting on  Washington's support because of U.S.-European tensions in the  region. The embargo was a "risky" initiative and it failed,  Paraskevopoulos continues. At the same time that Papandreou  found no supporters abroad, he "blackmailed" fellow Greek  politicians into approving his move for fear of domestic  political consequences. Since he cannot assign responsibility  for his mistakes to the "bad Europeans," he is blaming them, as  he will blame the "good" Americans for not understanding Greece  and then blame the UN for using the same criteria toward a  "statelet" like FYROM that it applies to a "state" like Greece,  Paraskevopoulos concludes.  <H5>  EU Action Termed "Naked Provocation" </H5>   An editorial in the 7 April Athens daily ELEVTHEROTIPIA  calls  the EU referral decision an "unprecedented naked provocation"  against Greece, as well as yet another proof of the "partiality  and enmity" of Greece's European partners. The EU decision  "automatically makes Brussels an untrustworthy interlocutor" in  solving the problem between Athens and Skopje, the editorial  continues. If Greece should not be concerned, for it will win  its case on the basis of "inalienable rights," it is the "major  issue of Community solidarity that is at stake." In practice,  the editorial concludes, solidarity that has given way to  "interests and other goals" is nonexistent.  <H5>  Politicians React </H5>   The 8 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI published the  reaction  of a number of Greek politicians following the EU decision.  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that the decision  "does not foster stability and security in the area of the  southern Balkans" and that it may have a "negative influence" on  Cyrus Vance's mediating initiative. Venizelos added that the  EU's common foreign and security policy has been "sorely tried"  in recent months because of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia,  and that the decision "violates Community solidarity." I  KATHIMERINI also cited Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis as  saying that "the Skopje issue is too important to be entrusted  to technocrats and economists." Arsenis charged that the  European countries' understanding of the "specificities of  conditions in the Balkans is especially weak." The decision, he  is quoted as saying, is the "bureaucratic result of processing  data from a strictly legalistic point of view." Arsenis  insisted that the decision will not change the Greek stance.  New Democracy (ND) leader Miltiadhis Evert is cited as saying  that while the unity of the national front on the issue of FYROM  must be maintained, Greeks must be told that the situation is  very serious. Evert criticized government policy, charging that  "precious time has been lost" and that "the absence of a clear  policy has produced the expected results." According to I  KATHIMERINI, Political Spring leader Andonis Samaras stated that  the EU decision "expressing Community solidarity with Gligorov"  is "unprecedented and offensive." He added that even if the  Court's decision goes against Greece, "we are not compelled to  apply it." Communist Party (KKE) leader Aleka Papariga is cited  as blaming the signing of the Maastricht Treaty for the Skopje  problem and stressing that it gave the EU "the right to  interfere in issues concerning Greece." Finally, N.  Konstandopoulos, leader of the Coalition of the Left for  Progress, attributed the decision to the "erratic moves" of the  government, the ND, and Political Spring, as well as to the EU's  negative stance. Noting that an impasse has been reached,  Konstandopoulos blamed the government and the parties for a  "purely political" approach to the Skopje problem, emphasizing  that the PASOK government has turned Greece into the venue for a  "peculiar confrontation pitting the interests of the United  States, the EU and some of its member states against each  other."  <H5>  United States Responsible for Referral </H5>   In an 8 April I KATHIMERINI article, Ino Afendouli writes  that according to a number of moves "in the sphere of secret  diplomacy," the United States seems to have offered the EU the  basic argument to refer Greece to the Court of Justice by  stating that FYROM is "dangerously destabilized" by the Greek  embargo and that relations between the Slavic majority and the  Albanian minority are "exacerbated." Moreover, the absence of a  "conflagration" in the area is just as important to the United  States as to the EU, Afendouli continues. At a time when  Bosnians are led to a "U.S.-inspired" Croatian-Muslim  federation, it is "unrealistic" to expect that Washington and  Greece's partners will be receptive to "Greek sensitivities  that, in their view, are a destabilizing factor." Afendouli  ends by warning that the U.S. intervention may lead to an  unsatisfactory solution that the Greek Government would be  unable to accept since it rejected better ones in the past.</p>

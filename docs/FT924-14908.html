			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sterling crisis batters Irish farmers IRISH FARM leaders are appealing for IPounds 18m (Pounds 16.7m) in emergency support from the government for beleaguered mushroom, lamb and pig meat exporters, who are being battered by the sterling crisis. They have also requested government backing for a IPounds 300m DM-denominated loan, to help farmers who are now facing real interest rates of around 13 per cent since Ireland's recent three percentage point interest rate hike. Since sterling left the ERM on September 16, it has fallen by 12 per cent against the punt, trading yesterday at around 107.5 to the punt. In making the appeal this week, Mr Tom Parlon, the Irish Farmers' Association deputy president, said: 'Farmers are entitled to the full benefits of the strong punt and the government's 'no devaluation' policy.' The DM loan, he said, would reduce farmers' interest rates by some 5 to 6 percentage points. Beef and dairy producers are still protected from currency fluctuations by the EC subsidies known as monetary compensation amounts (MCAs), due to be phased out by next January, but the lamb, pig meat and mushroom producers enjoy no such protection. Ireland exports 45 per cent of its pig meat to the UK, worth some IPounds 60m per year. Mushroom growers are currently exporting some IPounds 43m worth of produce annually to the UK, which represents 80 per cent of total output. Irish lamb exports, worth some IPounds 150m per year and representing 90 per cent of total lamb output, have been indirectly affected by British lambs displacing Irish produce in the French market, where 90 per cent of Irish lamb exports are destined. Lamb prices at Irish processing plants this week touched their lowest level in 13 years. According to Mr John Elmore, an IFA spokesman for Ireland's 52,000 sheep farmers, many sheep farmers are now facing bankruptcy. The IFA is calling for a temporary introduction of MCAs in the mushroom sector, while an editorial in the Irish Farmer's Journal has gone even further, saying: 'The Irish government (should) immediately seek full MCAs on all agricultural produce for non-ERM members. To have floating exchange rates and supposedly fixed agricultural prices is a nonsense. Any further talk of abolishing MCAs from January is not on.'</p>

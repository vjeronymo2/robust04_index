			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Property Plus: History at a premium - The costs of rebuilding - especially a period property - can far exceed those of simple purchase HOUSES ARE cheap today. Many can be bought for very much less than they would cost to build. Large, period properties are especially good value. Most people consider Britain's heritage of fine houses to be irreplaceable works of art - so valuable that owners have to gamble on when insurance premiums are due each year. In extreme cases, such as the magnificent Herstmonceux castle in East Sussex, the cost of re-building would be 10 times the selling price, and that leaves aside the value of the priceless gardens and parkland. The dilemma facing owners of period homes was highlighted in the recent catastrophic fire at Windsor castle. Often premiums are too high for houses to be covered for a total loss. English Heritage and agencies responsible for royal palaces and other national monuments, such as the Tower of London, simply cannot afford to insure them at all. Money is spent instead on prevention and early-warning systems. Surprisingly, while claims blaze even higher, only 61.7 per cent of Britain's 22m homes are insured against fire. There are signs of improvement but, even so, claims leapt by more than 7 per cent last year to Pounds 249m. Even some builders of new homes, desperate to maintain cash flow, are offering houses for less than they cost to build. Historically, this situation is a catalyst to a price explosion, but uncertainty over employment continues to apply the brake. Building costs vary from region to region and according to house type, causing a wide difference in premiums. But the British Insurance Association publishes an annual summary of building costs so, unless you live in a mansion, do-it-yourself valuation is relatively simple. Rebuilding costs bear no relation to market value although, fortunately, total losses are rare. On an average home, the guide price per square foot varies from as little as Pounds 41 to more than Pounds 70. To replace a beautiful Georgian mansion, however, could cost closer to Pounds 500 a sq ft. To estimate your own rebuilding costs, simply work out the floor area, using external measurements, and multiply by the number of floors. To complete the equation, multiply the total area by the rebuilding cost for your area and house type. Thus, a a moderate detached house of 2,000 sq ft in the home counties would cost 2,000 x Pounds 46 to rebuild - or Pounds 92,000. So, what price a Gertrude Jekyll garden or Capability Brown parkland? 'The garden comes virtually free if you take into account the value of the bricks and mortar,' says Colin Mackenzie, of Hamptons. He was referring specifically to Barton St Mary in East Grinstead, Sussex, built in 1906 and having 20 acres that are little changed from the myopic Miss Jekyll's original design. The price guide is Pounds 1m. Mackenzie says: 'To rebuild the house would cost Pounds 2m or more, and that excludes the incalculable value of the gardens.' Heveningham Hall in Suffolk, featured on these pages a few months ago, is still on the market. The price of Pounds 4.5m is trifling compared with the Pounds 16m that Savills and Knight Frank &amp; Rutley estimate it would cost to re-build. Again, the grounds - in this case, 469 acres sculpted by Capability Brown - count for nought. High above Bath is Widcombe manor, an exquisite Grade I Georgian house sitting in seven acres of terraced gardens thought to be the work of Harold Veto. Offers above Pounds 1.25m are sought by Savills with Knight Frank &amp; Rutley. Savills' man in Bath, Charlie Barkshire, says local building costs for a standard house are around Pounds 60 a sq ft; but a house of the complexity of Widcombe manor would cost at least Pounds 280 a sq ft to replace. One of the most remarkable building works in progress this year is Bliss mill, a huge Victorian tweed mill built in 1872. It might pass for a Georgian-style mansion but for the dome and 165 ft tower that soars above the finials and balustrades. Agent John D. Wood reckons that to build it today would cost at least Pounds 15m. The building dominates the rolling Oxfordshire countryside and is close to Chipping Norton (Chipping being a corruption of the Saxon word 'cheapening,' meaning market), the gateway to the Cotswolds. Work on converting the mill and its outhouses to flats was started by an American a few years ago and swallowed up more than Pounds 5m, much of that due to the high standards set, but the company went into receivership. Enter Andrew Davis, a flamboyant 27-year-old whose company, Widworthy Estates, has now completed a number of successful developments. 'It was a very sad state of affairs,' Davis says. 'The previous owner had lavished love and money on the old place but we were able to buy it for below Pounds 2m. 'We have spent another Pounds 3m finishing the 35 flats, providing a wonderful sports complex and converting the outhouses into cottages and covered car parks. The buyers will get quality that is far and away beyond what we could have built for the money had the previous owner not been so ambitious.' Prices of the flats and the delightful, bright cottages range between Pounds 125,000 and Pounds 245,000; annual service charges, which cover maintaining the indoor pool, tennis court and other facilities, will average about Pounds 1,750. In Regent's Park, London, the third of an eventual six remarkable villas designed by the champion of classicism, Quinlan Terry, is now ready for a house-warming party. The Gothick Villa, as its final 'k' indicates, is not architecturally pure; rather, a marriage of classic and Gothic style reminiscent of Palladio's Villa Saraceno in Venice. It is an extravagant place, with ogee arches, pinnacles, Corinthian capitals, vaulting, and just about every other trick in the architect's repertoire. But, as a home, it works much better than the first two, the rooms encircling the grand entrance hall and staircase being of better proportions. Savills, with Lassmans, has set a guide price of Pounds 6.75m. Now, the crunch question. If you buy the Gothick Villa, for how much should it be insured? Strawberry Gothic, as it has been described, does not come cheap - at least Pounds 300 a sq ft. Erring on the side of caution, you should reckon on closer to Pounds 500 so, with nearly 8,000 squ ft to protect, the premiums should cover re-building costs of at least Pounds 4m.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC;  </P> <P> MCINNES ENJOYS A RARE CAREER AS VIOLA SOLOIST;  </P> <P> THE VIOLIST, WHO HAS RETURNED TO USC, HIS ALMA MATER, SAYS TEACHING IS HIS  GREATEST JOY. HE PERFORMS TONIGHT IN COSTA MESA.  </P> <P> The viola plays an important role in an orchestra or string quartet as the  middle voice between the violin and cello. But it's usefulness as a solo  instrument is less frequent.  </P> <P> That violist Donald McInnes has built a long and distinguished career as a  soloist is a remarkable and rare feat. Today, he enjoys the reputation as one  of America's top viola soloists.  </P> <P> "I originally thought that I'd be happy finding a teaching position at a small  but good school where I could give a couple of concerts a year," McInnes, 51,  admitted in an interview from his comfortable home in Alhambra. "As it turned  out, I still teach, but my career as a soloist surpassed anything I could ever  anticipate."  </P> <P> Tonight at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, he performs the Bartok  Viola Concerto with the Pacific Symphony under the baton of Carl St. Clair.  Also on the recently revised program is the Overture to Rossini's "La gazza  ladra," excerpts from Bernstein's "Arias and Barcarolles" and Tchaikovsky's  Symphony No. 5.  </P> <P> McInnes feels a certain closeness with the Bartok Concerto because it was  commissioned by his teacher, William Primrose.  </P> <P> Memories of another teacher, Stefan Krayk, also continue to influence him.  </P> <P> "It was from Krayk that I acquired my basic musical tastes," he claimed. "There  are realms of what a performer knows is acceptable to the listener, and if you  go beyond that, it becomes distasteful."  </P> <P> In 1966 McInnes graduated from USC, not realizing that he would become one of  the most active viola soloists in the world. He vividly remembers the first  time his career appeared to be growing in a direction he didn't realize was  possible.  </P> <P> "The first event that really changed my career was when I was invited by Rudolf  Serkin to participate in the Marlboro Festival in 1970-71," he said. "The  second was also in 1971 when I was awarded the Ford Foundation Grant."  </P> <P> Of the $10,000 stipend McInnes received, half was supposed to go to a composer  of McInnes' choice as a commission to write a new piece for viola. The composer  McInnes chose was William Schuman, and his Viola Concerto on English Rounds  went on to become a mainstay of viola repertory.  </P> <P> "I thought long and hard about what composer I should choose," he remembered.  "I came up with Schuman because he passed three criteria: I wanted a composer I  liked, one who needed the work and one whose name would help my career as  well."  </P> <P> After the Schuman Concerto was recorded with Leonard Bernstein, McInnes' career  took off. But after being in demand all over the world and touring extensively,  he realized that teaching gives him the most joy.  </P> <P> "I enjoy academia and working with bright kids because you learn from them and  are constantly challenged by them," he said. "It makes you really rethink your  own art."  </P> <P> After teaching at the University of Seattle and the University of Michigan, he  returned in 1985 to his alma mater, USC, where he still teaches.  </P> <P> "In the original USC string department, there was Jasha Heifetz for violin,  Gregor Piatagorsky for cello and Primrose on viola," he said. "We have  graduates active in orchestras all over the world."  </P> <P> But burn-out may be taking its toll with McInnes. He admits that his busy days  touring the world were fun, but now he wants to relax and spend more time with  his students.  </P> <P> "I love to be at home," he admitted. "I have enjoyed touring and performing  throughout my life, but now I'd like to spend some more time relaxing and  teaching."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Violist Donald McInnes joins conductor Carl St. Clair and the Pacific Symphony  in music of Bartok, Bernstein, Rossini and Tchaikovsky at 8 p.m. at the Orange  County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa.

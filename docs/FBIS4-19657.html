			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva is returning to Lisbon.  In a few hours he will leave Hong Kong ending his visit to the  Far East. He is pleased and said that this visit, involving  business worth millions [of contos], was positive for Portugal  and China. Marina Pimentel reports:    [Pimentel] Business deals worth over 100 billion escudos  were  signed with China or are close to being finalized. The figure  was confirmed by the prime minister today.    [Begin Cavaco recording] Tens of millions, tens of millions  contos [1,000 escudos]. If we add the contracts already signed  to those contracts which could be signed as a result of  declarations of intent, we will go over 100 million contos. [end  recording]    [Pimentel] Cavaco said this figure surpassed all his  expectations. He was speaking at a news conference in Hong  Kong, convened mainly for the media of the territory, which like  Macao is going through a transition period to Chinese  administration. Cavaco was questioned mostly about the  different stances between Portugal and Great Britain in their  relations with China. Unlike the situation in Macao, the Hong  Kong transition process is experiencing some tension -- mainly  due to the hard stance which the current governor has taken  regarding guarantees of democracy in the territory after 1997.  Cavaco did not tire of repeating that Portugal is not  experiencing similar problems, because things were sorted out in  the Joint Declaration that Lisbon and Beijing signed in 1987.    Cavaco also reiterated what he has been saying throughout  his  visit: He does not like to discuss human rights in public, but  that does not mean he did not discuss them with the Chinese  authorities.</p>

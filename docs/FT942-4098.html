			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Homo stingius on the town: Central bankers are at the peak of their power. But can they stay there This has been a banner week for anthropologists. They have been able to observe a singular concentration and migration of one of mankind's more influential subspecies: the central bank governor. The Bank of England's 300th birthday celebrations brought a record 110 serving governors to London for a gala concert on Wednesday and a special symposium on central banking the following day. This weekend, the extended posse of central bankers (the Bank is open to suggestions for a more appropriate collective noun) moves to Basle for Monday's annual meeting of the Bank for International Settlements in Basle. If the spotlight is on top central bankers, it is for a good reason. These guardians of the world's monetary and financial systems have more influence than for a generation. This new-found clout will not be immediately apparent this weekend. The Basle gathering, one of the great annual events of the central banking world, has echoes of a calmer, bygone age. For once, serious work is put to one side. Bank governors and their officials, often with spouses in attendance, glide bonhomously from lunch to cocktails to dinner, perhaps exchanging the odd word on the need for fiscal austerity and financial prudence. Many will find that their biggest problem is coping with the compulsory second helpings so liberally served in the ho-tels clustered around Basle's main railway station. On show will be the old clubby, male- dominated world of central banking. Only Austria, Finland and Poland have women central bank governors. The guardians of the world's monetary and financial systems are a quietly spoken, sober-suited bunch, aged mainly between between 50 and 70. They are gossipy among themselves but cultivate a (frequently false) aura of discretion towards outsiders. Contrary to appearances, central bank governors come from varied professional backgrounds. Until 1990, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, was a senior Bonn government official who in his youth had aspired to be a priest. Mr Wim Duisenberg, head of the Netherlands national bank, is a former socialist finance minister. Mr Donald Brash, the innovative head of the New Zealand central bank, was once managing director of the New Zealand Kiwifruit Authority. Others, notably Mr Eddie George of the Bank of England and Mr Yashusi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, have been central bankers all their working lives. They head institutions with very different customs and histories. But once in harness, they seem to become remarkably like-minded people who are often more in tune with each other than the politicians and officials of their national treasuries. Top central bankers work together closely, meeting every month in Basle. They are in frequent telephone contact. The 'phone lines between the leading central banks were humming furiously in February when the bloodbath on the world bond markets seemed at one moment to threaten the world financial system. Although unelected and often paid more than politicians, these many men and few women are currently going from strength to strength. Their prestige is unscathed by the existence of 35m unemployed in the industrialised world. The British government, when faced with the problem of restoring credibility to economic policy after sterling's unceremonious exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, found the answer in greater openness, and giving greater responsibility for monetary policy to the Bank of England. Italy, at the height of its political crisis, turned to Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the Italian central bank governor, to be prime minister. The increasing complexity of financial markets, characterised by a huge increase in cross-border capital flows and the increased use of arcane financial instruments, has put a premium on central bankers' expertise. The acceptance of the idea that inflation is bad for economic growth and prosperity and that central banks are primarily responsible for combating it has helped turn central bank governors into public figures. Mr Tietmeyer spends much of his life lecturing his countrymen and financial markets on the Bundesbank's determination to control inflation. Britain's Mr George has been far more visible than his predecessor, following the government's decision to involve the Bank more in monetary policy. The independent Bundesbank's success in combating inflation has prompted other countries as far afield as New Zealand, Chile, Mexico and France to give their central banks more independence. Demands for independence or greater autonomy for other central banks, including the Bank of England, have grown. But, with the possible exception of the Bundesbank, more autonomy will invariably mean greater accountability. Today's central bankers must increasingly come to terms with a world in which they can no longer operate out of the public eye. Mr George, while welcoming the recent decision to publish the minutes of his monthly meetings with the chancellor after about six weeks, observed that his new position was 'not particularly comfortable'. He meant that, in future, people would be able to judge whether the Bank's advice to the government had been good or bad. He and his colleagues currently stand on the crest of a wave of approbation. But central bank governors are too realistic to believe this will always be the case. As their mystique is gradually stripped away, they will doubtless have to justify themselves and their actions far more in the face of growing critical scrutiny.</p>

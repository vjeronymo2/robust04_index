			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Goryachev, chief of the GosNII GA [State </F> Civil Aviation Scientific Research Institute] and doctor of  tchnical sciences, and I. Samoylov, chief of a division and  candidate of technical sciences: "What Kind of Aircraft Will We  Be Flying?"]    [Text] Civil aviation is going through difficult times in  Russia today. The principal indicator of this is the decline in  the volume of air service on domestic routes. However, according  to predictions by specialists, stabilization of the effective  demand for air transport should take place by the end of 1995,  after which it is expected to increase at the rate of about 6  percent annually. The 1992 level may be reached by the year  2000. With respect to the more distant future, the requirements  for air transport in 2010 may reach 200 to 230 billion  passenger-kilometers, that is, they will exceed the highest  level of 1990 (159 billion passenger-kilometers).    Naturally, the question arises whether it will be possible  to  meet the effective demand for air service with the fleet of  airplanes and helicopters that is available. Analysis shows that  roughly by the beginning of 1998, airlines will not be able to  cope with the transportation volume unless they undertake  substantial renovation of their fleet of aircraft.    However, this is not a simple process, as we know. It  requires sizable material outlays, which far from all air  carriers can afford. For this reason, one of the conditions for  survival of the sector in recent years has been solution of the  problem of maintenance on the airplanes and helicopters in  operation. The State Civil Aviation Scientific Research  Institute has conducted a great deal of work, as the result of  which the service life of Il-62M, Tu-154B, and Tu-134A airplanes  and Mi-2 and Mi-8 helicopters has been extended. Some 490  million rubles [R] were spent on this work, producing an  efficiency valued at R118 billion. If this work had not been  conducted, 11 percent fewer Il-62M, 7 percent fewer Tu-154B, and  42.5 percent fewer Tu-134A aircraft would have been operating on  air routes in 1994.    Nevertheless, the problem of replacing obsolete aircraft  with  new ones has not lost its urgency. Resolving it means  maintaining the competitiveness of domestic airlines not only in  the world air service market, but the domestic market as well.    What does our fleet of civil aircraft consist of today?  Roughly 1,650 mainline aircraft. At the same time, 80 percent of  mainline routes are being served by aircraft which are operating  beyond the limits of their initially assigned service life. By  1996 we will have to write off 12 to 15 percent of the mainline  aircraft, and by the year 2000, more than half of them. Some 20  percent of mainline flights are made in "modern" Il-86, Yak-42,  and Tu-154M aircraft which have been in operation for over 10  years and have become outdated.    Our fleet of aircraft includes several thousand airplanes  for  local air routes, the overwhelming majority of which are An-2's.  There are 2,100 helicopters, 97 percent of which are obsolete  Mi-8's and Mi-2's.    The serviceability of the aircraft is not up to standards.  For example, the degree of serviceability of the fleet of Il-86  aircraft is 56 percent, whereas the norm is 66 percent. The  annual flying time of one mainline aiurcraft is no more than an  average of 2,000 hours. The best of the aircraft on local  routes--the L-410 and An-28--are actually idle because they lack  spare parts.    So in this state of affairs, the answer to the question of  whether or not we need to update our domestic fleet of aircraft  is unequivocal. And the renovation has already begun. We can  even name a speific date--14 July 1993, when the Il-96-300 made  its first scheduled flight. But the renovation process was begun  roughly 5 years late...    The principal types of airplanes and helicopters which  should  replace the obsolete aircraft have been more or less determined.  They include the long-range mainline aircraft--the Il-96-300 and  its modifications, the Tu-204-300D, and in the more distant  future, the Il-96-200 and the Tu-304; the medium-range mainline  aircraft--the Tu-204 and its modifications and the An-218; and  the short-range mainline aircraft--the Tu-334-100, Il-114M, and  Yak-242. In the cargo aircraft class, they include new  modifications of the Il-76, the An-70T or Tu-330, the  5-metric-ton MiG-110 or the Tu-130, and cargo versions of the  Il-96, Tu-204, and Il-114.    In the near future, the Il-114 and its modifications, the  An-38, or the Be-32 will be available for local air routes.  Later on a new type of aircraft may make its appearance--a  regional 40- to 50-seat aircraft with a turbojet engine which  will take its place between the much slower Il-114 and the much  more spacious Tu-334 on routes of up to 2,500 kilometers with  relatively low passenger flows. We are linking development of  the helicopter fleet with the appearance of helicopters such as  the Mi-38, Mi-34VAZ, Mi-26K, Mi-54, and Ka-62.    The objective requirements to update Russian airlines' fleet  of aircraft as a whole are so great that it is hard to say which  classes of new airplanes and helicopters may turn out to be  unnecessary and may not find their place in this market. At  present, there are design proposals for dozens of new aircraft  for business flights, general aviation, and various classes of  load-carrying capacity.    But this is a potential market. The real market is  determined  not so much by an objective requirement as by actual effective  demand. In order to characterize this market, we will cite  several figures. In 1993 the various airlines and enterprises in  Russia purchased 182 new aircraft: 71 airplanes and 111  helicopters for a total of more than R250 billion. State  investments account for a little more than 10 percent of this  sum, and the funds of enterprises and local financing sources  account for the remainder. Some 60 percent of all airplanes and  helicopters, including 12 Tu-154M aircraft, were acquired by  nonstate enterprises for operation, leasing, and resale.    At the same time, many state airlines do not have enough  money to obtain their own aircraft after repair. At the end of  1993, 50 airplanes and 80 helicopters were in repair plants.  They had been repaired, but were not redeemed: the airlines owe  a total of R12 billion to the repair plants.    The appearance this year of aircraft manufactured in the  West, the Boeing 737 in particular, is a very important factor.  It attests to the beginning of a fundamentally new stage in th  development of Russian civil aviation--real competition between  domestic and foreign aircraft in the domestic market. And this  ought to be viewed very seriously.    The point is that the prices of aircraft being turned out by  Russian plants are already close to those being asked for  Western aircraft which have been in use. For example, in June  1993, the price of a Tu-154M was about R3 billion. Today it is  over R6 billion. At the same time, according to the Western  press, more than eight or 10 DC-9 aircraft of various  modifications which were formerly in use were offered for sale  or lease in July and August 1993 from 750,000 U.S. dollars  (DC-98-10-20)[sic; presumably figure should be "9," not "98"] to  $6.2 million (DC-9-50), that is, an average of $2 million to $3  million. At that time, when the average monthly lease was about  1 percent of the price of the aircraft, airlines would have paid  $20,000 to $30,000 per month for a lease. Raising this by a  factor of 1.5 to take into account the expenses for spare parts,  inasmuch as the aircraft are not new, we obtain $30,000 to  $45,000 per month. With the existing rates for passenger and  cargo services, operation of these aircraft with a profitability  level of up to 30 percent is entirely realistic. And their  advantages in fuel efficiency (25 grams per passenger-kilometer,  compared with 30 grams per passenger-kilometer for the most  economical domestic aircraft, the Tu-154M), reliability, the  opportunity to fly 6 to 10 hours per day, the organized system  of technical support, and so forth make these aircraft very  attractive for Russian airlines. Operation of the DC-9 aircraft  also opens the way for newer and more advanced aircraft of the  MD-91 (82-88) type, which are now being offered at $15 million  to $24 million.    The new nature of the aircraft market also determines the  new  emphasis on technical and economic requirements for Russian  aircraft and the relationships between buyers and sellers.    High fuel efficiency continues to be the principle  requirement for new aircraft at present, inasmuch as it makes it  possible to substantially reduce expenses for aviation fuel,  both in absolute and comparative measurement.    The next most important requirements are reliability and  safety, the service life, and the efficiency of ways and means  of monitoring the condition of the aircraft in operation,  inasmuch as this combination of characteristics determines the  ability to reach a high level in the turnover rate of financial  resources and in prevention of potential losses in aircraft  accidents and incidents.    Establishment of a system of after-sale support for an  airline by the manufacturing plant is an important condition;  this includes training of crews and technical personnel,  providing the necessary equipment for technical maintenance  bases, a steady supply of spare parts, and so forth. And a  requirement that is even more important is an acceptable price  and payment conditions.    All these requirements should be stipulated and coordinated  in the contract for delivery of an airplane or helicopter. The  contract should also provide for the economic responsibility of  the supplier to the buyer for any loss to the latter as the  result of failure to meet the requirements agreed upon, as well  as an efficient system of arbitration or legal solution to  conflicts.    The State Civil Aviation Scientific Research Institute  considers its duty to provide for maximum possible efficiency in  the process of updating the fleet of aircraft. To achieve this,  the plans for its work include comprehensive studies on the  certification of new airplanes and helicopters; the development  of updated national aviation regulations, combined with the  standards in effect in other countries; analysis of Russian  airlines' requirements for new aircraft; study of the domestic  market for the sale of aircraft manufacturers' output; and  determination of the most efficient use of funds being allocated  from the state budget to develop aviation equipment. In order to  determine precisely what the requirements are for aviation  equipment and the air carriers' requirement for one type of  aircraft or another, the institute distributes specially  developed questionnaires to aviation enterprises and airlines  each year. It is very unfortunate that certain managers in local  areas are in no hurry to respond.    Russian civil aviation is still a long way from a real  market. But we have already familiarized ourselves with certain  elements in a market economy and we realize: the market does not  forgive blunders, it must be studied, and we need to prepare for  it. So it turns out that the change in economic policy in the  sector has coincided with another period of no less importance  in its life: for replacing the obsolete equipment with new  equipment. But there will be no directives from "the mighty  person outside" today. By considering their own requirements and  material capabilities, the airlines themselves will determine  the types of aircraft, the number needed, and the conditions  under which they may be obtained. By making the right choice,  they not only strengthen their financial and economic activity,  but they will be able to more fully meet the public's  requirement for air service, and what is no less important, to  impove the quality of these flights. But a mistake can cost them  dearly. It is entirely possible that it may turn out to be their  last one. Such are the laws of the market.    COPYRIGHT: "Grazhdanskaya aviatsiya", 1994</p>

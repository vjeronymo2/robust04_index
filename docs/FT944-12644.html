			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Manager denies multiple share bid The contracts manager for City-based Gartmore Investment Management repeatedly breached signed declarations designed to prevent multiple applications in the power industry privatisation, a court was told yesterday. Mr Richard McGregor-Johnson, prosecuting, told Southwark Crown Court in London that Mr Stuart Fisher used the names of colleagues to obtain hundreds of shares he was not entitled to. He said that Mr Fisher's allegedly dishonest dealings involved the 1991 privatisations of the English and Scottish electricity generating companies. Mr McGregor-Johnson said: 'The prosecution say that this defendant was not content to apply only once for his own benefit, but dishonestly made multiple applications for shares in those two flotations.' The prosecution alleges that Mr Fisher knew he was breaking the law. Mr McGregor-Johnson said Mr Fisher, of Borough Green, Sevenoaks, Kent, had denied four counts of obtaining property by deception and three of attempting to obtain property by deception. He told the court that each charge represented applications for 300 shares made either in the names of people he worked with or knew. He said: 'The crown says the defendant persuaded them to allow him to use their names and put them forward for those applications on the basis that if he was successful, they would get a few beers or a curry as a reward but he would get any profits he made for the shares.' Mr McGregor-Johnson said that all the applications were supported by cheques drawn on Mr Fisher's account, although not all were successful. Mr Fisher sold the shares he obtained through his company's dealing department. The trial continues today.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWING INTO A NEW PART;  </P> <P> AGING: ACTOR JACK LEMMON IS HONORED FOR GOING BEYOND THE STEREOTYPES TO PORTRAY  AN ELDERLY MAN. HE SAYS THE ROLE TAUGHT HIM LESSONS ABOUT GROWING OLDER.  </P> <P> Jack Lemmon was overjoyed about becoming old before his time for a role. With  thinning, white hair, a shuffling walk, raspy voice and diminishing health, he  faced illness and death.  </P> <P> The 65-year-old veteran actor aged a couple of decades in a matter of hours for  his role in the 1989 film "Dad," playing Jake Tremont, an old man dealing with  the realities of the sometimes not-so-golden years.  </P> <P> Besides nods from film critics, the role has earned Lemmon the Rose Media  Achievement Award from the Reseda-based Jewish Homes for the Aging, a nonprofit  organization that cares for elderly Jews in the Los Angeles area on two  campuses in the San Fernando Valley. (The award is named for Rose Solomon,  actress Marlee Matlin's late grandmother, who was a resident of one of the  Jewish Homes for the Aging.)  </P> <P> Lemmon will receive the award at a dinner-dance Tuesday at the Four Seasons and  as the ceremony neared, he reflected on growing older and what he learned about  aging from the role.  </P> <P> While "Dad" wasn't a glamorous role it was what Lemmon calls a "rich" one. He  credits the film's makeup artists for giving him the physical characteristics  of an balding, wrinkled, liver-spotted man. But the rest was up to Lemmon.  </P> <P> "I think there's a trap in playing an older person, that you just say, 'Oh,  I'll play old,' " he says while sitting in his office across from the William  Morris Agency. "You don't play old. Old is a state of being. In many ways he  was very young. The biggest problem I had was in movement. I have a lot of  nervous energy, and I'm using my hands and my face when I don't know it. So I  tried to put him in a straitjacket in a way and confine his movements, and also  make him slow.  </P> <P> "There is no stereotype of an old person. I wish I had one -- it makes it  easier. You can tell the way someone walks that they're old, but there's a  hundred different ways old people can walk. When I was a kid starting out in  New York and the subways were only a nickel, you'd get in them and ride for  hours to kill time. I remember studying old people then. One thing I noticed  that really struck me was the eyes, and whether or not they were dead. You can  tell very often if someone has lost the capacity for excitement, caring,  whatever. They're existing."  </P> <P> The makeup, he adds, "did help enormously. My voice started to change; it got  lower, a little huskier, thinner. And when I had the makeup on, nobody knew who  I was. They couldn't believe it was me. . . . And people would treat me with  deference. There would be less of a tendency for people to slap me on the back  and say, 'How are you, you old son-of-a-gun?' They would be a little gentler.  Even guys on the crew, who saw me practically only in makeup, would set out  chairs for me. That had never happened before."  </P> <P> Lemmon's portrayal of Jake Tremont was accurate enough for Sheldon Blumenthal,  CEO of Jewish Homes for the Aging, and his staff, to choose Lemmon for the  media award.  </P> <P> "I thought the film was absolutely incredible," says Blumenthal. "My first  reaction was that I felt like I was at work. I saw it once, then again with my  staff, and had we talked about it, about what we learned from the movie, how  could we use this to react with the spouses and children of our residents. It  was a very real portrayal of the problems a family has with an aging parent."  </P> <P> He cites Lemmon's role as one that "didn't make old people good or bad; it just  made them real."  </P> <P> "Jack touched a nerve in people, and it was just amazing to see the hook he put  into the audiences," says Gary David Goldberg, "Dad" director and screenwriter.  "We tried desperately to stay away from (the stereotype of an older person). We  wanted to show the other side. . . . More and more people are facing this kind  of situation in their own lives, and it was imperative that we treated this in  an important way. People would watch the film and say, 'That's my father,' or,  'That's my mother,' which was kind of the overwhelming reaction."  </P> <P> While Lemmon plays the waiting game, hoping another good role will come his  way, he takes theedge off by golfing, traveling and spending time with his  family. Still, he has no plans to officially retire and seems to find it hard  to sit still in his overstuffed chair.  </P> <P> His father, a baker, took early retirement at 60.  </P> <P> "It was a very, very proud thing for him to do," says Lemmon, who obviously  still revered the father he lost to cancer many years ago. "The only thing is,  he went totally bananas. The poor man would be walking around Santa Monica,  going into shops and saying to the proprietor, 'Why is your window like this?  Do you think this is going to make people pay attention to your product? Look  what you've done. Where's your bread? How do I know how fresh it is?' He  must've done it 50 times while I was with him." Lemmon laughs at the memory.  "He did a lot of traveling, but he never should have retired."  </P> <P> Perhaps the son learned from the father. Lemmon doesn't deny it. "I think it  had an effect on me," he says.  </P> <P> "I might take it easy a little more," he says after thinking about it for a  minute. "There is the itchiness and the waiting, but it's nothing compared to  what it was like when I was younger. I went bananas. Now I can enjoy (the time)  more. And I realize there have to be the waits, otherwise you're just doing  something for the sake of working, and it's probably not going to be too good."  </P> <P> Besides dealing with his father's death, Lemmon and his wife Felicia gave  shelter over a decade ago to her mother, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease.  She spent a couple of years with them before she moved into her own apartment  with a full-time nurse before she died.  </P> <P> Recalling that time brings back some painful memories for Lemmon, who lowers  his voice and stares off while he talks.  </P> <P> "She stayed with us, then we couldn't have her in the house because we couldn't  take care of her. We were trying to do it 24 hours a day and trying to sleep,  but it was impossible. It gets tough. It really gets tough."  </P> <P> It's brought him face-to-face with his own mortality, he admits, but adds  quickly, "Thank God I'm in good health. My heart seems very strong, but unless  something hits me suddenly, I think I can look forward to a pretty long life.  </P> <P> "The only thing that bothers me is that time goes by and I want to work and I  feel like I'm 40. Other than that, I think I'm very lucky. I think to be in  good physical shape and having the mental attitude that I have at this age, I'm  blessed. I have to realize that when I start getting edgy. Still a lot of me  feels like I did when I first came out here in my 20s and said, 'Where is the  next part? It's been a week! I'm wasting time.' I'll never get over that. I'll  always feel that, I'm sure."  </P> <P> Lemmon admits that roles and scripts like "Dad" aren't delivered on his  doorstep every day. At the age of 65, is he happy with the roles he is offered?  </P> <P> "Not totally. It's a dichotomy -- I don't know an actor who's had more terrific  parts than I've had," he says. "Whether I've played them well or not, that's  somebody's judgment. And as you get older, there are rich, wonderful parts," he  says. "But 'King Lear' -- and 'Dad' -- don't come down the street every day.  They are fewer. As a result, an awful lot of pretty damn good parts do not  attract me."  </P> <P> The veteran of such films as "Some Like It Hot," "The Apartment," "Days of Wine  and Roses," "Save the Tiger" and "Missing" has to fight chronic restlessness  and an overabundance of nervous energy while waiting for the right film. As a  result, in recent years he's started to develop his own scripts. And despite  the fact he remains a box-office draw, Lemmon is at the mercy of a medium that  prefers youthful, wrinkle-free actors in leading roles.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's a prejudice against older actors," says Lemmon. "But I  think the desirability is always going to be for younger leading men who are  going to have more of a box-office attraction."  </P> <P> Dealing with the elderly "is something (screenwriters) should bear in mind  that's going to become more and more important in the lives of people they are  trying to touch, because we are becoming more and more involved with our  parents," he says. "There are more of us who are living longer, and they're  going to have to face that problem.  </P> <P> "I don't think it should be overdone as an issue," he adds, "like we're sending  a message -- Hey, we have to take care of it. I think that in just doing it  honestly it will take care of itself, if the entire family is considered and  more thought given to the importance of older people in our lives now. Anything  that is less gratuitous and more honest is good -- that's all I know."  </P></p>

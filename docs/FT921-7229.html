			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Some risque reading for the risk-averse So the bulls were right. Falling inflation is indeed producing falling yields in the equity market, even if not by much, and not in the manner you may have been led to expect. And P/Es are going up, too. As long as the market continues to discount a recovery some day, falling earnings can do the job quite effectively. Making industry more efficient by means of putting relentless pressure on profits is a rather unusual approach from a Conservative government, but it is the policy we have, and it is working. But when I hear last year's squeeze on profits described as a nasty surprise, as I did from the top table at the Society of Investment Analysts' excellent dinner last week, I am reminded of Mr Denis Healey's complaint about 'the young men who write brokers' circulars'. Even the middle-aged analysts, with a few honourable exceptions, behave as if they were young - too young, that is, to remember anything but the most recent past. You have to go back more than 30 years, after all, to the previous time that anyone questioned the idea that equity investments would always pay best in the long run; faith in equities survives even now, even among the pessimists. The Norwich Union, for example, appears to share my belief that bonds are the logical holding in times like these. But it talks only of a narrowing of the yield gap - not of the reappearance of the traditional gap, in which equities yielded more than bonds because they were riskier. Yet logic suggests that this ought to be somewhere in the forecasters' sights, even if only as one end of a range of possibilities. Indeed, in one sense the traditional yield gap reappeared a decade ago, when indexed gilts first became available. To nobody's surprise, these bonds, offering a risk-free real return, have nearly always yielded less than equities, and may well put a floor under British equity yields. Any brief fall in yields below this benchmark has rightly been read as a sign of bull-market excess, and that was in an inflationary world. It is fashionable at the moment to play with the idea that the great post-war inflation is going away. Nobody seems to draw the obvious conclusion, which is that if this did happen, the other yield gap - that between indexed and conventional gilts - might become very narrow. Indeed, if prices started falling, as they have over quite long periods of economic history, the coventional bonds would outperform the indexed, let alone equities. Look at it another way. The cult of the equity was started by Mr George Ross-Goobey as director of the Imperial Tobacco pension fund in the 1950s. Inflation was low at that time, but real growth was about equal to inflation. As he argued to a rapidly growing audience of converts, that made equities the ideal backing for a final-salary scheme. Taking one year with another, equities were a holding in money national income, and salaries would have a pretty constant share in that income. That is still true, and it is hard to imagine a future in which equities would not be a core holding in any decently-managed fund. But not, surely, virtually the sole holding. The numbers that matter here are those indicating the relation between the risk premium the market demands - measured in Britain at the moment by the gap between equity and indexed yields - and the expected real growth rate. Since the gap is normally in the 1-1 1/2 per cent range, and real growth at that rate is still only a matter of hope for the future, the indexed enthusiasm of a Mr Roger Bootle of Greenwell Montagu (and a few sages) explains itself. This is the logical home for the risk-averse. Most fund managers, however, like to think that they have redder blood in their veins than that. Indeed, if indexation became really fashionable, many of them would be out of a job. But if you want to take risks, what would you rather back, in the next few years at least - real growth rising towards its old trend rates, or falling inflation? Or to put the question more precisely, would you back an average growth rate of more than 2 per cent, or a 2 per cent fall in trend inflation? And if you are hesitating even for a moment over that answer, why are you still up to 70 per cent in equities? The fact is that after the appalling experience of the 1970s, gilts are still seen as too risky for any respectable fund, and the equity market will still be supported for many years by funk money in search of an each-way bet. But even those who do not take the bold step of re-balancing their portfolios should at least try to loosen up their thinking. Otherwise they may find themselves in the same position as those who thought Mr Ross-Goobey was being a bit too fast for comfort. A bolder approach by fund managers would make the economy a good deal easier to manage, since governments which borrow at rates of interest higher than the likely growth of their revenues are mortgaging the future. They are likely to remember this, except in election years, so do not base your strategy on the hope of a fiscally-led recovery in times like these. A keener demand for bonds might drive down yields across the board, thus justifying the hopes of the forecasters after all. So you could even regard a serious re-examination of gilts as a patriotic duty . . . well, as being prudent, at any rate. Prudence of quite another kind, however, will in future be demanded of others in the City. If there is one lesson which comes out of the recent results of financial intermediaries of every kind, it is: stick to your last. Even if managers had resisted speculative fever and sheer growthmanship, they would have lost heavily by conduct which they saw as enterprising. Clearing banks which ventured overseas, or into estate agency; savings banks which tried merchant banking; US savings and loans which got into shopping development or mining; London discount houses which forgot that they are essentially a privatised dealing room for the Bank of England, and took position - all have lost their shirts. Does this sound like a plea for the old days, when equities yielded more than gilts, and houses knew their place? Why, so it does.</p>

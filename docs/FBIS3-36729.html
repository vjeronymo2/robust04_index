			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev is touring  Central Asian countries. He spent the whole day today in  Tashkent, where he held talks with the president of Uzbekistan.    [Correspondent Shakhnoza Ganiyeva] Andrey Kozyrev's working  visit to Uzbekistan today began with talks at the republican  Foreign Ministry. Subsequently he was received by Uzbekistan  President Islam Karimov in the second half of the day.    The most acute problems of economic, military, political,  and  humanitarian cooperation between Russia and Uzbekistan and also  aspects of Islam Karimov's official visit to Russia, due toward  the end of February, were discussed at the meeting.    [Begin Kozyrev recording] I think that we will arrive at a  correct solution, so that we can help people as much as possible  and irrespective of their nationality -- and this also includes  the Russian and Russophone population and also other citizens of  both republics, both states -- so that they can cross the border  with ease and exchange money and dispose of their property as  they see fit. These, in actual fact, are the issues people are  interested in. Also, so that we can, of course, remove whatever  tensions, as it were, that might arise in connection with the  language and so on.    These issues must be dealt with professionally,  dispassionately, without superfluous emotions, even though the  problems themselves are extraordinarily emotive. However, they  must be tackled in a level-headed manner.    I think that at any rate, we have made yet another step  toward ensuring that these issues are examined in a correct  manner and that they can be generally resolved when the two  presidents have their meeting.

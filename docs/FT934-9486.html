			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Viacom files fresh suit against bid battle rival THE FOCUS of the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount Communications shifted to legal ground yesterday as Viacom fired off a new anti-trust complaint against rival bidder QVC Network. QVC independently said a key challenge for it was winning a lawsuit against Viacom due to be heard next week. Viacom, which agreed to a friendly merger with Paramount in September, had already filed a suit seeking to halt QVC's hostile offer, on the grounds that it was part of a monopolistic conspiracy by Tele-Communications (TCI), the cable television group. Since Viacom filed that suit, TCI has announced a plan to acquire associated cable programme company, Liberty Media, and itself be acquired by Bell Atlantic, the telephone company. Liberty Media owns 22 per cent of QVC. Viacom yesterday amended its suit to include the Bell Atlantic-TCI-Liberty merger in its complaint, and said the TCI-Liberty-QVC bid for Paramount had caused it 'enormous damage'. It also named Comcast, a cable company which owns 22 per cent of QVC, as an additional defendant. Separately, the Federal Trade Commission, which examines anti-trust issues, is thought to be near a decision on what, if any, stake Liberty Media can have in QVC if the company wins its bid for Paramount.</p>

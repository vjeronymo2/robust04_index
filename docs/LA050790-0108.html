			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ELECTION REFORM PROTESTERS JEER ISRAELI LAWMAKERS  </P> <P> Thousands of Israelis demanding electoral reform demonstrated outside the  Parliament today as it opened its summer session by commemorating the 45th  anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat.  </P> <P> At the gates of the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, demonstrators booed and  whistled at members arriving for the special session.  </P> <P> "Everyone is disgusted with what's going on," said Roni Lottner, 24. "They  offer jobs. They offer bribes to try to form a government. The system is  distorted."  </P> <P> Nearly two months of intense political bargaining to form a government have  disillusioned many Israelis and fueled the reform movement. Because neither  Likud nor Labor have a majority in the Knesset, the small religious parties and  breakaway members of the two major parties hold the power to determine the  makeup of the next government.  </P> <P> More than 2,400 demonstrators calling for direct election of the prime minister  and Knesset members gathered in the Rose Garden to rally for electoral reform.  </P> <P> "We've just got to change the system so the majority rules," Akiva Ehrlich  said. "Today the system we have allows immorality and bribery."  </P> <P> Staying away from political declarations, acting Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir  reminded the opening session of the thousands of Jews who gave their lives to  create the state of Israel.  </P> <P> "Its independence did not come easily. It was the result of many years of  political struggle," he said. "It was born out of generations of work . . . and  it was achieved by the pure blood of thousands of youths who gave their lives."  </P> <P> Parliament Speaker Dov Shilanksy, who escaped the Holocaust, told the members  that it was their task to remember those who were killed by the Nazis.  </P></p>

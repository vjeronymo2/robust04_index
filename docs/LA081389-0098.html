			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A California man who had been working in Vietnam said he was briefly detained  in manacles and denied access to diplomats before being deported. Daniel  Robinson, 25, of San Rafael, a student at Princeton University, said he was in  Vietnam for the past 10 weeks to research a travel guidebook under a contract  with an Australian firm. He said the visit was authorized and assisted by Hanoi  and that he had a valid visa. But he said he was questioned three times over  three days, told he had to leave because he lacked necessary documentation and  put on a flight to Bangkok.  </P></p>

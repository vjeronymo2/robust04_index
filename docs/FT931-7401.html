			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar hit by poor indicators THE US DOLLAR lost around 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday after a fall in the latest US consumer confidence data raised fears that the scale of the US economic upturn could not be sustained, writes James Blitz. A widely followed measure of consumer confidence, issued by the Conferebnce Board, dropped to 68.5 in February from 76.7 in January, when the market had been expecting a reading in the high 70s. The dollar fell to a low of DM1.6110 on the news and later closed in London at DM1.6125 from a previous DM1.6285. Yesterday's data added to the growing feeling in currency markets that the dollar's recent rise to DM1.67 has petered out. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist of DKB International in London, said that yesterday's indicators underlined the recent gloom in another poll by the ABC/Money index, which showed consumer confidence remaining very subdued in the aftermath of Mr Bill Clinton's election as US President. 'The strength of the US recovery in the fourth quarter of last year may not be maintained,' he said. Analysts at Citibank were also cautious about whether the dollar could break higher against the D-Mark. 'Signs of a future moderation in activity would obviously raise pressure for another cut in official rates, especially given the budget deficit reduction,' the bank's currency strategists said in their latest report. The dollar's weakness against the D-Mark was a source of renewed tension inside the European exchange rate mechanism yesterday. The German currency's stronger performance against the peseta and krone forced the Spanish and Danish authorities to raise interest rates to preserve their currencies' strength. At the close of European trading, the peseta was a little stronger against the D-Mark at Pta72.58. But the krone fell as low as DKr3.8560 to the D-Mark, closer to its ERM floor of DKr3.9016. Mr Mark Austin, Treasury economist at Midland Global Markets in London, said that the recent weakness of the Spanish and Italian currencies was taking its toll on the French franc in the ERM. In his view, the fall in the value of the lira and peseta could exacerbate problems for French exporters. Any threat of Spain quitting the ERM could also undermine the franc. The French currency closed at FFr3.396 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.392. As ERM tensions grow, it may be that the strength of the D-Mark dominates this weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven's finance ministers rather than the strength of the yen. Yesterday, the Japanese currency hovered around its record-breaking postion against the dollar, closing at Y116.65 from a previous Y116.35.</p>

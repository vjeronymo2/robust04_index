This document will be submitted to international  organizations with a view to having ethnic differences respected  and defended, as this is the only way in which different  cultures can coexist in the present times.    Miguel Chase Sardi [anthropologist and former head of the  National Indian Affairs Institute] said "this is a note of  warning that was sounded precisely a few days prior to the  events that took place in Chiapas, during which local indigenous  communities were brutally repressed. Here we requested what we  have been requesting since 1970, namely that indigenous  communities be granted self- government and self-determination.  This will not entail the destruction of the state. Actually,  for a state to flourish it must necessarily be multiracial and  pluralist as far as culture and language are concerned. We are  very pleased to note that our Constitution fairly comes up to  that idea." Despite this Chase Sardi later said that it is to  be regretted that the law is known but is not observed.    The most salient points of the document signed by social  researchers, anthropologists, and intellectuals underscores that  the letter of intent was drafted because they are "witnesses in  each of our countries to reiterated violations of the right to  life, to dignity, and to the cultural and human environment in  their local manifestations."    This lengthy document further stresses that "in the same way  that each ethnic group was forced over centuries to integrate  and adhere to the unspecified advantages of an ill-defined  national life, the same mandatory proposal is at present made to  Latin American countries to join and integrate themselves into a  world order controlled by a multinational oligopoly."    They claim that democracy as a philosophy of a Western  social  system revolves around the individual, and excludes the  communities of indigenous peoples.    They call upon Latin American rulers to keep the promise  made  to indigenous peoples in the Guadalajara Declaration of 1971,  when they solemnly pledged to ensure their economic and social  welfare as well as respect their rights and cultural identities.    At present the spotlight of international criticism is  focused precisely on Mexico, where the treaty was signed,  because of the inhumane treatment of indigenous communities in  Chiapas. Concerning this Miguel Angel Fernandez, a writer,  wrote a letter which, if the necessary signatures are collected,  will be sent to Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,  petitioning him "to put an end to the military repression (and  in general all cultural, economic, political, or social  repression and oppression) in Chiapas, and to establish the  necessary basis for a fair and free coexistence among all ethnic  groups." The letter concludes by expressing solidarity with the  indigenous people of Chiapas.</p>

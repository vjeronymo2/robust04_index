			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC &amp; DANCE NEWS: THOMSON: REMEMBERING AN ORIGINAL  </P> <P> Sotheby's in New York City has announced the sale of items from the estate of  Virgil Thomson. When the late American composer and critic died at age 92 in  October of last year, he left his famous apartment at the Chelsea Hotel in  Manhattan filled with furniture, paintings and sculpture.  </P> <P> With the exception of several works by Florine Stettheimer, Marcel Duchamp and  Jean Arp (to be sold by the auction house at sales Wednesday and Nov. 14 and  29), most of the collection will be on sale at Sotheby's on Oct. 11. The  composer's manuscripts have been left to Yale University; a few published  scores -- by Thomson and others -- are among the items to be auctioned.  </P> <P> Among the 150 lots in the sale are drawings and books, and photographs by,  among others, Man Ray, Editta Sherman, Berenice Abbott, Maurice Grosser, Roddy  McDowall, Lee Miller and Betty Freeman.  </P> <P> And there is furniture, including the bed in which much of Thomson's music is  said to have been written; the dining table at which the composer entertained  Copland, Cage, Stravinsky and Duchamp, and the kidney-shaped pie-crust table  that Alice B. Toklas left Thomson in her will.  </P> <P> Among the miscellaneous items: a black silk brocade vest, made for and worn by  Gertrude Stein; 43 volumes of works by Stein, and Thomson's address book,  dating from the 1920s and '30s.  </P> <P> In the introduction to the catalogue, Thomson's friend, the poet and playwright  Jack Larson, describes the composer in old age:  </P> <P> "The older I saw him become, the more I saw him as the small boy he must have  been in Kansas City, Missouri -- smart and intuitive, attention-getting and  accomplished, spiritual but sensual, loving, generous yet sometimes selfish,  talkative but observant and looking exactly like Virgil had since he was a  baby."  </P> <P> Proceeds from the sale of property from the estate will benefit the Virgil  Thomson Foundation, Ltd. The property will be on exhibition at Sotheby's from  Saturday through Oct. 10. Information: (212) 606-7000.  </P> <P> AND COPLAND: The 90th birthday of Thomson's contemporary and friend, Aaron  Copland, will not go unnoticed hereabouts. The School of Music at USC will hold  a monthlong Copland celebration, incorporating six programs in nine  performances, Nov. 7-Dec. 9.  </P> <P> These programs will survey the composer's varied output. Copland's opera, "The  Tender Land," will be performed by USC Opera, Dec. 6-9, closing the  celebration. His Third Symphony will be given by the USC Symphony, Daniel Lewis  conducting, Nov. 16; chamber music and songs are featured in a Copland faculty  recital, Nov. 18; Michele Zukovsky, a principal of the L.A. Philharmonic, will  play the Clarinet Concerto with the USC Chamber Orchestra, Nov. 13, eve of the  composer's actual 90th birthday -- he was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Nov. 14,  1900.  </P> <P> Among the performers at these programs: Conductors Larry Rachleff, Daniel  Lewis, Donald Crockett and Douglas Lowry; violinist Eudice Shapiro, and soprano  Janice McVeigh.  </P> <P> Funding these programs is a $36,000 grant from the E. Nakamichi Foundation.  </P> <P> BRIEFLY: Western Opera Theater embarks today on the first leg of its 1990-91  national tour.

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Somalia operation is 'not workable' THE United Nations' operation in Somalia is a mess, with little hope of its efforts there ever bearing fruit, the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. 'It's a dead end and I am very pessimistic about Somalia. It's such a mess and there is no possibility of it working,' Mr Alain Destexhe, secretary-general of the charity, said. There had been no improvement in Somalia since the UN dropped its high-profile hunt for Somali warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed, Mr Destexhe said. The UN had confused its humanitarian and political roles in Somalia and other crisis areas such as former Yugoslavia. 'After two years, the track record in Bosnia and Somalia is negative on both a humanitarian and a political level.' Relieved and joyful relatives laughed and wept as the men, looking weak with filthy clothes and unkempt beards, were freed one by one after shaking hands with top local officials. A young woman called Fahmeeda said her brother had been trapped in the mosque after going there to worship on October 15, the night the army sealed off the compound.</p>

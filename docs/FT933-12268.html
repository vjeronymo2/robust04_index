			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Market progress slows, say agents - Cadogan's Place THE PROPERTY market's progress slowed in June, with net sales 5.8 per cent down compared with May, the Corporate Estate Agents Property Index reports. Contracts exchanged rose marginally, but are still down in comparison with March, which has been the peak month for business in 1993. Confidence in the government was stronger then than now. And even if the recovery is under way, the spectre of higher taxes in the Budget in the autumn is still a dampener. Estate agent John D. Wood reports that its February-April quarter was profitable but the previous six months had been the worst for more than 20 years. It had a pre-tax loss for the year until April 30 of Pounds 291,000, down from Pounds 497,000 on the previous year. Savills, however, has turned a Pounds 1.44m loss into a Pounds 2.86m profit, on the year to April 30, selling twice as many houses in London in the second half-year as it had the year before. THE ORANGERY, in Mamhead Park, seven miles from Exeter, is an octagonal pleasure-dome said to be by Robert Adam. Originally it was a temple or water house. In the last century it became a gardener's cottage, but now it is a most sophisticated rural delight with two bedrooms, in 46 acres with views over the Exe estuary. Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, in Exeter, (0392-433033) will sell it by informal tender on August 12. The guide price is Pounds 325,000. Also new on the market is a thatched cottage by John Nash, a picturesque change from his stucco cottages in Regent's Park in London. Home Farm at Burley on the Hill near Oakham in Rutland is on high ground and has five bedrooms, a walled garden and a thatched game larder, and the original plans are in the Leicestershire Records Office. Humphrey Repton commissioned this curio of architectural history as part of his work at the big house. Clegg Kennedy Drew in Stamford (0780-52788) offers it at Pounds 375,000. BUCKLAND HOUSE, near Faringdon, in Oxfordshire, is a Georgian villa built for the Throckmorton family by the famous Bath architects, John Wood father and son, on strict Palladian lines, with a central block linked by passages to octagons. One was the library and the other served as a Roman Catholic chapel. The house has fine plasterwork and chimney pieces, and a big white-tiled area below-stairs, but will be costly to repair. The purchaser might wish to restore its 18th century aspect by demolishing the parts added for a planned visit by Edward VII, which never took place. The price for two lots is Pounds 1m, from Cluttons (0865-793900). Next door is the Tudor Manor House turned into Strawberry Hill Gothic-style stables by the Throckmortons in the late 18th century. Cluttons hopes for Pounds 275,000 but, as with the big house, redoing it will be expensive. You can walk straight from the downstairs rooms into the loose boxes without going outside. IN BEVERLY HILLS, California, 822 North Roxbury Drive was the home of Marlene Dietrich. The solidly built Art Deco building was built in 1928 and influenced by styles from ancient Egypt (in the aftermath of finding king Tutankhamun's tomb). The director Joseph von Steinberg chose it for her in 1931, complete with a very large living room, a large kitchen, a large pool and a cellar that held 5000 bottles. Rita Hayworth lived there later. Sotheby's International Realty in New York (800-848-2541) and Stan Herman and Stephen Shapiro in Beverly Hills (310-274-9494) are agents. The price is Dollars 2.495m. (Pounds 1.66m).</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy Monthly retail sales figures often shed more light on weather patterns than consumer spending trends. The CSO's figures showing a marked improvement in retail sales in March may well have been blown around a bit. The numbers were certainly in marked contrast with the earlier CBI distributive trades survey, which suggested consumers were running scared of looming tax rises. Yet any number of shopkeepers - including Etam yesterday - will testify to the unpredictability of demand. The longer term trend in retail sales, though, is still strong. The CSO's annual value comparisons may be distorted by Easter being such a moveable feast. But the strong rise in the value of household goods sales over the past three months must be reflecting the pick up in housing transactions. The predicted rise in house prices may also tickle up consumer spending, especially in south east England. Tax rises will progressively squeeze spending over the coming months although that may be offset by a fall in the savings ratio. Yet, if base rates rise next year then savings ratios may follow, dampening consumer demand. That may not worry the government unduly. Consumers have done their bit. Other sectors of the economy must take up the running.</p>

Both delegations held talks,  stressing that there are sound bases for bilateral cooperation.  Berisha and Tudjman commented on today's attack against Serbian  planes. For more details, let us hear the report prepared on  this occasion:    [Koleci] At the invitation of President Berisha, Franjo  Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia, arrived in Tirana  today, heading a Croatian delegation. He is accompanied by  Croatian Economy Minister Nadan Vidosevic, Tourism Minister Niko  Bulic, and Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo Sanader.    Berisha considered the visit by the Croatian president to be  another possibility to contribute not only to bilateral  cooperation but to peace in the region as well. Meanwhile, the  Croatian president assessed the time of this visit as very  important for events in southeast Europe.    At Rinas airport the high-level Croatian personalities were  received by President Berisha, Malasi and Vukaj, People's  Assembly Presidency deputy chairmen, Deputy Prime Minister  Kopliku, Foreign Minister Serreqi, etc. President Tudjman also  shook hands with the diplomatic corps accredited in Tirana.    Berisha and Tudjman held a special 30-minute meeting at the  Presidency. Later they continued with talks between both  delegations. After the end of these talks, both presidents  spoke to correspondents:    [Begin Berisha recording] With President Tudjman, we  discussed the development of friendly relations between Albania  and Croatia to find a sound and all-round basis to develop these  relations, and I am convinced that the visit of President  Tudjman is a real contribution in this direction. The  cooperation between Albania and Croatia is at the same time a  contribution to regional cooperation. It assumes great values in  the future in the framework of a broad regional integration.  [end recording]    [Koleci] The visit of the Croatian delegation in Albania,  Mr. Tudjman declared, and the talks held with the Albanian  delegation will serve to promote bilateral ties and more  successful common efforts for a commitment by the international  community to intervene in our region. During the talks, we  found complete understanding.    Berisha and Tudjman commented on today's act by NATO -- the  downing of four Serbian planes which violated the UN flight  embargo on military planes in Bosnia.    [Begin Berisha recording] We consider the NATO response to  the Serbian aggressor in the (?bosom) of Bosnia to be legitimate  and very important. We think that the courage and bravery of  the U.S. pilots will accelerate peace and stability in the  region. [end recording]    [Koleci] Mr. Tudjman assessed this act as a sign and signal  that the international community will continue efforts to solve  the crisis in Bosnia and create conditions for peace in the  region.    Wishing for a more concrete pronouncement, I asked Mr.  Tudjman how he would assess today's act, and he said: It is an  act of determination of the superiority of the international  community and Europe to oppose the Serbian aggressor, but also  to put barriers on Russian intervention in the Balkans.    This afternoon the Croatian president and the delegation  accompanying him will meet Prime Minister Meksi and Parliament  Chairman Pjeter Arbnori.</p>

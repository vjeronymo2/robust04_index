			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Clyde Petrol back to black with Pounds 2.2m Clyde Petroleum, the UK exploration and production company, has celebrated a return to the black with its first dividend payment in three years. The independent oil group announced interim net profits of Pounds 2.2m, against losses of Pounds 16.2m, and a first half payout of 0.35p.

Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chairman, said the group had tried to pitch the dividend at a sustainable level. Clyde expects to pay a further 0.65p at the end of the year, for a 1p total. The company increased production by 46 per cent to 30,843 barrels of oil equivalent per day. About 80 per cent of Clyde's reserves are producing.

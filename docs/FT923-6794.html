			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / International Company News: Bankers stalk Efim as asset disposals loom - Haig Simonian explains the problems confronting the state group's break-up Merchant bankers are busily studying Efim, the Italian state holding company put into voluntary liquidation last month, to see what might be marketable. The prognosis for the complex group, with activities ranging from aerospace, defence equipment, railway rolling stock, glass and aluminium to health spas, is not encouraging. Yet the success of disposals could be crucial to relations between the treasury and Efim's angry foreign bank creditors, which have lent about L3,500bn (Dollars 3.15bn) of the group's L8,500bn total debt. The government plans to give creditors up to L4,000bn of five-year bonds to cover the gap between the value of their loans and what can be realised through sales. While the treasury has fallen out with foreign banks over the low coupons on the bonds, all agreed the negotiations would be influenced by how much can be raised. Even preliminary estimates are still lacking, pending a valuation of Efim commissioned by the government from Mediobanca and S G Warburg last month. However, foreign bankers accept that their talks with the treasury could become much easier once figures are available. Efim's most attractive operations are the SIV glass business, Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie on the railway side, and its Agusta helicopters division. Not all are profitable, and they share problems such as overmanning. However, bankers agree the three are the most immediately marketable parts of its portfolio. Agusta, which co-operates with Westland of the UK, received a welcome lift last month with a big Canadian order for its jointly produced EH101 helicopter. Bankers say the company has good products and technology, but suffers from debts of about L2,000bn, which, with overmanning and too many plants, mean it loses money heavily. Some think Agusta could be an ideal partner for a foreign aerospace group wanting to break into the Italian market. However, the helicopter business is in severe difficulties. Moreover, Agusta's famous name and 7,000 employees means its fate may be swayed by political rather than market factors. Using arguments of 'national interest', domestic political considerations may dictate Agusta's incorporation into Alenia, the quoted aerospace and electronics arm of Iri's Finmeccanica group. A similar fate probably awaits Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie (BCF), Efim's Tuscany-based railway equipment subsidiary. The group has been successful in winning US orders for its urban mass transit systems and makes rolling stock for the Channel tunnel. However, it is no stranger to uncertainty. It has been a key in the long-running tug-of-war within the public sector on rationalising Italy's railway equipment business, currently split between Efim and Finmeccanica's Ansaldo Trasporti subsidiary. A merger between the two has traditionally been blocked by political barriers, as the two companies are controlled by different parties. That impasse led BCF into talks with the Italian subsidiary of the multinational ABB group. However, negotiations broke down, and BCF returned to seeking closer links with Ansaldo even before Efim's collapse. Some bankers question whether a merger is the only solution. Fiat, which has substantial railway activities, is tipped as an interested party, as are industrial multinationals such as ABB and Siemens. However, the chances of a purchase by any of the three are slim. While bankers agree that a number of Italian private sector industrial companies will snap up some Efim assets, few expect any really large takeovers. Only parts of Efim's empire are attractive, while the liquidity problems of many private sector groups will make them reluctant to embark on large acquisitions. The position of the non-Italian concerns is less clear. However, most bankers stress that domestic rationalisation by transferring companies such as Agusta, BCF or even Efim's OTO Melara defence equipment business to other public sector companies should only be the precursor to wider joint ventures on a European basis. Foreign buyers are seen as the most obvious candidates for SIV, Efim's glass-making arm. SIV has a substantial share of the European market for the automotive sector, making it superficially an obvious sale candidate. But the company is losing money, leading to differing views among bankers on its marketability. 'Just compare it with Pilkington,' said one banker. 'Although highly respected, it still isn't doing particularly well. So what chance is there for SIV, which needs to be rationalised and whose biggest client, Fiat, is losing market share?' Dealing with Finanziaria Ernesto Breda, the quoted holding company which operates OTO Melara, Efim's missile and defence equipment arm, could also be tricky. Defence equipment groups around the world are in difficulty owing to government spending cuts and lower procurement needs. Incorporation within Finmeccanica's Alenia subsidiary may be inevitable for want of anything better. Meanwhile, closure could be the only option for Alumix, Efim's aluminium division. Bankers lament Italy's decision ever to create an aluminium industry, given its lack of raw materials and heavy energy dependence. However, the solution for Alumix, based largely in Sardinia, may have to be as politically influenced as its birth. Ministers will be wary of closing a big employer such as Alumix in view of the depressed Sardinian economy. The island has experienced many cases of spectacular, but misjudged, public sector investments having to fold. So although it lost L420bn last year - equivalent to about a third of sales - Alumix's inevitable liquidation may be spread over a number of years.</p>

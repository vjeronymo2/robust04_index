			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Deficit at Alitalia deepens to L214bn ALITALIA, Italy's state airline, which has some of its shares listed on the stock exchange, followed the trend in the European aviation industry with a L214bn (Dollars 135m) loss for the first six months of the year. The results put paid to hopes of breaking even in 1993 and reverse a trend of progressively lower losses in the past two years. In the first half of last year, the group lost L39bn. The airline blamed the recession, which had reduced demand and triggered pressure on ticket prices. To counter the downturn, it planned capacity cuts (especially on domestic routes), efficiency improvements and would compete 'aggressively' to counteract the effects of fare wars. Sales rose by 7.3 per cent to L2,735bn, while the number of passengers carried climbed by 2.9 per cent, in spite of a 9 per cent fall in domestic traffic. Load factors were 62.3 per cent for passenger traffic and 67.6 per cent for freight. Alitalia's loss, which some analysts expect to total about L300bn by the end of the year, came in spite of extraordinary earnings of L112bn from asset sales. The company raised L92bn from similar sales in the same period last year. The results were partly affected by Alitalia's ambitious investment programme, which included L104bn for last December's purchase of 30 per cent of Malev, the Hungarian state airline. Spending on new aircraft amounted to L439bn in the first half. Fincantieri, the Italian state-owned shipbuilding group, reversed a long-running string of losses to report a net L3.7bn profit for the first half. The company said it expected to stay in profit in the second half thanks to a strong order book, lower costs and improved productivity.</p>

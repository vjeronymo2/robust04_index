			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Assurance systems popular with small businesses QUALITY assurance systems are popular with small businesses and do meet their needs, according to a survey by Pera International, an industry research association. Ninety per cent of companies that took government advice on quality management systems employed fewer than 100 people and 30 per cent fewer than 10 people. Pera supervises the government's quality consultancy scheme and it says that 28 per cent of companies that took consultancy advice went on to acquire a certificate for BS 5750/ISO 9000, the most common UK and international quality assurance standards. Based on the present level of demand for quality advice, about 45,000 UK companies will be certified after a government-funded consultancy by mid 1995. Survey of quality consultancy scheme clients.

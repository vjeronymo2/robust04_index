			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unease over a privatised PO Sir, It is not ignorance or wilful misrepresentation ('Avoiding postal fudge', November 3) that motivates public unease about Post Office privatisation. Those who have seen their Crown office close, and the service disappear into the back of a newsagent's shop - as in my town - have good reason to wonder what other assets a private sector Post Office would liquidate for the sake of a share price. Victor Ripley, 6 Streetes Close, Godalming, Surrey GU7 1YY</p>

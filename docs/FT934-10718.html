			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Round-table talks on Ulster some way off THE BRITISH and Irish governments yesterday launched a fresh appeal to Northern Ireland's constitutional political parties to resume talks on the province's future, but made clear that round-table talks involving all the parties were still some way off. However, in a move that augured badly for the future pariticipation of the hardline Democratic Unionist party in talks, the Rev Ian Paisley, the party's leader, unexpectedly delivered a letter protesting against the holding of yesterday's Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference session in Belfast. It emerged earlier this week that the UK government was prepared to press ahead with the peace process even without DUP participation. Yesterday's conference followed on from the start of the new peace initiative of Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in Brussels last week. After the meeting Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, expressed optimism that the two governments would press ahead quickly towards a new constitutional settlement. They made clear that dialogue would initially take the form of bilateral discussions with British ministers. Sir Patrick warned that an immediate push for resumption of round-table discussions with all parties could be counter-productive. 'The only point in getting around the table is when there is an agreement achievable,' he said. One possible target would be to have an agreement in place before Mr Major and Mr Reynolds meet at the UK-Ireland summit in Dublin within six weeks. Sir Patrick said the six-point plan put forward by Mr Spring last week would be 'central to the ideas that the two governments must bring to a conclusion between themselves'. The plan showed 'very encouraging evidence of the thinking of the Irish government'. Sir Patrick also spoke of the 'unbreakable meshing' between the UK-Irish talks and what the province's political parties were 'prepared to compromise over' regarding the internal government of Northern Ireland. Sir Patrick said there was 'no question at the moment' of having reached the stage where Ireland's constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland would be replaced or where the Anglo-Irish agreement was 'going to be repealed'.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Bank's role examined A CROSS-PARTY group of MPs is to look again at whether the Bank of England should be independent, as part of an extensive inquiry into the Bank's role. The Treasury select committee's investigation will cover the Bank's relationship with the government and with parliament - both in its own right and in the light of the Maastricht treaty - and also its supervisory activity. Ministers have repeatedly made it clear that they do not support the idea of giving the Bank independence, and the report could provoke a sharp clash between the government and the Tory-dominated committee. The committee is due to start hearing evidence in about mid-May and the inquiry is expected to last through until the summer recess, probably at the end of July.</p>

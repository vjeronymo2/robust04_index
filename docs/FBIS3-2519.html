"It is an appropriate speed after the country's GDP has  increased by 13 per cent for two consecutive years," he said.  "It would be an outstanding achievement if we can keep the GDP  growing at eight or nine per cent for a few more years."    Delivering a government work report at the National People's  Congress today, Premier Li stressed China will make its best to  maintain a vigorous and steady growth rate. Local authorities  should set reasonable growth rates for their respective  economies in accordance with their own conditions and not vie  with each other or concentrate exclusively on raising output  value.    On principles for economic work this year, Li Peng said,  China will carry out reform in depth.</p>

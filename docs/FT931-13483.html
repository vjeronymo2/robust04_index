			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / EC eager to resume Gatt talks with US THE NEW US administration may be willing to match the momentum in the European Community aimed at completing the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade reforms, it emerged yesterday. Even as Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US trade representative, was being sworn in, plans were being made for an early resumption of US-EC talks. Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's trade commissioner, said yesterday in an interview at the Financial Times that 'momentum had been jacked up'. It was now at a point where 'if the Clinton administration picks up the ball and runs with it' an agreement was possible before presidential power to press a Uruguay Round deal quickly through Congress expires early in March. He said he was ready to meet Mr Kantor at a moment's notice. He claimed a deal had come tantalisingly close in Geneva last week following significant headway on proposed tariff cuts in sensitive sectors such as textiles and electronics. They stopped short because of US pressure to rewrite other parts of the draft Uruguay round agreement. 'I don't believe that substantial changes are possible without Pandora's box being opened,' Sir Leon said. 'Everything depends on the attitude of the US administration.' Sir Leon saw his first priority as being to impress on them 'the urgency and desirability of reaching an early agreement. There is no single step which will have a more beneficial effect on the world economy than an agreement.' He conceded that tangible trade gains would take time to emerge, but an important boost could come from the 'announcement effect' of a breakthrough. 'If there is some degree of common perception not of the deal, but of the necessity for a deal and the approach towards a deal, we can give instructions to negotiators to go back to Geneva and get on with it.' Deadlines have constantly been broken for completion of the Uruguay round talks. , which are now in their seventh year. A breakthrough in November in a year-long US-EC dispute on reform of farm trade came too late to make a deal possible before US presidential elections.</p>

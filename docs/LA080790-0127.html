			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: ELECTRONIC CLEARING PLANS TO SELL MORE STOCK  </P> <P> Electronic Clearing House Inc., an Agoura Hills provider of electronic credit  card and check-clearing services, plans to sell an additional 3.6 million  common shares through the securities firm J.W. Gant &amp; Associates.  </P> <P> In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it  plans to use the sale's proceeds to repay debt, purchase equipment and develop  software.  </P> <P> It also warned that the stock would be an extremely speculative investment  because of Electronic Clearing's financial problems.  </P> <P> The company lost $171,000 on revenue of $6.34 million in the nine months that  ended June 30, after losing $722,000 in its fiscal year that ended Sept. 30,  1989. The company has had no earnings from operations since fiscal 1985, and  its existing stock trades for about 87 cents a share in over-the-counter  trading.  </P> <P> In April, the SEC charged the company with late filing of several financial  reports, and Electronic Clearing agreed to a consent judgment barring it from  further violations of federal securities regulations. The company said it  planned to file all future financial reports on time.  </P></p>

			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Discovery brings thrombosis hope Scientists have taken an important step towards finding a drug to control blood clotting, which causes heart attacks, strokes and other fatal and disabling diseases. The team - from Oxford and Edinburgh universities, and the Medical Research Council clinical centre at Harrow, north London - has identified the structure of a protein called tissue factor, which triggers blood clotting, or thrombosis. Their findings are published today in Nature, the science journal. Professor Edward Tuddenham, of the Harrow centre, said: 'More than half the premature deaths in the western world are thrombosis-related.' Thrombosis is triggered when tissue factor combines with Factor VII, another protein in the blood. This starts a biochemical chain reaction that ends in the formation of a solid clot that may block a blood vessel and cause damage. Dr Hamish Humphray, a scientist at Glaxo pharmaceuticals, said: 'Solving the structure of tissue factor represents a very important step towards the discovery of new drugs.' It will allow the development of potential drugs that will block thrombosis by inhibiting the interaction of Factor VII and tissue factor. Some compounds are already being tested by drug companies. The details of the structure of tissue factor will make it much easier to find the most effective potential drug. Once a potential drug has been identified, animal trials will be used to check its effectiveness and test toxicity. Clinical testing could start a year later. It might, however, be at least 10 years before a drug is marketed. A number of drugs that inhibit blood clotting are already used in heart disease. New drugs in the field include Ciba's Hirudin, which is derived from leech anticoagulant, and Biogen's Hirulog. They all act by blocking the later stages of the clotting chain reaction. A drug that acted on tissue factor could be more effective because it could start working earlier in the clotting process. At each step in the process, the number of molecules involved increases a millionfold. Drug companies are already screening compounds that inhibit tissue factor, but knowledge of the structure should make the screening process much faster. A hidden killer, Page 10</p>

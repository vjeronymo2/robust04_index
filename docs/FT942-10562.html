			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Kemper Kemper's decision to open its books to bidders looks wholly pragmatic. Management must have reasoned that it would be better to bow out gracefully than run the risk of being evicted by supporters of GE Capital's bid at the shareholders meeting originally scheduled for tomorrow. Yet it is difficult to see where a white knight will come from. Mr Sanford Weill's Travelers would have been an obvious suitor. But its recent acquisition in insurance and sagging share price must have dulled its appetite for big deals. Kemper's business mix complicates matters. Any US bank interested in mutual funds would have to divest the life insurance operation for regulatory reasons. Neither is there a long list of potential European bidders. Banco Santander, which already has a small stake in Kemper, has its hands full with the rescue of Banesto. Most European insurers with ambitions in US retail savings are either too small or have other strategic priorities. It is always possible that the investment bankers will find a way of dismembering Kemper, especially if a buyer for the troubled property portfolio can be found. But splitting the group is unlikely to release much value for shareholders. The breadth of Kemper's product range may actually be an asset, allowing it to sell both mutual funds and annuities depending on market conditions. On that reasoning, the group is worth more to GE Capital than the sum of its parts.</p>

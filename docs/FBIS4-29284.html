			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 16 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The paper on  proposals to attract foreign and Malaysian scientists and  engineers working abroad to the country is ready and awaiting  approval from the relevant government agencies, Science,  Technology and Environment Minister Law Hieng Ding said Thursday.    He said the working committee, headed by his deputy, Peter  Chin, had finalised the paper recently and was waiting for  government agencies such as the Public Services Department and  Treasury to endorse it before presenting it to the cabinet for  final approval.    The scheme was meant to meet the country's needs for  scientists and engineers to fulfil its plan to be an  industrialised nation by the year 2020, he told reporters after  opening an exhibition on the beauty of nature at the National  Museum here.    Law said that the incentive package, among others, offered  the target group salaries comparable to that offered by other  countries with fringe benefits including permanent resident  status, if necessary.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Deficit forecast at Bell Atlantic BELL ATLANTIC, the US telecoms group, expects to post a 1991 year-end loss. It blames the loss on a Dollars 1.55bn accounting change charge that will be retroactive to the first 1991 quarter, Reuter reports. The company, which plans to restate results for the first three quarters of 1991, said the charge related to its adoption of Financial Accounting Standard Number 106, which affects its accounting of retiree health and life insurance benefits. In 1990, Bell Atlantic earned Dollars 1.31bn, or Dollars 3.38 a share, on revenues of Dollars 12.30bn. Excluding the charge, the company said its earnings from operations were on track to meet analysts' expectations.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tea growers have mixed feelings on bumper harvest India, the world's biggest tea producer, is racing towards a record crop of anything up to 770m kg compared with 758.01m in 1993. By August the harvest had reached 466m kg, up 11.8m from the same stage last year. Producers' associations have started thinking aloud, however, about whether they should be asking the tea estates to cut production in December, when in the north mostly common to inferior varieties are plucked. Last December's record production of 43.51m kg was one of the major factors behind the fall in tea prices from which the market has yet to recover. It is still being debated to what level the December production of the gardens in the north and the south should be restricted. Moreover, even if the associations are able to reach an agreement on cutting production it is by no means certain that all the gardens, particularly the small ones, will fall into line. According to the Tea Board officials: 'The silver lining is that the tea companies today are mostly market driven. Seeing the premium available for quality tea, they are investing in the modernisation of plantations and tea-processing factories. Even the small, single garden tea companies in the south are making efforts to produce better tea'. The Indian domestic market, which is likely to grow to 585m kg from 578m kg last year, wants medium to good quality tea. The share of plainer and poor end-of-season varieties in the total tea production is to fall in the current year, even in the absence of an agreement on December production cuts. In the eight months to August, Sri Lankan production rose 14.9m kg to 164.5m. In the same period, however, the Kenyan crop, hit by bad weather, fell by 18.4m kg to 122.9m. While Bangladesh stepped up production by 1.9m kg to 31.2m, the Malawi crop was steady at about 28m kg and Indonesia's was reported to have suffered a setback. By the end of August, world tea production had reached 870.3m kg, up from 864.6m kg in the same period last year. In 1993 world production, aided by strong growth in India, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Malawi and despite the crop shortfall in Indonesia, rose by 142.5m kg to 1.47bn. As for India, the gardens in the north, including Assam, produced an extra 4.82m kg at 345.24m while those in the south harvested 120.67m kg, up 6.95m. In keeping with the trends in recent years, the industry had further raised the production of CTC (cut, tear and curl) tea to 409.76m kg from 378.11m, while there was a drastic cut in production of orthodox tea to 52.16m kg from 72.27m kg. Green tea output was up marginally to 3.98m kg. Orthodox tea sales have fallen as currency constraints have cut imports into former Soviet countries. 'While we continue to face problems with shipments to Iran, Russia, traditionally the most important destination for Indian tea, is not buying enough. The same is the case with the other CIS countries,' said an exporter. However, India is selling more tea to the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and Poland. The rising production and the slow export offtake have kept prices low at the Calcutta auction. The average for Assam leaf CTC up to the end of September was Rs50.84 a kilogram, against Rs53.30 in the same period last year.</p>

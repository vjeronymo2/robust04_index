			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Gallup sees hope in housing market INTEREST in buying houses and flats was last month at its highest level for two years, according to a survey by Gallup, the market-research group, Peter Marsh writes. An index used by Gallup to illustrate people's readiness to inquire about house purchases was 13.63 in September - after 12.08 in August. Gallup said the rise in house-buying interest in recent months was 'consistent with a modest price recovery' in housing. However, it added that 'a significant minority' in its monthly poll of 2,000 people were being put off buying homes by fears about unemployment, lack of savings and insufficient income. People wishing to buy for the first time are more bullish about entering the market than those already owning homes, the report says.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE JOINS ATTACK ON BAN OF CLINICS' ABORTION ADVICE  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp said Wednesday he has asked the U.S. Supreme  Court on behalf of California to hear a challenge to federal rules that  prohibit federally funded family planning clinics from mentioning abortion or  abortion providers.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp said his office accepted an invitation from the states of New York  and Ohio to join a request to the high court attacking the regulations, enacted  in February, 1988, under the Reagan Administration, as a violation of the  rights of privacy and free speech.  </P> <P> Deputy Atty. Gen. M. Anne Jennings said the regulations ban any clinic  receiving federal family planning funds from using money from any source in a  program that mentions abortion as an option.  </P> <P> The clinics are also forbidden to refer women to health care providers who  regularly perform abortions, and are required to provide a list of every local  prenatal care provider that does not perform abortions, regardless of the  clinic's opinion of the provider's competence, Jennings said.  </P> <P> She said Van de Kamp's office views the regulations as an unauthorized  expansion of a longstanding federal law that prohibited the direct use of  federal funds to pay for abortions "as a method of family planning."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE BRIDE WORE ANYTHING BUT WHITE IN A DRESS BY SUSAN LANE  </P> <P> After Carol Ramey and her boyfriend made plans to marry on their houseboat, she  realized that she didn't want to wear a traditional white wedding dress.  </P> <P> "I'm a little older than the average bride," said Ramey, who is 40 and getting  married for the second time. "I wanted something unique."  </P> <P> She spotted a photo of an elegant dress in a bridal magazine and sought out the  designer, Susan Lane. When she finally walked in the door of Lane's Toluca Lake  boutique, Country Elegance, Ramey said she felt that she had "died and gone to  heaven."  </P> <P> "This dress is perfect, exactly what I wanted," Ramey said of her $450  purchase. "It's a blush chiffon with an intermission hemline. It has a V-neck,  bellman sleeves, satin rosettes in front and the bodice is cotton. The dress is  floor-length and rises up about eight inches in front."  </P> <P> When it comes to designing bridal attire, 50-year-old Lane has always had a  flair for the slightly off-beat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Romantic Valentines'  </P> <P> "You see, a lot of people don't look good in white," Lane said. "Anybody with  pale skin, for instance, usually looks much better in a dress with color. We  work with lots of color, but I like to think of them as valentines . . .  romantic valentines. The majority of the colors we work with, such as blush,  are so muted you don't even notice that it's color -- you just notice its  warmth." (When Lane recently remarried for the fourth time, she wore a silver  silk Charmeuse dress with an intermission hemline, hand-painted flowers and  beadwork on the bodice and a plunging neckline.)  </P> <P> Lane's million-dollar business ("once I passed a million dollars, which was in  1984, I stopped giving figures," she said) happened almost by accident.  </P> <P> An art major, "home sewer" and housewife in the 1960s, Lane started "laying out  patchwork skirts on my pool table. I hate to throw things away. I think the  first skirt I did I used pink burlap and yellow. . . . I used to wear it all  the time to entertain, and people would just go crazy."  </P> <P> After selling one of the patchwork skirts in a friend's store, Lane sewed two  more, graduated to mass production and then, 20 years ago, opened her own shop  in Studio City. (She moved the store to Toluca Lake in 1982.) "Now we've even  gone into manufacturing. We have a 10,000-square-foot factory in Sherman Oaks,"  said Lane, who lives in North Hollywood.  </P> <P> The designer makes most of her elegant, romantic dresses, which range in price  from $350 to $500, in such fabrics as lace, chiffon, satin and satinet.  "Satinet comes in so many great colors that drapes really nicely," Lane said.  "Some people want silk, but satinet is soft. If I were to show you a dress in  silk and you were to feel it, you could not tell the difference between that  and satinet."  </P> <P> Lane's philosophy of design does not begin and end with her dress line. Country  Elegance is full of wedding touches: wicker baskets full of silk roses are  casually strewn on the blond wood floor. Sepia-toned, turn-of-the-century  brides and grooms stare sweetly from photos hanging on the walls. Antique  gowns, oak dressers, hat boxes and a peach satin sofa complete the look -- in  addition to a little, lace-covered table that offers wine and pretzels.  </P> <P> "The men love those," Lane said, laughing. "It's just a real nice touch,  especially when the men come in, because they don't have anything to do . . .  and they can sit down, have a glass of wine -- and more and more, we're getting  men in here.  </P> <P> "When I first started business, you'd never get a man in here," she added. "You  had everybody wanting white, and the brides were 18. Now they're 30; the men  come with them. They help them pay for the dress and the brides choose dresses  with some color in them. It's been a gradual trend."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Krylon Gown  </P> <P> Another trend in wedding gear that Lane has fueled is the paper gown, a $140  dress that is actually made of Krylon, an interfacing. "You wear it once, then  throw it away, since a lot of people only wear their wedding dress once  anyway," Lane said. "Or you can have the guests sign the train and use the  train for a guest book. Also, if you don't like the hem length, you can just  snip it shorter."  </P> <P> Jamie Nehen, a 23-year-old secretary from Encino, opted for a pink lace gown  over a satin slip for a garden wedding. "I wanted something cool and  comfortable, plus I thought traditional just wouldn't fit. We're having a  country-style wedding. And pink is my favorite color," said Nehen, who paid  $500 for her dress.  </P> <P> Occasionally a bride picks something bold and bright. "About three years ago,"  Lane said, "a bride planned to get married on Christmas Eve and we made her a  red wedding dress. Thinking of the Christmas theme, we also made her bouquets  of soft green ferns."  </P> <P> Sometimes the bride wears black. "One gal called us and said, 'Black is my  signature; I always wear black.' We tried several things on her and, sure  enough, she looked best in black. So I figured, 'Well, if you're going to do  it, do something very romantic, very 1920s.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Art Deco-Looking'  </P> <P> Or sometimes the bride wears white -- and the bridesmaids wear black. "Now 10  years ago, that would have been shocking," Lane said. "But it's very Art  Deco-looking. It's very sophisticated." (Thinking beyond the wedding day, Lane  carries two-piece outfits that can be worn elsewhere. "I really want to work  with the girls so they can wear their dress again -- bridesmaids too," said  Lane, whose bridesmaids' outfits average about $165.)  </P> <P> "We do custom dresses for people who might have figure problems," Lane said.  "We choose a fabric, and come in and we might match the top with the bottom,  where, let's say, they have heavy hips."  </P> <P> Helping out in the custom area is Sigrid Bailly, who tends to nervous brides in  a small room styled after a shingled, Victorian house. Sigrid's one-of-a-kind  Heirloom Collection dresses range from $400 to $1,300.  </P> <P> Lane also specializes in particuar looks, such as the 1940s bride, the  Victorian bride and the 1950s bride. "What we're saying, and it's really true,  is the brides of the '90s can wear all those different styles," Lane said.  </P></p>

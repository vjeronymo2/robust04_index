			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: AHP declines 3% in fourth quarter AMERICAN Home Products, the US pharmaceutical company, yesterday posted a 3 per cent decline in fourth-quarter net income, largely reflecting an increased effective tax rate following the adoption of new accounting standards. Net earnings for the three months fell to Dollars 361.6m, or Dollars 1.16 a share, from Dollars 372.6m, or Dollars 1.18. Sales in the quarter rose 10 per cent to Dollars 2bn from Dollars 1.82bn. Pre-tax earnings from operations rose to Dollars 500.7m from Dollars 464m. For the full year, earnings were distorted by a large number of items, including a charge of Dollars 220m for the write-off of acquired research in connection with the acquisition of Genetics Institute. Including one-time items, net income rose to Dollars 1.46bn, or Dollars 4.65 a share, in the year, from Dollars 1.38bn, or Dollars 4.36. Full-year sales were up 11.1 per cent to Dollars 7.87bn from Dollars 7.08bn. AHP said its effective tax rate, excluding the Dollars 220m acquired research charge, had increased to about 29.5 per cent from 22 per cent. It expects its 1993 effective tax rate to be 26-27 per cent. During the year, pharmaceutical sales rose 14 per cent to Dollars 4.59bn, although the rate of growth slowed to 13 per cent for the quarter. Sales in the consumer healthcare segment were 12 per cent higher for the year, at Dollars 1.61bn, and 7 per cent higher for the quarter at Dollars 393.9m.</p>

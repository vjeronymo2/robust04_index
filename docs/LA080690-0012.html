			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> CRITICISM'S NEEDED, BUT NOT STARK'S  </P> <P> I think it was stupid of him to say that (the reference to race).  </P> <P> I think it was accurate of him to assess that Sullivan was not doing his job.  It's too bad that he tarnished his remarks with a racist statement.  </P> <P> You have to understand that Sullivan has a responsibility to the poor of  America and he should be on a holy mission to achieve those goals and to  resolve health-care problems for them. (Health care) is not a luxury any of us  can afford to lose. (Sullivan) must recognize this.  </P> <P> That is what Stark should have been addressing. And it's unfortunate that Stark  didn't keep his comments in that vein.  </P></p>

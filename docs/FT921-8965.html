			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / The Property Market: More talk than action in Berlin 'Berlin is like London in the 1960s; the opportunities are enormous . . . companies wishing to invest can expect generous profits . . . .Berlin is an investor's paradise.' 'There has been a huge speculator-driven bubble that in the last month has started to burst. Banks are refusing to lend money on land because it is overpriced.' These contrasting views - from two of the many UK advisers who have flocked to Berlin in recent months - illustrate the uncertainties that exist in Europe's most unusual property market. The uncertainties are reflected in the differing levels of interest and investment attracted by the market. Berlin agents are besieged by visitors demanding information. Yet to date, there has been more talk than action. In the past 18 months, there have been barely 20 investment deals. The doubts over Berlin focus more on short-term rather than long term prospects. In the long term, Berlin's role as the seat of government will guarantee its future as Germany's most important city. Moreover, Berlin's growth will be powered by one of the strongest economies in the world. Berlin's expansion will create a huge demand for new commercial buildings. Office space in the city will increase from 13.5m square metres to 29m sq m by 2010; over the same period population is forecast to grow from 3.4m to 5m, according to the Institut fur Stadtforschung und Strukturpolitik, a planning institute. The opportunities, therefore, for developers over the next 15 years are enormous, particularly as 70 per cent of the existing office stock is obsolete. It is Berlin's short term prospects that are unclear. Already, one of the most sluggish markets in Germany has been transformed into one of the most expensive. Buildings that stood half empty two years ago have seen their rents quadruple. And while the worldwide property recession has restricted the funds available for investment, the grim forecasts on the future growth in property prices has made Berlin's landowners reluctant to sell their buildings. The shortage of high quality buildings on the market have forced yields down to 5 per cent, even where there is little prospect of continued rental growth. The reasons for the caution, however, go beyond the short term fluctuations in prices. There is extraordinary uncertainty about the future pattern of demand and supply. In the time since the Berlin wall was torn down in 1989, demand from tenants has vastly outstripped supply. Companies wanting to be represented in Berlin have clamoured for a share of the inadequate stock of office space. But it is unclear whether this pressure for space will be sustained over the next few years. Berlin's poor infrastructure, the lack of trained workers and the high cost of accommodation may deter companies from moving to Berlin. There is additional uncertainty as to when and how long it will take to transfer the seat of government from Bonn to Berlin - a move which will also see embassies, international agencies, employers' federations, trades union headquarters and the media follow suit. Anything from between five and 15 years has been mentioned. Yet there are other problems which will bog down developers. For instance, disputes about the ownership of sites that were expropriated by the former communist regime will slowdown virtually every developer on the eastern side of the city. Although a recent court case found that the claims of a previous owner should not be allowed to hold up development, nobody expects the arguments to be resolved swiftly. So it is unclear when the first new building will be erected on the eastern side of the city. The favourite is the 120,000 sq m complex in Friedrichstrasse, to be built by a consortium including the US property company Tishman Speyer Properties, Bouygues, the French construction company, and the French Galleries Lafayette department store. Work will probably start at the end of this year, although the consortium is facing the inevitable legal challenge on its ownership of part of the land. Even when questions of ownership have been clarified, developers can still expect to be held up by the planning process. No scheme on the eastern side of the city has yet received planning permission, according to Mr Stuart Reid of Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, the chartered surveyors. It is hardly surprising that dealing with the planning authorities is a drawn out process. The city is determined to do justice to the historical and symbolic importance of the land that has been cleared by the destruction of the wall. Potsdamer Platz, the huge area of wasteland near the Brandenburg Gate, which was once packed with glitzy hotels, cafes and stores, and where Adolf Hitler committed suicide in his bunker, is the most controversial site of all. First, the European Commission is investigating whether Daimler Benz and Sony, which bought much of the site relatively cheaply, received illegal subsidies from the city authorities. Second, the design of the square is the subject of heated debate. Daimler Benz claims that the planners' decision to restrict the height of buildings to 35m will produce monolithic facades, while Sony has called the planners' model unimaginative. Another planning debate is likely to be opened up in the next few weeks when Berlin unveils its master plan for the eastern side of the city. This will go some way to moulding the future shape of the city. Agents believe that prime areas in the western side (such as Kurfurstenmann) and the eastern side (such as Unter den Linden, the majestic avenue stretching out from the Brandenburg Gate) will ultimately resemble the west end of London and the City of London respectively. The problems of determing future rents lie in assessing the importance of the areas that fall outside the core city areas. 'It is really a guessing game,' says Mr Harry Gross of Zadelhoff Deutschland, real estate consultants. He believes that a significant oversupply of office space may develop over the next five to six years outside the core areas of the city. The western side of the city will, on average, command higher values than the eastern side, thanks to the higher quality of its infrastructure, shops and residential areas. The task of bringing the east of the city up to the same standards as the west is formidable. 'There is just too much to do there,' says Mr Gross. 'In some parts it looks like the Russian tanks have just moved out,' he adds. The future pattern of rents in the city may also be affected by developments in the hinterland of Berlin. One such project which has already won planning approval is a DM 1.5m business park at Beelitz by the UK's Carroll Group. So how well will the increase in demand match the increase in supply? In the face of so many difficult questions, it is no surprise that analysts disagree. According to Mr Guy Duckworth of Healey &amp; Baker, chartered surveyors, prime rents of DM 90 per sq m, may fall to DM 70-DM 75 in three years, as new buildings come on stream. 'If you bought in the last year, you have a good chance of getting your fingers burned,' he says. Mr Stuart Reid of Weatherall Green &amp; Smith, however, thinks demand will rise to match supply. In any case, the fundamental strengths of Berlin and its place in history will sustain continued interest from property companies. 'Every long term investor will want real estate here,' he says.  --------------------------------------------------------------- CAPITAL GROWTH (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------                     Retail  Office  Industrial  All Properties  --------------------------------------------------------------- Year to Dec 91      -3.6    -14.9      -2.1         -7.9 Quarter to Dec 91    0.6     -3.1       0.2         -0.9 Month of Dec 91      0.3     -1.3       0.0         -0.4  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Investment Property Databank  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Tadeusz Syryjczyk, a council member of the Democratic Union  (UD), the largest opposition party, said that the crisis had  shown the ruling coalition, whose members have roots in the  pre-1989 communist system, did not have "experts on governing  under democratic conditions."    Donald Tusk, leader of the Liberal-Democratic Congress (KLD)  - which is making plans to merge with the UD - said that the  real problem facing Poland was not the issue of personalities in  the coalition, but the statements and decisions of the Pawlak  government. Tusk argued that many decisions, particularly  relating to the budget and to taxation of small companies,  threatened to undermine the reform achievements of the past four  years.    Leszek Moczulski, leader of the rightist Confederation for  an  Independent Poland (KPN), said that none of the fundamental  issues had been resolved in relation to privatisation and the  dispute over the Finance Ministry. He predicted that the next  coalition crisis would erupt in four weeks time.    Jerzy Eysmont of the Non-party Reform Bloc (BBWR) noted that  despite the coalition agreement, there were sharp differences  between the SLD and the PSL over the state finances, the budget,  privatisation and local government reform.    For the leftist Union of Labour (UP), parliamentary floor  group spokesman Tomasz Nalecz said that the crisis was the  "first serious warning signal" over the differences between the  coalition partners. However, he added that "parliamentary  arithmetic" saved the coalition, since there is no obvious  alternative. However, "apart from the elegant style of  Borowski's departure from the cabinet, nothing was prevented.  (...) It was a serious coalition crisis, and more crises will  follow," he predicted.    Nalecz dismissed as "difficult to imagine" the suggestion  from KPN Leader Leszek Moczulski of a possible coalition of the  KPN, the PSL and the UP.    Among extra-parliamentary rightist groupings, opinions were  divided, but most were agreed the coalition was unlikely to  survive the full parliamentary four-year term. Pawel Laczkowski  of the Party of Christian Democrats (PCHD) said that he believed  the present coalition would easily see out the year. However,  there had been a clear shift in the relative balance of power,  with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak strengthening his position.    Romuald Szeremietiew, leader of the Movement for the  Republic  of Poland (RDR), described the coalition as a marriage of  convenience which was likely to face ever more rocks in its  path. Ludwik Dorn of the Centre Alliance (PC) believed that the  position of the SLD and its leader Aleksander Kwasniewski had  been weakened.    Janusz-Korwin Mikke of the Real Politics Union (UPR) said  that there seemed to be no real alternative to the present  coalition. Part of the SLD would like to make an alliance with  the Democratic Union (UD), but the UD is opposed. Also, there  is the possibility that SLD deputies from the All-Poland  Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ) might seek to make a separate  coalition deal with the Polish Peasant Party, but at the moment,  OPZZ deputies are apparently not ready to break up the SLD.    Poland's international partners are unwilling for the moment  to comment on developments in the ruling coalition. Officials  at the World Bank in Washington, who requested anonymity, said  that the bank was prepared to work with anyone appointed to  succeed Marek Borowski as finance minister. It was also  stressed that no official position could be expected from the  World Bank as long as the situation in Poland remained unclear,  and that the bank was concerned at the possibility of amendments  to the draft budget.    The value of Poland's sovereign debt on world secondary  markets, which after Borowski's resignation had fallen from 50.5  cents to the dollar to 46.5 cents, on Wednesday seemed to have  stabilised at 47 cents.</p>

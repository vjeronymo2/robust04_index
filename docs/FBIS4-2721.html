			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gong Dulun (7895 6236 4858), chief procurator of </F> the Sichuan Provincial People's Procuratorate to the Second  Session of the Eighth Sichuan Provincial People's Congress, 22  January 1994: "Work Report of the Sichuan Provincial People's  Procuratorate"]    [Text] Fellow Deputies,    Since the First Session of the Eighth Sichuan Provincial  People's Congress, the procuratorates at all levels throughout  the province, under the leadership of the CPC Sichuan Provincial  Committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and under the  supervision of the provincial people's congress and its standing  committee, have seriously implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC  National Congress and the directives of the central authorities  on combatting corruption. They have firmly implemented the law,  firmly handled cases, strengthened their various legal  supervisory functions, investigated and dealt with large and  serious cases of graft and bribery, struck at the various types  of criminal activities, and made obvious achievements. In  promoting the building of clean government in our province and  the building of socialist democracy and the legal system, and in  guaranteeing the smooth development of our province's reform and  opening up and economic construction, they have made positive  contributions.  <H5>  I. Placing Stress on the Investigation and Handling of </H5> Major and Serious Cases, While Continuing To Strike Firmly at  the Various Types of Criminal Activity    A. Taking the investigation and handling of large and  serious cases as the focal point and deeply developing the  struggle to combat criminal activities involving bribery and  corruption. Investigating and handling bribery and  corruption and other such economic crimes is a major function of  procuratorial organs. Since last year, the procuratorates at  all levels throughout the province have strengthened their  investigation and handling of large and serious cases.  Particularly in August last year, after the central authorities  issued the directive on further grasping the struggle against  corruption properly and realizing first-stage achievements  within a year, we made emergency mobilization arrangements in  the procuratorial organs throughout the province. We also  adopted a series of measures such as implementing chief  procurator responsibility systems for the handling of cases and  the measure whereby grass-roots level organs grasped the  investigation and handling of large and serious cases after the  provincial and city procuratorates have decided on the division  of the cases. Unified command and coordination have also been  strengthened. We have done well in internal mobilization and  the procuratorate heads at the provincial, city, and county  levels have sent circulars to the leading cadres within the  party at their respective levels, details of the situation in  the struggle against graft and bribery. The "100 Day Anti-Graft  and Pro-Clean Government Publicity Activities" were carried out  throughout the province and the procuratorate report center  telephone numbers at all levels were again publicized to  encourage the people to make reports. We have stressed policies  and tactics and handled cases in a firm, cautious, and correct  way, to guarantee the healthy development of the struggle  against graft and bribery. By the end of last year, the  procuratorates throughout the province had jointly received  20,446 reports of graft, bribery, and other economic crimes,  59.9 percent up on 1992. A total of 4,472 cases of graft,  bribery, and embezzlement of public funds were filed and  investigated. Of these, 2,445 major cases, or 54.7 percent of  the total, involved amounts in excess of 10,000 yuan, an  increase of 43.8 percent over 1992. Sixty-nine serious cases  involving cadres at the county and office level were  investigated and handled (including two cadres at the department  level), a 27.7 percent increase on 1992. Of the major cases  investigated and handled, 280 involved 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, a  76.1 percent over 1992; 233 involved 100,000 to 500,000 yuan, an  increase of 1.5 times; 27 involved 500,000 to 1 million yuan, an  increase of 92.8 percent; and 23 cases involved amounts in  excess of 1 million yuan, an increase of 10.5 times. Through  handling these cases, over 150 million yuan of state and  collective economic losses were recovered. Under the influence  of laws and policies, 100 criminals gave themselves up. The  general situation of cases in the various sectors handled by the  various levels of procuratorate throughout the province were as  follows:    1. Criminal cases were filed and investigated against a  total of 631 personnel from party and government organs. This  was 12 percent of the total number of persons involved in the  cases registered, a growth of 16.8 percent over 1992. Over the  period from September 1992 to April 1993, Gao Wancheng [7559  8001 2052], a government inspector and Liu Jiehui [0491 2638  6540] the city financial bureau director, both of Hechuan City,  improperly lent out more than 23.4 million yuan in funds. They  extorted 740,000 yuan as "service charges," of which over  400,000 yuan was shared between them and over 300,000 yuan was  used for offering bribes. Liu Jiehui also engaged in real  estate business through companies under the financial bureau  and, together with others, accepted bribes of 270,000 yuan. Two  deputy bureau directors from this bureau, together with the head  and deputy head of the bureau's rural finance section, embezzled  over 220,000 yuan in public funds. During the investigation of  this case, other cases were also successively investigated,  including the one where Lai Zhaofen [6351 0340 5358], the head  of the comprehensive department under the Chongqing City  Financial Bureau and Xu Yijian [6079 0110 6432], the deputy head  of the central district financial bureau of this City, had  received bribes; as well as cases whereby the managers of the  securities companies under seven district and county financial  administrations had engaged in graft, received bribes, and  improperly used public funds. The funds involved in these  crimes totalled 1.8 million yuan and a total of 28 major cases  involving amounts in excess of 10,000 yuan were pursued against  36 people. Of these, six were county- or office-level cadres.  Shi Renfu [4258 0088 1381], the deputy head of the student  enrolment office of Luzhou City had, since 1989, made use of his  position and on pretexts such as helping examinees to contact  tertiary institutions and gain entry and arranging study  opportunities, he successively extorted 323,000 yuan from 415  examinees and their parents in six counties and districts. He  also held a further 321,000 yuan of unexplained origin. After  the procuratorial organs filed a case, completed investigations,  and brought charges, the Luzhou City Intermediate Court tried  the case and sentenced Shi to death.    2. Graft, bribery, and other economic crime cases were  filed and investigated in respect of 61 justice administration  personnel, an increase of 84.4 percent compared to 1992. Wang  Xingbin [3769 5281 2430] of the People's Armed Police under the  Fengjie County Public Security Bureau, collaborated with other  people in using measures such as falsely recorded expenditure  and fraudulent checks to illegally obtain 208,000 yuan. He has  already been tried and sentenced to death by the Wanxian City  Intermediate Court. The cases investigated and handled also  include: One wherein an assistant procurator, Zhang Weilin  [1728 4850 2651] of the Qingyang District Procuratorate in  Chengdu City, accepted 130,000 yuan in bribes while handling  cases; another in which Guo Xuegang [7559 1331 0474], the deputy  president of the Yuqi Court under the Zizhong County Court,  extorted and accepted bribes; and a case wherein Zhong Zhengping  [6988 2973 1627], a lawyer from the Luzhou Lawyers Office, while  handling a case, embezzled 10,000 yuan of recovered funds from  an enterprise.    3. Criminal cases were filed and investigated in respect of  115 administrative and law enforcement personnel. From 1990 to  January 1993, Shuai Xinglong [1596 5281 7127] secretary of the  party group and Li Tingjun [2621 1656 0971], the deputy bureau  head, both of the Santai County State Land Administration  Bureau, used their positions and, through the printing of  land-use certificates, the examination and approval of land  requisition, the payment of wages to temporary workers, the  purchase of goods, the holding of meetings, and so on, they  raised prices and submitted false expense claims, thereby  corruptly obtaining 160,000 yuan through bribes and the  embezzlement of public funds. In December 1992, Tang Xinguo  [0781 2450 0948], the deputy bureau head of the technology  supervision bureau of Chenghua District, Chengdu City, together  with Zhao Yong [6392 0516], the head of the investigation team  of this bureau, while investigating and handling cases involving  fake and low-quality products being handled by individual  operators, sold off the illicit goods and divided the 20,000  yuan obtained between themselves. Liu Guangquan [0491 0342  2938], the head of the commercial inspection bureau in Neijiang  City, used the convenience of his office to embezzle 22,000 yuan  and accepted 7,000 yuan in bribes.    4. Close to 400 cases of graft, bribery and other economic  crimes were filed and investigated within the banking system.  Those who received bribes generally used their privileged  positions to lend out state funds as interbank loans and to  issue credit in violation of regulations. This greatly  disturbed the state's normal financial order and resulted in it  being impossible to recover a great amount of the funds. In  September last year, the Chengdu City Procuratorate investigated  and handled a case in which five section-level cadres of the  Industrial and Commercial Bank of Sichuan Province used their  positions and colluded with other people. Under the pretext of  interbank lending, they used the credit for personal gain and  the individuals received "benefits payments" from this. Thereby,  they lined their own pockets with public funds. Zhong Nianlin  [6988 1819 2651], the deputy section head of the commercial  credit section of this branch received 144,000 yuan in bribes.  Tang Anwei [0781 1344 0251], the deputy head of the planning  section received 60,000 yuan in bribes. Zhou Xin [0719 2946],  manager of the Industrial Bank Company under this branch,  received 150,000 yuan in bribes. Ran Longlin [0373 7127 2651],  the deputy head and others, a total of three people from the  Bishan County Construction Bank, while issuing credit, used the  pretext of "consultancy fees" and demanded bribes from those  obtaining credit. The bribes totalled 220,000 yuan. Xu Yuelin  [1776 1471 2651], a business operator in the securities business  section in the Jiangbei District Branch Office of the  Agricultural Bank, received 310,000 yuan in bribes through the  issuing of credit. Yi Bingqian [2496 4426 6692], a worker in  the Chongqing City Branch of the Communications Bank, colluded  with financial personnel in an enterprise and changed the  enterprise's 24 million yuan savings account into a trust  account. Thereby, from the interest differential, they  criminally obtained 700,000 yuan, of which Yi Bingqian received  400,000 yuan. The illegally obtained booty has all been  recovered. The Chongqing City Intermediate Court has already  sentenced him to death, suspended for two years. From June 1992  to April 1993 Zhang Gefei [1728 2706 7236], a teller at the  Central District Insurance Office in Leshan City, embezzled  679,000 yuan. He fled after the offence but was subsequently  apprehended. On 27 September, the Leshan City Intermediate Court  tried Zhang and sentenced him to death. The head and deputy  head of the accounting and finance section who bore major  responsibility in this case were sentenced to prison terms for  dereliction of duty.    5. A number of major cases were also discovered in some  enterprises. Hu Changxian [5170 2490 0341], the chief engineer  (deputy office head level) of the Chongqing Special Steel  (Group) Company took advantage of his position in wholesaling  steel products to accept bribes of 50,000 yuan. The courts have  sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment. Su Yuxiang [5685 3254  3276], of the Yonghong Real Estate Development Company of  Mianyang City, and Chen Qiuju [7115 4428 5468], the deputy  general manager and cash handler from the same company, while  engaged in real estate business in Hainan in April last year,  embezzled 1.08 million yuan and absconded with the money. The  procuratorial organs, after receiving the case, immediately  organized the pursuit and apprehension of these persons and  recovered all the booty. On 14 September, the Intermediate  Court of Mianyang City sentenced Su Yuxiang to death and also  sentenced Chen Qiuju to death, with the sentence suspended for  two years. Qu Kaijun [4234 7030 6511], the Hailande Commercial  and Trade Department manager and Qin Gesheng [6009 7245 0524],  the business manager of the overseas enterprise branch of the  Chongqing International Company, embezzled 690,000 yuan. The  court tried them and sentenced the two criminals to death, with  the sentence suspended for 2 years.    6. Over the year, 338 cases of tax evasion and tax  avoidance were filed, investigated, and handled. Of these, 20  were major ones involving over 100,000 yuan, a 66.7 percent  increase over 1992. Two cases involved amounts over 1 million  yuan. The crime of defrauding the state of export drawbacks is  a new one which has appeared in recent years subsequent to the  reform of the taxation and foreign trade structures. Since  1992, throughout the province, nine such major cases have been  detected involving a total of 20 million yuan. In March and  April last year, Dai Fuquan [0108 1381 0356] and He Kai [0149  0418], both working in the Kaijiang Branch Office of the  Zhongjiang County Industrial and Commercial Bureau, as well as  Lin Xinquan [2651 0207 0356], an official from the county  taxation bureau, improperly used operating licenses, tax  registration certificates, fictitious factories, fake receipts  and fake tax completion certificates to faudulently obtain 1.94  million yuan in state export drawbacks. Tan Qikun [6223 0366  0981], the head of the office of the Deyang City Taxation  Bureau, Li Biyou [2621 4310 0645], the deputy head of the Deyang  City Demobilized Military Cadres School, and Li Fumin, [2621  4395 3446], a purchaser for the Shoufeng Township Supply and  Marketing Cooperative in the city's central district, colluded  with each other to obtain by deception 1.84 million yuan in  state export drawbacks.    A total of 181 cases of fake trademarks were filed,  investigated, and handled, an increase of 33 percent over 1992.  Of these, seven cases involved over 1 million yuan in illicit  funds. In October last year, on the basis of reports by the  masses, the Yibin Branch Procuratorate investigated and dealt  with a case involving a conspiracy by the managers of the Dalian  Glass Factory and the Beijing Xiangxue Seafood Products Factory  whereby they illegally produced 300,000 fake crystal bottles for  Wuliangye wine. The Chongqing City procuratorial organs also  apprehended six illegal producers of, and dealers in, imitation  brand-name cigarettes, seizing over 3,000 cartons and over  240,000 counterfeit brand labels. They detained 19 people  involved in these illegal activities. Wang Tianfu [3769 1131  4395], the manager of the Jiangjin Branch of the Bank of China,  and others, used bank funds to assemble 226 fake Chongqing  Jialing motorcycles, the illicit amount totaling 1.4 million  yuan. The Shifang County Procuratorate investigated and  arrested Liu Bangyun [0491 1620 0061], an employee of the  Fangting Grain Station under the county grain bureau who, in  collusion with the unemployed Huang Kaihong [7806 7030 3163],  leased a disued wine cellar and used industrial alcohol to  manufacture fake wine which they sold. This resulted in 13  persons suffering severe alcohol poisoning after drinking the  wine. Four of those persons died and seven lost the sight or  most of the sight in both eyes. The Deyang City Intermediate  Court tried them for the crime of selling poisonous and harmful  foodstuffs and both Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong were sentenced  to death.    The successes achieved in fighting graft and bribery were  mainly realized following the increased attention given by the  party and the people after the issuing in August of a party  central committee directive on further properly grasping the  struggle against corruption. Party committees at various levels  gave attention to and strengthened leadership over the  investigation and handling of major and serious cases. The  broad masses warmly supported and actively participated in  making reports against criminals, while the province's  procuratorial personnel impartially implemented the law, did  everything they could, and went all out in their work. This  provided a clear contrast with the first half of the year when  reports from the people declined, as did the number of cases  filed. We need to draw experiences and lessons from this and  carry forward the struggle against corruption in a deep-going  and sustained way. We cannot allow laxity at any time.    B. Actively developing the struggle to firmly strike  at and seriously punish crime. Last year, the province's  procuratorate actively coordinated with the public security  organs and the courts and, in a planned and focused way,  launched various specific struggles provincewide to "oppose  theft," "strike at robbery," surround and annihilate "road and  railway criminals," strike at the abduction of women, prohibit  prostitution, eliminate the "six evils," and so on. After  August in particular, with the unified deployment and leadership  of the provincial party committee, the procuratorial organs  actively participated in the unified provincewide struggle to  rigorously strike at crime. As a result, there was a great  increase in approvals for arrests and prosecutions. Over the  year, requests were submitted by public security organs for  approval to arrest 62,072 persons. Of these, 57,537 requests  have been dealt with and the arrest of 53,317 persons was  approved. This was an increase of 40.2 percent over 1992.  Requests for transfer to prosecution and exemption of  prosecution for 56,250 persons were received from the public  security organs. Of these, 50,483 have already been handled and  48,183 persons have had public prosecutions initiated against  them. This was 15.3 percent up on the 1992 figure.    During the struggle to rigorously strike at crime, the  procuratorates at all levels throughout the province took as  their striking focus crimes such as murder, robbery, rape,  hoodlumism, the abduction and sale of women and children, crimes  involving serious violence, and gang crimes. Priority  deployment of forces was made against vicious crimes which had  major influence and presented a great danger to society. In  such cases, there was advance intervention, firm handling, and  timely examination of arrest applications and the examination of  prosecution applications. The number of persons for whom  arrests for serious crimes were approved was 16,104, or 30.2  percent of the total number of persons arrested. At Spring  Festival last year, there was a very major case of robbery and  murder in Chengdu City. The criminal brothers Zhou Qiang [0719  1730] and Zhou Tong [0719 1749], using the sound of the Spring  Festival firecrackers as cover on two occasions, armed with  guns, they entered houses and robbed and killed people. They  killed six people and stole 600,000 yuan in property. The  procuratorate organs engaged in advanced intervention and  twodays after the public security organs had requested  permission to arrest them, the permission was granted. Within  four days of the transfer prosecution application, the  prosecution was being pursued in court and, as a result, the  criminals were firmly punished in a timely way. On 4 May last  year, the Fengshan Cultural Troupe from Dianjiang County  performed at Gaofengzhen in that county. Hong Kang [3163 1660],  Chen Jiankang [7115 0256 1660], Chen Tao [7115 3447] and others,  a total of six people from the county, did not buy tickets but  forced their way into the theater, rushed onto the stage, and  assaulted a male performer. After the performance was over,  they also subjected the performers to indignities and seized and  raped three female performers. This had an extremely odious  effect and the cultural troupe was forced to disband. After the  public security organs had investigated this case, the county  procuratorate sent personnel to provide advance intervention and  the arrest permission was swiftly given. On 13 October, the  Fuling District Intermediate Court sentenced Hong Kang, Chen  Jiankang, and Chen Tao to death for rape and hoodlumism, while  the other three criminals were sentenced to prison terms ranging  from eight to 12 years. The masses were extremely pleased by  this.    C. Seriously investigating criminal cases involving  violation of citizens' democratic rights and crimes of  dereliction of duty. Over the year, 897 criminal cases  involving violation of rights and crimes of dereliction of duty  were filed and investigated. Of these, 104 were major cases and  and 53 were extremely serious cases, representing increases of  33.3 percent and 29.2 percent respectively on 1992. In April  last year, Bai Tianliang [4101 1131 0081], deputy secretary of  the Daqi District CPC Committee in Youyang County, together with  the deputy district head Peng Defu [1756 1795 1381] and Li  Maohong [2621 5399 4767], the acting party secretary of the  Daxiang Township CPC Committee, engaged in the arbitrary  collection of charges and the levying of fines. If the masses  did not obey, these officials adopted various modes of  punishment, including public parading in the streets, forcing  people to kneel for long periods, forcing people to stand for  long periods, and binding and beating people. They also took 21  peasants into custody illegally. The reaction of the local  masses was extremely intense. With the support of the county  party committee, the county procuratorate filed and investigated  charges of illegal detention against Bai Tianliang and the  others. In another case, the Hanyuan County Procuratorate  investigated the extremely serious 12 July fire and found that  it was an incident involving criminal culpability. The  procuratorate filed and investigated a case against the person  who caused the conflagration, the petrol station supervisor Gao  Jun [7559 6511]. From this case it was discovered that Li  Keping [2621 0344 1627], the deputy section head of the planning  section of the county branch of the People's Bank of China had  received bribes. In August 1993, the Sichuan Meishu Publishing  House published the Taiwan children's comic book "An Abrupt Turn  in Thinking." In this book, two pictures and associated texts  seriously harmed the feelings of Muslim people, leading to  demonstrations and sit-down protests by tens of thousands of  people in several provinces, and the seeking of audiences with  higher officials to lay complaints. This had serious political  effects and harmed social stability. After the provincial  procuratorate received the matter, it swiftly filed cases and  commenced investigations against Li Kanglin [2621 1660 2651],  the deputy head of the provincial Meishu Publishing House and  others, a total of three people who had been negligent in their  duties. The procuratorate also collected together copies of "An  Abrupt Turn in Thinking" and burned them, to guard against the  incident from expanding further and to bring stability back to  social order. In other cases, 57 justice administration  personnel were investigated for the crimes of self-serving  misconduct, extorting confessions through torture, and illegal  detention. Zhou Zhaofu [0719 2507 1381], a judge in the Ziyang  City Court, while hearing a case of robbery, absolved the  offender from guilt. On many other occasions while handling  cases, Zhou used his position to extort bribes and he thereby  received a total of 18,000 yuan. The procuratorial organs filed  a case charging him with self-serving misconduct and carried out  an investigation.  <H5>  II. Strengthening the Consciousness of Supervision, </H5> Strengthening Supervision of Law Enforcement    Since the beginning of last year, the procuratorates at all  levels throughout the province have seriously implemented the  spirit of the 14th Party Congress and the First Session of the  Eighth NPC, have firmly implemented law supervision  responsibilities, and have realized new advances in various  aspects of law supervision work.    The strengthening of supervision over investigation has  mainly involved the supervision and prevention of mistakes and  leaks in investigative activities through the examination of the  arrest approval and prosecution approval functions. Last year,  the procuratorates at various levels throughout the province  decided not to allow the arrest of 4,343 persons whose arrest  was unnecessary or against whom a case could not be built. They  also made decisions in accordance with the law, not to allow the  prosecution of 206 persons who should not have had criminal  responsibility assigned to them. During investigations, they  also pursued and captured in a timely way, 540 criminal elements  who had slipped through the net and prosecuted 355 persons. In  respect of illegal activities which occurred during  investigation activities by the public security organs, they put  forward 331 ideas on redressing the problems. In strengthening  supervision over the administration of justice, the various  levels of procuratorate have, in response to illegal activities  which have occurred during trials in the people's courts, put  forward 64 suggestions on redressing the problems. In  investigating the 112 appeals which held that court decisions  and rulings were erroneous, courts have heard 28 of these  appeals and in 17 cases the decisions or rulings were changed.  There has also been strengthening of supervision over prisons  and detention centers and over enforcement. Last year, in  response to some prisons and detention centers not firmly  enforcing the law, taking money to offset punishment, and  arbitrarily levying charges, a special investigation was carried  out. The problems noted in the investigation report attracted  great attention from the provincial people's congress and the  NPC Standing Committee. This led to the judicial organs  rectifying the unhealthy trend in levying charges. Supervision  over the implementation of reduced sentences, release on parole,  and release from custody to obtain medical treatment was  strengthened, while improprieties were swiftly discovered and  redressed. When crimes were discovered they were swiftly  investigated and dealt with. Zheng Wanming [6774 8001 2494],  head of the Mianzhu County Detention Center, by illegally  arranging for 27 criminals to be released for medical treatment,  extorted over 14,000 yuan cash and a pair of gold earrings from  the family members of the criminals. He also privately released  two offenders. Zhang Wanming has already been tried and  sentenced to 9 years imprisonment. Over the year, through  examination of prisons and detention centers, a total of 33  cases were filed and investigated against 38 prison and  detention center staff for crimes such as graft, bribery,  corporal punishment, cruel treatment, and the private release of  prisoners. At the same time, the procuratorates conducted  activities by which they struck at those personnel who committed  crimes while engaged in administering reform through labor and  education through labor. Over the year, the arrest of 61  persons was approved and public prosecutions were initiated  against 916 persons. This safeguarded order during the  transformation of prisons and detention centers. The  examination of complaints and petitions was strengthened and  there was reexamination of cases against which petitions were  lodged. In this way, if there were cases they were examined and  if there had been mistakes they were redressed. Over the year,  585 cases were filed for the examination and handling of  petitions which came under the jurisdiction of the procuratorial  organs. Through investigation, 226 verdicts were sustained, 73  were corrected, it was suggested that the courts reexamine 10  cases, and one application was rejected. By handling these  cases, the supervisory restraints within the procuratorial  organs were strengthened and the solemnity of the law was  maintained.    In order to raise the quality of work in receiving the  masses, the procuratorates throughout the province developed  reception activities in a civilized way. Fifty-three civilized  units were recognized and it was decided to confer the title  "Civilized Reception Hall" on 32 reception halls. Of these  reception halls, those of the Chengdu City Procuratorate and the  Bazhong City Procuratorate have been awarded the title  "Civilized Reception Hall" by the Supreme People's  Procuratorate. Civil and administrative inspection was also  strengthened. Protests were lodged in accordance with the law  against civil and administrative decisions and orders which had  been put into effect but which were obviously erroneous. We  upheld the policy of "positive, earnest, and stable" actions.  With one hand, we grasped basic work while, with the other we  grasped the handling of cases and thereby developed supervision  through the handling of cases. Throughout the year, 1,258  petitions against civil and administrative decisions and orders  made by courts, and which had already been put into effect, were  accepted. Of these, the handling of over 1,038 has already been  completed and in 371 instances, cases were filed. In 75 of  these, it was suggested that the court redress the matter, while  in 18 cases appeals were filed in court. By the end of the  year, three judgements had been revised and the legitimate  rights and interests of the party's concerned had been  maintained.    Strengthening railway supervision work. In the  struggle to combat graft and bribery, the Chengdu Railway Bureau  Branch Procuratorate and the procuratorates at the six branch  railway bureaus, centering around the rectification of railway  practices and with the work focus placed on investigating the  use of railcars and tickets for private gain, put all their  efforts into investigating and handling large and serious cases.  Over the year, they filed and investigated 70 cases relating to  graft, bribery, and other economic crimes. Of these, 29, or  41.4 percent of the total, were large or serious cases. An  amount in excess of 1.31 million yuan in economic losses was  recovered for the state. In the struggle to "seriously strike"  at such crimes, the railway procuratorates at both levels  actively participated in various specific struggles and  improvements. The focus was placed on striking at a group of  "railroad robbers," to safeguard railroad order. Throughout the  year, the arrest of 1206 criminals was approved and public  prosecutions were launched against 1103 persons.  <H5>  III. Opposing Corruption, Promoting Clean Government, and </H5> Doing Well in Building a Procuratorial Contingent    From the beginning of last year, under the new situation of  establishing a socialist market economy structure, the  procuratorates at various levels throughout the province  strengthened ideological and political work. They earnestly  arranged for the police to study the spirit of the documents of  the 14th Party Congress and the First Session of the Eighth NPC  and of a series of speeches by General Secretary Jiang. They  used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics to unify understanding. They educated  the police in strictly implementing the law, in observing  discipline, in opposing corruption, in promoting clean  government, and in rectifying the irregular practices within the  procuratorates. In a situation where the tasks are onerous and  the conditions arduous, the procuratorial police throughout the  province maintained high morale, devoted themselves to the  service of the public, struggled hard, carried out their duties  tenaciously, and manifested the characteristics of procuratorial  police.    In accordance with the central directives and provincial  committee's deployments, we strengthened our own work of  opposing corruption and promoting clean government. In response  to problems existing in our ranks whereby the law is enforced  insufficiently rigorously, where violations of the law are not  investigated, where there are instances of exceeding authority  in the investigation of cases and of arbitrary levying of  charges, in July and August procuratorial organs throughout the  province carried out education and a readjustment in respect of  strictly implementing the law. Since September, the leading  cadres at and above the county and office levels have carried  out a clean government self-discipline inspection and, at the  same time, further rectified unhealthy trends within their own  systems. 1. The procuratorial organs throughout the province  ferreted out 180,000 yuan in arbitrarily levied "prosecution and  examination exemption fees," "nonarrest and nonprosecution  education fees" and so on, returning the money to those who had  originally paid such fees. They investigated the "bail by which  one obtains a guarantor and awaits trial out of custody," which  was being levied by departments and, in July, in accordance with  a directive from the Supreme People's Procuratorate, stopped the  levying of this bail. 2. Since the beginning of last year,  procuratorial organs throughout the province have, in accordance  with relevant stipulations from upper levels, been engaged in  sorting out 123 companies of various sorts which have been  established. 3. The provincial procuratorate, in accordance  with stipulations by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, issued  timely circulars prohibiting procuratorate staff from  intervening in economic disputes and from exceeding their powers  in handling cases. In respect of those few procuratorates and  procuratorial policemen who intervened in economic disputes and  exceeded their powers in investigating cases, firm examinations  and rectifications were carried out. 4. Throughout the  province, 38 cases were filed and investigated in respect of  violations of law and discipline by procuratorial policemen and  in eight cases, criminal charges were laid. In opposing  corruption and promoting clean government, in accordance with  the stipulations of the Supreme People's Procuratorate and in  the light of reality, two sets of "eight prohibitions"  disciplinary rules for procuratorial organs and officials were  formulated and it was required that the procuratorates and their  staff throughout the province observe and implement these.    In looking back at work over the year, the main problems  which have existed in procuratorial work have been as follows:  1. In the struggle to combat graft, insufficient stress has  been placed on investigating and handling large and serious  cases in key sectors, while in leading the organs in  investigating and handling there has been the fear of  difficulty. During the handling of such cases, investigators  have thus shrunk back and been overly cautious. 2. Supervision  of problems such as cases which are not investigated, people  paying fines rather than undergoing imprisonment, and money  being used to pay off prison terms, has been insufficiently  strict. Further, phenomena such as enforcement of the law being  insufficiently rigorous and violations of the law not being  investigated occurred frequently. 3. Some procuratorates pay  insufficient attention to policies and tactics during the  handling of cases, their work is crude and simplistic, and they  sometimes violate the law in handling cases. 4. Many district  and county procuratorates are seriously lacking in funds for  handling cases and their equipment is backward. This has  seriously hampered the strict enforcement of the law.    Fellow deputies:    The "CPC Central Committee Decision on Certain Questions  Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy  Structure" passed by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, pointed out that it is necessary to  strengthen the building of the legal system and of clean  government and to firmly and unyieldingly carry out the struggle  against graft. The central political and law conference pointed  out that it is necessary, while accelerating the pace of the  reforms by which we are establishing a socialist market economy  structure, to safeguard the state's political and social  stability. In 1994, the tasks of procuratorial work throughout  the province are as follows: We will uphold guidance by the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics;  implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee; firmly uphold the policy of "grasping  with two hands and ensuring that both hands are tight";  strengthen legal supervisory functions; strictly enforce the  law; vigorously grasp the handling of cases; centralize  strengths in investigating and handling graft, bribery, and  other large and serious cases; strike at various types of  criminal activities; protect the legitimate rights of citizens;  safeguard political and social stability; create a fine legal  environment for reforms, opening up, and modernization; and  guarantee the establishment and development of a socialist  market economy structure.    We must develop the struggle against graft in a deep-going  and sustained way; centralize our strengths in investigating and  handling the large and serious cases which occur in party and  government organs, judicial organs, administrative law  enforcement departments, and economic management departments;  and we must investigate and handle crimes involving legal  personnel engaging in bribery, tax fraud, use of false  trademarks, and smuggling. It is necessary to strike at serious  criminal activities in a sustained and unwavering way, to  actively participate in the various specific struggles and  improvements in "seriously striking" at such activities, and  continue to strengthen examination and handling of crimes such  as "violation of rights" and dereliction of duty.    It is necessary to employ the principle of "seriously  enforcing the law and firmly grasping the handling of cases" in  handling overall procuratorial work and to strengthen the  various types of legal supervisory functions. In supervision of  investigations, we must strengthen supervision over situations  where cases exist but have not been investigated and where fines  replace imprisonment. In the supervision of trials, we need to  improve the level of public prosecutions and increase the  strength of appeals. In supervising implementation, it is  necessary to strengthen examination of the way in which cases of  reduced sentences, parole, and allowing prisoners to remain out  of custody to receive medical treatment are handled and also to  investigate cases where persons are held in custody beyond the  period of their sentence. When the law is broken or perverted  and a criminal case has been demonstrated, it must be firmly  investigated and handled. Civil and administrative supervision  involves appeals in accordance with the law against civil and  administrative judgements and rulings made by the people's  courts which are already in effect but which are obviously  erroneous. It is also necessary to pay full attention to the  examination and handling of judicial officers who are corrupt or  who have perverted the law. It is also necessary to do well in  terms of the dual internal restraints and in guaranteeing the  quality of cases. We must continue to do well in the  self-strengthening of the procuratorial contingent and raise the  political quality and law enforcement level of the enforcement  personnel. They should seriously study Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, more strongly uphold  the party's basic principles, uphold the idea of "grasping both  types of work simultaneously," and uphold the firmness and  consciousness of the struggle against graft. It is necessary to  do well in the ideological construction of procuratorate leading  groups at all levels, to increase their cohesiveness and their  fighting strength. It is necessary to continue to carry out  education in opposing graft and promoting clean government and  to correct the various unhealthy trends. It is necessary to  continue to perfect the target responsibility systems and  case-handling responsibility systems and we must actively  explore measures for reforming the procuratorial cadre personnel  system to encourage the procuratorial police to exert themselves  and be zealous in their work. We must also continue to do well  in professional training and raise the level of law enforcement.  We must build procuratorates in accordance with the law, carry  out examinations strictly, implement the law firmly, and  establish strict discipline.    We must consciously and actively accept supervision by the  people's congresses and their standing committees and handle  matters strictly in accordance with the law. At set intervals  we must, in accordance with the law, report on our work to the  people's congresses and their standing committees and fully  respect their deliberations and opinions. We must warmly accept  examination of law enforcement work by the people's congress  standing committees and handle those cases handed over by  people's congresses. We must actively and responsibly deal with  proposals, suggestions, criticisms, and ideas put forward by  people's congress representatives. It is necessary to  strengthen links with local people's congress representatives  and open-mindedly listen to their suggestions, criticisms, and  ideas on our work, so that we can continually improve  procuratorial work.</p>

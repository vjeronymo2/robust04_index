			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Petr Yevseyev, FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA </F> correspondent: "International Spaceport Uses Russian Technology"]    [Text] Russian space industry is receiving a chance for  strengthening its positions in the world and broadening its  share in the commercial launches market. The directors of the  key enterprises of the national space complex in November were  familiarized with the sites of the proposed construction of a  new international privately operated spaceport. It will be  located on one of the islands of Papua-New Guinea and Russian  specialists will play the leading role in its construction.    <FIG ID=JPRS-USP-001C-30A>           nnot&gt; Key: 1. Equator 2. Papua-New Guinea </FIG>      The idea of establishing a spaceport arose in Australia and  initially its construction was proposed precisely there, on Cape  York. However, in the course of elaborating the project the  Space Transportation Systems (STS) concern, organized for this  purpose, came to the conclusion that it was more feasible to  construct it in Papua-New Guinea. The islands proposed by the  government of this country are closer to the equator (Emirau  Island -- 1 degree 40 minutes from the equator, Manus Island --  2 degrees) and make it possible to increase the mass of the  payload put into a geostationary orbit by a Proton booster by  more than double.    In March five of our enterprises signed a preliminary  agreement with the STS. The Australians are taking upon  themselves the concerns about the financing of the project and  construction, together with Papua-New Guinea, of the  infrastructures of the future spaceport. Our task is supplying  technological equipment for the spaceport and the performance of  the principal assembly work.    Five years ago, when the idea of the construction had just  come up, American, French and British companies offered their  services. However, Russia was selected as the principal partner  and the Zenit first, and then the Proton, was selected as the  basic booster. Nikolay Pismennyy, department head at the Main  Administration for Rocket and Space Technology of the State  Committee for Industrial Defense Branches, attributes such a  choice to the fact that the Proton is now the most reliable and  has the greatest capabilities of any rocket in the world. This  booster has been launched more than 200 times.    Under the agreement, by the end of the first half-year of  1994 the Design Bureau for General Machine Building, with the  participation of other Russian enterprises, should have  developed a rough draft of the spaceport. It is proposed that  the first launch of a booster from the new spaceport will take  place in 1998.    The work done by our companies will be paid for at once,  regardless of the further operation of the constructed  spaceport. According to preliminary estimates, the cost of the  spaceport will be from 900 million to 1 billion dollars. Half  will be the cost of the technological equipment and half will be  the cost of construction. Thus, the cost of deliveries of  equipment and one technological booster will be from 400 to 500  million dollars.    But Aleksey Krysanov, department head at the Design Bureau  for General Machine Building, feels that the profit from these  deliveries will be small, so that the preservation of jobs at  production plants will be the most significant attainment. The  principal income for Russian enterprises, which will probably be  combined into some consortium, such as the Australians have,  will come from subsequent sale of Proton boosters for launches  from the new spaceport.    In addition, the Australians propose and even insist on our  participation in its subsequent operation. And they propose that  the Russian side become a co-owner of the spaceport, which will  make it possible to obtain a profit not only from the sale of  boosters, but also from the results of its commercial use. Our  contribution to the international consortium will be in the form  of "know-how."    However, the scales of the project and the intensification  of  the project during its realization, even without the stiff  competition in the world commercial launches market, do not make  it possible to consider the construction of the new privately  operated spaceport in Papua-New Guinea to be an already  accomplished fact. It is sufficient to recall the experience of  such cooperation between Russia and Brazil, where all work  ceased due to pressure from the American side.</p>

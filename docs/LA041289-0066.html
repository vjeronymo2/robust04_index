			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURVEY SEES CHILD-CARE CRISIS BREWING IN U.S.  </P> <P> Nearly 40% of the nation's working parents, rich and poor alike, are so  dissatisfied with child care that the situation has become a "national crisis,"  according to a poll released Tuesday by Louis Harris &amp; Associates.  </P> <P> The survey results -- telecast by satellite from New York to five cities around  the country, including Los Angeles and Mission Viejo, also revealed that single  and black parents are paying more for child care than white married couples.  </P> <P> The poll showed broad national backing for federal support of day-care  programs.  </P> <P> "This is an area where people wake up every day, 19% of the population, and  say, 'What will I do with my kid today?' " Harris said during the telecast.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tax Credits  </P> <P> If there is no action soon from Congress enacting new tax credits for child  care, "I tell you all hell will break loose," Harris said.  </P> <P> "I'd say it's reached crisis proportions," he declared.  </P> <P> Harris' firm from Dec. 22 to Feb. 8 questioned 4,050 adults on national  policies toward child care and also asked a sample of those, 2,009 adults with  a child under the age of 6, to describe their experience with child care.  </P> <P> The survey showed that although 53% of those surveyed thought the child-care  system was working "somewhat well," 38% said it was working "not very well" or  "not well at all."  </P> <P> The report said the negative numbers indicate that parents are putting up with  a "just tolerable" situation.  </P> <P> In comments on his survey during the telecast, Harris described those surveyed  as having "a deep, deep unease over the plight of children generally" and said  they worry that "most children in the United States today are short-changed."  </P> <P> Survey respondents believed that the overall quality of life for children has  deteriorated. Sixty-three percent said children are "objects of neglect," and  65% said children were worse off today than when they were growing up. Only  "the poor" and "the elderly" were ranked more neglected than children.  </P> <P> But at the same time, the poll showed that 47% of those surveyed believed that  most children had loving parents, 44% believed that they received medical  treatment when needed and 42% believed the statement that most children "are  basically happy."  </P> <P> The survey also looked at typical costs of child care, reporting the mean cost  for all those surveyed as $190 a month or $2,280 a year.  </P> <P> But Harris discovered an irony: "Many of those who can least afford to pay, in  fact, are paying almost as much as the very wealthiest families do for child  care."  </P> <P> Single mothers pay $211 a month and black parents pay $258, but business  executives pay $244, professionals pay $226 and married couples pay only $185,  according to the survey.  </P> <P> Explaining the disparity, the survey noted: "Parents pay what they have to in  order to get proper care -- if they can find it. . . . However, even when  parents pay high sums for child care, there is no guarantee they will receive  high quality or real value for their money."  </P> <P> Added Harris, when asked to explain why blacks were among those groups paying  top dollar for child care, "It's very difficult for them to find child care,  and they've got to pay through the nose. It's an old, old story in this country  -- you gotta pay more to be poor."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strong Ideas  </P> <P> Parents of all income levels had strong ideas of what they wanted in a day care  center. Ninety-seven percent cited as a key concern "the quality of people  running the center." But in answer to a national policy question, Harris noted  that nine in 10 of those surveyed agreed that better day-care workers must be  attracted "by higher pay, not paid the level of a parking attendant, as today."  </P> <P> The survey also asked all its respondents to consider President Bush's  child-care program -- a tax credit of up to $1,000 a year for low-income  parents -- as well as the Democratic alternative of providing funds to low- and  middle-income parents for child care and setting uniform federal standards for  providers. According to the Harris survey, those polled favored both proposals.  </P> <P> The poll was commissioned by Philip Morris Cos. of New York.  </P></p>

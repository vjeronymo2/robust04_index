			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Councils fear extra demands District and metropolitan councils, which will have to police the new shopping regulations, yesterday reacted with concern to the decision by MPs. The Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities welcomed the decision to put Sunday trading on a 'more clearly defined legal basis', but said councils would have to meet extra demands. The cost of the partial de-regulation option has been estimated by the Institute of Public Finance at between Pounds 3m and Pounds 4m - but the extent of the impact will differ from authority to authority. The Local Government Management Board said that trading standards departments would need extra funds to police the new regulations. But the government would not meet the cost, it added. Extra income from car parks and parking meters would have to be balanced against extra costs from increased pressure on street cleaning, trading standards and parking.</p>

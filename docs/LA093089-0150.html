			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Liquidation of At Ease Sought: Four creditors have asked the U.S. Bankruptcy  Court in Santa Ana to liquidate At Ease, the Newport Beach-based retailer known  for its expensive men's clothing. In the involuntary bankruptcy petition filed  this week, the creditors said they are owed more than $533,689 by At Ease. The  action comes in the wake of At Ease closing stores in Santa Ana and Westwood.  The company still operates stores in Newport Beach and Pasadena and is planning  to open a new store in San Francisco in the next two weeks. At Ease likely will  seek to convert the involuntary Chapter 7 filing to Chapter 11, which would  provide it protection from creditors while it reorganizes, said the firm'  attorney, Bill Lobel of Lobel Winthrop &amp; Broker in Irvine.  </P></p>

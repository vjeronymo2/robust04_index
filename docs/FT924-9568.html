			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries Appropriately for the company which makes Lucky Strike cigarettes, BAT Industries is enjoying its fair share of good fortune. Fate has breathed life into tobacco by opening up new markets from Czechoslovakia to China. Farmers Insurance missed any serious damage from Hurricane Andrew. Lower US interest rates mean higher earnings for a company with around Dollars 1bn floating rate dollar debt. True, mortgage indemnity insurance cost Eagle Star another Pounds 29m in the third quarter, underlining that BAT remains hostage to the UK housing market. In the context of a company making Pounds 100m a month from cigarettes, though, this now looks more of an embarrassment than a threat. Judging by the Pounds 175m investment in doubling capacity at its main UK plant, BAT believes tobacco profits have further to go. If the lucky streak continues, earnings could also be flattered next year by a stronger dollar. The new accruals method of accounting for long-term insurance business should make the accounts easier to understand - although not until BAT deigns to give its underlying assumptions on investment returns, policy surrenders and so on. With prospects elsewhere deeply uncertain, the promise of 9 per cent dividend growth this year looks appealing. Even at yesterday's all-time high, BAT's shares are trading on a prospective yield higher than the market average.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 16 (CTK) -- The Slovak Police do not  prepare "any extra measures" in connection with the envisaged  visit by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of Russia's Liberal  Democratic Party (LDPR), to Slovakia, Slovak Interior Minister  Ladislav Pittner told CTK today. Zhirinovskiy is to arrive for  a private visit to Bratislava on May 21, at the invitation of  Ladislav Mojzis, the owner of West-Club restaurant in  Bratislava, and Jozef Lauko, who attended the LDPR April  congress as an honorary guest.    Any Russian citizen can arrive in Slovakia when invited, as  Slovakia has visa-free relations with Russia, Pittner said.  "The situation would be different if the visitor did not keep  to Slovak laws," Pittner said, adding that in this case police  would act according to the law.</p>

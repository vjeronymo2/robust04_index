			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [M.M. report: "Serbs Can Also Do It Differently...."] </F>   [Text] The concessions that we have made so far, we made  thinking that they were the price of peace. If it turns out  that the Muslim and the Croatian sides indeed do not want peace,  we are prepared to make a different, radical step. We could  retracted the concessions. We are prepared for a solution that  would lead to the end of the Bosnian crisis, either through war  or peace.    This was stated for our paper by Nikola Koljevic, vice  president of the republic of Srpska, commenting on the  assembly's decision to postpone the adoption of the platform  until its session in Bijeljina on 17 January, shortly before the  meeting in Geneva. Stressing that the deputies at the Pale  assembly session adhered to their earlier offer [33.3 percent of  the territory for the Muslims], Dr. Koljevic said that the final  platform was not adopted this time because of "a possibility of  the Muslims and Croats reaching a new agreement."    "We certainly want the final settlement of the Bosnian  crisis  to be achieved peacefully, and we paid too high a price for  peace, and yet it has not been established yet," Koljevic said.  "This is thanks to the others, primarily to the Muslims. Serbs  cannot be asked to do anything more, because while we were  making certain concessions, new concessions were demanded, and  the concessions that had been made earlier were quickly  forgotten. These unjust concessions should finally be stopped."    Asked to comment on the latest threats to Serbs with  military  force, Dr., Koljevic said:    "Serbs have had enough of threats. Many responsible people  are thinking incorrectly because they do not know Serbs, their  history, and aspirations."</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets - Tokyo The Nikkei index is likely to continue to fluctuate around the 20,000 level in the week ahead, writes Emiko Terazono. However, trading volume is expected to rise sharply as a last-minute rush to realise profits on holdings boosts cross trading, or the selling and buying back of stocks, ahead of the September book closing. The volume of cross trades on the Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya stock exchanges during the April-September period is expected to total around 7.5bn shares, the highest since 1991, with about 80 to 90 per cent of the trading during the latter half of last week being attributed to cross trading.

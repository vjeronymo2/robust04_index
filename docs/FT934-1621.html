			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Unigate quits poultry with Turners Turkeys divestiture Unigate is completing its exit from the poultry business with the sale of Turners Turkeys to Bernard Matthews, the largest UK turkey producer, for an estimated Pounds 18m. Unigate's largest divestiture in the sector came nearly two years ago when it sold its lossmaking JP Wood chicken business to sharpen its focus on value added foods. Bernard Matthews is buying Turners to keep pace with a UK demand for fresh turkey products which was up by 30 per cent in the last year, and to acquire farms with confirmed planning permissions. 'Increases in our agricultural production have been restricted over the last years through the difficulties in obtaining planning permission for new farms both in Norfolk and Suffolk',said Mr Bernard Matthews, chairman. The cash consideration includes Pounds 11m for fixed assets and about Pounds 7m for the stock, subject to final valuation. Matthews is financing the deal with bank borrowings. It has conditionally agreed a Pounds 5.6m sale of 19 Turners Turkey breeding and turkey growing farms in the West Midlands to Sun Valley Poultry, a subsidiary of Cargill of the US. Matthews will be left with 20 Turners' farms and two processing plants in Norfolk and Lincolnshire, Matthews' home base. It will maintain the Turners brand. Turners, employing 800 people, reported operating profit of Pounds 2.8m on turnover of Pounds 59.6m for the year ended March 31.</p>

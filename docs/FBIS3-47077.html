			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- The government and the  ruling coalition decided Monday [10 January] to push a set of  political reform bills through the House of Councillors on  January 19, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama said.    At a meeting of leaders of the government and ruling  parties,  Social Democratic Party Secretary General Wataru Kubo reported  that the coalition parties want the reform bills to clear an  upper house special panel on political reform on January 18 and  the full upper chamber on January 19, Hatoyama told a news  conference.    Kubo was quoted as saying the coalition parties intend to  set  aside January 17 for a public hearing on the  government-sponsored reform measures even if the main opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) opposes the idea.    Once a public hearing finishes, a bill can be put to a vote  at a Diet committee.    The government approved the coalition plan to finish upper  house deliberations on January 19 on political reform aimed at  rooting out corruption that seems endemic to Japan's money  driven political system, Hatoyama said.    The reform package is intended to introduce single-seat  constituencies combined with proportional representation for  lower house elections and impose stricter controls on campaign  funding.    The bills cleared the lower house in mid-November and are  pending in the upper house.    Kubo reportedly said the coalition has no intention of  beginning talks with the LDP on possible modifications of the  bills unless the ruling and opposition parties agree to  enactment of the bills in the current Diet session, which closes  on January 29.    The government and coalition parties should wait for the  LDP's move on political reform despite LDP Secretary General  Yoshiro Mori's remark on Friday that the party would help pass  the bills in the current Diet sitting if they were first revised.    Hiroyuki Sonoda, secretary general of Sakigake (Harbinger),  and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, also called  for prudence about talks with the LDP on possible amendments of  the bills, saying it is still unclear whether the LDP is serious  about reform, according to Hatoyama.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said earlier  Monday that he welcomes Mori's remark, which was interpreted as  suggesting a shift in the LDP's stance on political reform.    Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi said the government  and the ruling coalition parties should make clear that they pay  due attention to minor groupings in the Diet, Hatoyama said.    While Ichikawa voiced concern about the tight Diet schedule,  Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the Democratic Socialist  Party, expressed hope the LDP will present its plan as early as  possible if it seeks modifications of the government reform  bills.    Kubo also proposed that the government promise the LDP to  revise the bills after they become law in a bid to secure their  passage through the Diet by January 29, Hatoyama said, adding  that Ichikawa expressed his personal approval of the plan.</p>

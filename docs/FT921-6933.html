			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: IBM chief announces retirement MR GEORGE CONRADES, one of International Business Machines' top executives, will leave the company at the end of the month. He is the second IBM senior vice-president to announce plans to retire from the company this month. Mr Conrades' departure follows his recent reassignment to a staff post, in charge of corporate marketing and services. Previously, he was general manager of IBM USA. The move was widely seen as a demotion in the wake of IBM's poor performance over the past year. Coming on the heels of the resignation of Mr Michael Armstrong, chairman of IBM World Trade, Mr Conrades' departure demonstrates the sweeping changes that are under way within IBM as the company reorganises its operations in an effort to boost its competitiveness and return to profitability. A 31-year IBM veteran, who at various times has had charge of most of IBM's largest product groups, Mr Conrades said a number of significant opportunities outside IBM have recently been presented to him.</p>

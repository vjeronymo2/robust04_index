			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Sport: Northampton's mighty oak - Rugby John Hopkins, the noted British sportswriter, will report regularly for the Weekend FT on golf and rugby, joining a small band of regular commentators: John Barrett (tennis), Teresa McLean (cricket), Keith Wheatley (yachting and sports politics), and Michael Thompson-Noel (horse racing). IT IS A matter of opinion whether or not Northampton is 'a dull place with much nondescript modern development,' as it is described in the Blue Guide to England. But suggest that its rugby team and its captain are dull or nondescript and you will have to answer to some of the most partisan spectators this side of Cornwall. This afternoon, coachloads of these supporters will be at Twickenham to roar on - and I mean roar on - Northampton in the Pilkington Cup final against Harlequins. When the men in black, green and gold run on to the most famous rugby pitch in the world, take a look at Gary Pearce, Northampton's captain. You can hardly miss him. His neck is as wide as most people's thighs and his thighs are as sturdy as the trunk of a tree. Wound around his head as protection for his ears will be a yard and a half of sticky tape. Pearce, who is 35, will probably be straining slightly as he leads his men out, puffing his cheeks, pointing his toes, his large hands making the ball look insignificant. He labours away at the game's pit face, the front row of the scrum, where it can be dark and gloomy. As tight-head prop he is the cornerstone of Northampton's scrum and as captain he is cornerstone of the team. He is the one who is never late on the team bus, never misses training, always gets on with the job in hand and the man always proffered as an example for younger players to model themselves on. Pearce first played for Northampton three prime ministers, three general elections and more than 13 years ago. He arrived from Aylesbury one Easter and less than a year later was playing for England. Since then he has acquired 34 more caps, the most by a prop forward, and has been on eight tours for his country. When you try to assess Pearce's assets as a rugby player you think of his strength, which is considerable, and of how good he is at doing what you might call the basic chores of his job. You won't see him frolicking in open play; his 16 3/4 stone sees to that. But his scrummaging technique is so faultless it could come straight from the pages of a rugby manual. 'Gary has very strong legs and always keeps his back straight,' says Barry Corless, Northampton's coaching coordinator. 'From this position he can drive forwards and upwards the moment the ball comes in. That is why he is so good. You see so many props with their heads down near their knees in a scrum and their backs rounded.' Northampton and their homely ground at Franklin's Gardens have been transformed since the summer's day three years ago when a cabal of seven members obtained the necessary majority at an annual general meeting to oust the existing committee and take over the club. Not everyone liked what followed. Soon the tumbrils rattled. Pockets of discontent formed and remain. But even those old members who have boycotted the club since the revolution could not deny the transformation effected by the new management. Three years ago the club was struggling near the foot of the second division. This season it finished eighth equal in the first. Last season Northampton won the national sevens and reached the semi-finals of the cup, thus drawing in more spectators. This has had such an effect that membership has trebled - one afternoon last season as much money was taken from one game as in the whole of the previous season. Northampton have set a record for ticket sales for this afternoon's final - more than Pounds 130,000. The Saints go marching in all right, taking coachloads of supporters wherever they go. Every rugby club in the county will have at least one coach full of supporters at Twickenham this afternoon, which is more than can be said of Harlequins. The size of Northampton's invading force will be considerable, even if it is smaller than Cornwall's army was in the final of the divisional championship recently. Last Saturday Northampton travelled to south-west London to play Rosslyn Park in what was the last league game of the season for both clubs. Roehampton looked at its best and spectators stood around, drinks in hand, enjoying the warmth of a spring afternoon. The result was a foregone conclusion from the moment Park scored in the second minute. The final score was 48-0. It seemed a shocking result for Northampton, who were only three players below full strength, and to get some perspective on it I sought the views of two of the most distinguished members of the home club. Phil Keith-Roach, Rosslyn Park's former hooker and now coach, is as much a part of the club as the netting that stops the ball flying out of the ground and on to the Upper Richmond Road. 'Gary Pearce is so good technically there's no reason why he shouldn't go on until he's 40, provided he stays free of injuries,' said the indomitable Keith-Roach. 'I played against him in my last game for Park. I broke my neck and thought I'd better retire. Mind, I was 42 at the time.' Then I came across the massive figure of the club's president and former England international, Andy Ripley, who beamed down benignly from behind his John Lennon spectacles. I thought I would soften him up with an easy question first. 'How are you?' I asked. 'Dancing on the end of a sunbeam, thank you very much,' he replied. 'And what did you make of that performance? 'Northampton are an unusual side,' he replied. 'They haven't got many stars and they were obviously not very interested this afternoon. Next weekend one of two things could happen. They could raise their game and win. Or they could be overwhelmed and lose by a record margin. I'm not quite sure which.'</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Deere reduces production target for fourth quarter DEERE &amp; Company, the world's biggest manufacturer of farm equipment, yesterday unveiled weak third quarter earnings and warned of an uncertain outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. The US company has scaled back fourth quarter production tonnage to about 21 per cent below last year's levels. This compares with a 5 per cent decline in third quarter production tonnage and a 4 per cent reduction for the first nine months of 1992. Mr Hans Becherer, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Although the lower production will facilitate our efforts to reduce company and dealer inventories, profitability will remain under pressure and our equipment operations will incur a net loss in the fourth quarter and for the entire fiscal year. However, our financial services operations are expected to continue to perform well during the remainder of 1992.' The Moline, Illinois-based company had third quarter net income of Dollars 9.1m, or 12 cents a share, compared with Dollars 31.3m, or 41 cents, a year ago. Sales and revenues slid 2 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 1.75bn from Dollars 1.79bn. Mr Becherer said profitability had been hurt by high sales incentives costs in a soft market. 'Despite the current reasonably favourable economic fundamentals of North American agriculture, farmers have remained very cautious in making capital purchases and retail sales have been lower than anticipated,' he said Industry-wide retail sales of industrial equipment had been slow in 1992 despite a gradual improvement in construction activity. In addition, the soft US economy appeared to be affecting consumer confidence and spending for durable goods. On Wall Street, shares in Deere slid below their previous 52-week low to close Dollars  7/8 down at Dollars 38 1/2 . During the third quarter, Deere's North American lawn and grounds care equipment operations increased its operating loss. For the first nine months, Deere had net income of Dollars 33.2m, or 44 cents a share, against Dollars 61.3m, or 80 cents, a year earlier. Sales and revenues were 2 per cent lower at Dollars 5.07bn compared with Dollars 5.15bn.</p>

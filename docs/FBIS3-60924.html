On 5 January, the  commander of the Army confirmed this information and said he had  already given the Venezuelan authorities a list of names of  Venezuelan soldiers involved in this illegal arms trade.    [Begin Army Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman recording,  identified by caption] The operation we carried out and the  statements of a guerrilla member produced information that was  turned over to the Prosecutor's Office. If you want names, I can  tell you that I cannot reveal them because this case is now the  responsibility of the Venezuelan authorities. [end recording]    The "24 Hours" newscast, however, learned that the following  Venezuelan soldiers are involved: Colonel Montes, Guard  Escalante, and Inspectors Ramos and Nunez. We also learned that  the Venezuelan Government is investigating certain reports that  many Venezuelan soldiers and guards offer protection to  Colombian guerrillas. Gen. Guzman also confirmed that there are  constant exchanges between Venezuelan subversives and Colombia's  ELN.    [Begin Guzman recording] We know that certain guerrillas,  especially those in the ELN, have crossed the border to give  training on the Venezuelan side. [end recording]    The Army commander added that although it is impossible to  control the 2,219 km borderline, the necessary measures were  implemented in coordination with the Venezuelan Army.</p>

Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's  report to the U.N. Security Council concerning the situation in  the two safe havens in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "Specifically, it has been proposed to open Tuzla airport  for  humanitarian supplies and replace the Canadian battalion in  Srebrenica with a Dutch one. We are currently studying the  report very carefully. At first sight, some corrections may  have to be made.    "However, already now we can say definitely that Russia's  position in favour of a balanced and calm resolution of all  questions has been reflected in the report. It rules out hasty  actions. The main accent has been made on reaching an agreement  between the U.N. and the warring factions.    "Such approach has already proven successful in Srebrenica.  The report expresses the hope that by the end of February the  replacement of the Canadian battalion will be successfully  completed. As far as Tuzla is concerned, a representative of  the U.N. secretary-general in former Yugoslavia will hold talks  with the Serbian and Moslem sides next week. We call for  constructiveness and believe that the necessary guarantees may  be provided to prevent the use of Tuzla airport for delivering  military supplies, which is a subject of concern of the Serbian  side.    "There is no question of delivering any `air strikes' in  order to `punish' one of the warring sides in Bosnia," Churkin  said.</p>

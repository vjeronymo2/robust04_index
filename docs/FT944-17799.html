			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Coats buys Charterhall offshoot from receiver Coats Viyella, the UK's largest clothing and textiles company, yesterday acquired Corah, the Leicester-based producer of underwear and knitted fabrics, for a consideration believed to be about Pounds 25m cash. Coats has been negotiating since May to buy Corah from the receiver to Charterhall, Corah's holding company. Charterhall went into receivership in 1990 after its Australian owner, Westmex, went into liquidation. The acquisition, which will be finalised following the preparation of completed accounts, comes after Coats identified clothing as one of its key growth sectors at the announcement of its interim results last month. Corah, which supplies Marks and Spencer, expects pre-tax profits to be at least Pounds 3.8m on turnover of about Pounds 63m for the year to October 2. Net assets are roughly Pounds 5m, after writing off debts. The company will join Coats' clothing division, which at the interim stage reported reduced operating profits of Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 5.2m) after closing a uniform factory in South Wales.</p>

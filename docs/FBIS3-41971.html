			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Negotiations on Cooperation </F> Agreement With Russia Expected To Be Relaunched"; as released by  Brussels Textline database]    [Text] Since the signing of the EC/Russia political  statement on 9 December (for which Russian President Boris  Yeltsin came to Brussels in person), negotiations between the EC  and Russia on the conclusion of a partnership and cooperation  agreement have known a period of reduced activity. A meeting of  experts planned for end of December in Moscow has been postponed  (Russian sources indicate that it should take place at the end  of January) and the initialing of the final agreement could, say  well-informed sources, take place toward the end of March. This  development does not correspond to the optimistic scenario  described by politicians on both sides at the signing of the  political statement when not only the president in office of the  European Council, Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, but  also the president of the Commission, Jacques Delors, had  announced that an agreement would be signed in the next few  days. Relaunching negotiations was the central topic of talks  that the Russian Ambassador to the EC, Mr. Silaew, had on Monday  [17 January] and Tuesday [18 January] with the vice-president of  the European Commission, Mr. Christophersen, with Sir Leon  Brittan and also with Mr. Benavides of the DG-I [Directorate  General I -- external relations]. EUROPE believes that the  reasons for the present break are both technical and political,  given that:    (a) Fundamental divergence persists, notably in the nuclear  field (in particular concerning the rules and provisions to  govern the trade of uranium between the EC and Russia), maritime  transport and access to the banking market (where Russia calls  for a transition period). As regards the nuclear question (by  far the most tricky question), France insists for trade  questions to be governed by a separate accord between the EC and  Russia, in this case the EURATOM agreement (negotiated 18 months  ago with Russia but never completed) which would give the EC  more possibilities for acting in connection with over-large  import flows or dumping practices in the trade of enriched  uranium. The 11 other member states, the Commission and Russian  authorities hope to include this chapter in the cooperation  agreement. It seems that the Commission recently submitted a  compromise solution to Russian authorities. It is now awaiting  Moscow's reply;    (b) After the parliamentary elections in Russia in December  and given the political and staffing changes that have taken  place within the Russian Government, the EC expects the  situation will become more stable and that its interlocutors in  negotiations will be clearly identified;    (c) Further to the real "forcing" by negotiators before and  during Mr. Yeltsin's stay in Brussels (mainly in order to make  it possible to sign the statement), the Twelve needed time for  reflection in order to examine results obtained in detail.</p>

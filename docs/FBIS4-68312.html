			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article with no byline: "Russia's New Space Capital"] </F>   [Text] Before the year 2000, Plesetsk (in Arkhangelsk  Oblast), where no heavy-lift launchers or manned spacecraft have  ever lifted off, could become the cosmodrome from which all  types of domestic space systems are launched. That's according  to the chief of the Main Center for Testing and Use of Space  Systems (the Plesetsk Cosmodrome), Maj. Gen. Anatoliy  Ovchinnikov.    The official date of birth of Plesetsk -- initially a  defense  facility where the R-7 intercontinental missiles stood in combat  readiness and were aimed at the United States and were, during  the Caribbean crisis, on red alert -- is 1957, when the wave  with the first landing force arrived there. In 1964, the  decision was made to re-orient the missile complexes of Plesetsk  to the peaceful purposes associated with space.    Today, from the nine launch pads of the northern spaceport,  four types of launchers lift off (the Soyuz, the Molniya, the  Tsiklon, and the Kosmos), and they place in orbit nine types of  science- or national-economy-related satellites (the Bion, the  Resurs, the Foton, the Molniya, the Meteor, the Okean, the  Musson, the AUOS, and the Nadezhda). Military satellites are  also launched from Plesetsk. Over Plesetsk's nearly 30 years of  history, two accidents have occurred (in 1973 and 1980), taking  nine and 51 human lives.    Because of the indecision between Russia and Kazakhstan on  the question of the fate of the Baykonur cosmodrome, the role of  Plesetsk has recently begun to grow. Even if Baykonur is leased  from Kazakhstan, Russia will still need a base for launching  heavy-lift vehicles and manned spacecraft. That is especially  important for performing the Russian-American program  Mir-Shuttle and the international project for the creation of  the orbital station Alpha.    In the opinion of Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, Plesetsk is best  suited for solving those problems. True, the location of the  cosmodrome -- far from the equator, which requires more power to  put some space vehicles into orbit -- does present something of  a problem, but one that can be solved. But the Arkhangelsk taiga  and tundra -- a sparsely populated area -- is convenient as an  area into which spent rocket stages can fall. In addition,  radiation field effects are minimal here, which is important for  the integrity of biological experiments.    In Plesetsk, the cosmodrome chief says, there wouldn't be  any  need to perform new construction -- some of the facilities would  just have to be reoutfitted, and the living area would have to  be renovated. That would take about 5 billion rubles at 1992  prices, three of which has been promised by the President of  Russia. But the biggest problem for Plesetsk, in the words of  Anatoliy Ovchinnikov, is the lack of specialists and the  assembly of launch-support teams. In fact, the drain of  personnel has virtually come to a halt, and many of those  serving at Baykonur now are getting ready to move to Plesetsk.</p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET ELECTION  </P> <P> People in the United States can draw inspiration from the recent Soviet  elections. Suppose in the voting booth we could express our dissatisfaction  with a slate of candidates by casting a negative vote for all of them. I bet  there would be greatly revitalized interest in voting among the vast numbers of  people in our electorate who don't vote out of a conviction that the Democratic  and Republican candidates they must choose between are as alike as two  competing brands of toilet paper.  </P> <P> The disaffected in our electorate, like the citizens of the Soviet Union, would  overwhelm the polls to cast decisive votes against entire slates of candidates.  And if no one could gain a majority mandate to govern, the election results  would show very powerfully that the United States also needs its own vigorous  program of glasnost and perestroika.  </P> <P> HARLEIGH KYSON JR.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

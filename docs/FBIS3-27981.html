This is not enough to meet the needs of the  851,620 persons living in the province.    Only four districts -- Phnum Penh, Kandal Stoeng, S'ang, and  Ponhea Loe -- possess favorable conditions for growing rainy  season rice while land in other districts along the Mekong river  is reserved for growing dry season rice and subsidiary crops.  The province transplanted only 45,230 hectares of assorted  varieties of rice with an average yield of a tonne and a half  per hectare in the past rainy season. So far the province has  planted more than 12,300 hectares of fast-growing rice, or 25  percent of the plan.</p>

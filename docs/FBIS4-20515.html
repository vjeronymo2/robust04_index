Strub: "Dissemination and Exploitation: A  Greater Emphasis" -- first paragraph is INNOVATION &amp;  TECHNOLOGY  TRANSFER introduction]    [Text] Activity 3 of the Fourth Framework Programme is  devoted to the diffusion and optimisation of results, and will  further integrate all the EC's efforts in these areas under one  programme. According to Dr. A.Strub, Director of DG XIII/D  (Dissemination and Exploitation of RTD Results, Technology  Transfer and Innovation), this will consolidate and enhance  Europe's ability to convert its undoubted scientific prowess  into internationally competitive products and services.    [INNOVATION &amp; TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER] Is this the first  time  that the dissemination and exploitation of research results has  been given such priority?    [Strub] Yes, certainly. Dissemination and exploitation is  now one of the four major headings of the Fourth Framework  Programme, giving these themes a much higher profile. What we  are seeing here is the continuation of a long-term trend. As  each Framework Programme succeeds its predecessor, the role of  dissemination and exploitation has become more prominent. On  the other hand, the current situation is that the funds proposed  under this heading of the Fourth Framework Programme are not as  high as the European Commission originally proposed, or as the  European Parliament wished.    Nevertheless, I expect that the dissemination and  exploitation work which was begun under the Second Framework  programme, and is now being developed and expanded under the  Third, will make further strides forward under the Fourth.    [INNOVATION &amp; TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER] What, in your view,  are  the main features of Activity 3?    [Strub] From my point of view, one of the main features is  the inclusion of work which up to now has been done under SPRINT  [Strategic Program for Innovation and Technology Transfer].  Both SPRINT and VALUE [program for the dissemination and  utilization of research results in science and technology] are  run from within my Directorate, and both programmes operate in  the technology transfer area. VALUE concentrates on promoting  the dissemination and exploitation of the results of  Community-funded research, whereas SPRINT has a brief which is  much broader -- to contribute towards the creation of a better  environment in Europe for innovation and technology transfer.    Up to now the administrative basis of the two programmes  have  been quite different, with VALUE within the framework programme  system and SPRINT outside it. The two programmes have much in  common and many shared interests, and the physical proximity of  the two management teams means that coordination and cooperation  between them is excellent. But having both under the same  administrative `root' will further improve coherence between the  two programmes and facilitate the undertaking of integrated  joint projects.    By the way, this poses a nomenclature problem. Should we  keep the names VALUE and SPRINT, which everyone knows, or should  we find a new name to cover both activities and to demonstrate  that they are merged?    Another point worth noting is that the network of  organisations set up under the THERMIE [European Technologies  for Energy Control] programme to promote energy technologies is  also put under Activity 3. That adds even more opportunities  for a shared approach.    [INNOVATION &amp; TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER] How will the  financial  environment for SME's [small and medium-sized enterprises] and  European industry in general be improved to make taking up new  technologies easier and more attractive?    [Strub] One of the objectives of Activity 3 is to improve  the financial environment for the dissemination of technology.  there will be two main strands to this.    One will target the interface between the financial world  and  innovative firms. The aim will be to improve communication  across this interface, and facilitate investment in  technological project. SPRINT has already done some work in this  area -- the SPRINT Investment Fora, for example.    The other strand will involve pilot financial schemes  specifically aimed at encouraging SMEs to make use of research  results and new technological developments. The SPRINT  Technology Performance Financing Scheme, which has been a  forerunner in this area, will be continued. We still hope that  -- notwithstanding the reluctance of some Member States -- the  Commission will also be authorised to try out a new financial  `instrument,' and that the funds finally made available to  Activity 3 will allow it. This instrument is intended to  improve the possibilities for financing the uptaking of  technologies and RTD results by SMEs and will be adapted to the  needs and practices of each Member State.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique of the Executive Bureau of the Democratic Party </F> dated 10 April: "The Romanians' Will To Be Together Remains  Intact"]    [Text] The Executive Bureau of the Democratic Party has  learned with deep concern and profound distress about both the  decision of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova to resume,  in a substantial way, the country's integration within the CIS  -- the successor to the USSR -- and the Chisinau officials'  declarations, which are contrary to the ideals and national  aspirations of the Romanians living on both banks of the Prut  River.    The Democratic Party has never doubted for a minute that the  imperial spirit from the East would be abandoned soon and  easily, but it kept hoping that despite the numerous hardships  of the current times the Romanians living in Bessarabia would  prove capable of turning to good account the advantages offered  by the new international situation to definitely unchain  themselves and return, in one form or other, to the cultural,  economic, and political space of their historic homeland.  Unfortunately, the decision passed by the Parliament of the  Republic of Moldova runs counter to the course of history and  can gravely and dramatically delay the accomplishment of the  Romanian national ideal of reunification.    At the same time we reject with indignation all assertions  that the post-December [1989] Romania never granted assistance  to the Republic of Moldova. At least during the Roman and  Stolojan governments, the assistance that was granted was  continuous and substantial, it came from all our hearts, despite  the fact that it meant a significant sacrifice for the  population of our country. However, it is also true that a  certain feeling of having been abandoned, which is experienced  by the Romanians in Bessarabia, is the fault of the current  government, as well as Romania's Presidency, which failed to use  the favorable circumstances created after the 1989 December  revolution and to show the evidence of patriotic courage and  political resoluteness that would have been needed for the  reunification of the country.    We are certain that the will of the Romanians living on both  banks of the Prut River to be together remains intact, as this  guarantees that sooner or later the country that was violently  torn away from us and submitted to dictatorship will be a WHOLE  [preceding word published in capitals] again, to the benefit of  the prosperity of the Romanian nation and stability in Europe.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Measured success of Thatcher's ovation - The moment when all eyes in the Empress were on the Baroness SHE HAD come to see her friends and support the prime minister. That at least is what her press secretary said. Baroness Thatcher yesterday decided that actions speak louder than words as she arrived to a slightly less than ecstatic welcome from the rank and file inside the Empress Ballroom. Her presence on the platform, alongside many of the senior ministers she has purportedly castigated in her memoirs, was designed to underline her approval for Mr John Major. But all most people wanted to talk about was what she really thought of her successor. The extracts in the Daily Mirror newspaper, widely believed, indicated just what a poor opinion she had of him. Mr Major appeared to return the compliment when he broke with recent tradition by declining to kiss her when he joined the platform for the debate on the economy. If comparing their respective merits as prime minister was not enough, supporters of each camp immediately began to contrast the standing ovations given to past and present leaders. At just over two minutes, Lady Thatcher's ovation was 20 seconds longer than the one given to Mr Major. But only half the audience were on their feet for the whole two minutes. Sir Edward Heath appeared scrupulously fair by standing for both but refusing to clap. There was no shortage of cabinet ministers trying to put the explosive issue of Lady Thatcher's memoirs behind them. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said the matter was 'history'; Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary said Lady Thatcher was 'livid with rage' at the Daily Mirror. Other representatives of the parliamentary party were more outspoken in their anger at what they perceived to be Lady Thatcher's hijacking of the party conference. 'It's a disgraceful lack of self-discipline,' said one. Her close friends appeared to hark back to a golden age which Mr Major now says never was. Mr Edward Leigh, the rightwing former trade minister sacked by the prime minister, said it was ludicrous to blame Lady Thatcher for stealing Mr Major's thunder. 'There is a tremendous affection for Thatcherite values. Until we get back to those policies we will continue to drift.' Sir Norman Fowler had hoped to appease Lady Thatcher's friends by declaring that he wore the badge of both Thatcherism and Majorism with pride. But it failed to convince one minister who said the government had only itself to blame by trying to distance itself from the achievements of the 1980s. Sir Tim Bell, who used to advise Lady Thatcher on her public relations, appeared bemused by the fuss. He professed surprise that anyone could have failed to see that the conference spotlight would fall on Lady Thatcher. 'What on earth did you expect?' Not to be outdone by the party chairman, who organised a dinner party for Lady Thatcher, Sir Tim hosted a lunch for her in the Imperial Hotel. As the guests made their way to their table they were somewhat taken aback at the sight of Sir Edward lunching in the middle with Mr Michael Heseltine at another table on the right. Mr Heseltine later made a triumphant return to the conference receiving the third longest standing ovation of the day. Supporters held out letters spelling 'Tarzan'. He had timed his entrance perfectly. Lady Thatcher had long since left the platform. Less than 24 hours after she arrived at Blackpool she strode out of the hotel lobby. According to one of her luncheon companions she had yet again demonstrated her support for the prime minister - this time by not even mentioning him.</p>

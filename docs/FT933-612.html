			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Traub buys east German machine-tool group THE Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising the eastern German economy, yesterday sold Heckert, the region's oldest machine-tool manufacturers, to Traub, one of western Germany's largest manufacturers of tools. The price was not disclosed. The sale of Heckert, based in Chemnitz, Saxony, will give Traub a foothold in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, a region which accounted for more than 70 per cent of Heckert's turnover before German reunification. Mr Hans Dieter Potsch, chief executive of Stuttgart-based Traub, said the group would invest more than DM60m (Dollars 37m) in Heckert over the next four years and would guarantee about 500 jobs. Before 1989, the plant employed 4,500. Last year, it recorded losses of over DM59m, compared with DM29m in 1991. Consolidated turnover fell by 11 per cent to DM339m over the same period. However, Mr Potsch said he was confident of growth over the next few years.</p>

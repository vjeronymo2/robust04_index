			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Environment--Candidate Countries </F> Should Be Allowed To Maintain Their Advanced Environmental  Standards"; as released by Brussels Textline database]    [Text] By adopting the Brigit Bjornvig Report (Dk, Rbw)  [expansion unknown] Parliament's Environment Commission  supported the "legitimacy" of the requests by Sweden, Austria,  Finland and Norway to be authorized to maintain their advanced  standards in environmental protection following their accession  to the European Union. The Committee stressed that these  countries:    a) would soon be bringing a significant contribution in  strengthening the EU's environmental legislation;    b) must, as far as possible, be authorized by the Council  and  Commission to maintain their current environmental standards in  those fields where the "acquis communautaire" is less advanced.  She also hoped that these two institutions would begin revising  this acquis as soon as possible with a view to the harmonization  of the environmental regulations of an enlarged Europe at the  highest level.</p>

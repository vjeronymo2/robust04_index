			<p>BFN     [Quotation marks as published]    [Text] A government official who requested anonymity told  REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA on the morning of 27 June that "the royal  government has already decided that it is time to outlaw the  Khmer Rouge, despite some differing views within the royal  government."    This official further said: As for the Khmer Rouge, if we do  not outlaw them, they will not soften their attitude or make  concessions to the royal government. If the Khmer Rouge are  left the way they are now, the royal government cannot do  anything. If they are outlawed and become rebels, they might  perhaps show some flexibility or even be willing to negotiate  with the royal government.    Concerning the issue of outlawing the Khmer Rouge, it was  recently rumored that some officials in the royal government do  not agree with the view of the leaders of the royal government  and of the National Assembly.    The same official affirmed that "what is important and  constitutes the key for the royal government at present is that  the royal government wants complete unity within the cabinet ...  [ellipsis as published] within the royal government in order to  continue its work to outlaw the Khmer Rouge, because what the  government is doing now is in accordance with the constitution,  in response to the aspiration of citizens, and in harmony with  its mandate.    This official further said that, legally, in any government,  even a coalition government, officials in the cabinet who do not  follow the policy of the prime minister or the royal government  can be considered as the government's opponents. Legally, these  officials should resign, or the prime minister should remove  them from their posts or dismiss them so that the implementation  of government policy is not hindered.    The same government official further affirmed that "in the  future the royal government will reshuffle positions in a number  of ministries; ministers will not be dismissed, but their  positions will be switched. For example, some officials will be  removed from the Interior Ministry and transferred to the  Foreign Affairs Ministry, or removed from the latter to other  ministries... [ellipsis as published] because for these  officials the probation period has ended.    However, this official did not elaborate on the reshuffle,  on  the personalities affected, or when this will be carried out.</p>

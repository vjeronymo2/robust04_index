This proposal would require an inspection to verify the integrity of the shield grounds for the cable harness of the electronic engine control (EEC), and correction of any discrepancy. This proposal also would require measurement of the electrical resistance of certain shield grounds, and repair, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by a report of an engine flameout after a lightning strike, due to several shields for the cable harness of the EEC not being properly grounded to the airframe. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent engine flameout due to insufficient protection of the EEC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by October 31, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;127&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

That AD requires revising the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to prohibit takeoff, landing, and climb in the vicinity of lightning or thunderstorms; and to require continuous ignition operation during takeoffs, takeoff climb to 1500 feet above ground level, final approach, and landing within 5 nautical miles of lightning and thunderstorms. That AD also requires the installation of four modifications designed to protect the electronic engine control (EEC) from the effects of lightning strike, which, when accomplished, terminates the requirements of that AD and allows for the removal of the AFM limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since issuance of that AD, Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, has advised the FAA of a report of an engine flameout after a lightning strike on a Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplane. Modifications required by AD 85&hyph;14&hyph;51 R2 had been accomplished on that airplane. Investigation revealed that the engine flameout occurred because several shields for the cable harness of the EEC were not properly grounded to the airframe. This condition, if not corrected, could result in insufficient protection of the EEC and may lead to an engine flameout following a lightning strike.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bombardier has issued Service Bulletins S.B. 8&hyph;73&hyph;18 (for Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 series airplanes) and S.B. 8&hyph;73&hyph;19 (for Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes), both dated April 29, 1994, which describe procedures for a visual inspection to verify the integrity of the shield grounds for the cable harness of the EEC, and correction of any discrepancy. The service bulletins also describe procedures for measurement of the electrical resistance of certain shield grounds, and repair, if necessary. The repair procedures consist of ensuring that the metal overbraid (which provides lightning protection for the EEC cable harness) is electrically bonded to the connector and the electrical receptacles are electrically bonded to the airframe. Transport Canada Aviation classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;94&hyph;09, dated May 5, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a visual inspection to verify the integrity of the shield grounds for the cable harness of the EEC, and correction of any discrepancy. This AD also would require measurement of the electrical resistance of certain shield grounds, and repair, if necessary. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The largest opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) agreed Tuesday night to take a  formal decision Wednesday on the submission of a no-confidence  motion against the coalition government of Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata, party officials said.    Under the accord reached by LDP head Yohei Kono and other  leaders, the party will hold a series of leadership meetings to  authorize the motion, which it hopes will be joined by the  second largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP).    The accord came amid a flurry of strategic talks held  separately by the SDP, which quit the governing alliance in  April, and coalition parties seeking to lure the SDP back into  the fold.</p>

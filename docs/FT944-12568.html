			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sharpening of public scrutiny is vital Sir, The Fundamental Expenditure Review of the Treasury has inevitably generated widespread debate. As ex-Treasury micro-economists now working as economic consultants in the private sector, we strongly endorse your concerns (Leader, October 20) about the implications for public expenditure control. In essence, there are two ways of effectively controlling public expenditure. The first is the traditional British way in which a central agency (the Treasury) controls all aspects of public expenditure by active and detailed monitoring and control over the composition, as well as the volume, of all public spending programmes. The second way is to decentralise, setting overall financial targets but opting out of monitoring the composition of expenditure. This requires setting and enforcing hard budget constraints on all public sector bodies. Those that cannot cover their costs from the revenues allocated from the centre then have either to cut back their activities, to increase revenues, or to borrow on capital markets without central government guarantees. This is the model on which states and local authorities operate in the US and the Lander operate in Germany. As a relatively centralised, unitary country, Britain has consistently opted for the former model and the Treasury has traditionally been its strongest advocate. The Fundamental Review, however, marks a significant shift towards the decentralised model. The main worry must be that devolving responsibilities as proposed will not, in practice, be accompanied by an effective hardening of budget constraints on government departments, agencies and quangos. Your leader is also right to point to the Treasury's role in dealing with departmental advocacy of vested interests. Your recent article ('Helicopter makers in a spin', October 6) on important forthcoming defence procurement decisions, demonstrated the pressures that powerful industrial groups can wield. The Treasury has played an important role in forcing proper examination of the economic choices underlying such decisions. It would be a big loss if the proposed Treasury functional and staff cutbacks led to a reduction in the power of the appraisal process and an increase in the influence of 'do-it-yourself' economics. As the chancellor has accepted the review as the basis for action, the key question is how to ensure that these potential dangers are minimised. The answer must involve increased public scrutiny. In particular, the role of systematic evaluation becomes even more important in the new system, both in assessing the economic effectiveness of programmes and in comparing outcomes against their objectives. Progress in public scrutiny will be a big factor in determining how far private sector financial disciplines can be applied to the public sector, including the decentralised bodies developing in areas such as health and education.

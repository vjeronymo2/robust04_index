			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Syndicated Loans: Local authorities turn to commercial banks UK LOCAL authorities are not exactly flavour of the month with the banking community. Since the swaps fiasco - when the House of Lords ruled that authorities were acting outside their legal powers in entering swap agreements, and were not obliged to meet their losses - many foreign banks will no longer do business with them, leading to wider lending margins for the banks. There has been something of a renaissance of commercial lending to local authorities recently. One reason has been the growing number of out-of-court settlements between banks and authorities over swap agreements. A second reason is the growing dependence of authorities on commercial finance. For most of the past decade, the Public Works Loans Board - a central government-funded agency - has grown in importance as a provider of finance to authorities. Ten years ago, it had lent exactly a third of total outstanding long-term debt owed by the authorities. That proportion shot up during the 1980s, reaching an estimated 79 per cent of the Pounds 61bn long-term debt at the end of March 1991. During that period, commercial lenders reduced their exposure from Pounds 28bn to around Pounds 13bn. The main reason for this was the preferential terms offered by the PWLB. With central government finances in a strong position, leading to a net repayment of public sector debt, it made sense to fund local authority borrowing centrally. The sharp reversal into deficit, and the hefty government borrowing now projected has changed that picture. The PWLB has been making itself less attractive as a source of finance. Its interest rates are close to those on commercial lending and it is likely to become more a lender of last resort to authorities, rather than the main source of finance. There could also be political reasons for such a step: PWLB lending shows up in the official public sector borrowing requirement. External borrowing by authorities may not, if it is for revenue rather than capital purposes. With the PWLB making new advances of Pounds 3.6bn in 1990/91, and nearly Pounds 8bn the year before, the sums are insignificant. Much of the syndicated commercial lending made to local authorities during the mid-1980s is coming up for renewal over the next three years. These arrangements are not strictly classified as 'borrowing', since they were structured to get around centrally-set borrowing limits. Known as 'deferred purchase' arrangements, these off-balance sheet deals became a cause celebre in the 1980s, as authorities entered sale and leaseback arrangements on assets. Most deferred purchase schemes look set to be renewed in their current form, if only because to restructure them would bring them into the borrowing net, reducing the capacity of authorities to borrow elsewhere. All of this points to a growing dependence on commercial banks. Several bankers comment that short-term borrowing by authorities has picked up recently, with a healthy two-way business being done through money-brokers. The costs have risen, though. The margin over Libor on five-year lending to local authorities is put at around 50 basis points - or half a percentage point. For the off-balance sheet schemes, the margin is more like 70 basis points, reflecting the complex structuring involved. That is close to what many companies pay. The authorities, though, are regarded as sovereign credits, with a capital weighting to match: banks need to set aside only 0.2 per cent of the capital they would have to provide for a straight corporate credit. Local authority lending does not come with an explicit guarantee from central government, but the banks take a charge over the future tax receipts of the authorities concerned. Some authorities complain this is a 'penal' rate, set to punish them for the swaps losses. But if a new commercial market does develop for local authority finance, that penalty is unlikely to last.</p>

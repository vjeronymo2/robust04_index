			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Power plan aims for stable prices ELECTRICITY prices would become less variable from year to year and might fall under 'system support' proposals announced yesterday by National Grid, manager of the electricity system in England and Wales. National Grid wants to set up a series of hedging contracts with the generators and regional electricity companies that would stabilise the 'uplift' payments made by Recs - and indirectly by customers - to ensure that electricity demands are met. Uplift charges are a mark-up added to the price of electricity to pay for the administration and running of the pool in which it is traded. They accounted for Pounds 475m, or 3 per cent of electricity prices, last year. Their unpredictability is one reason why bills to customers have been adjusted retrospectively in recent years. National Grid's proposals follow a report by Offer, the electricity industry regulator, which ordered a review of the way the grid pays for electricity from some power stations. Offer identified 14 power stations that made Pounds 200m in extra profits in the year to end March 1992, a 70 per cent increase on the previous year. In the electricity pool system, power stations bid a price and National Grid calls in the cheapest plants. To keep electricity flowing in certain areas at times of peak demand, other plants are occasionally required, even if they are not the cheapest available. Those plants often levy high charges, contributing to uplift. National Grid admits that it has no profit incentive to reduce uplift costs. It suggests that from April it should set up a service under which regional electricity companies would pay a fixed amount for expected uplift charges. In turn, it could sign a series of contracts with generators. There would be incentives for the generators to perform according to the grid's instructions, in place of the present looser arrangements. National Grid would make profits or losses on the service, although they would be capped in the contracts. It would thus have an incentive to reduce uplift, by, for instance, managing the load through contracts with large customers, or through improving the transmission system. Mr Tony White, National Grid head of transmission business development, said expensive plant would be used less, potentially reducing charges.</p>

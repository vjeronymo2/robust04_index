			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BEATHARD REJECTS CHARGERS' OFFER  </P> <P> Former Washington Redskins General Manager Bobby Beathard was offered a job  with the San Diego Chargers last week but turned the offer down, the San Diego  Union said today.  </P> <P> Beathard, who will work for NBC as a football analyst this fall, resigned from  the Redskins earlier this year and moved to the San Diego County beach  community of Leucadia. Beathard has described his move as a break from  football, sparking speculation that he would someday become an executive for  the Chargers.  </P> <P> "I shouldn't say several, but a few teams -- four or so -- have called,"  Beathard told the newspaper. "My mood was pretty much the same concerning all  of those calls. Being in the National Football League is exciting. It's fun.  But it's not what I'm looking for right now."  </P> <P> Chargers owner Alex Spanos said he offered Beathard a position last week but  that the specifics of the job were not outlined. He told the Union that  Beathard would have been working with Steve Ortmayer, director of football  operations.  </P></p>

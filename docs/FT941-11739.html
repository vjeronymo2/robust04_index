			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Tobacco company sues city for ban on smoking Philip Morris, the tobacco group, has filed suit against the city of San Francisco to overturn a tough anti-smoking ordinance that went into effect this week. The action is the first such legal challenge by the tobacco industry to local smoking restrictions, which are becoming widespread in California. In San Francisco, smoking is now banned in almost all workplaces. Restaurants will become 'smoke free' at the beginning of next year and at least 35 per cent of hotel rooms must now be 'non-smoking'. Smoking is also prohibited in outdoor sports arenas, including Candlestick Park, home of the 49ers football team. San Francisco's anti-smoking rules are being matched in towns and cities throughout the state. 'California is approaching smoking with a prohibitionistic fervour unlike any other state in the nation,' said Mr Tom Lauria of the Tobacco Institute. Close to 100 communities now ban smoking entirely in restaurants, workplaces or both. San Francisco bar and hotel owners who fear that restrictions may damage their businesses have joined Philip Morris in challenging the city's anti-smoking rules. Their lawsuit charges the city has overstepped its powers by enacting regulations that pre-empt state workplace safety laws. 'If every local government took it upon itself to issue varying workplace regulations,' said Mr Jeffrey Tanenbaum, a San Francisco attorney representing the plaintiffs, 'it would be impossible to do business in this nation.' Mr Steve Parrish, senior vice-president and general counsel for Philip Morris, said it 'believes the common sense solution to this issue is to provide separate sections for smokers and non-smokers'.</p>

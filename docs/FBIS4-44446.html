			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Zhuoyuan (1728 0587 0337): "Status of </F> Closely Monitoring Inflation and Prices Rises in 1994"]    [Text] What is the status of prices in 1994? This is a  question which has people very concerned.    With the rapid economic growth of 1992 and 1993, the level  of  prices has steadily risen as well. In 1993, the retail sales  price index rose about 13 percent, wile the cost of living index  for urban and rural residents rose about 14.5 percent (of which  12 percent were new price inflation factors). The economy is  maintaining its rapid growth trend in 1994, and with the average  economic growth estimated to be slightly over 10 percent, it  will be difficult to hold down inflation. I believe that not  only will it be hard to accomplish the goal of keeping inflation  within the 10 percent that was set at last year's National  Economic Work Conference, we should consider ourselves well off  if we can keep the 1994 inflation rate to not much more than the  13 percent of 1993. The price situation in 1994 will be quite  serious, and urgently needs close monitoring.    There are at least several factors supporting the above  estimate.    First, with so strong a trend to fixed asset investment,  there is not too much release of inflationary pressures. Because  there was very widespread 1993's fixed asset investment, with a  large increase in projects being built on too wide a scale, the  amount of investment required is very large. In addition, each  region and department is grasping all opportunities to seed  rapid development. They are full of drive to set projects and  expanding their construction scale, and this means that fixed  asset investment in 1994 will continue to be hot, and this will  be hard to control efficiently. This inevitably will sharpen an  already tight supply of capital, further expand the scale of  borrowing, put in more currency, and accelerate the pace at  which currency supply continuously exceeds the economic growth  rate. This is a situation usually unfavorable to easing  inflationary pressures. The lack of tight controls could also  possibly increase them. The inflationary pressures of the last  year have not been fully released, or are still in the process  of release, with the rate of inflation remaining high and not  going down. Therefore, the constant expansion trend of  investment in 1994 will make it very hard to control the  inflation rate efficiently.    Second, the rise in the cost of goods caused by merging the  exchange rate for Foreign Exchange Certificates (FEC) with that  of the Renminbi (RMB) will be a powerful impetus to inflation.  The merger of the FEC with the RMB at the beginning of 1994  caused a tremendous drop in the rate of exchange between the RMB  and the FEC which was originally set by the government. It  dropped from $1=5.8 yuan RMB to $1=8.7 yuan RMB, and inevitably  will cause at least some imported raw materials and consumer  products to rise in price, rapidly increase the power of costs  to push price increases. The adjustment in State officials'  wages began in October, 1993 and the adjustment of enterprise  and institutional wages it brought with it will also increase  the cost of goods, which will push prices up further. In  addition, adjustments in employees' wages will naturally  increase consumers' demand for them. This is another  inflationary factor which cannot be ignored.    Third, reform of the tax system reform will also affect  inflation. The tax system reform this time especially implements  a comprehensive value added tax. An important measure for  pushing China's tax system toward regularization, it fits the  requirements of developing the socialist market economy. We can  believe that implementing a value added tax won't add to  enterprises' general burden. But to conclude from this that it  won't push prices up is not very convincing. This is because  after the value added tax is implemented, although in general it  will not add to the burden on enterprises, different enterprises  have differing situations. Most enterprises will not have an  added tax burden, and some may even lose some, but a few  enterprises (about 28 percent of the state-owned enterprises)  really will have an added tax burden. The former category of  enterprises will not in general try to shift the burden, so  there will not be the phenomenon of prices declining due to  their losing some tax burden; the latter category of enterprises  will try everything they can to shift the added tax burden, and  it is easier to do this in a situation where there is a strong  consumption demand. International experience has proven that it  is best to choose a relatively stable economic environment for  comprehensively implementing a value added tax, for in this  situation it will be favorable to attack the causes of inflation.    Fourth, the new adjustment and releasing of prices will push  them up further. In 1994, the state will raise its grain and  cotton purchase prices, and the rising of these two basic  agricultural products will inevitably push the whole price level  upward. In 1994, the controlled price will be released on 200  million tons of coal allocations, and the price will go up on  planned medium price crude oil (about 40 million tons of planned  price oil will rise from over 200 yuan per ton to 700 yuan, and  in addition, 60 million tons of planned high price oil will rise  from 550 yuan per ton to 700 yuan, a price still lower than the  international market price). The price of electricity will also  go up, grain purchasing and sales price will also open up, etc.  These moves will no doubt push price levels up continuously. In  addition, in the second half of 1993 the level of general retail  sale prices rose obviously higher than in the first half year  (up to about 15 percent). Overconfidence is the only factor  which can affect 1994 prices rising two to three percentage  points, especially as the price index for the cost of living in  35 large and medium size cities rose 2.8 percent in November,  1993 over October, and then rose 3.2 percent in December from  November. Therefore, overconfidence is the only factor which can  affect 1994's prices rising about 5 percent.    Fifth, there are forecasts of inflation and a growing  inflationary psychology. Due to the lasting overheated economy  and a premature increase in the supply of currency, the pressure  caused by inflation will gradually increase, causing these  forecasts and the psychology of inflation. This is a factor  worth noting. Since these inflation forecasts have been  occurring, the slightest sign can send residents into panic  purchasing. It is easy for some people to take this opportunity  to raise prices, thereby disturbing market and reaping  staggering profits. Many places rushed to purchase grain in  November and December, 1993, and in some places the rush to  purchase imported home electrical appliances and gold jewelry,  etc. at the end of 1993 was explained by this. Residents'  predictions of inflation and the inflationary psychology will  form a fake consumer demand, causing some places sometimes to  twist the relationship between supply and demand. For inflation,  this is like pouring oil on the fire, so it deserve our  attention.    The year 1994 will be one of great strides forward in the  reform of China's economic system. The birth of five big reforms  involving revenue, finance, investment, foreign trade and  foreign currency and administration of state-owned assets will  cause greater adjustments in the original profit pattern, which  can easily cause social shock. In order to let reform go  smoothly, reducing the risks, we must create a very stable  economic environment for the birth of these five reforms. On  this aspect, I think, the state's macroeconomic policy is  particularly important. If the state adopts a relatively safe  macroeconomic policy, it will strengthen and improve  macroeconomic adjustment and control, appropriately suppress the  tendency of each place to battle for investments and projects,  restrain inflationary trends, and control too-rapid rises in the  general price level. It can create a better and relatively light  environment for reform, as well as keep the economy stable when  there is faster reform.    What is worth worrying about is that the state's  macroeconomic policy often suffers pressures from some  departments, localities and enterprises, which demand release of  credit, loans and money. This not only guarantees increases but  also relaxes alertness to inflation and higher prices, as well  as taking various ways to oppose or resist the state's  macroadjustment and control of cutbacks in activities. This  situation now exists. Quite a few localities and enterprises, in  order to pursue faster profits, ease financial difficulties or  employment pressures, attain greater achievements in  administration or career, are seeking more investment, higher  speed, and not admitting that their own departments, localities  and work units are operating at an excessively hot speed. This  makes it more difficult for the state to implement a safe and  healthy macroeconomic policy, and easily gives the impression  that the situation is out of control. Once control of investment  is lost, the economy will again get hot or even get hotter than  before, sharpening inflation, maintain more that 15 percent in  continuous inflation, and break through the median inflation  line, which will critically destroy economic stability. At that  time, it will be hard to achieve a soft economic landing by  means of small adjustments; rather, we will need to carry out a  hard landing by means of big adjustments, and losses will be  bigger. The development of inflation and price increases will to  a great degree critically affect how smoothly economic reform  goes, and make it increasingly risky, as well as being  unfavorable to the healthy operation of the socialist market  economy. Excessive rises in prices will first of all be  unfavorable to further price reforms: many measures to adjust  prices and ease them, things which should be done now, will have  to be postponed or canceled. This was the situation in both 1986  and 1988; it could also bring back unreasonable price  relationships. Second, it inevitably will propel the development  of opportunistic activities, disrupting the market and damaging  our building and fostering of a market system. Third, it will  inevitably widen the income gap, with a few people suddenly  getting rich by seizing every opportunity to do so, hoarding,  cornering markets, and driving up prices, while others who are  on salary or retirees' fixed income will probably find their  living standard falling, producing a mood of discontent.  Finally, it will also be hard to bring about government  macroadjustment and control, industrial policy will be difficult  to implement, and this will affect enterprises' normal  production and operations.    Generally, in order to permit the several major topics of  reform function smoothly, in order to have health development of  the domestic economy, we must pay close attention to the trend  of inflation and rising prices, implement appropriate  macroeconomic policy, and restrain inflation. These actions will  control rising prices over a wide scale, and keep the economy  stable.</p>

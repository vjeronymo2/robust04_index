			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: McCaw narrows deficit to Dollars 22.1m in second period MCCAW Cellular Commun-ications, the largest cellular telecoms company in the US, yesterday announced a narrowing in second-quarter losses to Dollars 22.1m, as net revenues from cellular operations climbed 28 per cent to Dollars 313.6m. In the same quarter a year ago, McCaw incurred a restated loss of Dollars 65.8m. The fast-growing, heavily indebted business said that cellular subscriptions continued to grow strongly in the quarter, rising 31 per cent to 2.5m by the end of June. The increase boosted cashflow 32 per cent to Dollars 189m, and was achieved in spite of a well-publicised health scare about the use of cellular phones. Mr Craig McCaw, chairman and chief executive, said that while current opportunities in the cellular business were unparalleled, there were further investments in the technology to be made. LIN Broadcasting, another cellular telecommunications company that is majority-owned by McCaw, also announced growth in cashflow and subscribers yesterday. Net revenues in the quarter rose 22 per cent to Dollars 185.4m, and cash flow from cellular operations climbed 21 per cent to Dollars 90.4m. Like McCaw, LIN carries a heavy debt load, and net losses in the quarter totalled Dollars 16.6m, up from a Dollars 12.7m loss a year ago.</p>

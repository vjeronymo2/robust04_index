			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Clear water revival in Tyne: Industry and salmon have returned to the river THE COMPLETION of one of Britain's most ambitious environmental clean-ups, the Pounds 150m transformation of the Tyne's urban reaches from open sewer to England's best salmon river, will be celebrated tomorrow. Kevin Keegan, manager of Newcastle United football club, will unveil an information panel at Newcastle Quayside about the clean-up. It will be part of a new heritage trail along the north bank of the Tyne, charting the riverside's history and changing use. The 20-year construction project - first discussed early this century - ends the discharge of untreated sewage and industrial effluent from 200 outfalls into the river's last 18 miles. When design work on the scheme began in the late 1960s, pollution was so bad that the river could be seen bubbling with gases produced by rotting waste. On warm days, the stench of the sewage then visible was nauseating. Oxygen depletion caused by the discharge of 700 gallons of raw sewage a second was so bad that stretches of the river were dead, preventing the salmon from reaching their spawning grounds upstream. Now they have returned. As traditional manufacturing has declined, the cleaner Tyne has made new uses possible for riverside sites, including private housing and offices inconceivable 20 years ago. Without the scheme, the Pounds 500m of public and private investment so far attracted by the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation would not have been possible, according to Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive. The investment includes an upmarket Pounds 21m hotel, the Copthorne in Newcastle; the Pounds 27m St Peters Basin development, mostly of private housing by Barratts, and the Pounds 140m Newcastle Business Park - last year named Britain's most outstanding urban renewal project by the Institute of Chartered Surveyors. Mr Paul Cheesmond, a director of consulting engineers Merz and McLellan, one of the occupants of the business park, remembers as a schoolboy 30 years ago seeing the Tyne black and dirty. The change has been dramatic. 'My office window looks out on the river. It's far more picturesque than I ever imagined it could be,' he says. 'You can see water-skiers and birds.' He adds: 'It encapsulates some of the changes which have taken place over the last 20 years. Everybody is upset about the shipyards but this is one of the positive aspects.' The interceptor sewers, which divert sewage from the old outfalls, run parallel to the Tyne. Most were tunnelled under Tyneside, up to 120 feet deep; the rest lie in covered trenches. The network, handling waste from 900,000 people, feeds into a treatment works at Howdon, Wallsend. The clean-up began when Tyneside's local councils created the Tyneside Joint Sewerage Board in the 1960s. Responsibility later passed to Northumbrian Water. In spite of the big improvement in the quality of the river water, Northumbrian Water has more to do. At present sewage sludge treated at Howdon is dumped six miles out at sea. Liquid effluent from the plant is discharged into the Tyne's lower reaches where tidal action sweeps it out to sea. New legislation means these practices must end in the next few years. But, says Mr Bob McMillan, group design manager of Northumbrian Water, 'we've come a hell of a long way'.</p>

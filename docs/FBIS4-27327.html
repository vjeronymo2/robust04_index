			<p>BFN     [Text] During the 27 May session of the lower house budget  committee Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, touching on the issue of  how Japan would cope if an emergency developed over the DPRK's  (North Korea's) nuclear ambitions, said: "Generally speaking,  the government will take adequate measures."    At the same session Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa referred  to the government's preparatory work for emergency legislation  to join possible sanctions against North Korea.    Kakizawa said: "Each section concerned is studying all  possibilities, including legislative measures."    The two senior government members made their remarks in  reply  to questions by Representative Nobutaka Machimura (of the  Liberal Democratic Party).    Responding to a question asking what Japan would do if  multinational forces were organized over the North Korean issue  in addition to any UN actions, Kakizawa said the government's  policy would be to offer all possible cooperation.    "It would be difficult for Japan in various ways, but Japan  must do everything it can," he said.    When Hata was asked about future direction of Japan's  defense  buildup policy, he said: "While some positive signs have been  seen since the end of the Cold War, Japan is still surrounded by  regional tensions. We must map out future policies taking these  into account."    Hata said he would make a careful decision on a revision of  the "National Defense Program Outline" in view of the debates at  the advisory Defense Issues Council.    He said: "We are not presupposing troop reduction [of the  Self- Defense Forces]. Rather, we must determine our future  course of action by paying sufficient attention to present  circumstances."</p>

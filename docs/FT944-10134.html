			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Zimbabwe farm seizure allowed Three white Zimbabwean farmers whose land was earmarked by the state for forcible seizure for resettling landless blacks have lost a High Court case to stop the government acquiring their farms, Reuter reports from Harare. In a judgment made available to reporters yesterday, Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku ruled that a 1992 law giving the state sweeping powers to seize farms for resettlement did not violate Zimbabwe's constitution. In his 22-page ruling, Justice Chidyausiku said: 'The constitution recognises and codifies the state's right to compulsorily acquire property, and indeed elevates the individual's entitlement to compensation for compulsory acquisition to the level of a fundamental right.' The farmers - Alistair Clothered Davis, Michael Anthony Clark and Erna Rhodena McClean - had argued that since the state offered no compensation when it designated land for seizure, and only compensated on transfer, the concept of earmarking land contradicted the constitution. But the court upheld the state's submission that it was exercising its regulatory powers of earmarking land pending future acquisition. Zimbabwe's population of 10m includes 100,000 whites.</p>

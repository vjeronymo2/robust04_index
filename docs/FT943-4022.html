			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Books: Killers with literary aspirations - Fiction DAN LENO AND THE LIMEHOUSE GOLEM by Peter Ackroyd Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 282 pages FELICIA'S JOURNEY by William Trevor Viking Pounds 15, 213 pages The serial killer is rapidly becoming a new folk hero, a debased Robin Hood for the fin-de-siecle. Popular culture got there first, with the American thriller writer Thomas Harris cleverly exploiting the notion that it takes one evil genius to catch another. The serial killer has entered the echelons of literary fiction, popping up in Peter Ackroyd's novel, Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem, and more unexpectedly in Felicia's Journey by William Trevor. Ackroyd's story is a deliberate shocker, as vulgar as the Victorian music halls which he evokes with apparently effortless skill. Trevor's offering is shabby genteel, set in a contemporary Britain which eludes him so completely that the novel seems to be composed only in shades of grey. Felicia is a typical Trevor creation, a naive Irish girl whose credulity tries the reader's patience. Trapped in a household which is itself mired in the past, embodied by a bed-ridden greatgrandmother, Felicia runs away to the English midlands in search of a man who has made her pregnant. All she knows is his name, Johnny Lysaght, and his claim that he works in a lawnmower factory. Felicia's story is interwoven with that of Mr Hilditch, an obese catering manager who lives alone in his dead mother's house. Mr Hilditch, whose appearances in the novel are marked by lists of food, is an undetected serial killer whose victims also come in lists: Beth, Jakki, Sharon, Bobbi, Elsie and Gaye. Mr Hilditch fixes on the destitute and desperate Felicia as his next victim. What is so troubling about Felicia's Journey is not the banality of its characters; serial killers often lead unhappy but otherwise unremarkable lives, as do their victims. Its fault is transparency, a painful sense of the novelist's imagination at work, struggling to convey characters whose feelings elude him. Hence the lists, a device which seems intended to reveal personality but in the end substitutes for it. Trevor's fiction has increasingly moved in this direction, possibly because the products of his imagination belong in the past and cannot comfortably inhabit contemporary life. His fey Irish heroines are decades out of date and in Felicia's Journey he falls back on repeating himself, introducing a sub-plot and a set of minor characters uncomfortably similar to those in his 1971 novel Miss Gomez and the Brethren. Where Felicia's Journey leaves an impression of surfaces barely touched, Peter Ackroyd's new novel is a pyrotechnic display which delights in tricking the reader into conflicting emotional responses. Its apparently sombre opening, the hanging in Camberwell prison in 1881 of a woman convicted of her husband's murder, is immediately undercut by a macabre, pantomime detail: the prison governor takes home the dead woman's gown and dresses up in it, presumably to aid masturbation. Ackroyd's plot centres on a series of bizarre and brutal murders in the East End of London, culminating in the slaughter of a family in the Ratcliffe Highway. These final murders take place in the very house where, in 1812, the real-life Marr family was attacked and killed. Ackroyd's sly mixing of fact and fiction has an extra dimension if the reader knows that the Ratcliffe Highway murders were the subject of a true crime book co-authored by the novelist P D James. Ackroyd's novel is brilliantly ventriloquial, taking the form of diaries, court transcripts and fragments of autobiography. It is a performance in the best sense of the word, an imagination so excited by its own confidence that it dares go to the very limits. Ackroyd also understands a crucial point about the serial killer in fiction, which is that in this genre Grand Guignol works better than gritty realism. Dan Leno and the Limehouse Golem pokes fun at the stuffier conventions of the crime novel and creates a murderer as mad, and bad, and as unlike real life, as Harris's Hannibal Lecter.</p>

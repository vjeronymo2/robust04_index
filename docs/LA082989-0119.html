			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MURAL TO TRAINMAN IS A LITTLE OFF THE BEATEN TRACK  </P> <P> When one of the largest, most colorful pieces of public art ever commissioned  in the city makes its official debut Wednesday, viewers may have trouble  finding it.  </P> <P> The 100-foot-long, 40-foot-high mural, titled "Train of Wisdom," is hidden on  the back side of Mission Federal Credit Union, at Park and El Cajon boulevards.  </P> <P> Despite its grand proportions, the mural's brilliant colors and powerful,  futuristic images of children floating along on a surreal train pumping clouds  of bright purple steam can be seen only if you happen to wander around the  building's corner.  </P> <P> That fact does little to diminish the excitement of San Diego muralist Mario  Torero for the project he designed and executed this summer with the help of 12  art students from city schools.  </P> <P> "It was just another building like all the other hundreds of buildings we see  every day," said Torero, 42, widely known for his murals in Chicano Park. "Now  people are noticing this wall because of the art that is on it."  </P> <P> The mural is the final phase of a project honoring a San Diego institution by  the name of Frank the Trainman. For 40 years, Frank Cox sold and repaired model  trains out of a grubby little store in the building. Ten years ago, he passed  his business on to friend and fellow train buff Jim Cooley. When Cooley sold  the property to Mission Federal Credit Union in 1987, he asked the new owners  to create a monument to Frank the Trainman, who died early this year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Different, All Right  </P> <P> Cooley, a self-acknowledged old-timer, hems and haws when asked what he thinks  of Torero's unorthodox artwork.  </P> <P> "I'm really not of this modern generation, so it's a little hard for me to  identify with it," Cooley said. "But, from what I understand, it's well done.  It's different, I'll say that. It's a form of art that I don't understand, but  that doesn't mean it's not good."  </P> <P> To complete the memorial, $20,000 worth of Cox's antique model trains have been  mounted in the branch office of the credit union, and an animated neon sign  that once beckoned customers to the shop was refurbished and remounted outside.  The  </P> <P> architectural firm of Bradshaw &amp; Bundy reshaped the building's stucco  exterior into the stylistic outline of a locomotive.  </P> <P> The back wall of the building was left windowless to create a smooth space for  a huge mural, the final phase of the project, which was requested by Cox before  he agreed to sell the property about two years ago.  </P> <P> When Torero was selected to paint the mural, he had no idea the building was  shaped like a train. He visited the site, drew renderings of its big, blank  wall, and took them to art students -- at O'Farrell High School of Performing  Arts and Roosevelt Junior High School -- who had been assigned to help create  the mural.  </P> <P> The students drew pyramids and children and sun rays, all of which Torero  incorporated into his final rendering. But one student outlined a train for the  back of the building, and, when the other kids saw it, they loved the idea,  with its big cow catcher of green and white stripes. Torero then realized that  the building was conveniently shaped like a locomotive.  </P> <P> The mural changed during the two months that Torero and his young staff worked  on it. At one point, they realized it needed a stronger tie to San Diego, and  they painted a vivid blue Coronado Bridge. The sun they had planned became a  sunflower to incorporate nature into the mural, and the wheels of the train  float through clouds to symbolize a journey of the imagination, Torero said.  </P> <P> Now that the mural is finished, the artist wants to make sure the community  knows it's there. He hopes to create a small public park on adjoining land. The  park could prove as surreal as the mural overlooking it. Torero wants to place  two plastic cows near the street to catch the attention of motorists.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seats in a Station  </P> <P> He's asked another artist to design colored cement benches, which he will  arrange to look like seats in a train station. Torero hopes a walkway from the  sidewalk along Park Boulevard that leads to the mural will draw passers-by. An  abstract sign similar to 12 others designed by artist Robert Salas and  installed along Park Boulevard near the zoo may also help point the way.  </P> <P> Torero's plans require the approval of city school officials, who own the land  next to the credit union.  </P> <P> If that happens, the enclave might become not only a monument to Frank the  Trainman, but uptown's first and only train station.  </P> <P> The mural will be dedicated at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday at Mission Federal Credit  Union, City Schools Branch, 4304 Park Blvd.  </P></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / BNL case reversal may embarrass Bush THE US court case over Dollars 5bn of illegal Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) took an unexpected turn yesterday when lawyers for the former branch manager of BNL Atlanta said he wished to withdraw his guilty plea and face a full-scale trial instead. The court, which was supposed to be considering a prison sentence for Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL manager, was told that he had been pressed by government prosecutors to support their theory that he was the sole orchestrator of the Iraqi loans scandal. More than Dollars 2bn of the BNL loans helped to finance Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical and ballistic weapons projects. The reason for changing Mr Drogoul's plea from guilty to innocent, it was argued, was fresh evidence indicating that he had acted with the approval of BNL's management in Rome and with the knowledge of the US government. BNL has denied that it was aware of the Iraqi loans, and the US prosecutors have argued that Mr Drogoul defrauded BNL. But defence lawyers have cited evidence to the contrary, including a 1991 CIA report, disclosed in the US Congress this week, which states that BNL officials in Rome knew of the Iraqi loans and even signed some of them. Judge Marvin Shoob, who has already said he does not believe Mr Drogoul acted alone, announced he would rule on the plea motion next Tuesday in Atlanta. The Bush administration could face serious embarrassment if the judge were to decide to order a full BNL trial. Federal prosecutors said they were inclined to oppose the request and the judge, after first saying he was unlikely to grant the motion, then said: 'Candidly I don't know what I am going to do. The defence may have good reasons for changing the plea.' Mr Bobby Lee Cook, the prominent Georgia lawyer defending Mr Drogoul, told the FT he would argue that the BNL manager was carrying out the policies of BNL, with acquiescence and permission from BNL in Rome. 'Mr Drogoul was also facilitating the well-known policy of the American government in supplying arms, technology and other materiel to Iraq. He believed that the government of the United States knew precisely what was happening and did not object because it was consonant with their policy at that time,' the lawyer said. In court yesterday, Mr Cook named a former US intelligence agent as one of the key intermediaries in the BNL Atlanta Iraqi loan programme. 'It is obvious from this hearing that the government has not been forthright or honest,' Mr Cook claimed. 'The government would have the court and the public believe this entire affair was designed and orchestrated by a young branch manager, without any knowledge or approval from Rome. That position offends logic and also turns the facts upside-down. 'It is an effort on behalf of the administration to rewrite and to reconstitute history, and to hide and suppress from the court and from the people the devastating and catastrophic blunders that our government made in arming and supporting Saddam Hussein,' Mr Cook said.</p>

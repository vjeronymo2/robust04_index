			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- The Federal Government has rejected  allegations by Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin that  Germany is "indirectly encouraging terrorism" with the  preliminary stop of weapons supplies. Bonn is prepared to lift  the delivery stop if these weapons are really used in accordance  with the NATO rules in Turkey.    Cetin's criticism is "not right," government spokesman Vogel  stated at a news conference in Bonn today. It is clear that the  government is not biased. The Workers Party of Kurdistan has  been banned in Germany, and there are efforts to adopt tighter  rules concerning the deportation of Kurdish rebels. Vogel  quoted Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who stated in an ARD interview  that he will not bow to the terror of any group in the streets  of Germany.</p>

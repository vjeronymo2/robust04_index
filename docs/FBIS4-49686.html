			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 10 (AFP)--China reacted angrily  Tuesday to suggestions by Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the  Dalai Lama, that he might hold a referendum on Tibet's future if  Beijing ignores his moderate approach. "The so-called  referendum suggested by the Dalai Lama is yet another trick for  his splitting activities," a foreign ministry spokesman said.  "The question of holding a referendum on the future of Tibet  does not exist," he added.    The Dalai Lama raised the possibility of a referendum  earlier  this week, saying 14 years of talks with the Chinese had made no  progress. "I may have no choice but to go in for a referendum  of Tibetans, both inside Tibet and those outside, for them to  discuss their options," the Nobel peace laureate said.    The foreign ministry spokesman reiterated that Tibet was "an  inalienable part of China" and warned against any action that  could undermine Chinese sovereignty over the Himalayan region.  "Any attempt aimed at splitting Tibet from China will meet with  firm oppostion from the Chinese people, including Tibetans," he  said.    Chinese troops took control of Tibet in 1959.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Democratic </F> Republic of Yemen Defense Ministry"; place and date not given]    [Text] Early this morning some of the peaceful populated  suburbs of Aden were subjected to barbarous and random attacks  by artillery and rockets from the forces of the ruling military  regime in Sanaa. The shelling was accompanied by desperate  attacking attempts from the same forces to advance on all  fronts. However, our brave armed forces intercepted these  forces, and inflicted crushing blows on them. They also  inflicted heavy human and material losses on them, and forced  them to withdraw.</p>

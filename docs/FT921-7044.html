			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: First-half drop for Murdoch's NZ unit ADVERTISING revenue of the New Zealand, Australia and US publications of Wellington-based Independent Newspapers (INL) was hit by recession, leading to a 9.7 per cent fall in first-half net profits to NZDollars 16.4m (USDollars 8.9m). Mr Alan Burnet, chairman, said the result was satisfactory considering the depressed economic conditions in the countries where the group owns newspapers. INL is 51 per cent owned by News Corporation, the media group controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch. Advertising revenues fell 7.1 per cent in New Zealand and 10.7 per cent in Australia compared with the same period of 1990. Mr Burnet said the group experienced some recovery, especially in its South Island New Zealand newspapers. Interest costs would fall for the year after NZDollars 14.24m of debt was repaid. The closure of the loss-making Auckland Star during the period, plus static newspaper prices was expected to mean that the full-year result would show considerable improvement. Satisfactory results were achieved by Gordon and Gotch, the subsidiary which is the largest newspaper and magazine distributor in Australasia. Circulation of the paid newspapers had been stable, with the Christchurch Press and the Waikato Times showing significant gains. Sales rose 14.9 per cent to NZDollars 471.39m from NZDollars 410.3m. Pre-tax profits fell 8.6 per cent to NZDollars 26.11m. Tax took NZDollars 9.83m against NZDollars 10.37m. A maintained 7 cents a share dividend was declared.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japan zinc project is abandoned Plans for a ADollars 500m (USDollars 370m) zinc smelter and refinery in Japan have been abandoned, Reuter reports from Brisbane and Tokyo. The smelter was to have been built at Hachinohe, in north-east Honshu, using the Imperial smelting process, developed in Australia, to produce 120,000 tonnes of zinc and 60,000 tonnes of lead a year. The three partners in the so-called Pacific Zinc project are Nippon Mining, with 50 per cent, MIM, the Australian group, 40 per cent, and Mitsui Mining. In August last year the partners decided to defer the project because of a change in circumstances surrounding the Japan smelting industry, including a rapid appreciation of the yen and low zinc and lead prices. MIM said yesterday they now believed that more favourable circumstances were unlikely and that the project should be abandoned and the partnership dissolved. When the project was planned in 1991, the US dollar traded at about 140 yen. The dollar is at present hovering around 100 yen. Slumps in metal prices were another factor, industry sources said.  ----------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ----------------------------------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium                -9,875             to 2,502,225 Aluminium alloy            -100             to 26,540 Copper                   +2,150             to 342,700 Lead                     +1,925             to 362,700 Nickel                   +1,518             to 135,660 Zinc                     +2,900             to 1,218,600 Tin                         -45             to 30,965  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

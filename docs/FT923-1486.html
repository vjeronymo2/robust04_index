			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Increase in people living alone SINGLE people living on their own account for more than a quarter of households in Britain, according to official figures released today, John Willman writes. The 1991 General Household Survey also shows that almost two thirds of women with dependent children are in work or seeking work and 70 per cent of parents with children under five use some form of childcare. The figures are among preliminary results published today by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. The survey, the most authoritative guide to households in Great Britain, is based on interviews with 19,229 adults in 9,955 households. The size of the average household in Great Britain has decreased from 2.91 in 1971 to 2.48 last year. That has been caused largely by more single-person households, up from 17 per cent in 1971 to 26 per cent last year. General Household Survey: preliminary results for 1991. OPCS Monitor SS 92/1.

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAR DEALER PENALIZED IN SALE OF USED 'NEW' AUTOS  </P> <P> A Thousand Oaks car dealership has been fined $46,000 and will be shut down for  two days next month for failing to tell customers their "new" cars had actually  been used for driver education classes by the Conejo Valley Unified School  District, authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The action against Shaver Pontiac follows a two-year probe that began when one  customer, a private detective, grew suspicious about his car's problems. He  discovered through a check of Department of Motor Vehicles records that the car  had once been registered to the school district, according to the Ventura  County district attorney's office and the man's attorney.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara attorney Robert L. Monk said that, like the other victims, the  buyer had been told that the car showed thousands of miles on its odometer  because it was a "demonstrator," used to give test drives and driven by  employees of the dealership.  </P> <P> "It's embarrassing to feel like you've been had," said Monk, who has filed five  lawsuits against the dealership on behalf of five customers who allege they  were lied to about their cars' histories.  </P> <P> Lawrence Silver, an attorney for Shaver Pontiac, said that "one of the  unfortunate consequences of this has been to discourage Shaver and other  dealers from providing these cars to school districts." He declined to comment  further.  </P> <P> A suspension of its operating and sales license will close the dealership Nov.  25 and 26 as part of its penalties, said William Gengler, a spokesman for the  Department of Motor Vehicles.  </P> <P> The DMV found the dealership failed to inform at least five customers that the  cars they were purchasing had been used by the school district. The DMV gave  Shaver Pontiac the choice of having its license suspended for five days, or  facing a two-day suspension plus $20,000 in fines, said Gengler. The dealership  chose the latter punishment. The DMV also fined Shaver Pontiac nearly $6,000 to  cover investigation expenses, he said.  </P> <P> The dealership also was ordered to pay $20,000 in civil penalties as part of an  out-of-court settlement with the Ventura County district attorney's office,  which had filed a consumer-protection lawsuit against the auto dealer.  </P> <P> The dealership admitted no wrongdoing in its settlement. Deputy Dist. Atty.  Linda S. Groberg said criminal charges were not pursued because of the  difficulty in proving that the dealership and its salesmen intended to defraud  customers.  </P> <P> But a Simi Valley woman who also sued Shaver Pontiac said she was angered by  the decision.  </P> <P> "The only way I can get my restitution is through my own private lawsuit," said  Jennifer Tarara. "I don't think our justice system is working very well if they  can defraud people like this . . . and have it not be viewed as a criminal  matter."  </P> <P> Tarara said she paid about $15,000 for a 1986 Grand Am and learned only last  April, after many repairs and arguments with the dealership, that it had been  used in driver education classes. She said the DMV contacted her during its  investigation.  </P></p>

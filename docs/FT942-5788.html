			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (6): Emu hinges on political will  -Contrary to expectations, the EMS has been remarkably calm Central bankers, in the words of William McChesney Martin, a distinguished former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, are the people who 'take away the punchbowl just as the party is getting merry'. Last summer, central bankers and finance ministers from the 12 European Union countries took away the biggest ever punchbowl from the global foreign exchange markets. In the early hours of Monday, August 2, 1993, they widened the fluctuation margins in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System to 15 per cent either side of the EMS bilateral central rates from 2.25 per cent and 6 per cent previously. That decision followed a year of crisis in the EMS that had seen sterling and the Italian lira leave the system and numerous devaluations of other member currencies. As the officials left Brussels after their difficult emergency meeting that weekend, few observers were prepared to bet that the EMS had much of a future. The new margins were so wide that they almost constituted a free float. It was generally expected that most of the currencies linked to the D-Mark through the ERM would depreciate sharply. With the EMS in apparent disarray, the European Union's ambitious plans for economic and monetary union by 1997 at the earliest, and failing that, by 1999, also seemed doomed to fail. But contrary to expectations, the EMS has been remarkably calm for most of the past 10 months. France and the other core members of the ERM resisted the temptation to follow the UK example of slashing interest rates and allowing a depreciation of their currencies against the D-Mark. After an initial weakening, virtue was rewarded with the gradual return of the French franc and other core currencies to levels that were either within or close to the old intervention floors against the D-Mark. Although the ERM is no longer perceived as a 'glide path' to Emu, the return of calm to continental exchanges has revived interest in Emu. Few expect Europe will have a single currency and central bank by the earliest deadline of the Maastricht Treaty, but the prospect of Emu by the end of the century is no longer laughed out of court. Stage two of the Maastricht process has been under way since the beginning of this year. This involves intensified co-operation on economic policy-making among the 12 through the council of economics and finance ministers. In addition, the European Monetary Institute, which may be the embryo of the planned European central bank, began operating at the beginning of this year and is engaged on technical preparations for the third and final stage of Emu. However, the obstacles to Emu are still formidable. At a practical level, the EU has done little to ensure that bank notes, coinage or payments systems will be adapted in time for the proposed introduction of a single currency. Politically, both the UK and Denmark have secured the right not to join Emu. Economically, only Luxembourg of the 12 EU members at present meets the tough convergence criteria that the Maastricht treaty sets as a condition for entry to stage 3. Of the criteria, the targets of low inflation and low long-term interest rates appear relatively unproblematical for most member states. Because policy makers generally agree that it would be folly to return to the old ERM narrow bands following the experiences of 1992 and 1993, it is also possible that EU states will opt for a generous interpretation of the requirement for exchange rate stability before joining Emu. The condition that entrants to Emu should have stable exchange rates within the 'normal bands' of the ERM for two years prior to joining could be construed to cover stability within the present 15 per cent bands. But even though the Treaty allows some flexibility, the requirement that the EU states control their fiscal deficits and overall debt looks daunting. Under the criteria, a country is supposed not to become an Emu member if its fiscal deficit exceeds 3 per cent of gross domestic product or its stock of government debt is more than 60 per cent of GDP. The latest Commission forecast, published last month suggested that only three countries - Ireland, Luxembourg and Germany - would meet the deficit rule by the middle of the decade. At present, a majority of EU members exceed the debt guideline with four countries having stocks of debt that are more than 50 per cent in excess of the Maastricht limit. Belgium and Italy, two members of the original EEC, have debt to GDP ratios of 138 per cent and 116 per cent respectively while Greece and Ireland have debt of 114 per cent and 93 per cent of GDP. Henning Christophersen, the commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, has predicted that during 1997 a majority of present EU members should fulfil the criteria 'with a return to normal growth'. But given the EU's relatively high real interest rates and typically moderate growth rates, it is hard to imagine Belgium, Italy, Greece and Ireland ever being able to meet the 60 per cent debt to GDP ratio. Meanwhile, senior members of the Bundesbank central council and the German constitutional court have taken public positions against any weakening of the debt and deficit criteria to ease entry to Emu for member states. So far, the political will of the 'hard core' of EU members to move towards Emu has been remarkably strong. The project, too, is better anchored than previous plans for a single currency and central bank because the Maastricht process has the backing of a treaty. But there have been signs this year that tight EU integration is losing support among electors in several countries including France and Germany. Much will depend on the lessons, if any, that policy makers draw from this month's elections for the European parliament and the outcome of the elections for the German national parliament in October and French presidential elections in early 1995. When the EU member states convene a planned inter-governmental conference in 1996 to discuss the progress being made towards Emu, improved economic conditions in continental Europe could give the project a fair wind. But the big decisions on whether Europe gets a single currency and central bank for its next millennium will depend on politics.</p>

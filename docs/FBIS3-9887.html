			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks in Creole] </F>   [Excerpts] Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion, ACP] and  Socialist Group [GS] parliamentarians are opposed to the  counterproposal of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. While  supporting the plan of the parliamentary delegation that is  negotiating in Washington, they say President Aristide must  appoint a new prime minister to fill the power vacuum. The  following is a report by Daly Valet:    [Begin recording] [Valet] [passage omitted] "But in Haiti  the  ACP parliamentarians do not agree with the plan proposed by  Aristide. According to Pierre Simon Georges, the head of this  bloc, they remain committed to the plan of the Haitian  parliamentary delegation asking that the president of the  country appoint a new head of government as soon as possible."    [Georges] "It is normal that.... The prime minister has  resigned." Besides, the resignation was announced long before.  The president is duty bound to fill this vacuum as soon as  possible. But this has not been done. "So I believe the first  point in whichever agenda, whichever plan" is the designation of  the prime minister. "What can be included in the plan after the  designation of the prime minister? All the other things they  [not further identified] want."    [Valet] So you do not agree with Aristide's plan which  speaks  of the departure of the military officers first?    [Georges] Not at all. "I am one of the parliamentarians who  do not agree that Cedras or any other military should step down  if the amnesty law is not first passed. Besides, that is what  gives me a feeling of security to discuss at the chamber as a  deputy. That is what gives me the feeling of security to use a  microphone to say whatever ensues from my political options."    [Valet] "As regards Aristide's return 10 days after the  appointment of the head of government, Deputy Pierre Simon  Georges says he has no objection to that, provided that head of  government would have time to establish social peace in the  country. But the deputy has a reservation in that he does not  believe there can be social peace in the country 10 days after  the appointment of a head of government. [passage omitted]    ``The stances are not different within the GS. Deputy  Edmonde  Supplice Beauzile of the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary  Party of Haiti [Panpra] advises that they have no comments to  make on the plan proposed by President Aristide because GS  President Duly Brutus signed, jointly with the parliamentary  delegation, a plan to be delivered to Aristide. This  parliamentary plan is supported by Panpra coordinator Serge  Gilles, according to Deputy Beauzile.''    [Beauzile] "At present, there is one member of my group who  signed another plan. So I do not need to give my opinion about  the plan set up by President Aristide."    [Valet] "So, as a parliamentarian who is affiliated to a  political party evolving within a [political bloc], you do not  share the outlines of this plan which provides for the return of  Aristide 10 days after the appointment of the prime minister?"    [Beauzile] "Let me tell you, Daly, you know that one of the  characteristics of the GS is our coherence. If we have made a  statement saying that we have accepted a plan, we cannot accept  one today, then accept another that comes tomorrow, and then  accept another that comes the day after tomorrow. By doing so, I  would give you an opportunity to say that I belong to an  incoherent group." [passage omitted]    [Valet] "Whereas several parliamentarians in Haiti, the  delegation of parliamentarians, the United Nations, and the U.S.  Government are putting pressure on Aristide to appoint a new  prime minister and whereas, for his part, the president has made  a counterproposal in which he asks for the departure of the  military officials before he chooses a new head of government,  the office at the Senate of the Republic that is presided over  by Bernard Sansaricq is working toward the establishment of a  new government, an exceptional government, according to what he  said."

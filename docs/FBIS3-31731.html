The Russian foreign minister met Andrzej Olechowski  in Krakow. Both politicians signed an intergovernment  Polish-Russian agreement "on graves and sites of remembrance of  victims of wars and repressions."    The foreign ministers began their meeting with private  talks,  during which bilateral relations and issues of European security  were discussed. Later, during plenary talks between delegations  of the two states' foreign ministries, new forms of economic and  cultural cooperation between Poland and Russia were examined.    After the talks, the ministers signed an agreement in which  both sides have undertaken, among other things, to finance  protection on their territories of sites commemorating the death  and martyrdom of citizens of the other state.    During the signing ceremony, Minister Olechowski emphasized  that reconciliation and friendship between the Polish and  Russian peoples has become possible through mutual respect for  the victims that both peoples suffered from the two totalitarian  systems that raged in the 20th century. "In this spirit, the  Polish people respect and protect the graves of the hundreds of  thousands of Russian soldiers who fell and rest on our soil,"  said the head of the Polish Foreign Ministry, adding that the  agreement confirmed the will to permanently respect the resting  places of victims of wars.    Kozyrev emphasized that the agreement was an expression of  respect for historical truth and the memory of those who gave  their lives in the struggle for freedom.    The Russian diplomat handed over to Minister Olechowski  photocopies of hitherto secret archival documents from the  period of the [1794] Kosciuszko Insurrection and the Targowica  Confederacy, including correspondence between Empress Catherine  II and Count Ignacy Potocki.    Commenting on the private talks, Kozyrev told journalists  that in these they had raised "in private, confidentially and  with mutual understanding," issues of European security and  cooperation with NATO.    The Russian minister said that at present we should  concentrate on "Partnership for Peace," while NATO membership  for new states is only one option. "Perhaps Russia too will join  NATO, but perhaps there are other options for fashioning a  security mechanism, including dialogue in the forums of the  existing political organizations," Kozyrev added.    Olechowski emphasized that perhaps in the future there will  be no NATO, or perhaps both Poland and Russia will be members of  the North Atlantic Pact. "These are options that would suit us  best," said the Polish foreign minister, adding, "if it is not  going to be possible to build a Europe without divisions,  `Partnership' could lead to only some countries joining NATO."    "I would like a democratic and affluent Russia to be one of  the pillars of security and economic cooperation in the future  Europe," Olechowski said, adding that this could be furthered by  Europe's opening to comprehensive economic cooperation with  Russia.    The Russian foreign minister emphasized that he does not  want  the countries of East-Central Europe to be viewed as a  battlefield for spheres of influence. He added that Poland is  now an active participant in international politics. According  to Kozyrev, in light of this, one could not say that Poland  finds itself in a political vacuum.    Referring to the plenary proceedings, Kozyrev said that the  Polish side put forward a number of interesting proposals  concerning economic and cultural cooperation. He also stated  that the Krakow proceedings brought closer the implementation of  agreements signed during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Poland last year.    "Polish-Russian relations are very good; they merely lack  friendly everyday substance," Olechowski noted. He added that  Poland and Russia, being neighbors, cannot be enemies. On the  other hand, they must be partners even if they do not want to  be. "The point is that now we want to travel the road from  partnership to friendship, and the Poles intend to do this  quickly," Olechowski added.    Before meeting Minister Olechowski, the Russian foreign  minister viewed exhibits of the State Art Collection at Wawel  castle and visited the Wawel Cathedral. Asked by journalists  about Polish-Russian cultural links, he said, "Our cultures have  never been separated from each other, and this gives me hope.  Culture is the spiritual basis on which we could build the  future and good-neighborly relations and develop partnership."    Stanislaw Ciosek, Polish Republic ambassador to Russia, told  a PAP journalist that the Krakow meeting was important for both  sides because it could contribute to "breaking through the  temporary cooling down in relations." According to Ciosek, a  breakthrough in Polish-Russian relations will not depend on a  single act but will take place gradually.    Ciosek emphasized that it would be easier to attain a  political breakthrough rather than an economic one, which "costs  a lot and has to be costed," while, for it to occur, there must  be first and foremost meetings between the heads of governments,  economics ministers, and industrialists.</p>

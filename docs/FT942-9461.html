			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / People: Chapman - poised to 'take on more' for Nomura Securities Max Chapman, the combative American who in the past four years has turned Nomura Securities' sleepy and unprofitable US operation into an unlikely Wall Street success story, was asked recently if he would stay with the Japanese firm when his contract expired in September, writes Patrick Harverson. He replied: 'At some point, Nomura will say to me: 'We would like you to do something more.' Or I'll decide to do something else.' Well, now it seems that Nomura has asked if Chapman would like to do something more: namely, take over the additional task of running the firm's London operation. And it looks as if the ambitious Chapman is ready to accept the offer. Although the details of his appointment as chairman of Nomura International in London were still being worked out last week, an announcement is expected within a few days. If he does take charge of London, and with it the rest of Europe, it will be an acknowledgement both of Chapman's growing influence at the world's largest securities house, and of the importance that Nomura places on integrating its far-flung overseas operations into a unified whole. Like many securities houses with global pretensions, Nomura has discovered that competition and rivalries between its separate foreign units has been counter- productive, not to mention costly. To rectify the situation, Nomura wants to merge its individual fiefdoms, and Tokyo clearly believes Chapman is the man to get US, London and Europe all reading from the same page. Assuming he accepts the offer, the tough-looking and tough-acting Chapman is likely to bring to London the same intensity of purpose that he brought to New York, which, after a few run-ins with Tokyo, he eventually turned into a smart, and highly profitable US-style securities house.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Boeing earnings slide in second term Boeing, the Seattle-based aerospace group, suffered a near 50 per cent fall in second-quarter net earnings, as aircraft deliveries fell sharply. Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman and chief executive, affirmed earlier forecasts of 260 deliveries for the full year, with production showing a 20 per cent decline in the second half, compared with the first. Revenues for the year are estimated at Dollars 21bn, about the same as the previous year. In the three months to the end of June, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer turned in a net profit of Dollars 222m, or 65 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 5.4bn. The results compare with earnings of Dollars 426m, or Dollars 1.25, and sales of Dollars 8bn in the second quarter of last year. Although the decline was severe, Boeing's performance was better than Wall Street had expected. Profits were well ahead of a consensus forecast which projected net earnings at 56 cents a share. Analysts said Boeing limited the damage to the bottom line by lowering its effective federal tax rate to 26 per cent, from 31.7 per cent in 1993. Its burden was eased by a tax credit for research and development costs and tax-exempt income benefits associated with export sales. In spite of the surprise, Boeing's stock slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 45 1/8 on Wall Street. 'It was a non-operational gain, and the market usually doesn't give you much credit for them,' said Mr Jack Modzelewski, an analyst at PaineWebber, the New York securities house. Mr Wolfgang Demisch, of BT Securities in New York, said he expected analysts to add about 10 cents to their full-year forecast in view of the reduced tax rate. Currently, Wall Street projects 1994 profits at Dollars 2 a share, down from Dollars 3.66 last year. At an operating level, the results were in line with expectations. A two-year slump in commercial aircraft production showed no sign of abating, with 67 deliveries reported in the second quarter, compared with 109 in the year-earlier period. Lower corporate investment income and higher interest expense had a negative impact on profits. Research and develop-ment costs are expected to exceed 1993 expenditures of Dollars 1.7bn. The increase partly reflects extensive testing and systems integration of the new 777 commercial airliner, which is scheduled to begin passenger service next May. For the first half, the company posted net earnings of Dollars 514m, or Dollars 1.51 a share, against profits of Dollars 751m, or Dollars 2.21, in the 1993 period. Sales declined to Dollars 11.7bn from Dollars 14.6bn.</p>

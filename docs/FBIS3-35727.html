V. Dashkevich considers that "Gaydar acted correctly, as you  cannot combine market methods of managing the economy with  administrative ones."    In Dashkevich's opinion, if the Russian and Belarusian  Governments adopt such a decision, it "will soon demonstrate its  unviability and force Belarus to return to setting up a  full-fledged monetary system."    "If a short-term effect is possible at the initial stage,  the  negative consequences associated with superimposing Russia's  internal economic disorder onto the Belarusian economy, will  become apparent by the end of the year."    The Russian Federation and Belarusian premiers signed a  statement in Moscow on the upcoming union of the two countries'  monetary systems.</p>

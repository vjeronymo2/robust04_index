			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: GOOD NUTRITION IS A VITAL ELEMENT FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING  WITH AIDS  </P> <P> As the search continues in laboratories across the world to find a cure for  AIDS, medical professionals are battling to promote better prevention and care.  Nutrition is one critical element in that struggle. The AIDS patient presents a  special challenge to the task of ensuring adequate nutrition.  </P> <P> Malnutrition is common among people suffering from AIDS. Their nutritional  well-being is continually jeopardized by opportunistic infections. To make  matters worse, poor nutrition further weakens the already compromised immune  system. Both the disease itself and its treatment can affect the body's ability  to absorb nutrients and can depress the appetite as well.  </P> <P> Against this grim scenario, the importance of diet stands clear. Good nutrition  can help maintain the patient's strength in the crucial fight against  infection.  </P> <P> Conversely, diet cannot provide a pathway to perfect health for such patients,  who sometimes fall prey to nutritional voodooism or quackery in their quest to  find relief from the disease. Attempting to bolster strength, many have turned  to alternative diets, herbal remedies and mega-vitamin therapies.  </P> <P> No evidence exists that these strategies are of any use, and some may be  detrimental. The best approach remains eating as varied a diet as possible,  taking in sufficient calories and getting enough of all the right nutrients.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Disease Complications  </P> <P> Several complications of AIDS make these goals difficult to meet. Diarrhea,  oral-esophageal problems, nausea and vomiting are among the many problems.  There are no pat answers, but experts -- such as those in the Task Force on  Nutrition Support in AIDS -- do offer tips for maintaining nutrient intake.  Here are several of the group's suggestions for diet modifications:  </P> <P> Diarrhea: Often the first gastrointestinal symptom associated with AIDS.  </P> <P> Tactic: Drink plenty of liquids to prevent dehydration. Water, diluted fruit  drinks and flavored drink mixes are recommended. Diluted orange juice and fruit  nectars, bananas and mangoes will help replenish potassium and other minerals.  Caffeine, greasy and high-fat foods should be avoided. Low-lactose foods such  as Lactaid products, aged cheese and cultured yogurt are good choices. Fiber  should be restricted. This means eating white bread, white rice and cooked  fruits and vegetables, rather than high-fiber foods. If diarrhea persists, the  physician may recommend a low-fat nutritional supplement.  </P> <P> Mouth sores or pain: May interfere with eating.  </P> <P> Tactic: Cool, smooth and mildly flavored foods should be chosen instead of  spices, salt and acidic foods such as oranges and grapefruits. Non-abrasive,  moist foods such as puddings, eggs, baked fish, noodles, canned fruits and ice  cream are best. For the AIDS patient who has trouble eating, one of the  commercially available nutritionally balanced drinks can add calories. Because  extremes in temperature can be irritating, food should be served at moderate  temperature.  </P> <P> When it's difficult to swallow, single-textured foods (mashed potatoes or  oatmeal) go down more easily than single-particle foods (nuts, corn and rice or  sticky foods such as peanut butter). Slippery foods -- gelatin, macaroni -- may  slide down too fast. Another tip: Tilting the head back or moving it forward  may make swallowing easier.  </P> <P> Taste changes and dryness of the mouth: Can make eating less pleasurable.  </P> <P> Tactic: If mouth sores and pain are not a problem, use herbs and spices to  enhance food flavor. Acidic foods (citrus fruits, pickles) help thin saliva and  make it easier to chew. Hard candies and gum keep the mouth moist.  </P> <P> Nausea and vomiting: Can be caused by infection but are also frequently  associated with medication or treatments.  </P> <P> Tactic: When medication is the cause, meals should be eaten beforehand. Small,  frequent meals are the best way to ensure a maximum intake. After meals, the  patient should rest but not lie down for at least two hours. Clear, cool  beverages, frozen ices, low-fat foods, salted or dry foods (pretzels, crackers)  and chilled foods (cottage cheese with fruit) are all recommended. Avoid spicy,  high-fat, fried or greasy foods.  </P> <P> Reduction in appetite (anorexia): Causes include medication, infection,  depression and emotional stress.  </P> <P> Tactic: Create a relaxing and soothing mealtime atmosphere. If possible, the  patient should eat with a friend and choose favorite foods. Smaller meals eaten  more often during the day, frequent snacks and an instant breakfast shake  between meals may help boost caloric intake.  </P> <P> Because symptoms and complications of AIDS are unique for each patient, no set  of guidelines applies to everybody. If efforts to maintain adequate nutrition  fail to meet the mark, a physician or registered dietitian should be consulted.  They may suggest a commercial formula or food product to augment the diet. In  severe cases, other forms of nutritional support may be necessary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Macadamia Nuts: Slim Chance of Low Calories  </P> <P> Question: Are macadamia nuts higher in calories than other nuts?  </P> <P> Answer: Yes. Nuts in general are notoriously high in fat, and therefore high in  calories. Nevertheless, there are differences among them. A cup of macadamias  contains about 940 calories and nearly 100 grams of fat, almost seven  tablespoons -- nearly the equivalent of half a stick of butter.  </P> <P> Moving down the caloric ladder, a cup of almonds has about 835 calories; a cup  of walnuts, 770. A cup of pecans or filberts contains 725 calories. Fat ranges  from 70 to 75 grams in a cup of any of these nuts.  </P> <P> Nuts also contain protein, some more than others. For example, a cup of pecans  has just eight grams of protein, about the same as in an ounce of meat, while a  cup of almonds provides almost four times that much, or 28 grams. Macadamia  nuts weigh in at the low end. They contain just 11 grams of protein.  </P> <P> Q: Is there any evidence that people who are more active physically are less  likely to be depressed?  </P> <P> A: More research is needed, but so far the answer seems to be yes. That was the  conclusion reached by Kenneth E. Powell and co-workers at the Centers for  Disease Control when they recently reviewed available evidence about the link  between activity and depression.  </P> <P> As they point out, the difficulty begins with the fact that criteria for  diagnosing depression are much less precise than those for other chronic  diseases such as coronary heart disease or cancer. Beyond that, depression only  rarely has a fatal outcome: Less than 1% of those who suffer from clinical  depression commit suicide. So, in the overwhelming majority of cases, changes  in symptoms are what must be measured, a task that is very difficult.  </P> <P> Several types of inquiries have been conducted since the beginning of the  decade. Four population surveys, three of them from Canada and one from the  United States, found that people who were more active were indeed happier.  Additionally, one of the Canadian studies, which also obtained information  about household chores, found a diminished association between activity and  positive-affect scores when both chores and leisure activity were measured  together. This suggests that leisure-time activity, assumed to be self-chosen,  may affect mood more positively than obligatory activity.  </P> <P> Other studies have compared the therapeutic effects of exercise to standard  therapy on depressed individuals. Those randomly assigned to a jogging program  improved as much or more than those assigned to other forms of therapy,  including group therapy, counseling or meditation with a therapist.  </P> <P> However, conclusions are limited by the fact that a therapist participated in  the group. In two other studies of women college students, aerobic exercise and  swimming were found to improve depressive symptoms. Using information from a  follow-up study of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,  women who were classified as not active at the time of the original survey were  twice as likely to be depressed eight years later than those who were active.  </P> <P> The authors of the review conclude that available evidence does suggest that  physical activity reduces depressive symptoms and improves mood. But they  caution that a clearer definition of the relationship depends on better  definition of depression and measurements of physical activity.  </P></p>

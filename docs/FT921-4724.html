			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / French Property: Paying without pain MANY BRITONS who buy in France do not speak the language and this often leads to difficulties with bills and correspondence. French addresses can be confusing. Which slip do you put in with the rates, electricity, water and telephone accounts? Writing a cheque on your local bank might seem simple enough - but not if you do not know the French words for the amount. To cope with all this, London estate agency Rutherfords (071-351-4454), which sells French property, runs an administration service. For Pounds 110 a year, you can pass over your correspondence and it will tell you how to deal with each item. Not paying a bill might mean having a service cut off. There was a man who thought a huge electricity account at his French property was a mistake. The agency looked into it - and found that he had forgotten to turn off the electricity. He had also left the refrigerator on - with the door open.</p>

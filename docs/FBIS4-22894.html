Rimareva, National Scientific Research  Institute of Food Biotechnology, Moscow; UDC 668.394:636.087.1]    [Abstract] The irreversible chemical processes occurring in  molasses during storage which make them unsuitable for use as a  carbon source in lysine production by microbiological methods  and reports that molasses can be easily substituted with acetic  acid and cereals and fruits and vegetables as well as the  urgency of developing new feed lysine production methods using  nonstandard fruit and vegetable raw materials prompted an  investigation into the possibility of producing lysine by  bioconversion of various types of fruit and vegetable raw  materials. To this end, the Brevibacterium sp.  culture cultivated in 750 ml bulbs containing 25-30 ml of  nutrient medium in a circular rocker spinning at a 220-240 RPM  speed for 24-72 h was used. The experimental procedure is  outlined. The quantity of lysine forming during fermentation was  measured by thin layer chromatography. The carbohydrate  composition of the fruit and vegetable media, the outcome of  lysine biosynthesis in media with various carbohydrate  concentrations, and a comparative characterization of the lysine  development process in media from fresh and long-stored raw  materials (apples, carrots, beats, cabbage, and various  combinations thereof) are summarized. The study demonstrates  that various types of such raw materials may indeed be used as  the substrate for microbial synthesis of lysine from the  Brevibacterium sp. culture and shows that  bioconversion occurs at a varying degree of effectiveness.  Complex media ensuring a high level of substrate conversion into  lysine are selected. An analysis confirms that any plant raw  material can be used successfully for producing lysine. The new  method makes it possible to solve the problem of fruit and  vegetable waste utilization, reduce environmental pollution, and  supply a valuable animal feed supplement.

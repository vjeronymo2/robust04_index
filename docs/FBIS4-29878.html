			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- The Japanese auto industry  asked the government Wednesday [22 June] to make maximum efforts  to arrest the yen's surge against the dollar, a Trade Ministry  official said.    Tatsuro Toyoda, head of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers  Association, made the request during a breakfast meeting with  senior officials of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI), including MITI chief Eijiro Hata, the official  told a press conference.    The auto industry has strived to reinforce its earnings  position through globalization of business operations so as not  to be easily affected by exchange rate swings, Toyoda was quoted  as saying.    "But an excessively strong yen would put a drag on such  efforts," he said.    Hata shared the auto industry's concern over the latest yen  rise, saying the yen has appreciated against the dollar to a  worrisome level, the official said.    The dollar slipped below 100 yen in overnight New York  trading for the first time, sinking briefly to a record global  low of 99.85 yen.    "An excessive strength of the yen could dampen burgeoning  recovery in auto sales," said Toyoda, who is also president of  Toyota Motor Corp. He said he hoped the government will take  action to drive down the yen to "adequate levels."    On the trade front, the auto industry renewed its request to  the government to hold firm to a policy of rejecting any U.S.  proposals that would lead to introduction of "numerical  targets," the MITI official said.    Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan Motor Co., was quoted  as  saying, "The United States has pledged not to seek numerical  targets but the auto industry is concerned the issue will be  revived during ongoing auto trade talks between the two  countries."    Hata replied that Japan will seek to settle the trade talks  with the U.S. in a manner that will not draw criticism from the  global community, the MITI official said.    "Japan will say what it should say in line with the spirit  of  a new global trade order to be formed under the World Trade  Organization," Hata was quoted as saying.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Cairo budget cuts subsidies THE Egyptian government presented its 1992-93 budget to parliament yesterday, cutting subsidies but increasing both military spending and civil service salaries in line with inflation, Reuter reports from Cairo. Egypt is part-way through a radical programme of economic reform, agreed with the IMF last May. The budget put spending for the year from July 1 at Dollars 18.9bn, up only 14 per cent against inflation of nearly 20 per cent. The draft proposed a modest reduction in the budget deficit to Dollars 2.8bn. Targets agreed with the IMF include cutting the overall state budget deficit to 6.5 per cent of GDP in 1992-93 from 9.5 per cent in 1991-92. The draft budget covers only the central government and the IMF's targets are based on all state spending.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Homes Assured directors jailed TWO FORMER directors of Homes Assured, the mortgage broker which collapsed in 1989 owing creditors Pounds 10.7m, were imprisoned yesterday following their convictions at Southwark Crown Court in August for fraudulent trading. Mr Anthony Dobson, the founder of the company set up to provide mortgages for council tenants buying their homes under the right-to-buy legislation, was jailed for a total of 5 1/2 years, and Mr Keith Woodward, its former finance director, for 4 1/2 years. Mr Dobson was sentenced to four years on the fraudulent trading charge and an additional 18 months on two charges of procuring the execution of a security by deception. Mr Woodward received three years for fraudulent trading and a further 18 months for furnishing false information. However, the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecutions, decided against a re-trial of Mr Michael Robinson, the former Homes Assured managing director also charged with fraudulent trading. The jury was unable to agree a verdict against him. Mr Robinson was formally acquitted. Passing sentence, Judge John Rogers QC said Homes Assured had started out as an honest business, but had been under-capitalised. Both men had ignored warnings that the company was losing money, and they continued trading. Mr Dobson had been guilty of blatant dishonesty in not revealing that he had reached a voluntary agreement with creditors to avoid bankruptcy when negotiating a loan from the Bank of Boston, the judge said. Mr Woodward had been guilty of dishonesty in submitting accounts to the High Court which he must have known were false. Both men were also disqualified from acting as company directors for 10 years.</p>

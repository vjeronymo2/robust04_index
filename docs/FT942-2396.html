			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Picking winners in groves of academe: Higher education's capital-market potential City analysts will soon have to grapple with a new problem - how to credit-score a university. European Capital, the merchant banking advisory company, has compiled a blueprint for higher education institutions on how they can raise capital from the bond markets. But it does not believe all of them will be able to do so. Analysts will have the sensitive job of assessing which institutions are sufficiently credit-worthy, and where the cut-off point for funding should be made. Institutions judged to be good credit risks will not necessarily be restricted to universities. Several specialist institutions, such as music colleges, may prove very safe borrowers. Mr John Holden, of European Capital, says two sets of tests will determine whether colleges can borrow. First there are financial tests - reserves, interest coverage ratios, surpluses of income over expenditure and all the normal indicators. These need extra research, but much of the information is already available and will be looked on favourably by financial institutions. Universities have the advantage of a regular stream of income from the government. The second set of tests relates to likely future demand for the university's services. They would try to answer the question: 'Is this institution going to be around long enough to repay in 25 years?' After the fast expansion of student numbers, some City institutions may be anxious about this. They will need to look at universities' research track records, and also at their popularity with students and with industrial sponsors. Any indication that a university is thriving academically will help convince the City that its future stream of cash from the government is assured. The test of whether buildings could be sold for alternative uses - usually regarded as central to credit-rating - may be less important. Successful universities such as Bath and York have purpose-built campuses a few miles outside provincial centres which would be difficult to sell for any alternative use, but European Capital believes they would still have no difficulty borrowing. Universities will not be forced to use the new bond finance when it becomes available, but it holds several advantages for them. They will have access to funds in a volume which banks might not be prepared to offer - and at more favourable terms and costs, thanks to the large deals involved. Most importantly, their finance will be long-term - probably for 25 years - and at a fixed rate. This type of funding suits universities, which expect assets such as libraries and laboratories to last over a similarly long timescale, and would be almost impossible to obtain elsewhere.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Vickers sees further losses at Rolls-Royce VICKERS expects its troubled Rolls-Royce Motors Cars subsidiary to suffer a trading loss of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m this year compared with a trading loss of more than Pounds 30m in 1991 in the face of continuing weak demand particularly in the UK and Japan. In spite of speculation about the possible sale of the prestige car operations to a foreign carmaker, the company said yesterday no deal would be disclosed at the Vickers shareholders' meeting tomorrow. Exploratory talks have been held with several groups, but BMW, the German executive and luxury carmaker, has remained front-runner for possible co-operation. However, BMW yesterday repeated denials of a pending deal. The Rolls-Royce and Bentley business last year dragged the whole of Vickers group into loss and forced it to cut its dividend. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars lost half its market last year in the face of recession in its main markets, the US and the UK. Sales worldwide fell 48.3 per cent to 1,723 - the lowest since 1968 - from the record 3,333 achieved in 1990. Sales in the UK halved to 513 from 1,007, while sales in the US plunged 65.2 per cent to only 400 from 1,149 in 1990. Conditions remained tough in the first quarter this year: in the UK sales fell to only 109 cars from 209 a year ago; in the US sales rose 20 per cent in the first quarter, but from a depressed level a year ago.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALLET REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> BUSTAMANTE AND FERRI IN EVENING PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> Her extension seems to grow higher every year, but Alessandra Ferri is still a  great Juliet where it counts -- in her intense surrender to each moment of  Kenneth MacMillan's Shakespeare ballet.  </P> <P> Sunday evening in Shrine Auditorium, Ferri graced the last performance of the  American Ballet Theatre season. Her Romeo: Ricardo Bustamante, a Ballet Theatre  soloist with an unusually high extension of his own and an ability to almost  match her sense of spontaneity and passionate involvement.  </P> <P> Though his best dancing had extraordinary suavity and technical plush,  Bustamante did not always look comfortable in his solos, with their emphasis on  intricate combinations of jumps and turns in place. However, the duets were  glorious: paradigms of mutual risk, trust and inspiration. Bustamante's  sensitivity as an actor and strength as a partner released Ferri into dancing  of thrilling urgency, intimacy, generosity.  </P> <P> Otherwise, this final "Romeo and Juliet" featured a number of pointed character  portrayals: Victor Barbee's brutal Tybalt, for example, and Clark Tippet's  haughty Capulet, plus, as always, Georgina Parkinson's memorably elegant and  neurotic Lady Capulet.  </P> <P> John Summers made a confused, manipulated Paris (another victimized Verona  youth rather than a co-conspirator). As Mercutio, Danilo Radojevic followed  current Ballet Theatre practice by reducing the character to generalized  sweetness and solid-gold virtuosity. Jack Everly conducted.LEWIS SEGAL  </P></p>

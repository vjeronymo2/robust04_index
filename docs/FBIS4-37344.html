			<p>BFN     [Text] Kabul, June 19 (AFP) -- Afghan President Borhanoddin  Rabbani will not resign at the end of June but is prepared to  transfer his authority to a legitimate national assembly, an  official spokesman declared Sunday [19 June].    "The president is waiting for an authorised assembly to be  established, to which he will deliver his authority," said  presidential spokesman Abdul Aziz Morad.    Morad rejected demands of rival faction leader Prime  Minister  Gulbuddin Hekmatyar that Rabbani must resign at the end of June,  saying the president's legitimacy rested on the Kabul grand  national assembly held in December 1992.    The establishment of a transitional government to settle the  two-year-long Afghan factional power struggle, which has been  proposed by a peace commission based in the western provincial  capital of Herat, had Rabbani's support, Morad said.    However, he said there was no contradiction between the  power  of the president and the power of the proposed Supreme Council  to be set up in Herat.    "The president's authority is totally separate from the  authority of the Supreme Council," stated Morad.    The proposed Supreme Council would set up an interim  government which, within nine months, would pave the way for  convocation of a grand assembly, itself responsible for drafting  a constitution and deciding on the future leadership of  Afghanistan.    It is to this grand assembly that Rabbani is most likely to  transfer his authority, should it ever be convened, but as  Hekmatyar has threatened more military action if Rabbani does  not resign by June 28 the chances of the peace process working  appear slim.    Neither Hekmatyar nor Rabbani have announced their intention  of attending the Herat conference yet. The prime minister wants  a "preliminary" meeting in Kabul first while the president would  go "if the necessity existed."    Kakojan Niazi, a spokesman for the Herat-based peace  commission, said it was hoped a meeting between Rabbani and  Hekmatyar representatives would take place in Kabul, in order to  thrash out details of the proposed Herat peace conference.    In the capital Sunday -- a public holiday in observance of  the Muslim religious anniversary of Ashura -- there was little  military activity, although locals reported continued fighting  between the Shi'ite Harakat-e Eslami faction and Hekmatyar's  Hezb-e Eslami in south Kabul.</p>

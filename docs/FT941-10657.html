			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Bonds: UK building society issues Pounds 500m FRN The Halifax Building Society dominated new issue activity in the international bond market with the launch of its Pounds 500m five-year floating-rate note yesterday, against considerable uncertainty regarding interest rate movements in the US and Europe. Dealers said the US Federal Reserve's quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates on Friday had unsettled the Eurobond and government bond markets, putting a temporary halt on new issue activity and leading to a decline in bond prices in the secondary market (although spreads over the government bond markets were little changed overall). However, with the financial markets in such a volatile condition, some syndicate officials regarded the decision by the Halifax to launch a FRN as a shrewd move. The Pounds 500m, five-year bonds carry a coupon of three-month Libor (currently at 5.5 per cent) and yielded an additional 6.5 basis points at the re-offer price of 99.72. Halifax yesterday called in its existing Pounds 150m FRN which was due to mature in 1996 and which had a minimum coupon of 5 per cent. In recent weeks it has called in two other FRN issues, taking the total amount called in to Pounds 500m. Yesterday's new FRN issue was intended to replace those three bond issues without the 5 per cent minimum coupon, syndicate officials said. Samuel Montagu and SG Warburg, joint lead managers, pointed out that the new deal would provide FRN investors with a large liquid issue, given that Halifax and Denmark now have the two largest FRN issues in the market. However, other FRN experts said the large size and difficult market conditions meant that the bonds were taking quite a while to place, and some of the less enthusiastic syndicate members were seen offering the bonds at below the reissue price to offload them. Even so, most market participants thought the bonds were priced fairly, given the Halifax's AA1/AA credit rating. 'The pricing is right, but the size means it could take a while to place and we're sceptical as to whether there is enough demand to do Pounds 500m. However, FRNs do best when people are beginning to think that interest rates will go back up,' said one veteran of the sterling sector. Bangkok Bank, the largest bank in south-east Asia, yesterday launched a Dollars 400m, 10-year convertible bond issue due to be priced next week. Morgan Stanley, lead manager for the issue, has indicated a coupon of 3-3 1/4 per cent and a conversion premium of 23-26 per cent. Although there has been a slew of new convertible bond issues in recent months, market participants said that Bangkok Bank stands out as a relatively strong name. Moody's Investors Service may cut Venezuela's Ba-1 long-term ratings and Ba-2 rating for its par and discount bonds and floating rate notes, Reuter reports. Moody's said the action reflects the deterioration of Venezuela's economic fundamentals, a worsening of its public finances, the crisis in the country's financial sector and the increasing political instability and uncertainty.</p>

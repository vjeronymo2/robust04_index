			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / International Company News: Philippines to push on with airline privatisation PHILIPPINE Commercial International Bank is pushing ahead with the privatisation of Philippine Airlines (PAL), but is waiting for the sale prospectus and the results of a due diligence review before making a final decision on the bidding consortium. A number of parties are known to be interested in acquiring the 60 per cent of PAL that the government is to put up for sale. They include Northwest Airlines of the US, JAL of Japan, a consortium led by a Hong Kong company, and a group headed by PAL pilots. 'Once the prospectus comes out, we will decide whether to bid, who to bid with and how much to bid,' said Mr Stephen Cu-Unjieng, PCIB managing director for investment banking. Mr Feliciano Belmonte, PAL president, said that PAL had incurred a net loss of 1.5bn pesos (Dollars 54.6m) for the year ended March 1991, mainly due to heavy foreign exchange losses and increased domestic fuel price costs. He said the foreign airlines were interested in PAL's trans-Pacific routes, rather than its current balance sheet. By the end of the year, Mr Belmonte - who also heads the government pension fund that controls 75 per cent of equity in Philippine Airlines - disclosed the airline was planning to double its Manila-US flights to 26 a week. One of the main obstacles to PAL's successful privatisation is its planned buy-back of Dollars 175m of Paris Club debts and Dollars 170m of commercial debts. The Philippines' central bank and the finance department have drafted an agreement that might resolve the debt issue, Mr Belmonte said. He said the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), the majority stockholder in PAL and the Philippine Plaza Hotel, has asked for a guarantee from Allied Kajima (AKL) of Japan foIlowing its purchase of the hotel for 1.5bn pesos. Mr Belmonte, who is GSIS president and general manager, said AKL has been asked to pledge as security 100 per cent of the shares to be bought as well as a mortgage on the hotel, which is being bought with a long-term lease from GSIS over the land.</p>

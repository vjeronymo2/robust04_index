			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT ON CIVIL RIGHTS  </P> <P> In response to "A Giant Step Backward," editorial, June 8:  </P> <P> We too are appalled at the Supreme Court ruling on discriminatory employment  practices and share your concern. We especially endorse your closing sentence  -- "Along with Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who dissented in the Wards Cove case,  we are left to wonder 'whether the majority still believe that racial  discrimination . . . is a problem in our society, or even remember that it ever  was.' "  </P> <P> Your editorial prompted me to write this letter and to suggest that if you are  sincere in your concern about people forgetting what "civil rights" is all  about, you might run a special anniversary feature article on the subject.  </P> <P> This year marks the 25th anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. This  historic legislation was won at the cost of great sacrifice and loss of life.  </P> <P> On June 1, the Los Angeles League of Women Voters dedicated its annual Women of  Honor luncheon to remembering this anniversary and honored civil rights  activists Myrlie Evers and Marnesba T. Tackett.  </P> <P> We were thrilled to have a large number of black men and women attending our  luncheon and were very proud when our organization was applauded for presenting  the only civil rights anniversary event in Los Angeles this year.  </P> <P> The League felt this was an important anniversary to remember and hoped to get  some recognition in The Times. However, beyond a "Save-the-Date" mention, and  in the spite of sending a photo and press release by messenger the day after  the event, we were ignored.  </P> <P> This letter is not being written because our luncheon was ignored by The Times,  but rather to urge you to use your powerful influence to help the community  remember and protect all that was won by "blood, sweat and tears."  </P> <P> LOIS SAFFIAN  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> League of Women Voters  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

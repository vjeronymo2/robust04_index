			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sheng Baoliang (4141 0202 5328) of the </F> International Economic Relations and Trade Department, Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation: "The Final Act of the  Uruguay Round and Its Impact On China's Economic Trade"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H5>  II. The Final Act's Impact on China's Economic Trade </H5>   1.The Uruguay Round's relevance to China.    In July 1986, the Chinese government formally applied to  regain China's status as a GATT signatory state. In September of  that year, the Chinese government attended the new Uruguay Round  multilateral trade negotiations in the status of full  participant. For seven years, China enthusiastically attended  this round of negotiations from beginning to end, and made due  contributions to the successful negotiations. In the process of  negotiations, besides making significant adjustments in economic  and trade policies in accordance with the requirements of the  negotiations, China submitted tariff reduction forms for  agricultural products and non-agricultural products, involving  taxes on more than 800 agricultural products and taxes on more  than 4,000 nonagricultural products.    In the trade service aspect, from start to finish, in  addition to participating in the negotiations and drafting of  the general agreement on trade service, China also submitted the  final trade service reduction form, and opened sectors which  included banking, insurance, shipping, land and sea oil  exploration, professional services (including legal, accounting,  etc.), computers, real estate, and advertising. Plans are for  China to initial all Uruguay Round accords at April's  ministerial level meeting, but the actual implementation of  these accords must wait for China to reenter GATT and become a  founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO).    2. The Uruguay Round's final act and its impact on  China's economy and trade.    There is no doubt that the agreement to liberalize world  trade described in the final act of the Uruguay Round will push  world markets open further and promote the world's economy, in  which the growth and promotion of international trade in most  countries has fallen upon hard times insofar as creating  significant economic efficiency and employment opportunities are  concerned. Economists believe that the Uruguay Round's agreement  to liberalize world trade will bring a $6,000 billion increase  in output value in the next decade, and by 2005, the gross  amount of world trade will have increased by 12 percent from the  current level of $3,600 billion.    However, the benefits that accrue from the agreement to  liberalize world trade will be different for each country in the  world, especially for poor nations which import agricultural  products, because they will pay more to purchase grain in the  world market. Talking about China's situation, the Uruguay  accord will have the following impact on our economy and trade.    1. It will assist the further development of China's  economic  trade, especially the foreign-oriented economy. It will help to  promote and expand export of China's products and service, to  expand attraction of foreign capital. This is chiefly due to: a)  Internationally, the success of the Uruguay Round will help  restrain western nations' trade protectionism and push them  further into China's open market while providing good and  relaxed external conditions for our economic development; b) the  free trade benefits from the Uruguay Round must be extended to  China, because although China in not yet a GATT member, we have  signed bilateral trade accords with MFN status; c) since the  implementation of the policy of opening and reform, China's  economy has become more closely linked to the world economy, and  the pace of that linkage is accelerating. In recent years,  reform and opening have gone further and expanded, and the  lasting rapid development of China's economy has created a nice  internal environment for the further development of economy and  trade.    One analysis by an economic cooperation organization showed  that China will be one of the countries deriving the most  benefits from the Uruguay Round's trade liberalization, and by  2002, its annual income will reach $37 billion.    But a more open market means more intense competition,  setting out a new and more serious challenge to the mix and  quality of China's export products and service. China's domestic  market will face strong competitive pressures from imported  products, and our export products must also face a strong fight  for markets with other countries' products. For this, we must  have clear understanding and preparation.    2. For the next step in China's economic and foreign trade  reform, the Uruguay Round accord will be an important reference  point. It will play an important role in making our economic and  foreign trade system match up better with international  regulations.    3. It gives a greater urgency to the negotiations for  China's  rejoining GATT, and the negotiation assignment will be more  critical. According to the schedule set up by the Uruguay Round  and the conditions for funding membership set by the WTO accord,  China must have completed its GATT re-entry before the WTO goes  into effect (estimates are for July 1995, with the final date  for going into effect to be established at the ministerial level  meeting in April 1994). Otherwise, China will have to re-apply  to join the WTO again, pay an expensive second time "entry fee,"  and will also have greater obligations in opening markets.  Speaking of the assignment, the accords reached in the Uruguay  Round will become the obligations China must comply with. So, in  the future negotiations on rejoining GATT, the signatory parties  will demand a higher price from China.    4. On the other hand, the final act of the Uruguay Round  will  also have some negative impact on China's economic and trade  development. For example, it allows cross-industry retaliation  (as an example, a nation can take retaliatory measures against  fabric products for problems in intellectual property rights and  service industries). Although the unified system for resolving  disputes will alleviate international trade disputes more  efficiently to prevent unilateral retaliation, it will not  resolve the problem of some countries exploiting their domestic  laws (for example, the American Special 301 Provision) to  implement restrictive measures against foreign countries in  order to retaliate for trade problems; some countries such as  the U.S. have made anti-dumping agreements part of their  domestic laws, opening a convenient door for them to use  anti-dumping restrictions on imports at their will.    It is worth mentioning that it will be some time before the  final act of the Uruguay Round goes into effect, and there will  be gradual implementation of the trade liberalization agreement  in it, so its impact on China's economy and trade will also be  gradual.    In short, while on the one hand, the final act of the  Uruguay  Round will be favorable to the further development of China's  economy and trade, on the other hand, its imperfect nature will  have some negative impact on the development of China's economy  and trade. At the same time, it makes China's GATT re-entry  negotiations all the more urgent and formidable.</p>

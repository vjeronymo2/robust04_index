			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Asahi undecided on Foster's issue ASAHI Breweries, Japan's second largest brewing group, yesterday said it has not decided yet whether to exercise its entitlement to a two-for-five rights issue announced by Melbourne-based Foster's Brewing, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Asahi holds a 19.99 per cent stake in Foster's. Foster's said on Tuesday the rights issue would raise about ADollars 1bn (USDollars 733m) and provide it with a platform for a higher credit rating.</p>

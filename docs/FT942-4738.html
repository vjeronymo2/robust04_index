			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Powerscreen declines to Pounds 24.6m Powerscreen International, the Northern Ireland-based manufacturer of screening and stone crushing equipment, yesterday announced a marginal decline in annual pre-tax profits due to the impact of disposals in early 1993. The company recorded a strong improvement in sales from the UK market and east Asia, primarily Japan resulting in group turnover of Pounds 122.5m (Pounds 108.3m). Mr Shay McKeown, chief executive, said order books for the first two months of the year were 'very healthy'. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March slipped from Pounds 25.3m to Pounds 24.6m due to the loss of contributions from Guzzler, the US subsidiary. However, Powerscreen's three core businesses all showed growth, and operating profits from continuing operations grew by 11 per cent to Pounds 23.9m. The company is also increasing its dividend by 11 per cent to 7.3p, with a proposed final of 5.3p. Earnings per share rose to 22.4p (20.7p) due to a smaller tax charge resulting from lower US earnings. The share price closed 6p higher at 255p. The UK and Ireland now account for 35 per cent of sales, with North America accounting for 26 per cent and Europe for 30 per cent. Screening, responsible for about half of turnover, experienced a 22 per cent increase in sales, aided by an upswing in the UK construction market and increased infrastructure spending in the US and east Asia. Simplicity Engineering and Ludlow-Saylor, two US businesses acquired in February, made a Pounds 2m contribution to sales and are already operating profitably. The crushing and recycling products division recorded a 10 per cent sales increase, with its performance hampered by a decline in its recession-hit European markets. Brown Lenox doubled machine sales to the UK and Ireland and the materials handling division, primarily its Matbro subsidiary, saw a 62 per cent increase in sales, having substantially broadened its product range and built up an export dealer network. COMMENT After eight consecutive years of profits growth Powerscreen has finally recorded a decline, but this merely reflected business disposals. Overall, the results were positive, with profit margins maintained. Profits should hit Pounds 28m this year, putting the shares on a p/e of 10.4, and it should remain on a strong growth track for the following year. Powerscreen has switched to one of the big four accountancy firms and has increased disclosure, which should win over some City sceptics. After their recent decline, the shares appear to offer value.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["By XINHUA Sportswriter Yi Gaochao"] </F>   [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Overnight fame and  phenomenal fortune without the labors of Hercules are the  lead-up of sports drug abuse in China.    But its sports officials changed perspective to look into  the  headache on Tuesday [5 April] for a cure.    An Anti-Doping China'94 seminar was held to arouse the  attention of all those who call the shots in sporting activities  in the country's 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous  regions.    Also present at the seminar were the principals from all  China's physical education institutions and the top officials  from its ministerial sports associations.    Central warning was sounded to alert freewheeling athletes.    Wu Shaozu, director of the State Commission for Sports and  Physical Culture, emphasized doping controls through clear  stipulation, tight check and harsh penalty.    "Actions must be taken," said the sports minister who took  his first trip abroad to attend the Second World Anti-Doping  Congress in Moscow in 1989.    The number of positive cases reported on Chinese athletes in  national and international events is appalling to the central  control of the country's sports mechanism.    From a Chinese markswoman failing her test during a World  Cup  meet in late 1987 up till January this year, 33 Chinese were  tested positive for performance-enhancing substances, mainly  anabolic steroids.    These athletes were in 13 sports of shooting, speed skating,  modern pentathlon, track and field, volleyball, swimming,  wrestling, judo, sporting acrobatics, canoeing, weightlifting,  boxing and rhythmic gymnastics.    Among the caught dopers were world and Olympic champions as  well as global and continental record setters.    "We cannot afford to remain passive in merely detecting and  penalizing them," said Yuan Weimin, vice-sports minister and  director of China's anti-doping committee set up in July 1992 as  a subcommittee under the National Olympic Committee.    Yuan said that China first conducted doping tests nationwide  in 1988 and built an IOC-approved doping control laboratory the  following year.    "But each year there always appear athletic drug abusers to  tarnish China's sports achievement," said Yuan.    After six years of trials and errors, the Chinese sports  commission decided to take an active role.    "We are shifting focus from detection to education and  prevention," said Wu Tuesday.    "It's because there are still people who slight the works of  the anti-doping committee," Yuan said.    He recalled that China launched its first intensive  anti-doping effort prior to the Barcelona Olympics when  pamphlets were published on moral and medical side-effects of  drug abuse.    Yuan's committee has written down a stipulation of 15 rules  concerning banned substances and later added rules concerning  nutrition food and beverage. "China's principle in developing  sports is to better the physique of the entire population," he  explained.    Wu hit home the key point of the seminar when he said that a  decree in his name would soon be issued to draw the line between  medical treatment and performance-enhancing build-up; between  individual venture and collaboration among athletes, doctors,  coaches and even officials.    Penalties, Wu ordered, will be from moral criticism to  disciplinary and even legal actions.    Yang Tianle, China's member on the IOC Medical Commission  who  gave an in-depth lecture on anti-doping Tuesday, added still  another line between intentional activity and medical illiteracy.    Now the lines have been drawn between the do's and don'ts in  China's anti-doping campaign, offenders, be they individual  athletes or collaborative teams, will be penalized as severely  as international federations do or maybe more so to thwart the  practice among the Chinese, Wu concluded.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Nafta Countdown: White House deal makers harvest support for Nafta SUPPPORT for the North American Free Trade Agreement mounted yesterday as the White House began to deliver written promises to various interest groups, particularly on agriculture, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. Opposition leaders tried to blunt momentum with harsh criticism of the Administration's deal-making. Ms Lori Wallach, an anti-Nafta leader, announced the formation of the 'Nafta Pork Patrol' to document and make public the deal-making surrounding the Nafta vote. From five to eight pro-Nafta votes were gained by an Administration promise to order an investigation into Canadian wheat imports if a dispute over alleged Canadian subsidies is not resolved in 60 days. The investigation could result in tariffs and quotas, although there is no guarantee that it will. Mr Jeff Lundberg, president of the National Association of Wheat Farmers, said Canadian wheat exports to the US soared from 10.5m bushes in 1988-89 to 47.8m bushels in 1992-93 with the help of subsidies and predatory pricing methods. However, some farm analysts believe Canada only made headway for its exports after the US used subsidies to sell its wheat abroad, causing supply shortfalls and raising prices. Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the international trade subcommittee, took to the House floor to defend the White House. 'This Administration has repaired the weaknesses of the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement and the Bush Administration's Nafta. The Nafta is now a good deal for wheat and sugar farmers,' he said. Representatives of citrus growers, who yesterday were preparing to announce support for Nafta, said they had 'a honey of a deal.' The Administration promised not to agree to a Uruguay Round deal which would cut US citrus tariffs any more than 15 per cent. Also promised was a temporary rise in tariffs on Mexican citrus if prices fall below a certain level.</p>

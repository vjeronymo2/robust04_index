			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Spanish financier in write-off move to avoid lawsuits Mr Javier de la Rosa, the Spanish financier being sued by the Kuwait Investment Office in connection with the collapse of Grupo Torras, the KIO's Spanish holding company, is to write off his domestic business interests in an attempt to ward off a fresh round of threatened lawsuits. The lawsuits are being brought by minority shareholders in Mr de la Rosa's loss-making Barcelona investment holding company, Grand Tibidabo. The write-offs, to be unveiled at Tibidabo's general meeting today, are viewed in Madrid as the final chapter in Mr de la Rosa's extraordinary career - a career marked by acquisitions on behalf of the KIO and by a spreading web of investments that turned the 47-year-old businessman into one of the richest men in Spain. Mr de la Rosa, who resigned as Grand Tibidabo's chairman in May amid growing shareholder hostility, is to sell his 26 per cent equity in the company back to Tibidabo for a token one peseta, allowing a capital reduction that will help Tibidabo clean up its balance sheet. Mr de la Rosa's stake represents Pta4.1bn (Dollars 31.6m) on the basis of the nominal value of the company's shares. Tibidabo lost Pta10.9bn last year, a shortfall that took into account provisions for outstanding loans to Mr de la Rosa of some Pta4.3bn. Under the chairmanship of Mr de la Rosa, the had company declared a 1993 loss of Pta319m. The dramatically increased deficit followed an audit by Ernst &amp; Young following Mr de la Rosa's resignation. Tibidabo was created in 1991 by Mr de la Rosa to serve as his own investment vehicle at a time when he was deputy chairman of Grupo Torras. The following year Mr de la Rosa severed his relations with the KIO and Grupo Torras. In spite of Mr de la Rosa's write-off at Tibidabo, lawyers representing the company's 9,000 small shareholders are understood to be considering legal action against the former chairman after today's annual meeting. Mr de la Rosa, together with other senior Grupo Torras executives, is already facing lawsuits in Madrid and London brought by the KIO alleging fraud and mismanagement. He is also being investigated by Spain's fiscal authorities in connection with alleged unpaid taxes.</p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Filtronic Comtek priced at 105p - Valuation of cellular components group well below expectations Shares in Filtronic Comtek, a manufacturer of components for the cellular mobile telecommunications industry, were priced yesterday at 105p each. This values the group at Pounds 44.1m, well below expectations which had ranged as high as Pounds 60m. The company is placing 23.8m shares - 57 per cent per cent of the enlarged equity - with institutional investors. The flotation price is understood to have been marked down 'to a more realistic' level after discussions with potential investors and in the light of market conditions. In recent weeks several new issues - including Independent British Healthcare, Martin Retail Group and Seaperfect - have been postponed while a handful of other recently listed companies are trading well below their offer prices. Mr Tim Linacre, a director of corporate finance at Panmure Gordon, the underwriter, sponsor and broker to the Filtronic Comtek issue, acknowledged that the price was 'at the bottom of the range' of forecasts. He pointed out, however, that under a share option scheme covering five directors and other key employees, exercisable over the next six years, a further 6.85m shares could be issued lifting the group's market capitalisation, based on the flotation price, to Pounds 51.3m. Mr Linacre admitted that the new issue market had been 'a bit sticky' in the wake of the share price collapse of some recent new issues such as Aerostructures Hamble. However, he said there had been good demand from institutions for Filtronic Comtek shares, 'which had been priced sensibly'. Under the placing 9.5m shares are being sold by existing shareholders including Professor David Rhodes, the Leeds University academic who formed the original Filtronic company in 1977. Filtronic Comtek was demerged from Filtronic at the end of June. Prof Rhodes, the executive chairman, is raising Pounds 1.4m through the placing but will retain an 11.5 per cent interest in the expanded capital. The remaining 14.3m shares in the placing are being issued by the company to raise Pounds 13.8m net of expenses. Prof Rhodes said the net proceeds 'will be used to fund the expansion, including investment in new facilities, capital equipment and research and development, as well as reducing borrowings and providing funds for working capital.' Sales in the company, which manufacturers high technology products for use in cellular telephone base stations, have grown from Pounds 1.23m in 1992 to Pounds 10.2m in the year to May 31. Over the same period pre-tax profits have increased tenfold to Pounds 1.11m, equivalent to fully diluted earnings per share of 2.39p. The shares are due to start trading on Monday.</p>

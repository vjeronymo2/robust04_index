			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: US airline widens talks in Europe MR Bob Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, says the US carrier has held talks over possible partnerships with a number of European carriers, including Lufthansa, British Midland, Air France, SAS, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Speaking after his company's annual meeting in Texas, Mr Crandall said: 'We haven't been able to structure a deal that makes sense for us and a European partner.' However, he said talks were continuing although he did not specify which carriers these involved. Although talks in the past had covered equity investments, discussions under way now were more about marketing relationships, he said.</p>

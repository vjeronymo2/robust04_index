			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) The price at which the transaction was executed; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The specific triggering event, identified above in paragraph 2(a), which caused the cross-trade transaction to occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. (a) Each cross-trade must be effected at the closing price for the equity securities involved on the date of the transaction, as quoted by the exchange on which such securities are principally traded or by the NASDAQ National Market System (NASDAQ). In the case of domestic equity securities traded over-the-counter, other than those traded on NASDAQ, the price must be the mean between the closing daily ``bid'' and ``asked'' prices on the date of the transactions, obtained from recognized independent sources, unless such securities have actually traded within 24 hours of the cross-trade transaction in which case the price must be the last sale price for the securities. If more than one source is used by BFM to price a particular domestic equity security traded over-the-counter, then the price must be equal to the average of the highest current independent bid and lowest current independent offer obtained from such sources. No foreign equity securities, other than those traded on a recognized foreign securities exchange for which market quotations are readily available, shall be cross-traded by the Accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The equity securities involved in the cross-trade are those for which there is a generally recognized market with adequate pricing information to enable BFM to use the Optimization Program for the Accounts in the transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The cross-trade must involve less than 5 percent of the aggregate average daily trading volume of the equity securities which are the subject of the transaction for the week immediately preceding the completion of the transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. For any cross-trade opportunity where equity securities available for sale from a Selling Account may be sold to more than one Buying Account, each cross-trade opportunity shall be allocated first to the Buying Account which is ranked by the Optimization Program as being furthest from optimality, measured on a numerical basis at the time of the transaction, until such Account is brought up to par with the Account which is next furthest from optimality. Such Accounts shall then be allocated cross-trade opportunities on a pro rata basis until the Accounts are brought up to the level of the next Account which is furthest from optimality. This allocation process shall continue until all cross-trade opportunities involving the equity securities in question are exhausted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. (a) BFM furnishes the Independent Fiduciary for each Plan Account participating in the cross-trade program at least once every three months, and not later than 45 days following the period to which it related, a report disclosing:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A list of all cross-trade transactions engaged in on behalf of the Plan Account during the period; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) With respect to each cross-trade transaction, the actual price used to effect the transaction and the identity of the pricing source, as well as the highest and lowest reported prices at which the equity securities involved in the transaction were traded on the date of such transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The authorizing Independent Fiduciary for each Plan Account participating in the program is furnished with a summary report at least once per year. The summary must be furnished within 45 days after the end of the period to which it relates, and must contain the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A description of the total amount of the Plan Account's assets, by type of equity security, involved in cross-trade transactions during the period;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A description of BFM's cross-trade practices, if such practices have changed materially during the period covered by the summary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A statement that the Independent Fiduciary's authorization of cross-trade transactions may be terminated upon receipt by BFM of the Independent Fiduciary's written notice to that effect; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A statement that the Independent Fiduciary's authorization of the Plan Account's participation in the cross-trade program will continue in effect unless it is terminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

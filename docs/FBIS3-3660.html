			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung and Linda Choy in Beijing] </F>   [Text] The People's Liberation Army (PLA) should come  under the supervision of parliament to avoid abuses of power, an  NPC meeting was told yesterday. Citing abuses by the Communist  Party-controlled troops, vice-chairman of the Guangzhou  Municipal People's Congress Yao Jiahua said lack of supervision  over the PLA might lead to corruption and malpractice.    The role and function of the NPC and the development of a  legal system in China dominated the congress yesterday. Some  deputies were at a loss as to what contribution they could make  in addition to joining the annual session in Beijng and making  one inspection tour of the regions.    Mr Yao said: "The lack of supervision over the PLA has  created some malpractices. In some cases, the PLA has competed  with people for profits by joining businesses. The troops'  respect for the law is also weak. There have been a lot of  rumours about the PLA taking part in smuggling and official  profiteering activities. The PLA is not living in a vacuum. It  is vulnerable to corruption and should be put under the  supervision of the NPC," Mr Yao said.    Chairman of the Guangdong People's Provincial People's  Congress Lin Ruo said measures should be implemented to ensure  the rule of law. "Although the NPC has passed many pieces of  legislation during the past year, they were not executed at  local levels, where officials simply rule according to their own  will," he said. He was joined by another Guangdong delegate, Li  Weixin, who added that the rule of law in China had been  hindered by the lack of legal provision for lawyers. "Without  legal protection, it is very difficult for lawyers to carry out  investigations and argue for defendants in court," he said.  Eleven drafts have been made of the Lawyers Act since work on  it began in 1982. Mr Li called on the Government to speed up  work on the Lawyers Act to ensure proper protection for  defendants in court.    Complaining of the low efficiency of the NPC, a Liaoning  provincial delegate said the 13-day session could be further  shortened if sufficient preparations were made, such as sending  government reports to delegates for study before the meeting.  Li Jin, a vice-chairman of the Liaoyang Municipal People's  Congress, said the work of the NPC Standing Committee should be  improved. "We shouldn't merely attend the annual meeting and  join an inspection tour just to be lectured on how good the  national situation is," he said.</p>

What is your  strategy to defuse it?    [Sanchez] We want to achieve significant growth levels,  comparable with those of Chile and Argentina through  capitalization, but with a significant social component.    Then comes the people's participation program that makes our  representative democracy a participative one through the use of  a great asset of ours; a strong understanding of the community.  Do not forget that two thirds of our population are Indian  groups that, unlike western societies, favor the community  rather than the individual.    Taking advantage of this, we want to create a society  capable  of achieving significant employment and high social justice  levels.    We are seeking to restore exports. In trade terms, Bolivia  lost about 90 percent over the past 14 years. We are currently  exporting drugs and people.    [Solans] The agreements that you have just signed with the  Argentine Government seem to be aimed at achieving this goal ...    [Sanchez] They promote investments by both nations [Bolivia  and Argentina] in my country to establish a raw-material  processing industry (the processing of national raw materials in  another country and the purchase of the finished products) that  will allow us to export lines in which Argentina is no longer  competitive as a consequence of its high labor costs. This way  we will export products and not people.    This step, along with an increased access to the U.S.  markets, about which we will ask U.S. Vice President Al Gore  when he visits La Paz within a few days, should allow us to  voluntarily eradicate coca crops.    [Solans] Is Mercosur [Common Market of the South] one of  Bolivia's goals?    [Sanchez] We are part of the River Plate system and we want  to be closer because Argentina and Brazil are our great markets.  We note that Mercosur's dynamics involves expansion, but there  should me much more opening and honesty.    With tariff lists that have more exceptions than uses, I  believe the honest approach has been neglected.    If we are allowed access, NAFTA may lead us into a dynamic  situation. Bolivia wants to become a bridge between Mercosur  and the Andean market.    [Solans] Concerning your talks with the Argentine  Government,  did you receive any response on the immigrants who do not have  any legal papers?    [Sanchez] We talked about establishing a new period for  Bolivians who already are here to gain legal status. We also  talked about enforcing new restrictions on the border and making  entry into Argentina more difficult.    Bolivia wants to give more jobs to Bolivians and this is the  goal of the free trade agreement between the two countries. We  are attempting to create a relationship similar to the one  existing between the United States and Mexico.    Deploying more guards on the border is no solution because  barriers vanish with a little corruption. The solution is to  create jobs in Bolivia and gain access to the Argentine market.    [Solans] And the gas sales to our country?    [Sanchez] Significant progress has been achieved. We have  reached agreement on an indefinite, free access in both  directions of gas and hydrocarbon by-products. We are very  content with having defined this market.    A three-year contract has also been signed in which a price  list has been established for gas because Argentina is paying  less than we should receive. The United States, with a  deregulated economy, is paying almost double. We understand  that the Argentine economic process does not permit any  traumatic cost-of-living surges and we will have to follow up on  this. We trust there will be a gas market here for Bolivia and  that there will be a market in Bolivia for certain Argentine oil  by-products.    [Solans] What reaction might stem from the Bolivian Armed  Forces over the impending extradition of former General [Luis]  Garcia Meza?    [Sanchez] None, we believe. We are enforcing a sentence.  The institutions are not corrupt -- men are.    The trial lasted seven years. He has been a fugitive for  five years. He was discharged from the Armed Forces. It has  been clearly established in Bolivia that this does not represent  an attack against an institution, but against a man who has  seriously damaged it.    [Solans] Do the lower echelons also understand it this way?    [Sanchez] I believe so. At one time it was clear that a  group of officers were the culprits. As time went by there has  been a natural renewal within the Armed Forces and now it is  understood that this case belongs to the past and justice must  be meted out.    [Solans] And in the political circles?    [Sanchez] We don't know. Some people are fearful of what  Garcia Meza might say. I believe this is not the case, that  everything was disclosed at the proper time and that, despite  speculations by the press, there will be nothing new. I believe  satisfaction prevails because impunity has been punished,  something that is not usual in our countries.    [Solans] Is it true, as some political circles in La Paz  claim, there are officials in your government who closely  cooperated with Garcia Meza's regime?    [Sanchez] No. Thank God I have no one who was linked to  drug trafficking or Garcia Meza. Our party was not involved,  while other parties, for various reasons, were involved in Gen.  Garcia Meza's project.    [Solans] Which ones?    [Sanchez] General Hugo Banzer's Nationalist Democratic  Action. Nevertheless, they moved away when they realized the  nature of that government.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> LATEST INJURY LIST HAS ROBINSON SCRAMBLING TO BUILD UP RANKS  </P> <P> Ram Coach John Robinson isn't ready to deal with all the reverberations of the  jarring collision between cornerbacks Jerry Gray and Alfred Jackson during  Friday night's 37-10 exhibition loss to the Washington Redskins.  </P> <P> There is, however, no getting around certain facts: Gray and Jackson probably  will be out at least a month; the roster must be trimmed to 47 players on  Monday, and, if the Rams had to play today, Latin Berry -- a rookie who is  making the conversion from college fullback to pro cornerback -- would be a  starter.  </P> <P> "We've got some damage control to do," Robinson said Saturday. "Obviously,  we're desperate, but we're still trying to evaluate our position. I just can't  tell you today who's going where and who's going to do what. Frankly, I'm not  sure yet.  </P> <P> "Are we going to move somebody out there (to cornerback)? Is a great corner  going to walk in here tomorrow like in the movie, 'The Natural'? We have some  decisions to make, but we have some time. So before we make the decisions,  we're going to review our options. When we're ready with a plan, we'll let you  know."  </P> <P> That plan could include a trade for a cornerback. Good corners don't come  cheap, however, which means the Rams, already short on bodies, probably would  have to part with some high-round draft choices. They also could hold out and  see who shows up on the waiver wire after Monday.  </P> <P> In any case, if the Rams' Sept. 9 season opener against the Green Bay Packers  were today, they would have 17 players who would be out or questionable, and a  number of others who would be playing without having practiced much in recent  weeks.  </P> <P> Here's a look at the Ram medical wards, by position:  </P> <P> </P> <P> SECONDARY  </P> <P>  -- Cornerback Jerry Gray (who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Saturday),  out four to six weeks.  </P> <P>  -- Cornerback Darryl Henley (hip), out for as much as the first half of the  season.  </P> <P>  -- Cornerback Alfred Jackson (groin injury), probably out four weeks. "It's a  little bit uncertain," Robinson said, "but we think it's a major injury."  </P> <P>  -- Safety Michael Stewart, healthy but still a holdout.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LINEBACKER  </P> <P>  -- Mel Owens (back), out four to eight weeks.  </P> <P>  -- Larry Kelm (who underwent knee surgery Saturday), out four to six weeks.  </P> <P>  -- Fred Strickland (hamstring), could be available against Green Bay.  </P> <P>  -- Frank Stams (slight groin strain), probable. "If Frank's hurt, I don't want  to know about it," Robinson said.  </P> <P> (The situation at outside linebacker improved Saturday when Kevin Greene  signed. But if Stams and Strickland can't play the Rams will face the Packers  without their two starting inside linebackers and both backups).  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEFENSIVE LINE  </P> <P>  -- Brian Smith (knee), Bill Hawkins (knee), Mike Piel (elbow) and Alvin Wright  (quadriceps) are all recovering from injuries, but will play in the season  opener. "We've only got four players, but they all made it through the game,"  Robinson said, managing a smile.  </P> <P>  -- Tackle Doug Reed, healthy but holding out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RECEIVER  </P> <P>  -- Henry Ellard (hamstring), should practice this week and "should" be  available for the season opener.  </P> <P>  -- Flipper Anderson (hamstring), see Ellard. Robinson says Anderson's injury  is more serious than Ellard's, which the coach describes as "nagging."  </P> <P>  -- Aaron Cox (hamstring), doubtful for Green Bay.  </P> <P>  -- Tony Lomack (hamstring), out at least one week.  </P> <P>  -- Tight end Damone Johnson, healthy but holding out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OFFENSIVE LINE  </P> <P>  -- Tackle Jackie Slater (dislocated toe), will miss at least one game, maybe  two.  </P> <P>  -- Tackle Robert Cox (cracked ribs and separated cartilage), possible for  Green Bay game.  </P> <P>  -- Tackle Irv Pankey (back), probable for the opener.  </P> <P>  -- Guard Joe Milinichik (broken thumb), questionable, but could play against  the Packers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RUNNING BACK  </P> <P>  -- Cleveland Gary (back), out most of the last month and has yet to play a  preseason game in his career. He could make the opener if he can make it  through a week of practice . . . something he hasn't been able to do this  season.  </P> <P> "Other than that, we're OK," Robinson said.  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Former Ram defensive end Gary Jeter, a 13-year veteran who was released Tuesday  by the New England Patriots, failed his physical with the Rams Saturday. "He's  not going to be with us," Coach John Robinson said. "He has a back injury that  is at a place where the doctors recommend that he retire." . . . Bright Spot  Dept.: "Last night, we played a game where we had very little offense, threw an  interception, fumbled the ball and had a kickoff run back (for a touchdown)  against us, all things that are usually disastrous," Robinson said. "But I was  pleased with the punter." Keith English, acquired Tuesday in a trade with the  San Diego Chargers, averaged 41.1 yards in six kicks against Washington.  </P> <P> The injury tidal wave is washing over the Rams and causing a plethora of  related problems. "It's shocking how many problems it causes," Robinson said.  "There are so many people not practicing that the ones who are are tired from  taking extra turns. There's problems on special teams. Everywhere you turn,  there's damage control. But part of winning in this league is dealing with  these kinds of problems. We'll find solutions. If we play these first three  games in a highly emotional state and play efficient and effective football, we  can win all three." . . . The Rams, who weren't too happy when the schedule was  announced and discovered they had a bye in Week 4, are now looking at it as a  blessing.  </P></p>

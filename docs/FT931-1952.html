			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Frogmore slides 4% to Pounds 4m LITIGATION COSTS and increased interest charges held back interim profits at Frogmore Estates, the property company. At the pre-tax level they fell 4 per cent to Pounds 4.16m in the six months to December 31. Turnover rose 30 per cent to Pounds 22.2m on the back of a sharply increased rent roll, which grew from Pounds 13.5m to Pounds 18m through acquisitions, rent reviews and new lettings. Interest charges, however, rose from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 2.5m. Borrowings at the end of December stood at Pounds 55m, compared to Pounds 45.8m at the end of June and Pounds 7m the previous December. Frogmore de-geared heavily as the property recession bit, but has since taken on new borrowing. Frogmore also included a Pounds 1.5m charge for litigation costs arising from a dispute over the acquisition of Land Investors by BCPH in 1986. Mr David Wilmot, finance director, said the issue was now closed and no further costs would be incurred. Earnings per share were 6.9p (7.5p). The interim dividend is 3.6p (3.4p).</p>

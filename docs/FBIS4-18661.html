			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "Latvian Ambassador Asks For German </F> Help"]    [Text] Bonn, 7 April -- Latvian Ambassador to Germany  [Andris] Kesteris has asked the Federal Government to join other  Western states in supporting Latvia's sovereignty and to brand  as a "provocation" the decree by Russian President Yeltsin on  the planned establishment of Russian military bases. Kesteris  said in an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE on Thursday [7  April] that Moscow's denial of Yeltsin's intention to establish  military bases in Latvia is questionable. The denial only  stated that Yeltsin's statements were quoted "in the wrong  context." The ambassador pointed out, however, that he saw  copies of Yeltsin's original "document." It also mentioned  Latvia. The agreement on the continued limited operation of the  Russian radar station Skrunda, negotiated between Russia and  Latvia, cannot be interpreted as an agreement on establishing a  military basis, Kesteris stressed. Latvia has allowed Russia to  operate the radar bases for four more years and has granted  Moscow an additional one and a half years to dismantle the  station. Kesteris pointed out that Russia is now apparently  trying to influence the internal situation in Latvia with  initiatives like Yeltsin's "document." In Latvia, a  "controversial debate" about the agreement with Moscow is going  on: "It is difficult to achieve a consensus in the country on  the continued existence of the base for another five and a half  years." Kesteris cited another possible reason for Moscow's  behavior: "The Russian Government is too weak to implement the  agreement in Russia. For this reason, Latvia is being provoked  not to sign the agreement." The signing is scheduled for the  end of April. "If Russia does not withdraw the document  unequivocally, it will be very difficult for the Latvian  president to travel to Moscow to sign the agreement."    The Foreign Ministry announced that Yeltsin's spokesman has  denied statements about Latvia. The doubts concerning the  negotiations between Russia and Estonia on the troop withdrawal,  which arose during the 18th round of talks in Moscow on  Wednesday and which have again questioned the withdrawal that  was to be completed by 31 August, need not be the last word.  Russia is facing pressure at home. Moscow's ultimatum that  Estonia must issue residence permits for all 10,000 military  pensioners and that, in addition to the money that has already  been granted, it is to provide another $23 million for the  construction of apartments for officers returning to Russia  might be a tactical maneuver, it was pointed out. Another round  of talks is likely to follow. Germany continues to demand that  Russia should complete the troop withdrawal by 31 August.  Yeltsin also announced the establishment of Russian military  bases in several CIS republics. Bonn stated that Russia also  maintains military bases in neighboring countries that used to  belong to the Soviet Union. This normally takes place on a  contractual basis.</p>

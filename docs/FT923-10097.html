			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Company to buy village TEXACO, the multinational petrochemicals company, has offered to buy a village after complaints from local residents about the drawbacks of living next to a refinery. The proposal, which may cost the company up to Pounds 2.5m to find new homes, has delighted the 100 residents of Rhoscrowther, Dyfed, which lies close to the company's refinery near Pembroke Dock. A campaign was launched by the villagers against Texaco six months ago after a small explosion led to fears that the village could be destroyed if there was a catastrophe. In spite of a report from the Health and Safety Executive that there was no long-term danger, the villagers continued to press for a move. Texaco said yesterday that as part of a 'good neighbour' policy it was offering to buy all the homes in Rhoscrowther and to pay all moving and legal expenses.</p>

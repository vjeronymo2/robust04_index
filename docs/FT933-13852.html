			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): Regard it as a roof, not an investment - Prices may well have bottomed, making this the buyer's year. But don't expect your home to outperform equities - Buying your house 1, Is this the right time? THE RELENTLESS search for the bottom of the housing market has been on for several years, but every time that new house-price lows appear to have been hit, the next set of indices shows further falls. The many false dawns, since the collapse of prices in 1989, have made analysts increasingly circumspect about predicting the timing or strength of the recovery. Many of the right ingredients have been in place for some time. Base rates have dropped from 10 to 6 per cent since the UK left the exchange rate mechanism last September, and the standard variable mortgage rate of 7.99 per cent (prevailing at the beginning of July) is the lowest for over 20 years. If there is another base rate cut this year, mortgage rates should drop further. The effect on affordability is marked. The main graph shows that, with mortgage rates of 7.99 per cent, servicing the loan on an average-priced house now takes 18.9 per cent of average gross income, compared with 44.4 per cent in 1990 when base rates were 15 per cent. This affordability ratio, which is calculated by dividing average monthly earnings by the amount needed to finance an 80 per cent mortgage for the average-priced house at prevailing interest rates, is now close to 1972 levels of 17.4 per cent. Prevailing tax reliefs are taken into account. Mortgage rates and house prices are two of the factors that have come together to convince analysts that this is the year that the market touches its low point before a slow, if halting, recovery. Gary Marsh, house price specialist at the Halifax building society, the largest lender, which accounts for about one in five mortgages sold, says that, although prices have not stabilised, they have bottomed out. Since last September, the monthly Halifax house price index, which reached a peak of 228.5 in July 1989, has hovered around 200. It has been marked by dips and rises since September, and Marsh says this pattern can be expected to continue, with the result that house prices will end the year at much the same level as they began. He expects prices to rise by 5 per cent at the end of next year. John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS, also doubts whether there will be price rises this year, and foresees a gradual rise next year. Prices are not expected to rise quickly, because of the continuing availability of empty property. Repossessions fell from their 1991 peak of 75,540 to 68,540 last year, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, but Wriglesworth expects a total of 70,000 repossessions this year, which will continue to act as a drag on prices. He points to a situation in which there is now an oversupply of property which people do not want - the repossessions - and an undersupply of good-quality housing at low prices. Traditionally, the market has depended for its movement on those at the bottom end of the market selling their homes and 'trading up'. If repossessions act to keep prices low, the problem of negative equity is compounded for those who first entered the market in the late 1980s. Their homes are worth less than the value of their mortgages, so they cannot afford to sell and trade up. However, Halifax's Gary Marsh says that this problem is being overcome, because the fall in house prices has enabled today's first-time buyers to enter the housing market at a higher level and to step over the heads of those who are stuck at the bottom of the housing rung. If we are bumping along the bottom, then this is as good a time to buy as any in the past six months or so, and it should remain a good time into next year. This appears to be borne out by the increase in levels of transactions this year, which also suggests higher levels of confidence on the part of buyers. The Adams Residential Property Index, which is compiled by James R Adams, a market research consultancy, and which monitors housing completions made by solicitors, shows that the number of completions in May exceeded 100,000, from a low of just under 60,000 in February. The May figure is the highest since last August (when stamp duty on homes worth under Pounds 250,000 was reimposed) and is also 6 per cent up on the same time last year, though it is down on the same month in the previous years back to 1988. James R Adams is predicting that monthly completions will hover around the 100,000 level for the remainder of the year. Potential buyers have also benefited since the Budget, from the removal of 1 per cent stamp duty on house purchases costing between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 60,000, and it is possible that the gradual falls in unemployment since February have helped confidence. But if you are choosing your moment in order to buy property as an investment, rather than as a roof over your head, you are embarking on a risky course. House prices tend to be less volatile than equities, but property is not consistently the best performing investment. The lower chart compares the performance of the FT-All Share (without income re-invested) with that of property prices, both in real terms since the end of 1965 to date. During this period, houses have outperformed equities. However, if we had taken 1973 as our base year, or any subsequent year, the return from equities would have been better to date, despite the 1974 and 1987 stock market crashes and the housing market booms of the late 1970s and the 1980s. There are few indications of another strong increase in house prices in the near future. Although prices may have bottomed, a strong recovery depends on the strength of the economic recovery as well as supply and demand in the market. The housing market price booms of the 1970s and the late 1980s were a legacy of inflation. House prices rose faster than interest rates, and mortgage debt was eroded in real terms, so that homeowners made profits out of borrowing. But expectations now are of slow economic recovery within a low inflation environment. Demand is also not expected to be as robust in the 1990s as it was in the 1980s. Demographic changes indicate that there will be a decline in the first-time buyer age group of 25-30 years as the baby-boomers of the 1960s get older. Pressure on prices will be maintained, according to Marsh, by shortages of land for house building; but, despite this, he does not envisage house prices rising faster than earnings over the next five years, unless the economy over-inflates. In the cautious words of one analyst: 'With hindsight, we will be able to say that the recovery began in 1993.'</p>

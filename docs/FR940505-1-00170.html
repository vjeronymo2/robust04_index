			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of these and other potential drawbacks, EPA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it would be preferable at this point in time to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandating the use of these control technologies by all ships when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are in California ports. There are at least three reasons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> why other solutions should be pursued at this time. First, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shown above, not all ships are high emitters. Therefore, it does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not make sense to mandate special technologies for all ships,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since this would mean imposing costly retrofits on some existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ships that are not high emitters. Second, and more importantly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not all ships spend a lot of operating time in California ports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It does not make sense to mandate permanent, expensive control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies for ships that visit California ports only once or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> twice a year which, as noted above, is the case for approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60 percent of the vessels that use California's ports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the regulation of oceangoing marine vessels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered in the United States has been traditionally undertaken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the United States Coast Guard, and through international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations such as the International Maritime Organization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (IMO), for ships registered outside the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> International trade may be significantly harmed by unilateral and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contradictory actions taken by various countries around the world  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandating different control methods and technologies for vessels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engaged in international trade. EPA believes that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate at this time to avoid unilaterally mandating the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of control technologies or other methods on ships that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with the technologies currently being advocated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States in the IMO. <FOOTCITE>91</FOOTCITE>  This is especially important in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the South Coast region because approximately 80 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> larger marine vessels that call on the LA ports, for example, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered in foreign countries. EPA believes that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important to create a regime that will encourage all ship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators and owners to reduce their emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while in California ports without creating significant problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for international trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 91 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The IMO is currently developing an international agreement to control emissions from ships on international voyages. The IMO subcommittee working on this project (Bulk Chemicals Handling) was charged by the IMO with achieving a 30 percent worldwide reduction in ship NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions and a 50 percent SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction. The subcommittee is currently considering a rule for new engines only. The resolution of this issue will clearly have significant ramifications for this FIP. See Section (2)(A) Fee Categories, below, for additional discussion of this effort. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Emission control strategies must also take into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic realities. Ships and ports bring more than pollution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California. They also perform the obvious function of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transporting products and raw materials to the area for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing and production purposes, and they bring jobs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money. Many millions of dollars of imports and exports travel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach every day, on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their way from the Midwest to the Far East or vice versa. Any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program for the control of emissions from ships and ports must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also consider the effects of such a program on this trade and on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the South Coast economy. Inappropriate treatment could move the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade out of the area, or even out of the country, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corresponding economic effects. While it is true that trade has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> centered in the South Coast because the area is well situated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accept it, having adequate facilities for moving and processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the products delivered, it is also true that emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategies should stress appropriate regulations which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balance emissions reductions with possible negative impacts on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For all of these reasons, EPA is proposing a flexible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control strategy for the reduction of emissions from ships at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> port. This strategy will rely on economic incentives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage operators and owners of ships that frequently use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California's South Coast ports to take the steps necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce their emissions. Specifically, this strategy involves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposing user fees for ships that use ports in the South Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> region. These fees will be based on the level of emissions of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ship using the port, among other things. EPA is proposing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three-tier fee structure, as more thoroughly described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like other emission charges proposed today, the ship fee will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on a price of $10,000 per ton of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions emitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the atmosphere.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to encouraging ship operators and owners to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> install and use emission control systems, the program contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two other features that should help reduce marine vessels'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribution to California's pollution while ships are berthed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> port and while they are operating at sea. First, ship operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may receive a reduction in the fees outlined below if they use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> onshore power sources instead of internally generated power while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are at port (this is called ``cold ironing''). Second, ship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators may receive a reduction in fees if they use a relocated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Santa Barbara shipping channel. EPA is proposing that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipping channel be located at least 70 miles from the shore to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease the amount of marine emissions that are transported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> onshore by prevailing winds. Both of these aspects of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program are described in greater detail below. No fee will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed any shipper who uses the lowest emitting class of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine, cold irons and avoids the Ventura air basin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are several advantages to this type of emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control program. First, it allows a ship operator or owner to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make decisions about which control technologies to adopt, if any,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based not only on the characteristics of a particular vessel but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also based on the extent to which the vessel uses South Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ports. Those ships that use South Coast ports more frequently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be faced with higher annual fees and therefore will have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater incentive to install more efficient emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices to reduce those annual fees. Vessels that use these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ports infrequently are not faced with the same level of annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees and would therefore probably elect to pay the fee instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installing more expensive emission control devices. EPA believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this is a fair strategy because these vessels contribute less to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall regional air quality problems than those vessels that use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these ports more often. At the same time, payment of a fee by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel that infrequently uses port facilities is justified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the vessel is contributing to local air quality while it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses the port.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

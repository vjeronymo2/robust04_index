			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Vickers There is a brutal simplicity about Vickers' rights issue. Shareholders wondering where their Pounds 60m will go need look no further than the Pounds 66m hole punched in the balance sheet by exceptional charges in the past two years. The recession has ruthlessly proved that Vickers is simply not big enough to cope with Rolls-Royce Motors' profit swings. It need not have been that way. Vickers came into the recession with no net debt and could have negotiated a good price for Rolls in 1990. But having set its face against Sir Ron Brierley's unrealistic demerger plan, the board hesitated too long about an outright sale. After this, there is precious little point in looking for a buyer until Rolls wins back its spurs. However little the management deserves the rights cash, the involvement of Cazenove will surely be enough to ram the issue home. Tanks should provide steady medium-term income and, now costs have been cut, the short-term recovery potential is there. What remains shrouded is the long-term future of expensive hand-built vehicles such as the Bentley Continental and the Challenger tank.</p>

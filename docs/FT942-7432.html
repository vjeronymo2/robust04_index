			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lease rates signal puzzles gold market The gold market is mulling over the possible significance of a fall in gold lease rates to an all-time low of only 0.6 per cent. 'The market is sending a message - but it is impossible to decipher at present,' says Mr Andy Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland. It may be at a turning point, he says. But whether it is ready for another leg of the bull market or whether prices will fall is not clear. He points out the gold bullion market is particularly liquid at present for at least four reasons: Much gold was swapped for US dollars in advance of what was seen as an inevitable increase in US interest rates at the May 17 meeting of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank; More central banks are willing to lend gold and to lend it for longer (lending in this case meaning that the metal is sold for cash while at the same time the seller arranges a futures contract to buy it back later); Producers, usually borrowers of gold, have been buying back forward sales; And renewed gold futures buying by US funds in May led to extra gold lending because commercial banks offset futures positions by buying then lending gold. Mr Jeffrey Nichols, managing director of American Precious Metals Advisors, suggests in his latest MetalsFAX newsletter that net sales of gold last year by central banks and other official bodies amounted to 'a fantastic' 900 to 1,000 tonnes, up from 653 tonnes in 1992, a year that included 400 tonnes sold by the Dutch central bank. His estimate is far ahead of that from Gold Fields Minerals Services, which in its recent annual review put net official sales at 475 tonnes. Mr Nichols says his estimate reflects 'several hundred tonnes of Saudi Arabian gold sales in 1993. The Saudis have been large-scale sellers of gold from 'invisible' or unrecorded holdings.' Mr Nichols also contends that the quantity of gold consumed by the jewellery industry in the US, and possibly other industrial nations, is 'significantly greater than generally believed.' He suggests jewellery consumed 2,643 tonnes of gold last year compared with the GFMS estimate of 2,302 tonnes. MetalsFAX. USDollars 7,000 a year; from APMA in the US on fax 802 425 6304</p>

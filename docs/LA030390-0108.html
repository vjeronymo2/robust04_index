			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUNNING;  </P> <P> NEW YORK'S FRED LEBOW IS IN HOSPITAL AWAITING BIOPSY RESULTS  </P> <P> Of all his storied fights and battles, this is surely Fred Lebow's toughest.  The feisty race director of the New York Marathon -- the man who invented  big-time marathons -- is today in a New York hospital, awaiting the results of  a biopsy on a growth removed from his head.  </P> <P> Lebow said it all began about a month ago when, typically, he was running.  </P> <P> "I was abroad at a marathon," he said this week from his hospital room. "I  usually run an eight- or nine-minute pace. All of a sudden, I was doing a  12-minute pace. It was hard to run. I thought, OK, no big deal. Then I went to  Belgrade and I was jogging. I was so slow. I figured it was all the traveling.  </P> <P> "I came back to New York and went jogging in Central Park. Same thing. I didn't  pay much attention to it."  </P> <P> Then, two weeks ago at a banquet, Lebow was introducing people he had known for  quite a while and mixing up their names. Something was wrong, but he didn't  know what. Without telling him, friends of Lebow's made a doctor's appointment.  A CAT scan showed a cyst or growth on his brain. He was immediately  hospitalized. Last Monday, part of the growth was removed. Results are expected  by early next week.  </P> <P> Lebow, 52, has refused to slow down. He began a running program on the roof of  the hospital. After the operation, he was slowed to a walk, which he does for  an hour in the corridor each day. His room is filled with flowers and cards,  and Lebow has been visited or called by scores of athletes whose careers have  crossed with his.  </P> <P> It has been the source of much comfort to him.  </P> <P> "Mary Decker came by today," he said. "Bill Rodgers called. The people at the  London Marathon called. I hate to be in the hospital, but I am going to fight  this. Besides, from my window I can see all the races in Central Park."  </P> <P> In town for the Los Angeles Marathon but not running it is Mexican  middle-distance star Jesus Herrera, who was second in the 1988 race.  </P> <P> Herrera will run in the 5K race, which is affiliated with the marathon and is  being staged for the first time. More than 2,000 runners are expected to take  part.  </P> <P> Herrera repeats the same sad story that other Mexican athletes have told over  the years, that of little official support and some official intervention.  </P> <P> Herrera said that if sports officials don't want an athlete to compete abroad,  they simply don't grant permission to leave the country. He said that to avoid  such a situation, he didn't tell anyone he would be running here.  </P> <P> "I just got on a plane," he said.  </P> <P> In a country that has bred some of the sport's most talented runners, it is  disheartening to hear that the problems persist. Herrera said if athletes  inquire about information on improved diets or training methods, officials  ignore them.  </P> <P> Big Brother Is a Watch: A new sports timing system will be tested in this  year's L.A. Marathon, and it may well be the shape of things to come. About 340  runners will be equipped with a timing device that, its developers say, will  provide instant and accurate timing information -- not only after the race but  also during the race.  </P> <P> The Time Tag system calls for a runner to wear a specially designed device  strapped to one wrist, programmed to identify the runner according to entry  number. The device emits a radio signal that is received as runners pass by  antennae, placed at various points along the course. The information is  processed and is supposed to provide instant race splits and updates.  </P> <P> The system has been used in the Ironman Triathlon and some other events but  never in a marathon. Twenty entrants in the Friendship Cup race -- which  consists of national teams -- will test the devices. In addition, 320 students  from the Southland will wear them.  </P> <P> Running Notes  </P> <P> Olympic sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner, who retired from the sport last  fall, announced that she has taken up marathon running and hopes to compete in  the 1996 Olympics in her new discipline. "I have the dream of running the  marathon because I just love running," she told a group in Melbourne. "I'll go  out and just run and run and run along the roads. I love the fact of running .  . . The Bolder Boulder race in May has been selected as the 1990 TAC national  women's 10K championship . . . The Goodwill Games marathon team will be  selected based on performances from last Sept. 30 through March 18. The 1990  men's national marathon championship will be held at Columbus, Ohio, on Nov.  11. Yet to be determined are the qualifying races for the World Championships  in Tokyo next year . . . Qualifying standards have been set for the Olympic  trials marathon: 2:20 or better for men and 2:45 or better for women. . . . Two  of marathon running's top women -- Joan Benoit Samuelson and Ingrid Kristiansen  -- will not run this season. Each is expecting her second child.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WATCHING THE LOS ANGELES MARATHON  </P> <P> FREEWAY RAMP CLOSURES  </P> <P> Harbor Fwy. northbound/southbound and 6th St., 7 a.m.-11 a.m.  </P> <P> Hollywood Fwy. northbound/southbound and Hollywood Blvd., 8 a.m.-1 p.m.  </P> <P> Hollywood Fwy southbound and Vine St., 7 a.m.-11 a.m.  </P> <P> Hollywood Fwy. southbound and Gower St., 8 a.m.-1 p.m.  </P> <P> Santa Monica Fwy. eastbound and westbound and Crenshaw Blvd., 8 a.m.-2 p.m.  </P> <P> PARKING: Parking near the start and finishis available at the Coliseum lots for  $5 per car and at USC lots for $6 per car.  </P> <P> ENTERTAINMENT CENTERS  </P> <P>  The start/finish and 10 locations along the course will provide spectators  with entertainment and race updates.

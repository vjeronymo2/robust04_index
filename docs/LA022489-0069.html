			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  7 CARD CLUBS AGREE TO DROP ASIAN GAME  </P> <P> Proprietors of the seven card clubs in Los Angeles County have agreed to drop a  controversial Asian betting game under a proposed revision of the state's  98-year-old gambling law.  </P> <P> In return, officials of the California Police Officers Assn. have tentatively  agreed to support legislation that would allow the clubs to return to a  recently banned fee system, under which the clubs collect a percentage of  gamblers' winnings, according to Los Angeles County Undersheriff Robert A.  Edmonds.  </P> <P> The compromise between the two sides is outlined in a proposal by  administrators of the five Los Angeles County cities that contain the casinos  -- Bell Gardens, Huntington Park, Commerce, Bell and Gardena -- to overhaul the  state's gambling laws.  </P> <P> The proposal was announced one week after card club owners won a preliminary  court battle against the Sheriff's Department, which has tried to stop clubs  from offering three popular Asian games, saying they violate state law.  </P> <P> Under the compromise, pai-gow, which is played with dominoes, would no longer  be offered in card clubs throughout the state. But Asian poker and super pan 9,  which are played with traditional playing cards, would be allowed.  </P></p>

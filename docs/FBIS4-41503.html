			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Khabarovsk June 25 TASS -- A number of  socio-political movements in Amur area, in a message to the  president, the Federal Assembly and Government of the Russian  Federation, have expressed strong disagreement with the methods  suggested by President Boris Yeltsin to combat crime.    They pointed out that the recently signed presidential  decree  runs counter not only to the norms of criminal procedure  legislation but also to major provisions of Russia's  Constitution.    The message is signed by representatives of the Khabarovsk  regional branch of the Economic Freedom Party, the territorial  organisation of the Peasant Party, and the "Land and People"  social foundation.    The signatories believe that the presidential decree will  not  protect the population against organised crime but would bring  society back to the times of universal angst, people's  suspiciousness with regard to one another, and would lead to  violations of human rights and unfounded repressions.</p>

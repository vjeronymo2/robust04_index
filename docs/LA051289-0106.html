			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW: COMICS TAKE A G-RATED STAND FOR A GOOD CAUSE  </P> <P> Comedy is not pretty, or so the saying goes. In many cases, it's not very clean  either: Attend even one or two shows on the comedy club circuit and it becomes  apparent that X-rated jokes, like the ability to exploit an amusing set of  neuroses, are practically required equipment.  </P> <P> But Monday night at the L.A. Cabaret in Encino, a comedy club that has seen its  share of bleepable humor, most of the jokes will be rated PG. There will still  be plenty of jokes about love, jokes about dates, jokes about parents, coming  of age and the general stupid behavior of inept politicians and salesclerks --  all the turf that comics love to grouse about.  </P> <P> But Monday night's show is for charity: Proceeds will benefit the programs and  services provided by the Los Angeles and Ventura County office of United  Cerebral Palsy in Van Nuys. "It gets weird if you let comics do their real  funky material during a charity event," said R. J. Johnson, the show's  co-producer. "I don't want anyone who's come to support a family cause feeling  uncomfortable."  </P> <P> The show is also a comedy contest. Now in its third year, Stand-Up Comics Take  a Stand! is limited to 80 working professional comics who reach the semifinal  round (to be held at the California Mart in downtown Los Angeles on June 16) by  winning a runoff competition at area clubs. Ten comics will compete in Monday's  L.A. Cabaret show, which is the sixth of nine runoff rounds. The Icehouse in  Pasadena will be the host for the seventh runoff May 22.  </P> <P> According to Johnson, the concept for Stand-Up Comics Take a Stand! came from  comedian Gene Mitchener, who, because of a sensory nerve disorder, does his  stand-up comedy in a wheelchair. "There are a lot of comedy contests, but most  aren't charity events," said Johnson, who also co-produced the half-hour TV  documentary for KTLA called "Breaking Ground," which featured success stories  of disabled entertainers.  </P> <P> The finals, which take place June 22 at the Wilshire Ebell Theater, will be  televised in October on cable's CBN Family Channel, owned by the Christian  Broadcasting Network. CBN also broadcast last year's show and caused a minor  stir when it edited out some of the finalists' material, including that of  Kathy Buckley, who happens to be hearing-impaired.  </P> <P> But Johnson sees no harm in pure G-rated humor. "It's good for the audience,  and it's good for the comics, too," he said. "I mean, if they ever get booked  on 'The Tonight Show,' they'll need at least six or seven good clean minutes."  </P> <P>  A runoff round of the comedy competition Stand-Up Comics Take a Stand! takes  place Monday at L.A. Cabaret, 17271 Ventura Blvd., Encino. Show begins at 8  p.m. Tickets are $5. Call (818) 782-2211 for information.  </P> <P> LAURIE OCHOA  </P></p>

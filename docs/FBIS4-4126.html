			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gansu Province Governor Zhang Wule: "Province Strives </F> to Be Corridor of Industrial Power"]    [Text] Gansu, a province of northwest China with huge  economic potential has already attracted many domestic and  international investors.    After years of hard work, the province now has a booming  economic construction drive in progress and a pattern of opening  to the outside world in all sectors has been formed.    By the end of last March, there were 870 foreign investment  enterprises in Gansu, with a total investment of $1.11 billion.  Last year alone, more than 500 enterprises opened in the  province.    Moreover, 87 offices from various foreign economic  organizations have been established in Lanzhou, capital of the  province, acting in close co-operation with developments  throughout the province.    Gansu is a landlocked area.    Renowned both at home and abroad, the Silk Road passes for  1,655 kilometres through the whole length of the province. This  accounts for one-fifth of the ancient trading route's total  length. Traditionally therefore, Gansu has always been an  important region to China for its cultural and trade exchanges  with other countries.    Over 2,000 mining sites have been discovered. Among these,  there are 115 useful minerals. The proven reserves of nickel  rank the mine second in the world, while reserves of 23 other  minerals take fifth place in China, and those of 10 more  deposits take first place in China. Nonferrous and rare metals  such as nickel, copper, zinc, antimony, cobalt, platinum,  rhodium, and iridium have realistic and potential advantages for  extraction.    Gansu is one of China's five major pastoral areas. Meat,  hide, wool, and milk are the main products. There are over  4,000 kinds of wild plants, of which 950 are sources of Chinese  medicinal herbs. Particularly important is the production of  Chinese angelica, dangshen, licorice root, red and yellow vetch,  Chinese rhubarb, safflowers, the bulb of fritillary, elevated  gastrodia, and glossy ganoderma. It is especially famous for  Minggui (angelica root) and wendan (root of baily asiabell) both  in Ghina and abroad.    Besides grain production, the province produces huge  quantities of honeydew melons, black melon seeds, dongguo pears,  rose oil, black moss, garlic, dates, apples, day lily, and lily  flower.    Many of China's important industry bases have been set up in  the province. Of particular note are the Jiuquan Satellite  Town, Baiyin Copper Town, Jinchan Nickel Town, and Jiayuguan  Iron and Steel Town.    Gansu has a complete network of railways, highways, and  airlines, taking Lanzhou as the geographical centre. It also  has an important section of the continental bridge, the  international railway between Europe and Asia, from Lianyungang  in Jiangsu province to Amsterdam in Holland. Gansu has over 20  airlines connecting it with cities at home and abroad.    Telecommunications and telephone calls to every city in  China  and 152 countries and regions are available.    In the educational field, there are over 130 research  institutes and 18 universities and colleges with 310,000  technical personnel of various specialities. All of these have  formed a synthetical study base in science and technology and  such an impressive capacity in science and technology ranks  Gansu ninth in the country.    Approved by the state government, Gansu enjoys preferential  policies on a par with the opening eastern coastal cities. The  province introduced preferential measures to encourage foreign  investment in August 1992. According to the measures, all  overseas investors and investors from Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan can enjoy the following preferential policies:    -- Enterprises run outside downtown areas can operate free  of  charge in land usage during their construction and five years  after they become operative.    -- Enterprises involved in cultural, educational, scientific  research, medicine, social welfare, traffic, mining, farming and  forestry, animal husbandry, municipal infrastructure, and others  operative in remote areas will have no land use charges levied  upon them during their operation.    -- Investors who develop land can do so free of charge from  land usage tax during their period of development.    -- Enterprises can enjoy priority of supplies of water,  electricity, gas, coal, oil, loan provision, raw materials,  communication priority, traffic dispatch, and personnel hire.    -- Investors can enjoy a whole range of preferential  treatment in creating foreign exchange, depreciation of fixed  assets, balance of foreign exchange, visa issuance, and living  conditions.</p>

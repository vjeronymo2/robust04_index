GAMES ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CANYON'S BIALAS PASSES FIRST TEST  </P> <P> Quarterback Kevin Bialas overcame a shaky start Saturday to lead Canyon High to  a 21-7 victory over Notre Dame in the second round of the L.A. Games football  tournament.  </P> <P> Bialas, making his debut at quarterback, threw an interception on his first  pass, but he settled down and threw two touchdown strikes to receiver Jim  Zopelis to lead the Cowboys to the win at North Torrance High.  </P> <P> Canyon, which had a bye in the first round, will meet North Torrance, the  defending L.A. Games champion, this morning at 8:30 at North Torrance.  </P> <P> North Torrance defeated Chatsworth, 13-6, and Verbum Dei, 14-7.  </P> <P> Canyon, sparked by interceptions by Joe McKeon and Rob Lantiser, broke a 7-7  tie with two second-half scores.  </P> <P> "I was pleased with the defense and the way our offense came back and played  after the bad start," Canyon Coach Harry Welch said.  </P> <P> BASEBALL  </P> <P> Alemany 3, San Fernando 2 -- Pinch-runner Brian Cooney scored on Brian Shaw's  single in the sixth inning, carrying across what proved to be the decisive run  for visiting Alemany in a game called after six innings because of a time  limit.  </P> <P> San Fernando's Canto Franco scattered eight hits and struck out nine.  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Taft 71, Pacifica 22 -- Four Taft starters scored in double figures as the  Toreadors took a 39-9 halftime lead and cruised in a first-round game at  Dorsey.  </P> <P> Cornell Hill and Joe Snow shared team-high honors with 14 points each. James  Wade added 13 and Eric Dafney 12.  </P> <P> Morningside 57, Canoga Park 40 -- Despite the absence of 6-foot-6 center Jason  Maxwell, who had a previous commitment, Canoga Park kept the score close before  collapsing in the second half at Dorsey.  </P> <P> Canoga Park, which trailed by just three points at the intermission, was led by  Lindsey Dunbar (17 points) and Gene Ross (10).  </P> <P> GIRLS' BASKETBALL  </P> <P> North Hollywood 46, Santa Monica 32 -- Jacinda Sweet (18 points, 12 rebounds)  and teammate Suzi Shimoyama (10 points, six assists) paced the Huskies in a  first-round game at Los Angeles High.  </P> <P> Alemany 21, Redondo 12 -- Junior point guard Rachel Corelli scored eight points  to spark Alemany in a first-round contest at Manual Arts High.

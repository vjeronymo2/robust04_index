Both sides disagreed  with each other on the textile trade issue; U.S. officials  brought up an old case, saying that the Chinese side had made  "little improvement" on the human rights issue, which may affect  the extension of most-favored-nation [MFN] status in June; and  Secretary of State Christopher will meet PRC Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen in Paris in late January to discuss bilateral  relations. What is the development trend for Sino-U.S.  relations this year? As the Clinton administration has  reshuffled its leading group in foreign affairs and laid down  its diplomatic foci, how will Sino-U.S. relations be affected?  <H5>  Clinton To Strengthen His Diplomatic Work </H5>   The Clinton administration, on the whole, did not have a  good  showing in its diplomatic work in 1993. It suffered a series of  setbacks in Somalia and Haiti; the White House appeared to be  very passive faced with the chaotic political situation in  Russia; and it was criticized by the domestic media for its  indecision on the Bosnian issue.... The first to announce his  resignation was Defense Secretary Aspin, who is going to be  succeeded by Inman. Then, Talbott, who is a good friend of the  president and former director of the Washington office of TIME  magazine, succeeded Walton as deputy secretary of state, thus  becoming the No. 2 figure in the State Department. These  personnel changes show that Clinton is going to strengthen his  diplomatic work in 1994.    Clinton wants to straighten out the chaotic state of  diplomatic work over the past year, hence, the diplomatic foci  listed by the State Department are in the following order:  Economic work and trade, the Middle East, Russia, nuclear  proliferation, and the concept of democratic politics. Such a  list is much more concrete than the three diplomatic principles  (economic security, military security, and democratic security)  set forth a year ago, which were ambiguous and contradictory in  their implementation. Now, the Clinton administration's  diplomatic policies are worked out in accordance with the medium  to short-term interests of the United States, which, on the  whole, conform to the traditional pattern of U.S. diplomatic  strategy. People have noticed that democracy comes last in the  list of diplomatic foci.    Last year, U.S. diplomacy was in a state of confusion. The  Clinton administration just treated symptoms but not the disease  and was led by the media. Moreover, it did not differentiate  what was primary from what was secondary and its strategic  interests were not clearly defined. For example, it stressed  the "human rights issue" too much in its policy towards China  and almost stopped granting MFN to China at the expense of its  national economic interests. Although the recent White House  reshuffle of its leading foreign affairs group does not have a  direct bearing on Sino-U.S. relations (the move was mainly  concerned with its policies towards East Europe and Russia), the  orientation of these adjustments and the emphasis on real  strategic interests will indirectly help advance Sino-U.S.  relations to a normal path, that is, its policy towards China  will be evaluated and considered in accordance with the real  interests of the United States.  <H5>  U.S. President Is Interested in China </H5>   Over the last several months, many U.S. congressional  delegations have visited China. Senator Johnston, chairman of  the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and  Congressman Gephardt, majority leader of the House of  Representatives, pointed out respectively that the United States  should attach importance to the China market. They called for  more economic cooperation and trade between the two countries  and were generally satisfied with China's performance on the  human rights issue. Regarding the State Department's assertion  of so-called "little improvement" by China on the human rights  issue, which "may affect the extension of MFN treatment," some  observers in Washington said that this was merely a counter for  the Clinton administration to bargain with Beijing and a move to  try to force Beijing to make concessions. Moreover, although  the U.S. ambassador to China said that China had made "great  improvements" in human rights, the State Department immediately  said that "little improvement" had been made, because the latter  thinks that as the decision on extending MFN treatment is made  six months from now, it was a little too early to make such  conclusive remarks on this issue.    Meanwhile, according to sources in Washington, Clinton, who  is inexperienced in diplomacy, is very much interested in China  and frequently asks his assistants to regularly brief him on  questions related to China. As far as Sino-U.S. trade relations  are concerned, he is particularly optimistic. According to  sources in the White House, the President believes that Beijing  can persuade Pyongyang to take a mild gesture to solve the  problem related to the DPRK's possible possession of nuclear  weapons. The sources also said that Clinton had asked at least  one of his assistants to try to reach a deeper understanding  with President Jiang Zemin, and he also said he would personally  handle policy on China in such a way as to treat Sino-U.S.  relations as his own "special program," just as former President  Bush did.  <H5>  The United States Is Not Politically Superior to China </H5>   Diplomatic observers on Washington said: Viewed from the  framework of international relations in the mid-1990's, the  United States does not have the means to blockade China, and the  day when Beijing and Washington are on an equal footing is about  to come or has already come. People notice that such western  powers as Germany, Japan, and France have vigorously developed  trade relations with China and are looking forward to entering  the huge China market. However, as far as the international  political situation is concerned, the development of the  political situation in Russia is really a very great worry to  the United States and the Clinton administration, and the U.S.  public are anxious about the changes there over the past six  months. Under such international circumstances, Washington is  not ready to antagonize China in the diplomatic arena. Hence, a  Chinese scholar said: Compared with Washington, Beijing now has  greater superiority in the international political arena. Facts  have proved that the means employed by the United States against  China, such as siege, intimidation, and discrediting China, have  been ineffective. In 1994, for the sake of the United States'  own interests, the Clinton administration cannot but reciprocate  toward China, and such a situation is quite evident.</p>

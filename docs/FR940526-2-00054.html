			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. The Ginnie Mae Guaranteed REMIC Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. General Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MBS guaranteed by Ginnie Mae have a single class of ownership interests. In a single class MBS, each security sold bears the same coupon rate of interest, has the same scheduled maturity, and has the same expected average life. Each holder of a single class MBS is the owner of an undivided beneficial interest in the mortgage pool and is entitled each month to receive: (1) Interest at a fixed rate, and (2) a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  share of all principal payments, including prepayments, made on the underlying pool of mortgages. For this reason, MBS are not attractive to certain investors who want to invest in securities tailored to their individual investment goals. Multiclass securities, the most common of which today are REMICs, were developed to meet this need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The REMIC structure permits allocation of the underlying cash flow from MBS to multiple classes of securities with differing maturities and interest rates. The cash flow allocation specified at creation of the transaction establishes the rights of the various classes of security holders to receive interest and principal payments. These allocations may result in REMIC investors receiving repayment of principal and/or interest at different times. For example, the different maturity classes, which are commonly referred to as ``tranches,'' might have expected maturities of 2, 5, 7, 10 and 20 years with each of these classes paying a different rate of interest. Because the amount and timing of the pass-through of funds to the investor is tailored to the investor's specific financial goals, the value of the REMIC tranches is increased. The timing and amount of payments on tranches may vary depending on the prepayments of the mortgages backing the single class MBS. However, total payments to all REMIC investors correspond to the total full and timely payments on the single class MBS in the REMIC pool or trust. REMIC trusts are not treated as separate taxable entities and, thus, there is no double taxation, pursuant to sections 860A through 860G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Ginnie Mae REMICs will be backed by Ginnie Mae guaranteed MBS. Government mortgages will continue to be pooled, and a traditional single class Ginnie Mae MBS will be issued in the customary fashion by Ginnie Mae issuers. These Ginnie Mae MBS will be pooled in a second stage transaction, and multiclass Ginnie Mae pass-through securities will be issued. The second stage transaction will elect tax treatment under the REMIC provisions of the Code. Ginnie Mae will guarantee the full and timely payment of principal and interest on the REMIC securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Ginnie Mae REMICs will be issued through single purpose trusts created by knowledgeable and financially sound firms (the ``sponsors'') that assemble the Ginnie Mae MBS, take the initiative in forming the trust, in developing the structure for the REMIC securities (i.e., how many tranches with what characteristics), in preparing the description and disclosure for the offering documents and in marketing the REMIC securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a REMIC transaction, there must be an identifiable pool or trust (Ginnie Mae expects a separate trust to be used for each REMIC) and a trustee of proven reliability and competence to ensure that amounts owed to the trust are collected by it, that the correct amounts are paid out timely by the trust to the holders of the REMIC securities, and that accurate records and reports are prepared and furnished to security holders, auditors, the IRS, and Ginnie Mae. Ginnie Mae will require that the REMIC trustee make available to Ginnie Mae the full financial details of the REMIC trust and that the trustee follow industry performance standards. Rules and procedures governing the trust and its operation, including detailed rules as to distributions of principal and interest to each class, must be spelled out in trust documents approved or prescribed by Ginnie Mae. Experienced trust counsel will be responsible for modifying the standard documentation for each trust and issuing the customary trust counsel opinions for reliance by Ginnie Mae, among others. Verification that the obligations of the REMIC securities pursuant to the terms of the trust documents can be met under all possible patterns of cash flows (``structural integrity'') must be represented without qualification to Ginnie Mae by the sponsor and Ginnie Mae's Financial Advisor. In addition, a qualified accounting firm must provide Ginnie Mae with a customary comfort letter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sponsors must indemnify Ginnie Mae, with interest, for any payments that Ginnie Mae makes pursuant to its REMIC securities guaranty because of a defect or lack of structural integrity of the REMIC transaction. Trustees must indemnify Ginnie Mae for losses caused by any breach of obligations to or for the benefit of Ginnie Mae as set forth in trust documents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Eligible MBS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ginnie Mae expects that Ginnie Mae REMIC trusts will be required to pass through cash electronically to REMIC security holders on the same day that the trusts receive immediately available funds on the Ginnie Mae MBS they hold. To facilitate this, only MBS with the following characteristics will be permitted: (1) Ginnie Mae I MBS issued on or after February 1, 1993; (2) backed by single family mortgages; (3) in book entry form; and (4) registered in the name of the designated depository.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

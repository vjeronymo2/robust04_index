			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Peers fight off leasehold rebellion SUPPORT from opposition parties yesterday enabled the government to fight off an extensive rebellion from its own backbenchers in the House of Lords over leasehold reform, Alison Smith writes. Labour and Liberal Democrat peers joined ministers and Tory loyalists in voting down amendments which would have restricted the government's plans to give long leaseholders in blocks of flats the right to club together to buy the freehold of the property. A stream of Tory peers, led by Lord Boardman and Lord Peyton - both former ministers - urged ministers to confine the new rights to leaseholders who were resident in the flats and who were UK nationals. Although the rebels attracted the support of Lord Tebbit, a former Tory party chairman, peers rejected their proposals.</p>

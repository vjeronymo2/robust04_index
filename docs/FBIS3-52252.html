It is  reported that more than 200 casualties fell in Kallar.    Reports earlier said that the security situation was still  tense in Irbil and al-Sulaymaniyah and that most shops are  closed and life paralyzed. Sound of explosions and guns are  heard on the outskirts of Irbil and al-Sulaymaniyah. All roads  connecting towns, districts, and townships have been closed by  warring gangs. Hospitals are full of dead and wounded with no  medical attention. People do not have the means to obtain food.    Reports from al-Sulamaniyah say that the gang of agent  Mas'ud  Barzani and the gang of agent Jalal Talabani are massing their  saboteurs in and around al-Sulaymaniyah to begin a new round of  fighting. This time the two sides will fight directly to  heighten the tragedy which they created in the region.</p>

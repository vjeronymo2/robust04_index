			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Mining company seeking to invest in new mines Almazy Rossii-Sakha, Russia's biggest diamond mining company, is seeking Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) to invest in two new diamond mines over the next 10 years, Mr Vladimir Piskunov, company vice-president, said in London yesterday. The deposits are in the Prilensk and Daldyino-Alakitsk regions, writes Kenneth Gooding, Mining Correspondent. He said that the company's new Jubilee (or Ubilinnaya) diamond mine, which cost about Dollars 500m, would be in production next year. Mr Piskunov said the mine needed only Dollars 10m more. Western analysts pointed out that this implied the start-up would be at least three years behind the original schedule.</p>

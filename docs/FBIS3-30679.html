He stressed that European integration, which also guarantees  the country's stability, will remain a cornerstone of Hungarian  policy even after spring elections, as it is based on the  complete consensus of all parliamentary parties and the whole of  society.    EU association means modernization and protection for  Hungary, and a market to the western half of Europe, Goncz said.  The agreement is seen as an opportunity for beginning  substantive political dialogue and boosting economic cooperation.    "Cooperation with our neighbours, mainly the Visegrad group,  is indispensable during the process of integration as well as at  membership stage. Unification sets an example of cooperation  for all countries in the region," the president said.    The meeting and the subsequent gala dinner were attended by  Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky and International Economic  Relations Minister Bela Kadar.</p>

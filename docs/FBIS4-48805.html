			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Alves Antonio] </F>   [Text] Good afternoon. At the Lusaka talks between the  government and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola] delegations, the mediator is searching for  alternative solutions. This morning, Alioune Blondin Beye, UN  special representative in Angola, received in his hotel room in  Lusaka the leaders of the two delegations. The meeting lasted  some three hours, though nothing has been disclosed about the  issues discussed. It is believed the mediator was informed by  the negotiators about the meetings they held recently with their  respective leaders in Luanda and Huambo. Reliable source  believe this morning's meeting adopted the strategy for the  resumption of talks interrupted on 20 May. It is also believed  that the issues to be dealt with by the government and UNITA  negotiators over the next few hours have been outlined.    Meanwhile, we have learned that the government and UNITA  delegations this morning held separate meetings to adopt a stand  on issues relating to national reconciliation, namely UNITA's  participation in the running of the country, the status and  security of Jonas Savimbi, and the security of senior UNITA  officials. The first steps have been slow, with the government  and UNITA negotiators carefully choosing their moves. The  process could become clearer as of now, but many things may  happen in these unpredictable talks.</p>

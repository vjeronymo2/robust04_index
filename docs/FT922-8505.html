			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Worcester falls to Bosch as offer goes unconditional ROBERT BOSCH, the German conglomerate, yesterday declared its Pounds 71.8m offer for Worcester Group, the central heating boiler maker, unconditional. It has acceptances or has acquired shares totalling 51 per cent of Worcester's ordinary equity. The offer, of 225p a share in cash or loan notes, will remain open until further notice. Worcester shares fell 2p to 219p yesterday, after the Takeover Panel ruled on Monday against an appeal by a group of shareholders which had been unhappy with the some of the terms of the offer. These investors, with 27 per cent of the shares, were concerned about a deal struck between Bosch and Worcester's management under which the management would have a continuing equity interest in the business. They also felt the price being offered was too low. It emerged yesterday that the Takeover Panel was divided over its decision to allow Bosch to proceed with its offer for Worcester. Following presentations by both sides, several panel members privately expressed concerns that the offer talks failed to take account of the interests of non-management shareholders. Members of Worcester's management and their families have 38.4 per cent of the group's shares. There were also concerns about the message that approval of the bid would send to other continental companies considering making a UK acquisition. While the matter never proceeded to a formal vote, members were said to have been persuaded by the argument that Bosch's offer contained considerable equity risks for Worcester's management who will be shareholders in the newly-formed Bosch subsidiary. The dissenting investors have yet to decide whether to retain their shares or accept the offer. They could continue as a minority in the hope of obtaining a better price for their shares later. However, the position of minority shareholders in such circumstances is not often strong, and few have been successful in negotiating a higher offer. They could find that the stock market quotation of the shares is lost, making it difficult to trade in the shares, and that dividend payments are small. A minority with over 25 per cent of the shares could prevent Bosch from passing special resolutions which might be necessary to restructure Worcester's business, or merge it with Bosch's Junkers subsidiary. But continental companies are accustomed to dealing with minority shareholders. Bosch's readiness to declare the bid unconditional suggests that it is not overly concerned by the threat. If more than 90 per cent of investors accept the offer Bosch can apply to the court for permission to buy the rest compulsorily.</p>

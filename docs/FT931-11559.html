			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Deutsche Telekom appeal DEUTSCHE Telekom, the German state telephone monopoly, urgently needs to expand its capital base through privatisation, in order to help finance a DM60bn (Dollars 38bn) investment programme in east Germany. Mr Helmut Ricke, the chief executive, said yesterday that the investment programme, under which DM11bn was spent in 1992 and the same amount again is planned this year, would run up huge debt servicing costs unless the privatisation plan was approved by the German Bundestag in the near future. He said that the telecommunications giant managed to install more than 25 per cent more telephone connections in the former Communist part of Germany last year than it originally planned: 758,000, compared with a target of 600,000. Yet the company still faces a backlog of 2m requests for new phone lines. Details of the extraordinary telecommunications investment programme were presented by Mr Ricke yesterday, in a defence of the decision not to open the east German market to wider international competition. At the same time he warned that the planned privatisation of Deutsche Telekom was urgently needed 'so that we won't have to hold back our investments because of our capital base'. The German government plans to sell off 49 per cent of the state monopoly to private shareholders, but has to reach agreement with the opposition Social Democrats first, in order to change the constitution to allow privatisation to go ahead. Mr Ricke said last week he expected the first shares to be sold in 1994 or 1995. He said that Deutsche Telekom created 1,500 jobs directly in east Germany last year through its investments, and ensured the preservation of 100,000 more jobs through its contracts to east German enterprises. Of the DM11bn spent on the overhaul of the entire network, DM5bn was spent directly in east Germany. Dr Wilhelm Pallmann, the director responsible for the eastern investment programme, said there were now 20 telephones per 100 inhabitants, compared with 11.6 in 1989, and around 50 per 100 inhabitants in west Germany. The two halves of the country should be equally well equipped by 1997, when the Telekom DM60bn investment programme comes to an end.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN JOURNAL;  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP SHIFTS INTO ROLE OF LAME DUCK ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL  </P> <P> The candidate was 10 minutes late for his press conference and television  cameramen were fiddling with their lenses. Hot dog-chomping reporters  impatiently eyed their watches. Leaders of a dozen state and local law  enforcement groups nervously memorized their sound bites. Then, out of his  Wilshire Boulevard office tower sprang Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp.  </P> <P> Surveying the familiar scene, the two-term prosecutor grinned sheepishly and  waved at the crowd -- which had nothing to do with his presence. Then he walked  down the block to lunch while the newsmen continued to wait for the arrival of  Arlo Smith, the Democratic contender to succeed him.  </P> <P> A few short months ago, Van de Kamp, 54, was the odds-on favorite for the  Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Spotlights focused on his youthful face.  Reporters dogged his cautious footsteps. Microphones amplified his every  thought.  </P> <P> But since his sound defeat by Dianne Feinstein in last June's toughly fought  primary, Van de Kamp has faded into the background of California politics.  </P> <P> The lame-duck prosecutor, who leaves public office in January, says he is  spending much of his time preparing the state Department of Justice for his  successor -- San Francisco Dist. Atty. Smith or former Republican Rep. Dan  Lungren.  </P> <P> "The focus has been first of all on the office -- to make sure we are in as  good shape as we can be," said Van de Kamp, following the dedication of the  Ronald Reagan state office building in downtown Los Angeles last week. "We've  had major hits this year on the budget so we've had to do a lot of internal  adjustments," he said. "It's a busy time. I was in Sacramento Tuesday, San  Diego yesterday and now I'm here today."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp has also been working, primarily behind the scenes, to help fellow  Democrats Feinstein and Smith, and to win passage of three ballot propositions  that he had once hoped would propel him into the governor's office.  </P> <P> Ironically, his real legacy is less likely to come from his failed campaign  than from his sponsorship of the ballot measures -- Proposition 128, the  so-called "Big Green" environmental initiative; Proposition 129, which  authorizes drug enforcement funding and clarifies constitutional rights to  reproductive choice; and Proposition 131, which would limit elected officials'  terms while establishing public campaign financing.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's generally low-key public role has included speeches before  partisan crowds, meetings with newspaper editorial boards, and fund-raising  phone calls. In recent weeks, he has also made a public appearance for Smith in  San Diego and attended a $1,000-a-plate Democratic Party unity dinner with  Feinstein and Smith in San Francisco.  </P> <P> "I've been doing anything really that they've asked," he asserted, "within the  bounds of reason."  </P> <P> In a year dominated by negative campaigning, Van de Kamp predicts that the  tightly contested race between Feinstein and Republican Sen. Pete Wilson could  still be won by whomever chooses the opposite tack during the final days.  </P> <P> "I think we're in the period now where an elevating inspirational message that  gets us out of the rut of this back-and-forth negative stuff since the summer  might lift either campaign (to victory)," he said.  </P> <P> In the same breath, Van de Kamp adds that Smith's best chance to succeed him as  attorney general lies with loudly attacking Lungren's conservative views.  </P> <P> "It's really going to be dependent on television commercials," Van de Kamp  said. "Smith has a good chance of winning if he can better establish in the  public's mind Lungren's negatives such as his anti-choice views (on abortion),  his support of pro-oil positions and his lack of institutional prosecutorial  experience."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp expressed his thoughts after taking a tour of the new Reagan  Building, where his successor will set up a Southern California satellite  office.  </P> <P> "It's a pretty good view -- a little bit of everything from (St. Vibiana's)  church to Dodger Stadium," said Van de Kamp, as he strode through the  still-incomplete quarters with an impressively credentialed tour party.  </P> <P> "I like this hallway, but the one on the other side is a little bleak," he  confided to famed sculptor Robert Graham.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's concern about nuts-and-bolts matters extends to the future of the  attorney general's office.  </P> <P> Neither Smith nor Lungren, he says, have focused on programs he considers his  major achievements: the introduction of such technological breakthroughs as DNA  analysis in crime fighting, and the beefing up of the office's consumer  protection, civil rights and antitrust enforcement programs.  </P> <P> Despite his crushing loss last June, Van de Kamp said he has no regrets about  having given up the prosecutor's post for a shot at the governor's office.  </P> <P> "I tried to erase any element of bitterness from my psyche," he said. "I tried  to just get rid of any taint of that at the time of election night . . . Now  that's done and I look on."  </P> <P> To what end is not yet clear.  </P> <P> "I've been in public life for 30 years," the former Los Angeles County district  attorney and federal public defender said. "I've had a very good run and I'm  very grateful for the opportunities that I've had. Now it's time to make a  change.  </P> <P> "I'm looking at law, business, foundations, some educational kinds of things .  . . You know I could be in nonprofits, working with nonprofit boards (while)  keeping active as a private citizen in the politics of my party.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to make a Sherman-like statement," he concluded. "But I'm not  leaving public office with the thought that I'm just waiting for the next brass  ring to grab . . . I do not intend to run for election, certainly with respect  to the United States Senate or anything else."  </P></p>

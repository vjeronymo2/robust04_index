			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: AP Moller to take over rival's shipping business AP MOLLER, the Danish shipping and oil group, yesterday agreed to take over the shipping operations of the East Asiatic Company, a long-term rival in liner shipping and one of the oldest Danish shipping companies. AP Moller will acquire nine large container-carrying liner vessels, which will continue in service, said APM. EAC suffered a group loss of DKr1.18bn (Dollars 188m) in 1992, when its equity capital was cut to DKr2.8bn, only 17.4 per cent of assets. Turnover last year was DKr17.3bn, much of it from extensive trading operations in eastern Asia. The sale price was not released, but EAC said the agreement would result in 'a very considerable strengthening of EAC's cash position' and an appreciable reduction in its debt. Although Moller has said it would try to offer jobs to EAC officers, EAC said that relatively few of the group's 1,300 shipping staff could expect to be offered employment.</p>

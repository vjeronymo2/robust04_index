The Interpretation, under ``Investment Partnerships and Corporations,'' generally disallows sales of a hot issue to an investment partnership or corporation, or similar account (``investment partnership'') if a restricted person has a beneficial interest in the entity. Thus, an investment partnership with several limited partners would be ``tainted'' due to the limited partnership interest of the restricted person. In August 1992 and October 1993 Notices to Members, the NASD announced it was going to allow investment partnerships, on an interim basis, to use a ``carve out'' mechanism to prevent restricted persons with an interest in an investment partnership from participating in hot issue allocations. This ``carve out'' mechanism requires the NASD member making such allocation to set up a separate account for these transactions and obtain from the investment partnership and its accountants documentation that indicates that the restricted persons are prevented from participating in a hot issue allocation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that the carve-out methodology is the most equitable and appropriate approach for investment partnerships in which restricted persons have a beneficial interest, and that the carve-out procedure should be codified as proposed under the Beneficial Interest section of the Interpretation. The carve-out procedure would not allow a person restricted under the Interpretation to receive a hot issue allocation inconsistent with the Interpretation's provisions; but would also not inequitably penalize those not restricted under the Interpretation due to their interest in an investment partnership in which a restricted person also has an interest. A typical scenario is where a limited partnership with a large number of limited partners is restricted under the Interpretation because one of the limited partners is an officer of an insurance company, and therefore restricted under Paragraph 4 of the Interpretation. Rather than restricting the whole limited partnership, the carve-out procedure would allow the limited partnership to purchase the hot issue by properly allocating the hot issue away from the restricted limited partner according to the specified requirements proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the NASD believes that a beneficial interest, as defined under the Interpretation, should not be created by the receipt of a management fee based on the performance of an account. The NASD believes that investment partnerships and other similar accounts typically require that the management fee structure of such accounts include a performance-based component. Thus, an investment advisor restricted under Paragraph 4 of the Interpretation could restrict an entire investment partnership, in which no restricted persons have an interest, based solely on the investment advisor receiving a fee based on the performance of the securities in the investment partnership account. The Beneficial Interest provision of the Interpretation is intended to address those accounts in which a restricted person has a substantive, albeit not necessarily direct ownership, interest that should be appropriately restricted. The NASD believes that the receipt of a performance-based fee, without the existence of any other beneficial interest, should not create such an interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Definition of public offering. In its present form, the Interpretation's definition of a public offering includes virtually any and all distributions of securities, whether registered or unregistered under the Securities Act. The NASD has found that the definition has had the unintended effect of implicating the Interpretation's restrictions for bona fide private placements of securities which do not present the potential abuses that the Interpretation is intended to guard against. The NASD believes that the proposed modification to the definition, which in essence does not apply the Interpretation to a traditional private placement of securities, is appropriate because such distributions generally are limited in scope and have holding periods placed on the privately placed securities. Thus, the NASD believes that such placements should not be within the purview of the Interpretation in that distribution is limited and that the potential for restricted persons to purchase the securities and resell or ``flip'' them in a short period of time is limited due to the resale restrictions placed on such offerings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Associated person definition. Article I, Section (m) of the NASD By-Laws defines a ``person associated with a member'' to include a partner of a broker/dealer and any person who is directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by such member, whether or not such person is registered with the Association. The NASD has found that a certain degree of confusion exists as to the status of passive investors in broker/dealers, such as broker/dealer limited partners, equity owners, or subordinated lenders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes, that under certain circumstances, such persons should not be considered persons associated with a broker/dealer due to their limited, passive investment in a broker/dealer. Thus, the NASD has proposed that if a person owns or has contributed 10% or less to a broker/dealer's capital, such person should not be construed to be an associated person; provided that, such ownership interest is a passive investment, the person does not receive hot issues from the member in which she has the interest, and that the broker/dealer is not in a position to direct hot issues to the person. The NASD believes that the limitations placed on such persons in order not to be considered associated persons will prevent the same from attempting to use their ownership interests in a broker/dealer to effect the purchase of hot issues, and circumvent the Interpretation's objective of a bona fide distribution of a hot issue. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Persons associated with limited business broker/dealers. Similar to the status of persons with a limited ownership interest in a broker/dealer, the NASD believes that persons associated with certain broker/dealers that transact a limited securities business should also not be restricted as other associated persons under Paragraph 2 of the Interpretation. Specifically, the NASD proposes that persons associated with broker/dealers whose business is limited to direct participation programs or investment company/variable product securities not be restricted under the Interpretation to the same extent as those persons associated with broker/dealers with a more comprehensive securities business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Typically, a broker/dealer's business is limited pursuant to a restrictive agreement executed by the member as a condition to its membership in the Association. In that persons associated with such limited broker/dealers are not in a position to sell, distribute, or withhold hot issue securities, the NASD does not believe that such persons would be in a position to inhibit a bona fide distribution of a hot issue security. The NASD notes that the proposed modification applies only to a person associated with such a limited broker/dealer, and not to the broker/dealer itself. The NASD does not believe that it is appropriate for any NASD member to purchase a hot issue security for its own account, regardless of the extent of its securities business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Issuer directed securities. Presently, an employee of an issuer, who also is restricted under the Interpretation, must receive permission from the NASD Board of Governors in order to purchase hot issue securities of its employer, if the employee does not have the requisite investment history with the NASD member making the securities distribution. For example, an employee of a manufacturing company who is married to the senior officer of a bank would be restricted under the Interpretation because he or she is the immediate family member of a restricted person under Paragraph 3 of the Interpretation. Under the proposed changes to Paragraph 3 of the Interpretation, the employee would still be restricted if the senior officer of the bank directly or indirectly supports the employee. If permission is granted by the board of governors, the employee is allowed to purchase the securities of the employer without meeting the investment history requirement, but the amount purchased would still have to meet the insubstantial and not disproportionate tests described above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that it is inequitable to impose such restrictions on employees of issuers who are in most cases tangentially restricted under the Interpretation, in connection with their purchase of securities issued by their employer. The NASD notes that issuer-directed share programs are viewed as a valuable tool in employee development and retention, and does not believe that the objectives of the Interpretation are furthered by imposing essentially the same restrictions on such purchases as those not involving an employer/employee relationship. Thus, the proposed modifications to the Issuer Directed Securities section of the Interpretation will allow employees of issuers to purchase hot issue securities of the employer under the same terms and conditions as persons associated with NASD members are permitted in connection with purchases of securities issued by the member, pursuant to an exemption provided in Section 13 of Schedule E to the NASD's By-Laws. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

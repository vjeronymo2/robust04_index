			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POINDEXTER GIVEN 6 MONTHS IN PRISON;  </P> <P> IRAN-CONTRA: THE FORMER REAGAN AIDE RECEIVES THE HARSHEST SENTENCE OF THE SEVEN  CONVICTED IN THE SCANDAL. THE JUDGE CITES THE DEFENDANT'S LACK OF REMORSE.  </P> <P> John M. Poindexter, the highest-ranking former official convicted in the  Iran-Contra scandal, was sentenced Monday to six months in prison after a judge  said that he had sought to "nullify" the actions of Congress and had shown no  remorse.  </P> <P> The former national security adviser in the Ronald Reagan White House was the  only one of seven convicted in the scandal to receive a prison term. The  others, including two former White House officials, were placed on probation or  required to perform community service.  </P> <P> The retired rear admiral, standing ramrod straight before U.S. District Judge  Harold H. Greene, looked grim and pursed his lips on hearing the sentence. But  he managed a faint smile as he walked to embrace his wife, Linda, in the front  row of the courtroom.  </P> <P> He refused to speak with reporters and drove off with his lawyers after briefly  thanking a group of flag-waving supporters who demonstrated outside the  courthouse.  </P> <P> Greene allowed Poindexter to remain free until a ruling on his appeal, which is  likely to occur next year. The judge did not impose any fine, noting that  Poindexter already had incurred large legal bills. Navy spokesmen have said  that Poindexter's pension, which is about $55,000 a year, will not be affected  by his conviction.  </P> <P> Dan K. Webb, the associate independent counsel who prosecuted the case, told  reporters later that the sentence was "very fair and very proper." Webb said  that it should alert other public officials that "when you serve in high  government office . . . you must do so with the highest levels of integrity and  honesty."  </P> <P> Before sentencing, Poindexter's lead attorney argued that "what he did, he did  for his country."  </P> <P> Poindexter, who did not take the witness stand at his trial, faced a maximum  sentence of 25 years in prison and fines of $1.25 million.  </P> <P> Reagan refused to comment on the sentence, according to his press secretary,  Mark Weinberg, in Los Angeles. The former President gave videotaped testimony  that was presented at the trial in which he said that he had never authorized  anyone to break the law and did not, in fact, believe any laws had been  violated.  </P> <P> Before imposing sentence, Greene told Poindexter that decisions of Congress  cannot be "nullified by appointed officials." Congress voted in 1984 to cut off  military aid to rebel forces in Nicaragua. Greene said that, by lying and  obstructing congressional inquiries about the National Security Council's  involvement in supplying arms to the Contras in Nicaragua, Poindexter had  sought to "invalidate the decisions made by elected officials."  </P> <P> A jury last April found Poindexter, 53, guilty on five felony charges for  seeking to conceal from Congress that a subordinate, Oliver L. North, was  secretly violating a congressional ban by raising funds for the Contras and  supplying them with weapons. Jurors found that Poindexter had also obstructed  congressional efforts to learn about covert U.S. arms sales to Iran and  diversion of the profits to benefit the Contras.  </P> <P> After calling Poindexter's offenses serious and noting that he had shown no  remorse, Greene said: "Congress is entitled to accurate and complete  information and cannot fulfill its constitutional duties without it."  </P> <P> Greene said that the defendant had conducted his scheme "for a lengthy period  of time" and, along with North, had "engaged in the destruction of evidence,"  including 5,000 computer memos dealing with the Nicaraguan supply mission and a  presidential authorization for shipping arms to Iran.  </P> <P> The judge noted that, under new federal sentencing guidelines, Poindexter would  have received a prison term of 21 to 27 months. But the guidelines do not apply  to such crimes committed before 1987, and a sentence of that length would be  unfair because six other defendants received probation from other judges,  Greene said.  </P> <P> He took note also of Poindexter's 33 years of military and government service.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Greene said, a prison term is necessary to deter other high  government officials from considering perjury.  </P> <P> Before delivering his lecture, Greene listened to a plea for leniency by  Richard W. Beckler, Poindexter's chief defense attorney.  </P> <P> Greene asked Poindexter if he wished to speak himself.  </P> <P> "Your honor, I don't have any comment," the defendant replied.  </P> <P> Beckler called Poindexter "an honorable person" and pointed out that he had  received "no personal gain, no personal profit" from any of his actions.  </P> <P> Webb conceded that Poindexter, who resigned from the White House when the  Iran-Contra scandal broke in November, 1986, had been "a well-respected public  official in one of the highest positions of government."  </P> <P> After remarking on Poindexter's "brilliance" and the fact that he had been  graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy at the top of his class, Webb told the  court: "Except for the events of this case, I don't quarrel with his 33 years  of service to his country."  </P> <P> But Webb said that the defendant's five felony convictions showed that "John  Poindexter was carrying out presidential policies at all costs. He accepted  that the end justified the means.  </P> <P> "This is not a malevolent or evil man in any way," Webb continued. But, because  his crimes "undermined the very fabric of our government," a prison sentence  must be given, he told the court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IRAN-CONTRA DEFENDANTS  </P> <P> John Poindexter, former national security adviser, convicted April 7 of  conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false  statements in connection with Reagan Administration assistance to the Contras  and a November, 1985 shipment of missiles to Iran. He was sentenced Monday to  six months in prison.  </P> <P> Oliver North, former National Security Council aide, was found guilty in May,  1989, of three felonies -- aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress,  destroying official documents and accepting an illegal gratuity -- and  sentenced to two years probation, fined $150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200  hours of community service. He is appealing while serving the community service  in an anti-drug program.  </P> <P> Robert McFarlane, former national security adviser, pleaded guilty to four  misdemeanors of withholding information from Congress by denying that the NSC  staff was soliciting support for the Contras' military activities and helping  move supplies to the rebels and denying that he knew anything about  other-country financing of the Contras. He was placed on two years probation,  fined $20,000 and sentenced to 200 hours of community service.  </P> <P> Richard Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded guilty Nov. 8 to  lying to congressional investigators when he said he wasn't aware of any money  that went to the benefit of North from the maze of companies known as "the  enterprise," which Secord had used in the Iran-Contra affair. Secord on Jan. 24  was sentenced to two years probation.  </P> <P> Carl (Spitz) Channell, pleaded guilty to using his nonprofit National Endowment  for the Preservation of Liberty to raise more than $2 million to buy weapons  for the Nicaraguan rebels. He was sentenced to two years probation for  conspiring to defraud the Treasury of taxes due on the money raised with  North's assistance. He died last month.  </P> <P> Richard Miller, head of a Washington public relations company, pleaded guilty  to conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service of taxes on contributions  used to supply military aid to the Contras. He was sentenced to two years  probation.  </P> <P> Albert Hakim, an Iranian-born businessman who with Secord ran "the enterprise,"  pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of aiding and abetting in supplementing North's  income by paying for a security fence at North's home. Hakim was fined $5,000  and sentenced to two years probation Feb. 1.  </P> <P> Joseph Fernandez, former CIA station chief in Costa Rica, is charged with  obstruction and making false statements in connection with his assistance to  North's Contra resupply network. The judge in the case said the charges must be  dismissed due to the attorney general's ban on the use of classified material  Fernandez needs for his defense. Prosecutors are appealing.  </P> <P> Thomas Clines, former CIA agent, was indicted for allegedly failing to report  to the IRS some of his income he received for working for North's Contra  resupply network. Clines, a business partner of Secord and Hakim, has pleaded  innocent and is scheduled to go on trial Sept. 4.  </P></p>

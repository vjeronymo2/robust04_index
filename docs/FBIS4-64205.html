			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reihard Uhlmann commentary: "Small Election Gift"] </F>   [Text] If economic development adheres to the prediction  of the spring report, it will give the government coalition a  small election gift, because the majority of the economic  institutes expect the upswing to begin in western Germany during  the second half of 1994, also with accordingly positive effects  on the economy in the new laender.    Most statements by the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the Free Democratic Party  of Germany [FDP], therefore, generously brush aside the more  pessimistic predictions of the German Institute for Economic  Research (DIW). Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (FDP) even  sees the chance that the growth rates could be a bit higher than  predicted by the institutes.    However, the coalition should beware of succumbing to all  too  great an optimism about the economic development now. Even the  majority prediction, which is at the upper limit of all  predictions so far, does not permit that. Only exports are  relatively certain as an economic engine so far. Private  consumption continues to lag behind because of the fact that  real incomes will go down again this year, and the recovery of  investments will make only gradual progress despite brighter  expectations for profits.    Above all, however, unemployment will continue to rise for  the time being. Here there remains only the hope for a change  in employment next year. The institutes, too, did not have any  new ideas on this matter, apart from the well-known  prescriptions against this problem. Their loquacious  philosophizing that structural unemployment is "not a phenomenon  inherent to the market economy" does not help much.    While the institutes praise the parties to the wage  negotiations almost excessively -- even though only for the wage  agreements in western Germany -- they are once again very  critical of financial policy. Even though they corroborate the  FRG treasurers that they are following a thrift course, they  point out that the consolidation threatens to become a "fiscal  purpose in itself" because of the "massive tax increases." This  does permit the reduction of deficits, but, at the same time,  private households and companies are deprived of "an  unprecedented level of financial means" at the cost of the  economic development.    The majority of the institutes therefore demand a strong tax  reduction despite the high state debts, including a gradual  reduction of the solidarity surcharge as of 1996. They clearly  reject the cost-neutral tax reform that Waigel is planning for  the next legislative period: "Tax reductions are not the apex  of economic expansion, but they are a precondition for a lively  development of the economy."    The institutes are convinced that tax reductions finance  themselves via more growth. However, this calculation need not  always be correct. Therefore, Waigel should take this proposal  into account with caution. Otherwise, one day, the institutes  will reproach him or his successor for even higher deficits.</p>

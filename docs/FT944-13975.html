			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Malbak benefits from consumer spending upturn Malbak, the South African industrial group, benefited from an improvement in consumer spending in the final quarter to increase after-tax earnings to R545m (Dollars 83.8m) for the year to August, up from R479m a year ago. Turnover rose 15 per cent to R12.6bn from R11bn previously. However, Malbak's operating margin fell to 6.9 per cent from 7.5 per cent, although the group attributed this to expansion in branded consumer products, which are subject to lower margins. Pharmaceuticals group SA Druggists boosted its contribution to earnings to 17 per cent from 14 per cent on the back of improved productivity. Branded consumer products, including furniture group Ellerines and electronics manufacturer Tedelex, also did well, raising combined earnings to R88m from R59m. Packaging group Holdains kept earnings steady at R65m in spite of having to restructure its plastics division, but food processor Foodcorp was hurt by weak trading conditions and could manage only a 5 per cent rise in income to R78m from R73m. Mr Grant Thomas, group executive chairman, said that although conditions had improved, the recovery in spending remained fragile. Most of the group's companies have elected to award capitalisation share issues in place of dividends to help fund new capital expenditure. Malbak will take up its shares in each case, but has increased its own final dividend to 24.5 cents from 22.5 cents, raising the total for the year to 38.5 cents from 35 cents previously. Malbak is to acquire Defy, a big domestic manufacturer of white goods, from TEK for R130m.</p>

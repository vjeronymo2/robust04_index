			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: France reiterates resolve to sell Renault The French government yesterday stressed its commitment to the privatisation of Renault, the state-owned automotive group, but played down reports it was considering a partial sell-off this year. 'We are studying the Renault dossier with respect to privatisation,' said an industry ministry official. 'But we have not taken any decisions on how the sale is to be implemented.' Speculation on the idea of a partial privatisation this year, with a full privatisation in 1995, was triggered by a report in the Tribune Desfosses, the French business daily. According to the report, the government is considering the sale of between 15 and 25 per cent of Renault's shares as early as this autumn, and could combine the sale with a capital increase for the automotive group. The sale could take part in two tranches: one for individual investors through a public offer for sale, and the second for institutional investors and industrial partners. Industry observers said there were several advantages in such a scenario. For one, it would confirm the government's intention to privatise Renault, following its omission from the latest list of public companies slated for sale. The list, announced in March, included Assurances Generales de France and Groupe Bull, the computer manufacturer. A flotation of part of the French government's 80 per cent stake in Renault would also facilitate the reduction of Volvo's 20 per cent holding in the company. The Swedish group has retained the stake since the collapse of its planned merger with Renault at the end of last year. A partial privatisation would allow the formation of a 'noyau dur', a group of long-term stable shareholders. Lagardere Group, which co-operates with Renault on the production of the Espace vehicle, and Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, are potential long-term investors.</p>

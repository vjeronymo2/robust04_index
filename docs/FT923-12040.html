			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Rome urged to combat Mafia THE ITALIAN government faced a chorus of demands yesterday to adopt exceptional measures to combat the Mafia following Sunday's assassination of a leading magistrate in Palermo, Sicily. As a first response to the killing of Mr Paolo Borsellino, the leading anti-Mafia magistrate, with five of his bodyguards, the government said 1,100 extra police and 1,000 paramilitary carabinieri were on their way to Sicily. The army had already been used in the early hours to help remove 55 Mafia bosses from Palermo prison to mainland high security jails. Others were being transferred to isolation jails. The authorities believe the order for Mr Borsellino's killing came from one of the Mafia bosses in Palermo prison. In a special session of parliament last night, deputies quizzed the government on the adequacy of security measures for frontline magistrates and urged more active intervention against the Mafia. Mr Borsellino was known to be top of its hit list. Yesterday in Palermo crowds gathered outside the Palace of Justice to vent their anger over the killing, in scenes similar to those two months ago after the Mafia murder of Mr Giovanni Falcone, who had been leading the fight against organised crime. 'It's war,' said one of the slogans carried by a demonstrator. Inside the palace, Mr Borsellino's colleagues in the judiciary threatened a strike against the inability of the state to protect their members. Police also voiced extreme concern over the eight bodyguards killed in the attacks on Mr Borsellino and Mr Falcone. Members of La Rete (the Network), the newly created anti-corruption party in Sicily, claimed that their leader, Mr Leoluca Orlando, a former mayor of Palermo, was at serious risk, along with at least three others. Mr Pino Arlacchi, a leading criminologist, said in a television interview that the state was being confronted by a clear Mafia policy of killing one by one those with knowledge about it. 'The thing to be done now is a strong and immediate attack against these men (the Mafia bosses), violent if necessary,' he said. Mafia's trump card, Page 2</p>

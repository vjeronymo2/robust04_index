Expressing his  satisfaction with the high-ranking guest's visit, President  Tudjman said that the development of relations between the  United States and Croatia was positive and stressed that  democratic Croatia had been doing its best since its very  beginning to forge as close as possible links with the United  States, not only because of the 2 million Croatians living there  but because U.S. democracy is an exemplary model for young  democracies such as Croatia's.    Speaking about the situation in the UNPA [UN protected  areas]  and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Tudjman reiterated Croatia's  stands regarding a peaceful solution to the crisis in these  areas. In this context he stressed that there would be a  positive effect if the UN Security Council lent its firm support  for the draft solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina proposed within  the framework of the conference on the former Yugoslavia. He  also pointed out that concordance [suglasnost] among the EU  [European Union], United States, and United Nations was a  serious precondition for efficiency and a quick end to the war  in this area. The president also said that Croatia -- in  keeping with its general democratic development and seeking  solutions for the UNPA and Bosnia-Herzegovina -- was determined  to protect human rights on a lasting basis. It will nevertheless  bring those who threaten this development to account.    President Tudjman also expressed his deep gratitude to Mrs.  Albright for her visit to Vukovar. Speaking about the horror  she had seen in Vukovar in the heart of Europe, the ambassador  said that the United States would do everything to punish the  perpetrators. She also presented U.S. views on solving the  situation in the UNPA. In this context she stressed that the  United States supported the implementation of Resolution 871.  In this respect she emphasized the importance of continuing  sanctions against Serbia as well as the fact that these  sanctions ought to be linked to reintegration of the UNPA into  the system of the Republic of Croatia. Speaking about the  situation in Bosnia, Mrs. Albright stressed that the United  States was concerned over the fighting between the Croats and  Muslims. She also emphasized the problem of delivering  humanitarian aid to the suffering population of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The United States wants peace, stability, territorial  integrity, and democracy in this region, the ambassador said and  added that she hoped President Clinton's Partnership for Peace  project would secure peace and stability in the region of  Central and Eastern Europe and facilitate the incorporation of  this entire region into the European order of democracy, peace,  stability, market economy, and respect for human rights. Toward  the end of the meeting, Ambassador Albright stressed that  relations between the United States and the Republic of Croatia  will remain good in the future too.</p>

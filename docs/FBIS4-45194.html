			<p>California   Official   <F P=102> 94WB0039C Mexico City EXCELSIOR in Spanish 6 May 94 pp 5-A,  35-A </F>  <F P=103> 94WB0039C </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City EXCELSIOR </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Renato Davalos including an interview with Diego </F> Valades Rios, attorney general of the republic; at the Zocalo, 5  May 94]    [Text] The attorney general of the republic, Diego Valades  Rios, claimed that the remand of Sergio Ortiz Lara, deputy  attorney general of Baja California, "has no political  background, and involves a legal matter." Declaring that this  individual's responsibility will be proven, he also remarked  that it cannot be claimed that a "narcoeconomy" or  "narcopolitics" exists in Mexico.    When questioned about statements made by the PAN [National  Action Party] governor, Ernesto Ruffo Appel, the attorney  general noted that, on 4 March, he had informed the state  governor himself of the remand. "I, like all Mexicans, have  confidence in the Federal Judicial Branch," he commented at the  end of the oath-taking ceremony for the class of 1,975 draftees  at the Zocalo yesterday.    Mr. Ortiz is responsible, and "this will be proven,"  declared  Valades Rios. "And if he should not be culpable, the Judicial  Branch will make the decision." However, "there is nothing  political about the matter. I respect the governor, who is a PAN  militant; I respect the nation's governors and all the political  parties. Our only responsibility is to apply the law."    Davalos: Does it appear to be a power struggle, or  not?    Valades: By no means; it has nothing to do with  politics. It has been proven that Ortiz was on the site of the  violent acts of 3 March. He has also been proven to have helped  one of the drug traffickers, nicknamed "El Mayel," to escape. We  shall verify that during the course of the trial, and it has  nothing to do with politics.    He went on to say: "The governor, whom I respect and esteem  personally, will surely agree with me that it is up to the  Judicial Branch to decide what is fitting."    Davalos: Have you been in contact with the  governor?    Valades: Yes, I have been in contact with the  governor, expressing my respect for him, and telling him that I  trust in the justice system, as he does. I am convinced that Mr.  Ortiz is in collusion with drug traffickers, and I shall prove  it.    Davalos: What is happening in Tijuana? Has it gone  out of the government's control?    Valades: Tijuana's problem is something that we  all deplore. Both the local and federal authorities are  striving, and maintaining levels of cooperation that please me  greatly. I have acknowledged this publicly.    Davalos: Could it be said that there is a  "narcoeconomy" or "narcopolitics" in Mexico?    Valades: No, that is not the case.    Davalos: Isn't there any evidence that the  financial system has been penetrated by the drug traffic?    Valades: That has not occurred by any means.</p>

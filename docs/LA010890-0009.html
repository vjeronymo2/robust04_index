			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIDDLE EAST AND DOMINO THEORY  </P> <P> Funny thing about the domino theory. It never worked as advertised when what  was feared was the loss of Third-World countries to communism. But now that  communism itself is being routed in Eastern Europe, the domino theory appears  to be working like gangbusters.  </P> <P> It would be a mistake, however, to assume that the rush toward democracy under  way in the East Bloc will now extend beyond the borders of Europe, overtaking,  perhaps, the Middle East. In that region, otherwise inexorable momentums have  an odd way of running aground. This is not to say that the region isn't due for  greater democratization.  </P> <P> But with thousands of battle-hardened Iraqi troops still in uniform and  squaring off, this time against Syria in Lebanon; with Syrian and Palestinian  and Christian forces themselves poised at each other's jugular for a new round  of fighting; with Muslim fundamentalism endangering the moderate regimes of  Egypt and Jordan, and with the mainstay of the Arab world still determined not  to accept a secure Jewish state in the vicinity, a Middle Eastern version of  what the Czechs are calling the "Velvet Revolution" is hardly in the offing.  </P> <P> And as the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are discovering after two  fruitless years of violence, the walls of Jericho are made of sterner stuff  than their counterpart in Berlin.  </P> <P> The Palestinians have not yet grasped what the Czechs realized instinctively --  that peaceful means and reasonable intentions can render the most dramatic  results.  </P> <P> In Czechoslovakia, as elsewhere in East Europe, the struggle for democracy was  waged at the grass-roots level.  </P> <P> In the West Bank and Gaza, unfortunately, the opposite has occurred. At the  grass-roots level, the Palestinians have demonstrated an unyielding addiction  to violence while refusing to embrace the path of peaceful negotiation Israel  has traditionally indicated it would respond to.  </P> <P> ILAN MOR  </P> <P> Consul for Press &amp; Information  </P> <P> Israeli Consulate  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

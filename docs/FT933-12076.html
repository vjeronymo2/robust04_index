			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Yeltsin lets in a rouble own-goal: The bewildering politics of a central bank move WHEN senior ministers of the Russian government were summoned to a meeting in the cabinet of ministers building in Moscow on Friday night, they had been given no warning of what they were to be told. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, told them the central bank had decided to announce the next day that: All pre-1993 notes in circulation would cease to be honoured from the following Monday; Russians had two weeks in which they could change up to Rbs35,000 of old for new money (foreigners one day); And arrangements would be made for those former Soviet republics still in the rouble zone - 10 out of 15 - to exchange their old notes. There was little discussion: according to one account of the meeting, the decision had already been taken and Mr Chernomyrdin, with Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, used the meeting simply to inform the ministers, not to ask their opinion. No representative of the finance ministry attended the meeting: Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister in charge of finance, was in Washington and Mr Sergei Dubinin, his first deputy, had just gone on holiday. Mr Andrei Vavilov, the ranking deputy minister, was told of the move after the meeting by Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation - the only minister present to raise objections. The decision was published on Saturday morning and immediately led to queues at the shops and the currency exchange offices as people tried to exchange pre-1993 notes for goods and hard currency. By Sunday, the old notes were being exchanged for about Rbs2,000 to the dollar. As the citizens queued again at those shops that were open on Sunday morning, the president had cut short a two-week break in the Russian countryside to return to Moscow - where a series of decisions by the parliament over the past week had put in jeopardy the privatisation programme, control of the budget and the position of foreign banks. Among his first visitors were Mr Sergei Filatov, his chief of staff, and Mr Vavilov: they begged him to sign an order rescinding the decision of the central bank and firing Mr Gerashchenko. They met several times: at the last meeting, they were sure he would sign such a decree. Mr Fyodorov gave an interview from Washington to the Moscow Radio Mayak, denouncing the move as 'a provocation aimed at the prestige of the state, the president and the government' - even though he must by then have known that the prime minister had approved the move. He was not alone. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the Russian parliamentary speaker and an increasingly bitter foe of the president, went on television also to demand that the bank rescind, and threatened to fire 'senior officials' if it refused. Mr Khasbulatov, under the existing constitution, has the power to see that this was done: the central bank is responsible to parliament, not to the government or the president. Others crowded on to the bandwagon. The leadership of the hardline National Salvation Front saw the move as one made by the 'anti-popular' forces in the cabinet to 'establish a colonial regime (controlled) by pro-western puppets'. The Civic Union, which prefers to be known as centrist, also blamed the government, in particular the reformers within it - just the people who were yesterday striving to get the decision reversed. As far as can be determined, it was the central bank's leadership and the centrists in the government, led by the prime minister, who took the decision. The reformists were against it more because of method than aim: for one thing, to make it clear that the currency is Russian gives the other republics notice that they must abide by central bank discipline, long an aim of the reformers. But, as Mr Fyodorov said, the announcement was reminiscent of a command economy rather than what might be expected of a reforming government. Mr Yeltsin called an emergency meeting of his security council yesterday afternoon - after which he issued a decree aimed at 'protecting the rights and legitimate interests of the citizens', lifting the ceiling of money to be changed to Rbs100,000 and extending the deadline for changing roubles until the end of August. He also decreed that Rbs10,000 notes could be exchanged freely, even if they bore the 1992 date. Mr Yeltsin's role has dismayed western economists. Professor Stanley Fisher, the former chief economist for the World Bank, said: 'Yeltsin has softened the original move but it's still a very bad idea. It shouldn't have been done. It's not terrible to create a new currency but it is terrible to confiscate roubles from those who work in the free part of the economy.' Mr Fyodorov, whose public statements have been vitriolic, returns from Washington today and must decide whether to submit to the president's compromise or to oppose it, possibly to the extent of submitting his resignation as minister responsible for the country's finances. It will be a hard choice, for it will be in the face of evidence that the government's anti-inflationary policy was beginning to show some results.</p>

The suit, which seeks class-action  status, accuses Leonard Shane, Mercury's former chairman and nine others of  releasing "materially false and misleading information" about Mercury's  revenues and loan portfolio. The suit is the second shareholder complaint  against former executives of Mercury, which was taken over earlier this year by  federal regulators.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Milan Milosevic and Dragoslav Grujic, </F> Documentation Center: "New and Old Ministers"]    [Text]  <H5>  Zoran Sokolovic, Minister of Internal Affairs </H5>   A veteran among the ministers. Born 1938 in the village  Lepena, Knjazevac Opstina. By nationality Serb. Graduate of the  School of Agriculture. Employed after graduation in the Vucje  Agricultural Cooperative as production superintendent, and in  1964 became the cooperative's director. It was then that he  ended his agricultural career and began his political career.    He was decorated for his effort with the Order of Labor with  silver garland.    Zoran Sokolovic was the principal operative at the Eighth  Meeting, then the one who took the silk cord to Novi Sad when  the advocates of autonomy were overthrown, and, finally,  president of the Assembly in the year when the constitution was  adopted giving great powers to the president of the republic.    On 8 June 1990, when the first meeting was held between the  government and opposition representatives in the offices of the  Serbian Republic Executive Council, the government  representatives were Zoran Sokolovic, Dusan Mihajlovic, and  Ratko Markovic, while the opposition was represented by Vuk  Draskovic, Veljko Guberina, Milenko Radic (NRS [People's Radical  Party]), Djordje Ninkovic (Democratic Party [DS]), Velimir  Cvetic, Ranka Cicak (SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of  Yugoslavia]), and Aleksandar Stefanovic (Liberal Party [LS]).    It was agreed at the time that in future a "roundtable  discussion" would be held regularly, every Tuesday, but nothing  came of that agreement.    He has been a deputy in all three convocations of the  Assembly.    In the first convocation of the multiparty Assembly, he was  the liaison between SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] deputies and  Milosevic. He was elected minister of internal affairs on 30 May  1991, following the resignation of Radmilo Bogdanovic (by a  majority of the votes, nine abstaining). During the debate of  the Law on Internal Affairs, he responded to the criticism of  the deputies: "I have a soul and a heart and it pains me to hear  these charges and insinuations." At a time when countless  uniformed members of various paramilitary formations were  roaming over Serbia, Zoran Sokolovic refused to debate this in  the Assembly, because "neither have there been, nor are there  now, any paramilitary armed formations whatsoever on the  territory of the Republic of Serbia."    In connection with the June demonstrations and the arrest of  Vuk Draskovic, Ferenc Cubela (DZVM [Democratic Conference of  Vojvodina Hungarians]) reminded the deputies of the SPS of the  television pictures from 5-6 October 1988 and of Mr. Zoran  Sokolovic with the megaphone, and also of the role he had in  Novi Sad. Zoran Sokolovic said in response to that: "There is no  need to explain to anyone what happened in 1988 and what has  happened now on 1 June, it was witnessed by the entire people  not only of this Republic of Serbia of ours, but indeed the  entire world. Accordingly, one cannot be exchanged or compared  with the other, and I have no further comment."    In the debate on the state of security and safety of the  population, he assured the public that "there are no reasons for  people to feel hysteria based on fear and insecurity and a  feeling of being threatened." At almost the same time, the  republic police occupied the buildings of the federal police. In  his time as minister, two ministers of the government of Serbia  have been arrested (Vlajkovic and Mihajlovic), but proceedings  against them have not been terminated to this day.    Finally, a lexical tidbit. The root of the police minister's  surname is "sokol [falcon]," defined as "a bird of prey which  aristocrats train and use to hunt with." Perhaps the surname has  no relation to the character, and it is probably a pure accident  that at one time the Serbian government included not only Prime  Minister Sainovic (whose surname comes from the Persian word  sain, which means "falcon"), but also the police minister had  etymologically the same surname--a surname connoting that its  owners have, so to speak, a natural instinct which drives them  to be obedient to their supreme master and the ability to  provide him a good catch, which is a topic made to order for  Milja Vujanovic.  <H5>  Slobodan Radulovic, Deputy Prime Minister </H5>   Born 10 January 1943 in prison. His mother Petrana, who was  in the Partizans, was pregnant when she was imprisoned in the  casemate on Mamula Island, where she had the baby and gave him  the symbolic name Slobodan; he spent the first nine months of  his life in prison. Radulovic came to Belgrade in 1963 and  enrolled in the School of Economics, where he received his  degree in 1968. He got his first job in the Belgrade  Packinghouse. He has been the director of several firms in the  past and the city minister for the economy. Four years ago, he  became the head of C Market. Married (his wife Vukica is  employed in Elektrodistribucija); they have two daughters  (Jelena and Natasa), and they are both studying economics. Owner  of a Toyota. Favors the idea that before taking office the  property of all ministers should be inventoried, "because the  main benefit of this would be for the government. It is time  that people left the government without a blemish."    He was a deputy in the Serbian Assembly in the second  convocation (1993). In the last election, he was elected on the  slate of the DS in the Belgrade electoral unit, he was expelled  from the DS because he entered the government, and, according to  Djindjic, he will be asked to give up his office. As the  director of C Market, during the years of inflation he managed  to preserve the capital of his firm, among other things by  leasing the stores and vehicles to employees of C Market. These  days, he represents himself as "one of the fiercer critics of  all governments," which is why he "has often experienced  unpleasantness." He sees the state as a large business firm  which must make a profit. He says he would have "no dilemma  about resigning because of things which are irregular."  <H5>  Radovan Pankov, Minister for Liaison With the Serbs Outside </H5> Serbia    A teacher from the village Tovarisevo, one of the  beneficiaries of the Eighth Meeting. On the wings of the "yogurt  revolution" in September 1988, he soared to high posts in the  party and government. His ascent began on 20 October 1990; at  the First Conference of the SPS for Vojvodina, he was elected to  the Main Committee, and then he was Sipovac's rival for the post  of president. In the 1990 election, he was elected in the first  round (with 55.72 percent of the vote) in the Backa Palanka II  and Bac electoral unit, and he obtained the post of vice  president of the Assembly. He even used that post to help his  son graduate from high school.    That was in late June 1992. Escorted by security, in an  official car with police plates, Radovan Pankov visited  Podujevo. His son Misa was with him. According to Deputy Zoran  Paunovic, Radovan Pankov "came for a working visit to the  Podujevo region and the economic giant--the Fagar Construction  Fittings Factory, at the invitation of the opstina leadership."  During the visit to the business school, Milena Vukotic, a  teacher, and principal Grujic hastily questioned young Misa and  found that he was a chip off the old block and issued him a  diploma from the business school. For the favor which the  school's principal did for Pankov, Gvozden Grujic received from  the vice president of the Assembly a promise that he would be  appointed chief of the Podujevo MUP [Ministry of Internal  Affairs]. Presumably so that he could deport from Podujevo the  teachers who objected to this fast-service graduation of young  Misa.    But in addition to his personal worries, Comrade Pankov also  worries about affairs of state. Informed sources say that during  this war he has been operating from the background, mainly  through the so-called National Council for Slavonia, Baranja,  and Western Srem, whose headquarters were on territory under  Pankov's control--in Backa Palanka. It is from there, it is  said, that the "spontaneous uprising" of the people was  directed, and many people, among them even Vojislav Seselj, talk  about Pankov's role in supplying weapons to Serbs on the other  side of the river.    Following the election in May, Radovan Pankov was elected to  the Chamber of the Republics, on the candidates' slate of  representatives of the Assembly elected by the Assembly of  Serbia from among the ranks of its deputies. Aside from these  facts, Pankov's qualifications for the post of minister were  probably also helped by his assurance that "there would have  been no Serbia if it had accepted the ultimatums of the CSCE and  the EC. The advocacy of an independent and self-sufficient  Serbia by certain opposition parties in Serbia is tantamount to  capitulation and the courting of an expanded Germany."  <H5>  Ratomir Vico, Information Minister </H5>   A returnee to the post of minister. Vico was elected  minister  the first time on 31 July 1991 during the "reconstruction" of  the Bozovic government. After 9 March, he headed Television  Belgrade. Vico became the truth minister of Serbia after he  "differentiated" the editorial staffs as the commissar of  numerous working groups following the triumph of the Milosevic  faction. At that time, the main curse among Belgrade editors was  "May God send Vico's working group to visit you." Following a  short period as minister, Vico returned to Television, which is  now headed by Milorad Vucelic, and he has been receiving a  salary as his adviser, and working on the distribution of fuel  within the firm.    The appointment of Vico to be information minister was one  of  the principal stumbling blocks within the leadership of the SPS.  Those who attended say that he was one of the reasons why the  discussion about the makeup of the cabinet lasted all night.  Only just before dawn did a directive arrive from on high that  Vico should be the candidate, and that ended the story about  Milivoje Pavlevic's successor.  <H5>  Radoje Djukic, Minister for Business Enterprise </H5>   Born 24 July 1949 in the village Cecuni, Ivangrad Opstina,  Montenegro. He is the second member of the Democratic Party  detached to work in the Marjanovic government. Radoje Djukic  owns the Djukic Knitwear Mill. Last year, he was elected small  business manager of the year. A man who has known Marjanovic for  many years ("it was my good fortune that we exported together").  The owner of the knitwear factory worked on exports and imports  of petroleum and gas from Russia through Italy. He is a member  of the Executive Committee of New Belgrade Opstina (he  represents the DS in the opstina Assembly), in the opstina  government he is chairman of the Committee for Aid to the  Krajinas, and, from what he himself says, New Belgrade Opstina  is the only one in the FRY which has solved the problem of aid  to the krajinas in an institutional way. According to BORBA, he  made a custom of working lunches with every prime minister, and  he uses the familiar form of address with Milosevic."  <H5>  Ratko Markovic, Deputy Prime Minister </H5>   Born 8 December 1944 in Pozarevac. Author of both  constitutions in effect today. He began his career as university  professor in Kragujevac. He got his post as professor at the  University of Belgrade with the help of his friends in the SK-PJ  [League of Communists-- Movement for Yugoslavia] (Draskovic), in  that the authors of a textbook made the gentlemanly gesture of  consenting to sign him on as an author so that he would fulfill  the condition for becoming a professor. As an expert on  federalism (position of the provinces), he took part in debates  about a "unified Serbia" and then sided politically with  Milosevic. He has been a judge on the Constitutional Court, and  now he is a deputy in the Citizens Chamber of the Yugoslav  Assembly.  <H5>  Svetozar Krstic, Deputy Prime Minister </H5>   Law school graduate. Owner of the Krstic Holding Company. He  began his working career in the small provincial town of Odzaci  as director of an internal bank, and he entered Serbia's  political life as a young official among Milosevic's Communists,  for a time he was on the Politburo of the Central Committee of  the League of Communists of Serbia, but at the time when the  Communists were renamed Socialists, Krstic changed teams and  went over to the ND-PS [New Democracy--Movement for Serbia]. He  maintained good business relations with those who had been his  comrades up to that time, as indicated by the fact that he was  given the post of assistant general director on the team of  Dragan Tomic (the one from Simpo). During the transformation of  the Yugoslav economy, he became a private businessman and set up  his own firm, always in tune with the fashion. When it was  profitable to open up exchange offices and savings banks, Krstic  also had one of his own.</p>

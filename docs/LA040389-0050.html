			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REJECT ABC'S OFFER, NABET ASKS MEMBERS  </P> <P> A major technicians union with nearly 2,500 members at ABC in Los Angeles, New  York and elsewhere said Sunday it is recommending rejection of a four-year  contract the network calls its "final offer."  </P> <P> But no strike vote has been taken, and "we're not talking strike yet," added  John Krieger of the National Assn. of Broadcast Employees and Technicians.  </P> <P> The contract proposal covers ABC employees at its Hollywood studio, radio  stations KABC-AM and KLOS-FM and KABC-TV Channel 7. Also covered are employees  at ABC's New York and Washington operations and radio and TV stations in San  Francisco, New York and Chicago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ballots to Be Mailed  </P> <P> Ballots will be mailed out by April 17 and the results reported to ABC on May  3, Krieger said. The main drawback in ABC's proposal is job security, he said.  </P> <P> Although the offer provides for three years of job guarantees, there are  provisions by which ABC could fire up to 400 employees, 100 of them in radio,  Krieger said.  </P> <P> That contention was disputed by Patty Matson, a Capital Cities/ABC Inc.  spokeswoman in New York. She called ABC's job-guarantee offer "unprecedented"  for a network and said only 100 to 120 employees are excluded from the  guarantee -- 60 of those in radio.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2,150 NABET Members  </P> <P> She said ABC employs 2,150 NABET members on a full-time basis, including 1,850  in technical areas.  </P> <P> Contract talks, held in San Diego since March 1, ended late Friday with ABC's  offer. The union's five-member negotiating committee unanimously voted to urge  rejection of the offer, which ABC wants ratified by May 15, Krieger said.  </P></p>

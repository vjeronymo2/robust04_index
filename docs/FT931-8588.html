			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: France to provide extra capital to two state-controlled groups THE FRENCH government is providing extra capital to two state-controlled companies by offering FFr1.5bn (Dollars 271m) in equity-linked debt to Air France and a short-term FFr2.5bn loan to Groupe Bull, the computer company. The injections come little more than a month before the parliamentary elections. The ruling socialists are expected to be defeated by the centre-right coalition, which has made privatisation a central theme in its campaign. Air France is to receive its FFr1.5bn of equity-linked debt from Caisse des Depots et Consignations (CDC), the state-controlled financial institution that already owns 0.5 per cent of the carrier. CDC is providing a FFr750m subordinated perpetual loan with share warrants attached and FFr750m of bonds repayable in shares. The loss-making airline needs the money for the purchase of 17 aircraft. Bull, which is struggling back to profit after three years of losses, is to receive a three-month loan of FFr2.5bn. The government is directly providing 72 per cent with France Telecom, the state-controlled telecommunications company, contributing the rest. The two companies are receiving state support at a time when the government's relationship with public sector companies is under the spotlight.</p>

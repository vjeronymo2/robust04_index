They managed to track  down and catch red-handed a group of ``businessmen'' attempting  to export abroad 260 capsules containing uranium-235 and  uranium-238. This element is the fuel for nuclear electric power  stations.    According to the operations data, the leak of the nuclear  raw  material occurred at a Kazakhstani enterprise. The cargo was  first conveyed to Chisinau in a homemade lead container. And  only when the definite date of the handover of the uranium to  the purchaser became known was it delivered to Odessa.    The smugglers prepared the operation thoroughly. They agreed  with members of the crew of a Black Sea Steamship Company vessel  that the container would be delivered on board shortly before  the vessel's departure for foreign parts. It was there, in the  port, that one of the ``businessmen'' was to meet the purchaser.  This member of the gang was detained on his way to meet his  client. He was found to be carrying uranium samples in an  ordinary coffee jar. A search revealed that this courier was  carrying the genuine certification of an Afghan war veteran and,  no less, a Hero of the Soviet Union.    As of today six people have already been detained. Two are  Moldovan citizens, four Ukrainian. Most of them are scientific  research assistants.    A search of one apartment uncovered a further 100 kilograms  of mercury and a few kilograms of rare-earth metals. While this  search was going on, the owner of all these riches was holding a  live grenade in his pocket. Fortunately, he did not decide to  use it.    The investigation established that they wanted to sell the  uranium for U.S. $200,000 (according to rough estimates, the  price of this consignment of uranium on the world market is  around $20 million). The purchaser himself was from Siberia.  But where he planned to deliver the cargo is not yet known.  There are hopes that criminal investigation officers will  detain the purchaser too.    The ease with which the uranium was delivered in its  container to the airplane steps [as published] proves that it is  not for nothing that the West is worried over the illegal export  from CIS territory not only of the ``brains''--the nuclear  physicists--but also the raw materials of the nuclear industry.</p>

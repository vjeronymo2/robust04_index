			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Observer: Wicks' next trick? Meanwhile, though Jean-Claude Trichet's move from the French treasury to the governorship of the Bank of France has yet to be confirmed, it has not hindered whisperings concerning Trichet's replacement as chairman of the EC's secretive but influential monetary committee. This assembly of top officials from EC finance ministries and central banks is habitually headed by a treasury hand, rather than a central banker, from one of the larger EC economies. So the face of Sir Nigel Wicks, the second permanent secretary at the UK Treasury responsible for international affairs, who has been tipped by a number of European monetary officials as a likely candidate, would certainly fit. Normally a two-year stint, the chairmanship has rarely been in British hands, though Sir Nigel's predecessor, Sir Geoffrey Littler, held the position in 1987 and 1988. The Treasury is saying nothing, but Wicks is well-qualified. Long famous in Whitehall for an over-full agenda, he has been shedding some of his many duties in recent months and so presumably could find time. He might, of course, run into some opposition from Euro-enthusiasts. Wicks was one of Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher's favourite civil servants and, in his rapid ascent to the top of UK monetary diplomacy, was a robust advocate of British interests. But he earned high marks from EC colleagues for his part in negotiating the Maastricht treaty. 'He was much better than Norman Lamont,' said a senior continental central banker yesterday.</p>

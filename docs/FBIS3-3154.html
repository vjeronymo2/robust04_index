			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Hung-wei (0491 3163 0251): "Zhu Rongji Stresses </F> Three-Point Principle in Financial Work"]    [Text] Zhu Rongji has made an important comment on  financial issues.    He said that since June last year, the financial system has  rectified the financial order, observed strict financial  discipline, promoted financial reform, strengthened  macroregulation and control, resolutely implemented "simple  rules to be observed by all concerned," and swiftly changed the  chaotic situation in the financial order. At the same time, new  conditions and problems arising in the national economy have  been promptly studied and analyzed, appropriately taking stock  of macroregulation and control according to the demand of  "blocking the evil door and opening the right door" and  resolutely and decisively adjusting the capital flow structure.  The rate of availability of promised capital for key state  projects exceeded 99 percent, no IOU's were issued in purchasing  farm products, the shortage of circulation funds for key  production enterprises and foreign trade enterprises was  basically alleviated, and excessively big fluctuations in the  development of the national economy were avoided effectively.  At the same time, the trend of excessive currency issuance was  checked, the total volume of currency issued for the whole year  was basically controlled within fixed macroregulation and  control targets, the market exchange rate was stable, and the  state's foreign exchange reserves had increased.    Zhu Rongji said that the State Council has decided that the  financial work principle this year is to continue to rectify the  financial order, steadily promote financial reform, strictly  control the total volume of credit, and earnestly strengthen  supervision over finance.    He raised three new demands for the broad masses of cadres  and staff in the financial system.    First, they must strictly control the total volume and scale  of credit this year. "The crux of controlling the total volume  of credit is to control loans for investment in fixed assets  released by banks at various levels. Beginning this year, the  scale of loans for infrastructure and basic industrial projects  are all being handed over to the newly founded State Development  Bank to make centralized arrangements. Other banks will not be  allowed to squeeze other investment projects. In particular,  for projects which involve the total volume of loans being used  as circulation funds, projects which have not received approval  to begin construction, and projects which break up the whole  into parts, no loans will be given, no single project will get a  loan, and not a single yuan will be given in excess. Whoever  uses undue means to exceed the total volume of credit will be  held responsible."    Second, after business of a policy nature are separated from  them, various specialized banks should transform themselves into  commercial banks, and they must courageously try things out and  take exploratory steps this year. "Taking into consideration  that state-owned enterprises are in the process of changing  their operational mechanisms this time, specialized banks should  first practice management of a proportionate balance between  assets and liabilities under a controlled amount of lending,  gradually build self-restraint and risk-taking mechanisms, and  be able to make their own decisions regarding operations and  take responsibility for gains and losses. To coordinate with the  implementation of the Bankruptcy Law, preparatory funds  allocated for tackling outstanding amounts this year should be  properly used."    Third, branches of the People's Bank of China at various  levels must earnestly change their functions and duties and  should play a dominant role in financial supervision in the  localities. "Branches and offices at various levels must really  spend most of their energy on stabilizing the currency and  financial supervision. At present, particular attention must be  paid to stopping the emerging tendency of random fund-raising  activities; whenever such activities exist, they must be banned.  Only when random loans and random fund-raising activities are  brought under control can the scale of investment in fixed  assets be brought under control and can inflationary pressures  be alleviated."    This year will witness the increased weight of financial  reform, and it is necessary to boldly carry out reform on the  one hand, and, on the other hand, avoid a chaotic financial  order like that which emerged last year; therefore, how far Zhu  Rongji's financial work principles can be realized is a problem  which deserves only cautious optimism.</p>

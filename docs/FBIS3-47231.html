			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Prime Minister's Visit to Cambodia"] </F>   [Excerpts] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai will lead a  delegation visiting Cambodia from 12 to 14 January. He will be  accompanied by a group of businessmen from the private sector.  [passage omitted] There is a political element to this visit.  It concerns Thai-Cambodian relations as they relate to the  Khmer Rouge issue.    There are trade and political issues that the prime  ministers  of both countries will have to thrash out and settle on good  terms, in the spirit of compromise, and based on the principle  of mutual interests. If each party merely tries to preserve its  interests to the fullest, without thinking about good relations,  problems between the two countries could blow up into a major  conflict. Naturally, the Thai Government will try to protect  the interests of businessmen investing in Cambodia, while the  Cambodian Government has a duty to protect the interests of its  people against exploitation by foreigners investing in Cambodia.  This is why there will be a review of old contracts signed by  the Cambodian Government. [passage omitted]    The Thai Government must make clear its sincere intention to  help Cambodia in national development, especially economic and  agricultural development. Thailand has enough potential to help  Cambodia. We have people with expertise in agriculture,  fishing, banking, investment, and industry. The Thai Government  must make clear its sincerity in helping the Cambodian people  develop their country. It must seek the Thai private sector's  cooperation in not exploiting or taking advantage of the  Cambodian people, as was the case with the chit fund that  cheated the Cambodian people.    Anyway, a big problem between Thailand and Cambodia is the  political issue of the Khmer Rouge. Although it is an internal  Cambodian affair, the problem affects Thailand. On this issue,  the prime minister should confirm to the Cambodian Government  that Thailand no longer supports or recognizes the Khmer Rouge,  because Cambodia now has an elected government that is  recognized internationally. The situation has changed  completely; the previous status of the four Cambodian factions  has expired. Ever since the elections and the registration of  political parties in Cambodia, the Thai Government has only  recognized those parties that are registered under the Cambodian  electoral system. The Khmer Rouge, therefore, is an illegal  group.</p>

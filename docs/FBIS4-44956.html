			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Isma'il Shalabi, Faculty of Law, al-Zaqaziq </F> University: "Unemployment Problem and Economic Development:  Governors' Role"]    [Text] As part of the government's recent course of  economic reform and in order to end the budget deficit and help  eliminate unemployment, accelerate the economic development  process, and avoid contracting more foreign debt, it is  important to encourage the establishment of investment,  production, and service projects in the governorates. This can  be done by exploiting the resources of each individual  governorate to establish such projects without the government's  contributing any funding to them. Governors should play the main  role in establishing these projects because of their broad  powers, moral authority in their governorates, and good  relations with citizens and businessmen. One can exploit the  relative advantage that each governorate has over the others.  Projects can be based on utilizing the citizens of each  individual governorate in addition to whatever Arab or foreign  capital is obtained. The performance and success of governors  should be evaluated through the number of productive and service  projects each has established in his governorate, the extent to  which each has realized the policy of self-sufficiency in  production, service, and food security, and the elimination of  unemployment for the citizens of the governorate. I would point  out that the best form for these projects is that of joint stock  companies that perform productive activities in the  manufacturing, agricultural, and service fields. Stress should  fall on small industries that need only small capital--small  workshops employing a limited number of university or middle  technical school graduates. To that end I formulate in the  following points my concept of self-reliance in investment and  development and of how governors can contribute thereby to  eliminating unemployment in the coming period:    1. The governor's role is to promote projects and work to  establish them through his contacts, connections, and moral and  political position. He should also arrange publicity and the  necessary conferences for citizens and businessmen.    2. Participation should be limited to citizens of the region  and the previously mentioned agencies. The Union of Egyptian  Banks should play a promotional role with foreign and joint  banks and thereby support these projects.    3. It is important that the necessary economic studies be  done for these projects and that suitable personnel be selected  to run them. Experienced technicians in the field of production  of each project should be utilized. We should completely avoid  political interference in the selection of the project, its  site, or its workers in a way not in harmony with its economics.  The managing boards of these companies should be formed from  their founders and shareholders through free elections with the  knowledge of the company's general meeting.    4. The following economically and socially important  considerations should be especially taken into account with  regard to these projects:    a. Increasing production and raising productivity so as to  ensure covering the need of the domestic market for the goods  produced, with any surplus to be exported, thereby bringing in  foreign revenues.    b. The more employment in the project is restricted to  citizens of the region, the more eager these citizens will be  for the project's success and the more interested they will be  in participating in it; and thus the more rapid will be the  region's development.    5. The shares of these companies should be listed for  trading  on the stock exchange. This will invigorate the securities  market and make it easier to create financial liquidity for  shareholders.    6. The governor's success in his region is related to the  number of joint stock companies established in the region and  the success of these companies. He can be evaluated objectively  on this basis.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Survey of Reinsurance (3): Shake-out not yet over - Lee Coppack says life for brokers looks likely to remain challenging THE collapse of the retrocession market and resulting shortage of catastrophe reinsurance capacity is adding to the pressure many London brokers already feel from the problems of a soft insurance market in the US, the weak dollar and generally lower interests rates. Traditionally reinsurance business has produced good returns for London brokers, particularly in London market excess of loss reinsurance and retrocessions of that reinsurance or LMX business, where the average commission was 10 per cent, but the expenses modest. According to Allan Nichols of stockbroker James Capel, other types of reinsurance outside the US are still producing a good if not spectacular income. And not everyone is losing money on excess of loss business; the privately-owned Lloyd's broker Benfield Group made a profit of Pounds 20m with 68 employees in the year to June 1991, and this year is likely to show further improvement. One of the biggest changes prompted by the present climate in the market is the re-organisation of the reinsurance business of C T Bowring, London subsidiary of the US broker Marsh &amp; McLennan. From October 1, Bowring's two principal London reinsurance broking operations, C T Bowring Reinsurance and Winchester Bowring will trade together under the name of Carpenter Bowring Ltd. The name, which will also be used in Melbourne and Sydney, also incorporates that of Marsh's principal reinsurance broking subsidiary, Guy Carpenter and Co. Carpenter is a dominating force in the US market with a strong position with the leading US insurance companies. Bowring Reinsurance has a North American and international divisions and London market specialist Winchester Bowring. Last year Marsh reported Dollars 269m revenues from reinsurance broking. It began its integration of group reinsurance activities two years ago. A New York operating group deals with North American business from the US and London, and a London operating group looks after the rest of the world. Hady Wakefield, chairman of Bowring Reinsurance, said that the latest development is a continuation of the co-operation and cohesion that the group has been building. Winchester Bowring has found its once highly profitable LMX business is no longer so successful, but it is far from alone. With the near disappearance of retrocession covers, catastrophe capacity has contracted sharply, and some programmes cannot be placed at all. For example, Steel Burrill Jones reported last year that although rates were up in its specialist class of marine excess of loss business, certain risks, particularly retrocessional contracts or programmes where the results had been poor, just could not be placed at any price. The largest UK broker Sedgwick has suffered a downturn in its reinsurance broking this year. At the half year Sedgwick's reinsurance subsidiary E W Payne reported a 7 per cent drop, 8 per cent excluding currency factors, Pounds 43.1m to Pounds 40.1m during the same period of 1991 in operating income. Mr Nichols said that US domestic companies could not buy all the cover they wanted: 'A lot of US companies have a reinsurance programme which looks like a string vest.' In a move that echoes the reaction of brokers to the liability insurance crisis of the mid-1980s, Bowring parent Marsh &amp; McLennan and leading US bank J P Morgan plan to raise Dollars 300m in capital for a new joint venture property catastrophe reinsurer based in Bermuda. The company, to be called Mid-Ocean, would write catastrophe excess of loss and retrocession business. Sedgwick's nearest rival in size, Willis Corroon also suffered a gloomy first half with pre-tax profits down 22 per cent to Pounds 54.1m, but reinsurance was less of a problem. Although active in the LMX market, Willis did not have a major LMX broker. Business from the US into London was also down, but revenue from companies outside the US and UK was strong during the first half, increasing more than 20 per cent. David Rainbow, executive director of Willis Faber &amp; Dumas and in charge of reinsurance operations in France and Benelux, commented: 'We are not so opportunistic, so we have been relatively less affected by the change in the market than some of our competitors.' Willis has a long tradition in the market, and its activities have grown partly by organic growth but also through its acquisitions of Stewart Wrightson, specialist reinsurance broker Carter Wilkes and Fane, and Corroon &amp; Black. Within the last year, all its reinsurance activities have been brought together in two divisions, international reinsurance and UK and North American reinsurance, plus the former Corroon subsidiary G L Hudson. All come under the board of the group's main broking company Willis Faber &amp; Dumas. Robert Gayner, managing director of the European division, believes Willis has a size, quality and spread in its international reinsurance portfolio that give it a competitive advantage. Once a pure marine excess of loss broker, Steel Burrill Jones had a substantial proportion of its business in retrocession, classic LMX business which has just about disappeared, according to finance director Tony Keys. Since 1987 the group has been diversifying into different lines, mainly in direct classes. Although reinsurance broking represented just over 40 per cent of the group's turnover in 1991, retail broking and consultancy business may well overtake its contribution to the group's revenues this year. However, the Benfield Group, which is owned by its directors and staff, is thriving in the excess of loss business. Its chairman Matthew Harding says: 'We do not look for business. We want customers who are good enough to pay a proper price for proper reinsurance.' He challenges the orthodox doctrine that brokers need to make a substantial proportion of their profits on the investment income on premiums and claims in transit. Benfield believes in getting the premium to the underwriter within a fortnight and the claim to the ceding company in the same period. Brokers believe that evidence is emerging of greater stability in catastrophe reinsurance. Mr Keys said that without a big disaster, rates would probably prove profitable, so he did not expect to see substantial further increases. He felt the likely reduction in the number of Lloyd's names from 1993 could lead to further contraction. The mergers of syndicates can result in decrease of capacity as the new syndicate writes one large line that is not as large as the predecessor syndicates together. Mr Rainbow says the market appears to have reached a plateau; no new capital is coming in but the contraction has stopped. The key has been a painful process of forcing the direct insurers to retain more of the risks they write. He says the reinsurer's view was: 'I will expose my capital if the cedant will expose his.' Life for reinsurance brokers looks likely to remain challenging for some time. Where direct companies are retaining more business, competition among the brokers is increasing for the remaining business. The market is becoming more fragmented; the percentage of premiums placed in Lloyd's by the largest broker has fallen from a peak of 17.8 per cent of the total in 1978 to just under 10 per cent last year. Robert Gayner at Willis Faber believes the shake-out from the collapse of the LMX spiral and depressed rates is not over. 'The market which today has survived is not necessarily in a strong position. We believe there will be more reinsurance failures.' The author is London editor of A Guide to the Leading Insurance Brokers in Europe, published by L'Assurance Francaise.</p>

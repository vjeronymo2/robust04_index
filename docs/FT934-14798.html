			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forte float surprises THE announcement by Forte of its intention to float its airport services division early next year caught the market by surprise and led to a roller coaster day for the shares. At the outset, they shot up on the news only to tumble to 217p at the day's worst. Then, the shares rallied up to 225p, eventually drifting back to close at 222 1/2 p, a net 5 down on the day, on turnover reaching an average 2.6m. Leisure analysts were puzzled by both the timing of the announcement and the reaction of the shares. Although there has been talk of the move for several weeks, the news was not expected until next year, with a flotation predicted in early 1994. Speculation that Forte was more anxious than previously thought to reduce its gearing was heard among leisure specialists, most of whom put the group's debts at around Pounds 1.2bn to June 1994. Estimates of the airport catering division's worth are above Pounds 200m, with the effect on Forte's balance sheet around Pounds 150m if it retains its 25 per cent stake, as proposed. With more sales forthcoming, Forte's debt situation should become more manageable. The sale of its Harvester pub chain - Allied Lyons is now being strongly tipped as the buyer - is expected shortly, and should contribute some Pounds 100m. The expected flotation of Gardner Merchant - in which Forte has a 25 per cent stake - next year could give another Pounds 120m. Selected hotel sales could also contribute. Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court commented: 'The potentially brighter debt picture makes it increasingly unlikely that Forte will need to have a rights issue.' Allied Lyons shares slipped 5 to 567p.</p>

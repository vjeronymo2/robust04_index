			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau February 8 TASS -- Moldovan President  Mircea Snegur has accused leaders of the self-styled Dniester  Republic of attempts to aggravate the socio-political situation  in the left-hand bank areas of the republic and has warned the  population about their possible provocations. These charges and  warnings are contained in a presidential address to the people  of Moldova, published here today.    "The unconstitutional authorities of the so-called Dniester  Republic have blocked the implementation of the Moscow agreement  on the peaceful settlement of the conflict, signed on August 21,  1992," Snegur stressed. "This is evidenced by the deployment of  Dniester armed forces within the zone of security, which was  envisaged by the Moscow agreement, and their remaining  fortifications there. The local population was actually shut up  in a reservation by the special regime clamped down on the  left-hand bank territory by the Tiraspol leaders," the Moldovan  president claims. "Posts have been set up on roads and vehicles  and citizens are being searched in a most humiliatory manner.  Pressure is being exerted on villagers refusing to support the  Tiraspol leaders. People are not allowed to set up voting  stations for the upcoming parliamentary elections in Moldova."    Vice-president of unrecognised Dniester Republic Aleksandr  Karaman stated today that Snegur's public warning against  possible provocations prove that such acts are quite possible.  "Definite forces in Moldova would like to put the blame for them  on the Dniester Moldovan Republic, especially in the presence of  foreign observers," Karaman stated. "However, it would be  logical for us to keep very quiet and mild in such a situation,"  he added.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Scotland caught in recession THE Scottish economy does not have the strength to pull itself rapidly out of recession, and unemployment is likely to continue rising longer than in the south of England. That is the view of the Fraser of Allander Institute, Scotland's principal economic research organisation, in its latest quarterly bulletin. The institute says the latest Scottish Chambers' survey of business opinion pointed to a poor industrial production performance and a probable acceleration in unemployment. The Scottish economy until recently has suffered less from recession than the south of England, and its seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 9.7 per cent is below the UK average. There are now some signs that the UK economy as a whole is recovering. Quarterly Economic Commentary, Fraser of Allander Institute, Curran Building, 100 Cathedral Street, Glasgow G5 0LN. Pounds 15.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUDDENLY, TOM BRADLEY LOOKS MORTAL, AND L.A. BLACKS FEEL ORPHANED  </P> <P> "I've come home . . . I've come home."  </P> <P> Three years ago, Mayor Tom Bradley spoke these words to launch his second  ill-fated gubernatorial campaign at a rally of hundreds of black supporters who  had jammed into a poorly ventilated room in South Los Angeles just to see and  hear him.  </P> <P> Tom Bradley has come home again. With the mayor's blessing, last week a  gathering of black influentials rose to Bradley's defense as he faces the most  serious crisis of his political career over questions about his financial  dealings and allegations of conflict of interest.  </P> <P> What was behind the stout, if belated, defense of the mayor has as much to do  with deep concern for the future of all blacks in this city as it does with Tom  Bradley's political future. The black leaders mounting the mayor's defense are  afraid that without Bradley, the doors will shut again at a City Hall that was  all but off-limits before he took office; in a broader sense, they fear that  his absence will create an overall social and business environment more hostile  to blacks in a city that already is strongly segregated.  </P> <P> No matter what the disposition of the current investigations, the era of the  71-year-old Bradley's quiet political dominance is in its twilight. And in  spite of 16 years as mayor, Bradley, who has surrounded himself at the highest  levels largely with people who represent his big business/Westside money base,  has no political protege.  </P> <P> Among the three blacks on the City Council, none appears able to forge the  multiethnic coalition that Bradley attracted.  </P> <P> Gilbert Lindsay, 88, represents a district with a boundary change possible in  the future and a growing Latino population; there is a reasonable chance that  the next representative will not be black. Robert Farrell, 51, has had to beat  back two recall attempts. Nate Holden, 60, is a populist scrapper who ran  against Bradley this spring. Holden proved himself adeptat tapping into  widespread dissatisfaction about the quality of life in Los Angeles. But he did  poorly against the mayor in the three predominantly black City Council  districts.  </P> <P> Ironically, many black political activists are pinning their highest hopes on a  lawsuit initiated by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund.  Either through creation of an expanded Board of Supervisors resulting from the  lawsuit, or through natural succession to the seat currently held by Supervisor  Kenneth Hahn, blacks are expecting a place on that powerful body. Rep. Julian  Dixon, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters and Holden already have indicated interest.  </P> <P> But in spite of its tremendous influence over health care, courts and  environmental issues, the county board remains a nebulous entity to many  voters. The mayor and council, like the President and Congress, are easily  identifiable and thus most often looked to for leadership. And right now, the  pool of younger blacks in position to ascend politically is limited.  </P> <P> Bradley himself may have unwittingly fostered this dearth of local black  political up-and-comers. When the mayor in 1987 put the power of his office  behind the council candidacy of Homer Broome, a sincere but uncharismatic city  commissioner with no electoral experience, the decision had a domino effect.  Rita Walters, who wanted to run for the council, decided to stay on the school  board. That set back Mark Ridley-Thomas, executive director of the local  Southern Christian Leadership Conference and one of several young black  professionals hungry for a chance to make a difference in politics. He found  himself unexpectedly running against the well-supported incumbent Walters. The  result: He lost, and another chance of political upward mobility for a new  generation of black leaders was lost, too. And since incumbents rarely leave  office, the "thirtysomething" hopefuls grow gray waiting for their turn at the  political helm.  </P> <P> So, many blacks cling to Bradley, with an interest less in protecting him  personally and more as an act of self-preservation.  </P> <P> "Even if you're not a fan of his," said one prominent black businessman, "if he  goes out with a cloud over his head, it hurts us all."  </P> <P> Many privately express worry that they will be forgotten in Los Angeles as  Latino and Asian populations grow. It's an odd worry for a city that has the  third-largest black population in the nation. But that infrequently quoted fact  is little comfort to the blacks who have personalized Bradley's woes.  </P> <P> Such a deep fear, which likely seems exaggerated to whites, is credible to many  blacks. A January Los Angeles Times poll showed why with an ugly reality:  Blacks are the group most disliked by others in Southern California. Although  no poll was needed to confirm that to a black person, living daily with that  knowledge has its deleterious effects -- like seeing racism as the motive when  the press naturally goes after a big news story about Bradley's finances.  </P> <P> The love-indifference-love relationship between Bradley and black voters was  best described to me by a longtime resident who has known the mayor for several  years.  </P> <P> To the black community, this person said, Tom Bradley "is like the cousin in  your family who was bright and managed against all odds to get to college and  do better than anyone else in the family, and everyone's so proud. Then the  cousin moves to the other side of town and visits less often because he's busy  and successful. You understand. But as time goes on and baby brother needs  shoes and mom gets sick, you sort of resent him for not doing more (to help).  But when someone outside of the family attacks him, you end up leaping to his  defense -- though you may think about it awhile first."  </P> <P> And so to the degree that the black community ties its fate to that of the  mayor, both face some difficult times and hard questions ahead.  </P></p>

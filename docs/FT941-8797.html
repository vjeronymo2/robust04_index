			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Portugal in telecom merger The Portuguese government is merging two of its three telecommunications operators ahead of partial privatisation late this year or in early 1995, writes Peter Miles in Lisbon. The cabinet yesterday decided to rename Telefones de Lisboa e Porto and Telecom Portugal as Portugal Telecom. TLP covers communications in Lisbon and Oporto, while Telecom handles calls with the rest of the country and with Europe. The government said Marconi, the intercontinental operator, 51 per cent state held, was being left out of the merger for the time being.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> (San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Portland General Electric Company were among the applicant companies when WSPP applied to Fe. Both companies, by letter to FE, subsequently withdrew from the WSPP application and were individually issued electricity export authorizations in Docket Numbers EA&hyph;100 and EA&hyph;97.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By this joint application, each of the participating Pool members seek an export authorization allowing them to enter into transactions with BC Hydro which involve the exportation of electricity from the United States. All such transactions would be pursuant to the terms and conditions of the WSPP's pooling Agreement and service schedules approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The WSPP Agreement effects a marketing arrangement pursuant to which the members provide among themselves prescheduled and realtime coordinated short-term power and energy transactions. The Agreement also sets forth the limitations and parameters affecting all WSPP transactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The WSPP Agreement contains four service schedules approved by and on file with FERC. All WSPP transactions are conducted voluntarily among members pursuant to the terms of the service schedules. The transactions are wholesale in nature, involving no retail sales. Specifically, the schedules provide for (1) Economy Energy Service, (2) Unit Commitment Service, (3) Firm System Capacity/Energy Sales or Exchanges, and (4) Transmission Service. Significantly, all transactions among WSPP members must be no more than one year in duration. Also, all transmission services are voluntary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The WSPP Agreement is not intended to relegate the members to a ``traditional power pool'' arrangement. The Agreement does not work to supersede any of the contractual relationships of any of the members, and its does not preclude any of the members from entering into future contractual relationships. In the WSPP application, WSPP asserts that, in essence, the WSPP is intended to be superimposed on top of its members' other contractual relationships and thereby serve to capture economic benefits which are not already realized under those existing agreements. Because of its purpose as a supplemental agreement to facilitate the sale of short-term excess capacity and energy, transactions under the WSPP agreement involve the use of only existing facilities and do not require the construction of new facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The electric energy to be exported will be delivered by BC Hydro over the international transmission facilities owned and operated by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of these facilities has been authorized by Presidential permits issued pursuant to Executive Order 10485, as amended by Executive Order 12038. These facilities consist of three electric transmission lines that interconnect with facilities of BC Hydro: Two 500-kilovolt (kV) lines located at Blaine, Washington, (Presidential Permit PP&hyph;10) and one 230-kV line at Nelway, British Columbia (Presidential Permit PP&hyph;46). In addition, BPA's 230-kV transmission line that connects to West Kootenay Power and Light Company, Limited, also at Nelway, British Columbia, will be used (Presidential Permit PP&hyph;36). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedural Matters: Any person desiring to be heard or to protest this application should file a petition to intervene or protest at the address provided above in accordance with &sect;&sect;385.211 or 385.214 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211, 385.214). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any such petitions and protests should be filed with the DOE on or before the date listed above. Additional copies of such petitions to intervene or protests also should be filed directly with: Michael E. Small, Wright &amp; Talisman, suite 600, 1200 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;3802. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 18 CFR 385.211, protests and comments will be considered by the DOE in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a petition to intervene under 18 CFR 385.214. Section 385.214 requires that a petition to intervene must state, to the extent known, the position taken by the petitioner and the petitioner's interest in sufficient factual detail to demonstrate either that the petitioner has a right to participate because it is a State Commission; that it has or represents an interest which may be directly affected by the outcome of the proceeding, including any interest as a consumer, customer, competitor, or a security holder of a party to the proceeding; or that the petitioner's participation is in the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A final decision will be made on this application after a determination is made by the DOE that the proposed action will not impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or will not impede or tend to impede the coordination in the public interest of facilities in accordance with section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. The final decision would be issued to the individual members of WSPP and not to the Power Pool itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before an export authorization may be issued, the environmental impacts of the proposed DOE action (i.e., granting the export authorization, with any conditions and limitations, or denying it) must be evaluated pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of this application will be made available, upon request, for public inspection and copying at the address provided above. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on May 2, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Anthony J.

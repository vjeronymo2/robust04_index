			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Political hopes take Hong Kong to record LINGERING concern over the yen's strength continued to weigh on the market, and share prices closed lower on small-lot selling by investment trusts and dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 94.31 at 16,759.61 after a day's high of 16,840.67 and low of 16,721.48. Small-lot sales of export-oriented stocks depressed prices as the yen hit a new Tokyo high of Y116.15 against the dollar. The yen later fell below Y117 in the afternoon, but investors failed to respond. Volume came to 230m shares, compared with 251m on Wednesday, and declines outpaced gains by 656 to 311, with 168 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 6.47 to 1,266.11, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.40 to 1,013.14. Volatility on the currency markets hurt leading exporters, while importers of raw materials and fuels, seen as beneficiaries of a higher yen, were firm. Electric power companies were the top gaining sector, rising 1.4 per cent. Railway-related shares were picked up by dealers who hope that the autumn listing of JR East, created by a break-up of the former state-owned Japan Railways, could ignite interest in companies with close links to railway companies. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which has gained some 10 per cent in the past four trading sessions, relinquished Y4,000 to Y666,000 on light profit-taking. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel attributed the recent rise of the semi-state-owned company to buying by Japanese securities houses, wanting to gain the lead underwriting role for JR East. Nippon Comsys, an electrical engineering group with close links to NTT, declined Y12 to Y719, while Fujikura, the cable company, receded Y9 to Y570. Tokyo Electric Power, which relies on fuel imports, advanced Y60 to Y2,740, while electrical engineering concerns affiliated to the power suppliers gained ground. Kyudenko appreciated Y50 to Y1,640 and Kandenko moved forward Y40 to Y2,170. Brokerage issues fell on earnings worries. Daiwa Securities dipped Y30 to Y820 and Nomura Securities Y20 to Y1,440. Nomura announced plans to cut executive salaries by 10 to 20 per cent from March due to worse than expected earnings prospects. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 71.27 to 17,855.38 in turnover of 118.6m shares. Volume surged on cross trading by investors wanting to realise profits on stock holdings. Roundup INVESTORS IN Hong Kong pronounced themselves satisfied with Wednesday's budget, but more importantly they took heart at political developments, and shares finished at an all-time high. The latest rally brings stock prices to some 30 per cent above their lows of early December. US institutions who had been buying back into the Hong Kong market for several days were joined yesterday by local investors and some mainland Chinese buyers. Mr Michael Franklin of Kim Eng Securities in London said the colony's budget proposals had been well received but that the strong market performance indicated that investors were now looking for a break-through in the political situation when Governor Chris Patten addresses the Legislative Council today. HONG KONG saw the Hang Seng index gain 31.16, or 0.48 per cent, at 6,467.80, having touched a peak of 6,538.32 shortly after the opening, in heavy turnover exceeding HKDollars 5bn. The previous intraday and closing records were 6,470 and 6,447 respectively, reached on November 12. Shares opened at a record high, driven by good annual results for HSBC's Midland Bank, and expectations of a 25 per cent rise in profits for HSBC being revealed later this month. HSBC, the biggest component of the Hang Seng index, ended HKDollars 1 higher at HKDollars 67, after reaching HKDollars 68. TAIWAN continued its upward drive and the weighted index added 154.71, or 3.4 per cent, to set an 11-month peak of 4,737.32. The index has risen 40 per cent since the start of February in a rally sparked by easing political tensions, a better economic outlook and the formation of a new, pro-business cabinet. SINGAPORE drew encouragement from Keppel's 14.3 per cent increase in 1992 earnings and the Straits Times Industrial index rose 6.57 to 1,658 in volume of 157.26m shares, against 77.21m on Wednesday. Keppel put on 10 cents at SDollars 7.05 but its Singmarine subsidiary shed 12 cents to SDollars 3.56 on reporting a 42 per cent drop in 1992 net profits. AUSTRALIA eased afresh amid continuing uncertainty over the March 13 federal election. The All Ordinaries index dipped 3.2 to 1,622.9.</p>

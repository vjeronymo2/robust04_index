			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTONOVICH CALLS BIAS RULING WRONG  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich told a federal judge Thursday that Sarah Flores'  first-place finish in the June primary for a seat on the county board shows  that the judge was wrong in ruling that the supervisors discriminated against  Latinos in drawing district boundaries.  </P> <P> Antonovich took the witness stand during the third day of a hearing before U.S.  District Judge David V. Kenyon on whether a new county redistricting plan  corrects violations of the federal Voting Rights Act.  </P> <P> Kenyon is expected to decide early next week whether to accept the plan, which  places Supervisor Ed Edelman in a new, predominantly Latino district. The  plaintiffs in the voting rights case want a district without an incumbent to  improve the chances for the first Latino to win a seat on the board.  </P> <P> In his testimony, Antonovich denied allegations that he and Supervisor Deane  Dana endorsed Flores in an effort to persuade Kenyon to dismiss the voting  rights lawsuit.  </P> <P> The allegation was made under oath Wednesday by Flores' opponent, Superior  Court Judge Gregory O'Brien.  </P> <P> Dana on Monday testified that he had "absolutely not" told O'Brien that the  lawsuit was the reason he supported Flores to succeed retiring Supervisor Pete  Schabarum -- a statement that O'Brien said amounted to perjury.  </P> <P> Antonovich said he met with O'Brien in March and told him, "The plan in 1981  was not discriminatory, and Sarah Flores' victory will show it."  </P> <P> He said that Flores' first-place finish shows that Kenyon's ruling was "wrong."  </P> <P> Flores, who won 35% of the vote in June, and O'Brien, who received 20%, are due  to face off in November, but whether the election will proceed hinges on the  outcome of the hearing.  </P> <P> Antonovich said he endorsed Flores because he has known her since high school,  because of her experience as a longtime deputy to Schabarum and because "she  was the best qualified."  </P> <P> Supervisor Kenneth Hahn on Thursday submitted written testimony objecting to  the county proposal to add Beverly Hills and Hollywood to his South-Central Los  Angeles district. Hahn said that would make it "harder for a black candidate or  a candidate favored by the black community" to get elected.  </P></p>

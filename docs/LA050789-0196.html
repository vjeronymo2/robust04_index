			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PREP WRAPUP;  </P> <P> THOMAS QUITS AFTER LEUZINGER WALKOUT;  </P> <P> 2-YEAR COACHING TENURE WAS STORMY  </P> <P> A stormy two-year relationship between Leuzinger High's baseball team and Coach  Derrel Thomas ended Thursday when the ex-Dodger resigned after most of the  Olympian players turned in their uniforms.  </P> <P> Leuzinger Athletic Director Steve Carnes said Friday that the players who quit  have been reinstated and that Thomas will be replaced by junior varsity Coach  George Mendez for the team's two remaining Bay League games Tuesday and  Thursday against Santa Monica.  </P> <P> Thursday's flare-up between Thomas and several players came after the team  forfeited its league game against Hawthorne, a loss that eliminated Leuzinger  from playoff contention and brought down the curtain on a disappointing season  for the once-promising Olympians.  </P> <P> "The whole situation is just crazy," said a Leuzinger teacher, who asked not to  be identified. "But (the school) put up with it for two years. Thomas has had  conflicts with players before."  </P> <P> The teacher said Thomas, a walk-on coach, was almost fired last season for  grabbing a player and has been criticized for frequently missing practices and  team meetings.  </P> <P> Reports vary as to who was at fault for Thursday's forfeit.  </P> <P> Thomas said only six players were on the team bus when it departed for the game  at Hawthorne. He said other players who missed the bus because they were late  drove to the game in cars but were ineligible to play.  </P> <P> "It's because of insurance purposes," he said.  </P> <P> However, Carnes said there is no CIF-Southern Section rule restricting the mode  of transportation to and from games. He said if the players drove to the game  on time, they could have played.  </P> <P> But when the remaining players arrived at Hawthorne, Thomas informed them that  they would not play and Leuzinger would have to forfeit.  </P> <P> "That's when they walked by me and handed in their uniforms," he said.  </P> <P> Asked if he tried to talk the players out of quitting, Thomas said: "Why should  I? I didn't have to talk them into playing baseball."  </P> <P> Thomas said nine players walked out, including star pitcher Tyrone Scott, the  South Bay leader in strikeouts. He said only three starters did not turn in  their uniforms.  </P> <P> "We've had problems with them being late for the bus," he said. "I got fed up  with it."  </P> <P> The incident capped a rough week for Thomas. His father, Lorenzo, died Monday,  forcing him to miss practice that day and have Mendez serve as acting coach in  Tuesday's 10-9 loss to Hawthorne. He attended the game and returned to practice  on Wednesday.  </P> <P> "I had planned to take the whole week off," he said. "But just doing nothing  didn't seem to be too productive. My spirits weren't that high, but I still  tried to coach anyway."  </P> <P> The resignation did not surprise many at Leuzinger. When Thomas was hired  before last season, he said he didn't plan on coaching at Leuzinger for more  than two years. The Olympians were 25-29-1 under Thomas.  </P> <P> "The entire baseball situation has been building to this," Carnes said. "I  think, under the circumstances, the resignation is best for all concerned. It  hasn't been easy for Derrel. He's had some personal problems this week with his  father passing away."  </P> <P> Carnes said the school plans to advertise for a new coach.  </P> <P> "We're looking for a teacher, somebody who is on campus all the time," he said.  "I think that will be best for the program."  </P> <P> Ironically, Thomas' arrival at Leuzinger last year was met with enthusiasm by  many of the same players who walked out Thursday.  </P> <P> Many felt the presence of an ex-major leaguer would help fill the void left by  Dennis Bowman, who died of a heart attack in May, 1987, after coaching the  Olympians to a 142-86-2 record in nine seasons.  </P> <P> But the high expectations never materialized.  </P> <P> Leuzinger took third behind Redondo and El Segundo in the competitive Pioneer  League last season and lost in the opening round of the Southern Section 4-A  Division playoffs, finishing with a 12-16 record.  </P> <P> Thomas predicted that the Olympians would win the Bay League title this season,  and that seemed possible in March after they captured the championship of the  Costa Mesa Tournament and brought a 7-2-1 record into league play.  </P> <P> However, Leuzinger played inconsistently, and reports of Thomas' run-ins with  umpires and his players overshadowed the team's lackluster performances on the  field. A source at Leuzinger said Thomas was ejected from a game with Crespi on  April 22 in the Palos Verdes/Redondo Tournament and drove away in his car while  the team rode home on a bus.  </P> <P> "He said he had to go to a (baseball) card show," the source said.  </P> <P> The frustration felt by Thomas and Leuzinger's players seemed to come to a head  in recent weeks as the team dropped out of contention in the Bay League. The  forfeit to Hawthorne marked the Olympians' seventh loss in the last eight games  and kept them in seventh place at 4-8, 13-13-1 overall.  </P> <P> "They had a good team, easily one of the top teams in the area," said a  Leuzinger teacher. "And now they're zilch."  </P> <P> Carnes, who coaches Leuzinger's football team in addition to serving as  athletic director, said he sympathized with the players who quit.  </P> <P> "You have to realize they're disappointed because of the way the season has  turned out," he said. "I know they weren't happy about quitting. But they're  kids, and they're impulsive."  </P> <P> El Segundo and St. Bernard, co-leaders in the Camino Real League baseball race,  will square off at 7 Wednesday night at El Segundo Recreation Park in a game  that will most likely decide the league championship.  </P> <P> El Segundo snapped St. Bernard's Southern Section record of 35 consecutive  league victories with a 9-6 win April 15, but the Eagles figure to face a  different pitcher Wednesday.  </P> <P> St. Bernard's ace left-hander, Dan Melendez (9-1), did not pitch in the last  meeting but is scheduled to start this time. Melendez hit two home runs and had  five RBIs in the first game with El Segundo.  </P> <P> Carson's baseball team forfeited its game with visiting Crenshaw on Friday when  Coach Marty Blankenship was ejected for arguing about a balk in the first  inning. The loss knocked the Colts into last place in the four-team Pacific  League with a 6-6 record and hurt their chances of qualifying for the L.A. City  4-A playoffs with three games remaining.  </P> <P> The top two teams from each league and the four best third-place teams from the  4-A Division's six leagues will qualify for the playoffs.  </P></p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: Fund managers rush to limit their exposure - Whitehall claims vindication POLITICIANS in Europe have frequently blamed speculators for the crises in the exchange rate mechanism. But the frantic selling of the franc yesterday appeared to be by pension funds and companies with international investments, which do not normally take speculative positions in currency markets. Throughout the last few days, fund managers have been particularly concerned that a devaluation of the French franc could undermine the value of French bonds and equities they hold. They have therefore hedged the exposure of these instruments by selling the French franc now, fearing that its exchange rate will soon depreciate. Pension fund managers intervene in the currency markets comparatively rarely. But the sums that they have under management are vast, and much greater than the reserves held by central banks. The other group of players who were selling the French franc yesterday were the New York-based hedge funds - of which the Soros Fund, run by the entrepreneur, Mr George Soros, is the best known. These funds are highly speculative players, but for most of this week they have taken a very low profile. Last weekend, Mr Soros told a French newspaper that he was not speculating against the franc because of his support for European monetary union. Yesterday, he changed his stance, in a statement saying that it was 'futile to protect the European Monetary System by abstaining from trading in currencies.' That statement may have brought a new wave of panic to the market. But, at the end of European trading yesterday, some analysts thought these hedge funds were playing a comparatively small part in this crisis.</p>

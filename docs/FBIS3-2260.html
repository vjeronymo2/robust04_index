Some 100 Norwegian soldiers riding in 17 armored personnel  carriers and six Danish tanks, entered the base to replace  Bosnia's Muslim troops, who are to officially hand over control  of the airport at noon Tuesday.    Located 15 kilometers from Tuzla city, the airport has been  the biggest military one in former Yugoslavia with two runways,  one of which is 2,400 meters long. The airport is capable of  receiving all types of aircraft.    The airport has been closed for more than 10 months. Under  an accord reached by Bosnian Serb and Russian leaders, the Serbs  agreed to reopen it on condition of using it only for  humanitarian purposes.    About 300 Swedish soldiers will be deployed there to protect  the runways.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guido Dell'Anquila] </F>   [Excerpts] It seemed as though it had all been sorted out:  President Scalfaro was going to be a super-guarantor and was  ready to appoint Berlusconi premier. Then problems started and  Berlusconi has still not been asked to form a government.  [passage omitted]    [Dell'Aquila] It is not Scalfaro who is  hesitating--Berlusconi has asked for more time. He wants all  the pieces of the jigsaw in place before he takes up the mantle,  in order to avoid surprises.    There are at least two problems which still have to be  solved. On the one hand there is the problem of  guarantees--Berlusconi's dual role as premier and businessman.  Yesterday, Scalfaro came forward to play the role of  super-guarantor, but today the Northern League has applied the  brakes. The League's Francesco Speroni has said: Berlusconi  will be watched by us and by parliament.    The other problem still waiting to be solved concerns the  much criticized plan to divide the functions of the Interior  Ministry. However, the Northern League is sticking to its guns.

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Observer: Final hurdle John Fairley's promotion to managing director of programmes at Yorkshire TV means that the race for the most powerful job in the new ITV power structure  -the network's central programme scheduler  - is again open. Fairley had the backing of Greg Dyke, chairman of the ITV Association, for a job which involves putting an annual programme budget of Pounds 425m to work and refereeing any disputes between the big ITV companies and the independent producers. However, Fairley seems more interested in chasing foxes than chancing his luck on a bed of nails, so the field has opened up again. Charles Denton of Zenith, the independent programme production company, Andy Allen, director of programmes at Central and his counterpart at Granada, Steve Morrison, are all in the running. But getting everyone to agree is going to be hard and at the end of the day the Independent Television Commission may have to impose its choice. So coming up on the rails is the perfect compromise candidate in Paul Bonner who, as director of the programming planning secretariat at ITV, is already doing the equivalent job. Bonner has the programme-making credentials - he was head of science and features at the BBC and director of programmes at Channel 4 before immersing himself in the ITV bureaucracy. He also has a secret advantage. He's less than three years off retirement. So if he doesn't suit . . .</p>

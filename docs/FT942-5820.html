			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Investors stay on sidelines despite higher yields European government bonds took another tumble on continued futures and cash selling, and although long yields have risen sharply in recent days, they failed to lure investors back into the market. 'It is increasingly unclear what is pushing the markets down,' said Mr Peter Kerger, head of futures and options at NatWest Markets in Frankfurt, but after the recent heavy losses, 'there is a lot of fear, and a self-feeding downward momentum in the market.' In addition to technical selling in the futures pits, traders reported significant sales of cash bonds by institutions opting to end the pain of watching their long-term positions go deeper into the red. 'People who have held on and on since February are fed up and have begun offloading loss-making positions,' said one dealer. Higher than expected German production data and the release of a strong US National Association of Purchasing Management index also pressured prices. German bunds opened slightly higher on early short-covering after Tuesday's sell-off. The Bundesbank lowered its securities repurchase rate by five basis points to 5.15 per cent but that failed to give prices a lift, especially after earlier rumours of a larger cut. Stronger-than-expected industrial production further pressured prices, fanning fears that economic recovery might fuel inflation pressures. Contradictory comments from Bundesbank council members added to the market's confused state. While Mr Guntram Palm, president of the state central bank of Baden-Wurttemberg, said that recent cuts in the discount and Lombard rates mark at least a stopping point and 'maybe even a turning point' in monetary policy, Mr Olaf Sievert, president of the state central bank of Saxony-Turingia, said that 'a definite end of the monetary easing has by no means been indicated, and has certainly not been agreed upon'. Activity is expected to be calmer today with large parts of Germany closed for the Corpus Christi holiday. The June bund future fell to around 92.30, down 0.54 points on the day. France heavily underperformed Germany, with the June notional bond contract on Matif falling by 1.16 point to 116.56. Plagued by inflation fears and weakness in neighbouring markets, UK gilts were one of the day's worst performers. The June long gilt futures contract fell through the psychologically important 100 level - the lowest level for the front-month contract since January 1993 - to close around 99 25/32 , down 1 1/32 on the day. Traders reported selling of cash bonds by institutions and no buying interest, even though current yields are seen to offer good value. The 10-year gilt currently yields 8.79 per cent, some 191 basis points above its German counterpart. Europe's peripheral markets also fell sharply, with Denmark and Sweden again severly weakened by heavy foreign selling, which also weakened their currencies. In Italy, the June BTP contract dropped 1.13 points to 107.04 and in Spain, which faces a government bond auction today, the June bond future fell 0.97 points to 93.71. Even in Japan, which has held up well recently, prices were hit by stronger economic data, causing the September JGB contract to fall by 1.11 points in Tokyo, and another 0.49 points in London to 110.82. US Treasury bonds staged an impressive recovery yesterday afternoon from an early sell-off triggered by fresh signs of inflation. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/2 higher at 86 15/32 , with the yield dipping to 7.379 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was  1/32 better at 99 13/16 , to yield 5.959 per cent. The late rally was tied to declining commodity prices and reports of an unannounced bond purchases by the Federal Reserve. In the morning, the National Association of Purchasing Management had re-ignited the market's fears of inflation with the release of its May survey. The overall index came in at 57.7, unchanged from the April reading. However, the prices index, viewed as an accurate leading indicator, was up sharply at 71.5, against 63.2 the previous month. The data suggested that the economy's expansion over the past six months had finally created shortages of raw materials, which were feeding through to the prices paid by manufacturers. As a result, bonds across the board lost ground quickly. Longer-dated securities, whose value is eroded by inflation, suffered the worst damage, dropping by nearly  3/4 points within minutes of the mid-morning announcement. Later, prices stabilised and recovered amid talk of the Fed buying three-year and five-year notes on the open market. The move carried no policy significance. The release of the NAPM survey overshadowed one shred of favourable economic news on offer. The Commerce Department said construction spending had risen a tepid 0.6 per cent in April, against expectations of a 1 per cent gain. The session brought only light activity, which may have exaggerated the price swings.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- The Tokyo District Court  rejected Thursday [14 April] an appeal from former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakamura against a judge's decision Wednesday  not to release him on bail, Nakamura's defense attorneys said.    The three-judge panel acted on an appeal from Nakamura who  had asked for bail so he can take part in a Diet vote to pick a  successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his  resignation last Friday. But no date has been set for the Diet  vote yet.    Nakamura, 45, an independent member of the House of  Representatives, has been detained at the Tokyo detention house  since mid-March after prosecutors arrested him on suspicion of  taking a 10 million yen bribe from leading general contractor  Kajima Corp.    Prosecutors indicted Nakamura on April 1 on charges of  taking  the bribe on January 13, 1992, from Shinji Kiyoyama, then vice  president of Kajima.    The Tokyo District Court did not state its reasons for the  latest rejection.    Nakamura's first bail application was dismissed last Tuesday  on the grounds he might destroy evidence.    Nakamura's latest appeal was a "junkoku" appeal which can be  filed with a three-judge panel at a district court. It is a  legal recourse available under the Code of Criminal Procedure  when the defense claims it is dissatisfied with a decision by a  single judge.    Nakamura is the sole Diet member implicated in connection  with an influence-peddling scandal surrounding the country's  leading construction contractors.    He quit the Liberal Democratic Party just before his arrest  and is currently an independent member of the lower house.    If found guilty, Nakamura could face up to five years in  prison, according to the penal code.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Gwent (7): 'Most exciting science park' - Celtic lakes A CHANCE meeting between Dr Eric Ash, rector of Imperial College of Science and Technology, and Mr David Waterstone, then chief executive of the Welsh Development Agency, led to the creation of what has been described as the 'the most exciting science park to be built in Britain'. Imperial College, part of London University and a world-renowned leader in the field of science and technology, was looking to expand its science park, a small unit of about three to four acres housed at Ascot, Berkshire. That building was full, while Imperial's premises, next to the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Natural Science Museum in London's South Kensington, offered no scope for expansion. Mr Waterstone seized his chance. Why did Imperial not come to Wales, to a site in Newport that the agency wanted to develop in conjunction with the borough council and Gwent County Council? In travelling time, it was little further from Imperial College than Ascot since trains ran every hour through the day from Newport into Paddington in about 100 minutes. With modern communications anyone in Newport could talk through computer links to Imperial College just as easily as if he or she were in the next room. Dr Ash was intrigued. Some time after, a report in the Financial Times alerted other parts of Britain to Imperial's intention to move its science park to Wales. The college was bombarded with proposals that it should look elsewhere. This was an anxious time for the Welsh Development Agency as Imperial felt bound to consider several other suggestions, though in the end it stuck by its decision to put its science park in Newport. The first building, an innovation centre, on what has been named Imperial Park has just been completed and the first tenants are on the point of moving in. Dr Gwyn Jones, the WDA's chairman, who has already paid one visit to Japan to 'sell' the idea of Imperial Park as a place for high-quality research allied to the college, is enthusiastic about the project. 'This science park will put Wales on the map as one of the most technologically advanced places in which to work,' he says. 'Imperial Park will become the science park by which all the others will be judged. With Imperial's reputation and our development and marketing ability, the economy of Wales will be given an enormous lift.' Imperial Park is, in fact, only part of a much larger Pounds 250m development that is taking place on the western edge of Newport and that goes under the name Celtic Lakes. This area is being developed by a partnership between Trencherwood, the Newbury-based concern in Berkshire, which has long owned land on the site, and the Bassaleg Group, a local concern which is closely linked to London and Cardiff Properties, the development arm of a local entrepreneur, Mr Bruce Woodstock. Celtic Lakes covers some 170 acres and is a joint venture between the two private sector concerns and the WDA and Newport from the public sector. In the first phase of the development, Imperial together with the WDA and Newport will work on 50 acres while the two private sector concerns will have some 60 acres. In the second phase Imperial has a further 28 acres with Celtic Lakes holding the remainder. Imperial Park's innovation centre, covering 25,000 sq ft, will be let, on two floors, in units down to 500 sq ft with direct communications links to Imperial College in London. A second sister building next door is expected to be ready next year. Mr Bruce Woodhead of Celtic Lakes says that work on its first building, actually two 15,000 sq ft buildings linked by an atrium, should start soon so that it is ready for occupation in the summer of next year. He is looking for rents in the area of Pounds 12.50-14 a sq ft, the higher figure being the top of the market at the moment in nearby Cardiff. A marketing launch will begin in the autumn. Imperial's rents would be lower since its clientele would be rather different, researchers and scientists working at the leading edge of science and technology. With its smaller units it is looking at about Pounds 8.50 a sq ft. Like the other major science parks in Britain, such as Trinity in Cambridge and Heriot-Watt in Edinburgh, Imperial hopes that its tenants will eventually grow larger and move out, it is hoped, into larger premises on the Celtic Lakes estate. When completed, the science and business park comprising Celtic Lakes will offer some 2m sq ft of space. Mr Graham Moore, the WDA's property director, says that the joint venture between the four partners involved in Celtic Lakes, will 'ensure that the development linking the science park and the business park will go ahead with quality always in mind.' Both he and Mr Woodhead say that tenants are 'on the horizon'. The WDA is marketing Imperial Park 'very heavily', Mr Moore says, 'and one or two major companies have already expressed strong interest'. Mr Woodhead says even the institutions are interested in the site. In the present climate that is quite an achievement because Celtic Lakes is not a stand-alone development. TSB and Panasonic have been adjoining inhabitants for some years and across the A48, which links Newport and Cardiff, Gwent County Council together with Newport and the WDA is developing the Gwent Technology Park. This park has, for some years, been home to the research and development activities of AB Electronics, the international concern. Next door to this technology park the London-based Portico Estates is developing, in conjunction with University College, Cardiff, what was intended to be a science park but which now has more of a business park theme. This developer, too, is talking of a potential client. Visitors to Celtic Lakes can now see the distinct outlines of the park created by London architects Aukett Associates. Water features are in place, the roads are completed and the paths are laid down. Mr Woodhead says the number of trees and shrubs planted have probably not been exceeded by any other British business park. 'We see the site competing with the very best, with the likes of Aztec West in Bristol, the Birmingham Business Park, Stockley Park near London's Heathrow Airport or the Solent Business Park outside Southampton. But this is not just a British park; it is intended to be able to compete with the very best in Europe, too.' Those are large claims, but there are plenty of people in Wales who believe not only that Celtic Lakes, incorporating Imperial Park, will succeed but that it will enormously enhance the standing and attraction of the Welsh economy as well.</p>

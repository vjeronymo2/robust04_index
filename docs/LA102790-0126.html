			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEGOTIATORS AGREE ON DEFICIT-CUTTING PLAN;  </P> <P> BUDGET: THE PACKAGE IS RUSHED TO HOUSE FOR A VOTE. LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES AND  THE PRESIDENT'S AIDES BACK THE NEW MEASURE. IT FALLS $10 BILLION SHORT OF  EARLIER $500-BILLION GOAL.  </P> <P> Senate and House negotiators reached formal agreement Friday on a trimmed-down  version of a compromise budget deficit-reduction plan and sent it to the House  floor for approval only 10 days before the November elections.  </P> <P> At a meeting in the House Speaker's office, after two full days of additional  wrangling following months of partisan discord, congressional leaders of both  parties and President Bush's own representatives gave their blessing to the  package.  </P> <P> The House was expected to approve the package, albeit narrowly, sometime early  today, and the Senate would then vote on the accord later in the day. Bush  Administration officials said there was no doubt that the President would sign  the new measure.  </P> <P> The five-year budget plan falls $10 billion short of the $500-billion  deficit-reduction goal that the two sides had set in an earlier accord, which  had been worked out at a 4 1/2-month-long summit between the White House and  congressional leaders.  </P> <P> Even so, it contained a sizable tax increase, designed to hit hardest at the  rich. And it included substantial cuts in spending on agriculture and other  government benefit programs.  </P> <P> The accord came as the Treasury Department disclosed that the federal deficit  for fiscal 1990, which ended on Sept. 30, jumped to $220.39 billion, the  second-worst showing ever. The record -- $221.2 billion -- was reported in  fiscal 1986.  </P> <P> Economists predicted that the budget deficit for the current year, fiscal 1991,  would soar to the $275-billion range, even with the deficit-reduction plan that  is expected to be signed into law this weekend.  </P> <P> Despite the endorsement of the plan by House and Senate negotiators Friday,  approval by the full House early today was not a certainty.  </P> <P> Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) predicted that the House would pass the  legislation, but his top lieutenants reportedly were worried that  election-conscious House Democrats might balk. Analysts figured that Democrats  must provide 80% of the 217 votes needed for passage.  </P> <P> Most Republicans in the House -- defying President Bush's support for the plan  -- had indicated they would oppose any compromise that raises taxes. House  Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) had promised no more than 40 to 50  votes from GOP ranks to help pass the package.  </P> <P> In the Senate, however, leaders of both parties were more confident that the  budget plan would be approved with bipartisan backing.  </P> <P> House Democratic leaders, fearing that further delay might erode support for  the compromise agreement, rushed to bring it to the House floor late Friday  night or in the wee hours today as one of the last acts before Congress quits  for the year.  </P> <P> Negotiators gave final approval Friday to tax increases totaling $164.6 billion  over the next five years and tax breaks worth $27.4 billion, mainly to "working  poor" families with incomes under $20,000 a year.  </P> <P> There also would be $2.5 billion in tax relief for the oil industry.  </P> <P> Overall, revenues would contribute $137.2 billion to deficit reduction, with  spending reductions of $185 billion for the defense industry and a $100-billion  cutback in mandatory benefit programs.  </P> <P> The remainder of the $490-billion package would consist of estimated savings in  interest payments on the debt, now amounting to $264.8 billion a year.  </P> <P> Unlike most tax packages of the last decade, the plan presented to the House  would tilt sharply against those making more than $200,000 a year through a  combination of rate increases, limitations on deductions and a phase-out of the  $2,050 personal exemption.  </P> <P> People in this income category would see their taxes raised by an average 6.3%,  compared to an increase of roughly 2% for those making between $20,000 and  $200,000 a year and tax cuts of 2% or 3% for those below the $20,000 level.  </P> <P> The new budget package would raise the tax rate on the highest-income brackets  to 31%, from 28% now. It would also limit itemized deductions for wealthy  taxpayers, reduce the benefit from personal exemptions and impose the Medicare  payroll tax on higher incomes.  </P> <P> As expected, the compromise contained a 5-cent gasoline tax increase, starting  Dec. 1, and higher taxes on cigarettes, beer, wine, alcohol and a limited  number of luxury goods, such as high-priced cars, boats, planes, jewelry and  furs.  </P> <P> The gasoline-tax issue is particularly sensitive in California because the  state already has raised its gasoline tax by 5 cents a gallon, with additional  penny-a-gallon increases scheduled each January through 1994.  </P> <P> The compromise package contained few surprises, since most of its tax  provisions were telegraphed in advance during several days of semi-public  bargaining by negotiators.  </P> <P> It did include a tax break for parents of new babies -- a tax credit of up to  $340 for low-income taxpayers with children under 1 year old, effective Jan. 1.  </P> <P> A new child health insurance credit of 6% was added for working families with  incomes under $20,000. And the existing earned-income tax credits were more  than doubled, with larger credits or federal payments to families depending on  the number of children they have.  </P> <P> The biggest single revenue-gainer, however, would come from applying the  existing 1.45% health insurance tax to the first $125,000 of wages, or  salaries, instead of using the $51,300 cutoff in effect this year. It would  raise $26.9 billion over the next five years.  </P> <P> The alternative minimum tax rate would be lifted from 21% to 24%, affecting  relatively few high-income people who otherwise would pay no tax at all because  they have so many legal deductions.  </P> <P> In all, the changes in individual tax rates would raise more than $40 billion  toward the deficit-cutting goal.  </P> <P> In a concession to investors, the tax on capital gains was set at 28% -- a cut  for those now in the 33% marginal rate category but merely preserving the same  rate for the very rich, who now pay 28% on ordinary income.  </P> <P> The compromise would raise airline ticket taxes to 10% from 8% and extend the  federal telephone tax for another five years.  </P> <P> In an effort to sweeten the package, the Senate-House negotiators decided to  extend for one year a series of popular tax breaks for business, including a  research and experimentation tax credit and a low-income housing credit. These  provisions would lose $5.8 billion in revenue over the next half-decade.  </P> <P> New taxes on insurance companies, however, would raise $8 billion. A  controversial plan to impose Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes on  state and local public employes who do not participate in a public employee  retirement system was added to the package. It would yield about $9.2 billion  in revenue.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES: A23, 24, 26  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE INCOME TAX BITE  </P> <P>  The following estimates of the impact of the federal budget pact include the  effects of a higher basic tax rate, limitations on itemized deductions, and the  phase-out of personal exemptions for upper-income taxpayers, as well as a  higher wage ceiling for the Medicare payroll tax.  </P> <P>  Individuals and families below the $75,000-level would have no net increase:.  The figures do not reflect increases in gasoline and other excise taxes.  </P> <P> $75,000 INCOME  </P> <P> Individuals:  </P> <P> Before: $15,423  </P> <P> After: $15,508  </P> <P> Increase: 0.55%  </P> <P> Married, no children:  </P> <P> Before: $12,521  </P> <P> After: $12,822  </P> <P> Increase: 2.4%  </P> <P> Married, two children, one earner:  </P> <P> Before: $11,317  </P> <P> After: $11,618  </P> <P> Increase: 2.65%  </P> <P> Married, two children, two earners:  </P> <P> Before: $11,618  </P> <P> After: $11,618  </P> <P> Increase: 0  </P> <P> </P> <P> $100,000 INCOME  </P> <P> Individuals:  </P> <P> Before: $22,229  </P> <P> After: $22,264  </P> <P> Increase: 0.16%  </P> <P> Married, no children:  </P> <P> Before: $18,296  </P> <P> After: $18,959  </P> <P> Increase: 3.62%  </P> <P> Married, two children, one earner:  </P> <P> Before: $17,092  </P> <P> After: $17,755  </P> <P> Increase: 3.88%  </P> <P> Married, two children, two earners:  </P> <P> Before: $17,755  </P> <P> After: $17,755  </P> <P> Increase: 0  </P> <P> </P> <P> $150,000 INCOME  </P> <P> Individuals:  </P> <P> Before: $35,438  </P> <P> After: $36,146  </P> <P> Increase: 2.0%  </P> <P> Married, no children:  </P> <P> Before: $31,741  </P> <P> After: $32,474  </P> <P> Increase: 2.31%  </P> <P> Married, two children, one earner:  </P> <P> Before: $30,322  </P> <P> After: $31,141  </P> <P> Increase: 2.7%  </P> <P> Married, two children, two earners:  </P> <P> Before: $31,110  </P> <P> After: $31,503  </P> <P> Increase: 1.26%  </P> <P> </P> <P> $200,000 INCOME  </P> <P> Individuals:  </P> <P> Before: $46,988  </P> <P> After: $49,665  </P> <P> Increase: 5.7%  </P> <P> Married, no children:  </P> <P> Before: $45,354  </P> <P> After: $46,260  </P> <P> Increase: 2.0%  </P> <P> Married, two children, one earner:  </P> <P> Before: $43,935  </P> <P> After: $45,460  </P> <P> Increase: 3.47%  </P> <P> Married, two children, two earners:  </P> <P> Before: $44,722  </P> <P> After: $46,547  </P> <P> Increase: 4.08%  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1,000,000 INCOME  </P> <P> Individuals:  </P> <P> Before: $231,788  </P> <P> After: $261,839  </P> <P> Increase: 12.96%  </P> <P> Married, no children:  </P> <P> Before: $231,787  </P> <P> After: $260,854  </P> <P> Increase: 12.54%  </P> <P> Married, two children, one earner:  </P> <P> Before: $231,788  </P> <P> After: $260,854  </P> <P> Increase: 12.54%  </P> <P> Married, two children, two earners:  </P> <P> Before:: $232,575  </P> <P> After: $262,666  </P> <P> Increase: 12.94%  </P> <P> Source: Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells  </P></p>

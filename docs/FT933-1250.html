			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Money Markets: German futures fall CONTINUING nervousness about the situation in Russia led to a new flight of safe haven funds into the dollar yesterday and this helped to push down the value of most German money market instruments, writes James Blitz. There was no specific news from Moscow to trigger concern in the markets. But it was still unclear yesterday whether President Boris Yeltsin had won a resounding victory in the political struggle being waged there. Dealers have sold German instruments at times of tension in eastern Europe, out of fears that there is substantial German investment in the region. The December short sterling contract fell 3 basis points to close at 93.88, and the March 1994 contract declined 1 basis point, finishing at 94.42. There was no suggestion that the fall in these prices had been due to the Bundesbank's decision to leave its Lombard and discount rates unchanged. Most of the market had been of the view that the central bank would not change monetary policy at Mr Helmut Schlesinger's last meeting as Bundesbank president. The central bank would not have wanted there to be any misinterpretation of decisions made during the presidential handover. In the German cash market, call money edged down slightly, benefiting from Wednesday's net injection of DM5.2bn into the market. Dealers said that recent pressure from German tax requirements had also faded. Overnight funds traded at 6.85 per cent, a little lower than Wednesday's 6.93 per cent. However, dealers said that the call money rate was unlikely to ease much more in the near term. French franc interest rate futures were little changed on a day which again brought no cut in the Bank of France's official interest rates. But the recent weakness of the D-Mark as a result of the crisis in Russia will almost certainly have helped the French authorities to buy D-Marks and build up reserves. Sterling interest rate futures were a little more buoyant because of the pound's stronger performance against the D-Mark. The December short sterling contract moved up one basis point to close at 94.33. Three-month sterling interest rates again ended at 5 7/8 per cent. Most of a Pounds 1.25bn shortage was removed by lunchtime.</p>

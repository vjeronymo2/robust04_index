Estonia today began registering the residents of the former  Soviet military base town located some 40 kilometers to the west  of the country's capital. The campaign is scheduled to continue  until Saturday [26 March].    Olesk in an interview with BNS warned that if the country  fails to get a record of Russia's active service military and  their family members in the town, a substantial part of Paldiski  residents will remain a secret for Estonia.    "We must have on record how many active service military and  their family members are there in Paldiski, and who they are.  If we fail to learn this, it means one: the Russian side is  destabilizing security in Paldiski," he said.    The minister said talks on the issue had taken place between  the Russian military and the Estonian Government's special  representative in the area, Juri Tikk. Olesk said Russian army  representatives had promised to present lists of their military  in the town. But he added that this was not enough for Estonia.    To pass the procedure, Paldiski residents must answer a  questionnaire, after what they will get a special inscription  into their passports. Car owners must also present their  driver's license and car ownership document.    The questionnaires will be filled in by Estonian officials  and then signed by the respondent.    Estonian authorities will be entitled to deny working and  residence permits to non-citizens who have no passport  inscription on having passed the registration. The stamp will  also give the holder the right to enter Paldiski at the time  when special entry regulations are to be introduced. The  regulations will be effective during the dismantling of two  nuclear reactors at a Russian base in the area.    Olesk said the overwhelming majority of Paldiski residents  were in favor of the registering. The questionnaires are later  to be checked by officials at the Citizenship and Migration  Department.    "It is clear that as the passport inscription is also a  certain kind of guarantee for movement in Paldiski during the  time of dismantling of the reactors, most Paldiski residents  want to get this inscription. Paldiski residents also  understand that the passport inscription and the special  regulations to be introduced for the time of dismantling of the  reactors are in their own interests," Olesk explained.    Government representative Juri Tikk has earlier said that  the  passport registration campaign which started today "is only the  first stage that will give a picture of the town's residents and  their documents."    "Sooner or later also those who abstain from filling in the  questionnaire will have to bring their explanations. At the  time when nuclear fuel will be brought out from Paldiski and  controls are stepped up at the Pakri peninsula, those people  will start to get caught," Tikk said.    Tikk said about 250 Estonian citizens and some 4,000 loyal  residents and their children were currently living in Paldiski.  Those are the people that have received the Estonian  privatization documents. Estimates put the number of Russian  military in the town at 800-1,000, about 600 of whom must leave  the country by Aug. 31, 1994. Then only some 200 Russian  military specialists will remain in the town to dismantle the  nuclear facility.    "Those people will be allowed to remain in Estonia only in  their status as civilians," Tikk added.</p>

Sergey Filatov, leader of the President's Administration,  now  gives his opinion on the reasons for the conduct of Boris  Yeltsin, his aides Yuriy Baturin and Georgiy Satarov, the State  Duma deputies, and the leaders of the Prosecutor General's  Office.    A few days before the decision on the political amnesty was  adopted, I attended the Duma Council session which discussed the  draft of this document. No one supported the draft apart from  Zhirinovskiy. Votes were cast against it by Shakhray, who  predetermined the result of the 23 February vote, and by Lakhova  and the representatives of the Communist Party of the Russian  Federation faction. They asked the same questions that we are  asking today: What kind of political amnesty is this, is it not  a cover for criminals to hide behind, and how is the decree to  be implemented without causing distortions to the law? On the  basis of these questions which remained unresolved in the draft  decree, the deputies voted against it.    However, a few days later they voted in favor of it. Yet the  questions remained unanswered and the deputies were supposed to  have adopted a document which would have addressed those  questions. Who can explain this inconsistency?    However, there is surely some consistency here. After all,  by no means the least role in the adoption of the amnesty  decision was played by those same people who opposed the  president in the former Supreme Soviet. The only difference is  that Viktor Ilyukhin, leader of the Security Committee and a  member of the communist faction, came to the aid of Vladimir  Isakov, leader of the Legislation Committee.    There is a certain logic to the opposition's conduct. Its  plan is this: Either the president does not intervene in its  actions, in which case the opposition will achieve its goal, or  the president does intervene, in which case he loses by setting  himself against the legislative power.    You can try that trick once, you can try it twice. But you  cannot be sure that every time you do it all the senior  officials will withdraw and leave the president one on one with  that misunderstanding of the laws, which is what the opposition  is doing. You cannot always count on the fact that the  president will have the final say. There is a certain  threshold, there are rules which every responsible official must  abide by.    But when you are expecting a normal constitutional process  and they impose the complete opposite on you, this of course  produces a certain shock. But it was agreed to refrain from  such rules after the 12 December elections and work instead on  the basis of constructive cooperation between the branches of  power. But what has happened is that Baturin and Satarov, the  president's aides, acted according to civilized rules and held  talks with the State Duma, the Prosecutor General's Office, and  the Supreme Court but the latter merely played games with them.  After all, the word "immediately" in the State Duma decision on  the amnesty has nothing to do with jurisprudence. But instead  of waiting for clarifications from the lower house of parliament  on the mechanism for the enactment of its decree, it was set in  motion straight away.    I told Kazannik about this when I phoned him on the evening  of Friday, 25 February. The first thing that he said to me was  this: "At 0900 hours on 26 February I shall release them all  from Lefortovo." I was worried that the decision was being  implemented right away without clarification on the mechanism of  its implementation. I put that question to Kazannik, and he  replied: "If I do not release them, Kravtsev (deputy prosecutor  general--T.Z. note) will."    My second question was this: Why not hand the State Duma's  decision over to the Constitutional Court, after all, it will  continue its work on the basis of the new law any day now.  Kazannik replied that this law does not exist at the moment. My  third suggestion was to pass the Duma's decree to the Supreme  Court, a structure that is in operation. To all these questions  I received a negative reply.    The final words which Kazannik said to me were these: "If I  do not release them I will be charged under the article on  exceeding my powers."    No matter what one says about the need to obey the letter of  the law, I am sure that the haste and inconsistency with which  the Prosecutor General's Office acted are absolutely obvious.    The judicial investigation which is now being conducted at  the Russian Prosecutor General's Office on the instructions of  its new leader, Aleksey Ilyushenko, will answer many of the  questions about the circumstances of and reasons for the hasty  implementation of the State Duma's decree on the political  amnesty.    I am also bound to note a certain aloofness on the part of  the deputies, prosecutors, and judges to the reason why the  amnesty was carried out. We have already been through this once  before when Khasbulatov imposed his ideas and believed that he  was acting in the interests of all society. If the reason for  the amnesty was to achieve social accord, there is only one side  which cannot take part in that process. After all, those people  who left Lefortovo jail take no account of the fact that this  was done for their sake.    As a result, the last word has once again been left to the  President, who to achieve real accord undertook the initiative  to unite all the political forces in society for the elaboration  of a charter on civil peace in the country.</p>

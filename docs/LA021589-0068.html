			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEAL IS REJECTED BY NORTH JUDGE;  </P> <P> GESELL TO AWAIT HIGH COURT'S VIEW ON SECRETS  </P> <P> A federal judge Tuesday rejected a compromise agreement on the screening of  classified information for the trial of Oliver L. North that had been worked  out by the Justice Department and independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, objecting to the joint request for  stricter procedures as unworkable and too late, said that he will await word  from the Supreme Court on whether the trial can go forward, an announcement  that may come in a few days.  </P> <P> Gesell, meanwhile, said that Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh could "terminate the  case or any count" in the indictment at once if he submitted an affidavit  barring disclosure of state secrets that North's lawyers say they need for his  defense.  </P> <P> "He can act now if he wants," Gesell told Justice Department attorney Stephen  A. Saltzburg.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Last-Minute Objections  </P> <P> Expressing his displeasure that the Justice Department had filed last-minute  objections on behalf of U.S. intelligence experts last week, just as he was  choosing a jury, Gesell declared: "I find no basis for giving him (Thornburgh)  a seat at the counsel table or the right to intervene by way of bits and pieces  of affidavits whenever the going gets tough."  </P> <P> The judge, however, granted a concession to Justice Department officials in one  area in which they had expressed grave concerns -- that the identities of 13  countries that had provided aid to Nicaragua's rebels in return for U.S.  assistance might be disclosed.  </P> <P> The judge said that he would consider masking the names of the countries as  long as the identities are not essential to a fair trial for the former White  House aide. He said that he would hear more from attorneys on that issue today.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would 'Gut Defense'  </P> <P> North's attorneys had objected to the proposed compromise, contending that it  would "gut the defense."  </P> <P> Gesell concluded the 90-minute open-court hearing by declaring that Walsh was  solely responsible for North's prosecution under the 1978 Ethics in Government  Act. That act removes the Justice Department from investigating or trying  current or former high government officials who might have political influence  with the department.  </P> <P> "Our lawyers are reviewing the judge's order," Thornburgh aide David Runkel  told reporters, adding that Justice Department officials have been meeting with  the independent counsel.  </P> <P> "There are a number of things being discussed back and forth," Runkel said.  "It's a question of reviewing the options. . . . We want the trial to continue  but we want to safeguard against the unauthorized release of classified  information."  </P> <P> The judge said that Thornburgh, who chiefly was responsible for making the  eleventh-hour bid to increase restrictions on use of classified information in  the Iran-Contra trial, had no right to urge the court to tighten its trial  procedures. Gesell acknowledged, however, that Thornburgh -- under the 1980  Classified Information Procedures Act -- has the power to withhold sensitive  information if he determines that its disclosure would harm national security.  </P> <P> In such instances, charges against North might have to be dropped -- as  happened last month when the primary counts of conspiracy and theft were  dismissed.  </P> <P> The proposed Thornburgh-Walsh compromise would have required Gesell to allow  government security experts to screen any evidence to be presented by North in  nine specific areas. Gesell noted that he already has worked with Walsh and  defense attorneys to screen hundreds of sensitive government documents over a  six-month period during which Justice Department officials were silent on the  issue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rehnquist Order  </P> <P> Walsh, in fact, had said that he was satisfied with the longstanding procedures  for handling classified materials but had agreed to the compromise with  Thornburgh to speed up the trial. Just before that agreement last weekend,  Thornburgh had obtained an order from Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist that  North's trial must be delayed pending a Supreme Court review of the dispute,  set for Friday.  </P> <P> Thornburgh had planned to ask the high court to bow out if Gesell accepted the  compromise.  </P> <P> But Gesell said that the compromise plan would force many delays in the trial,  with jurors having to be excused from the courtroom. He said that the plan also  might interfere with North's right to a fair trial.  </P> <P> Gesell said Tuesday that he wants to study the sensitive area of third-country  support for the Contras, which U.S. officials had secretly lined up during a  period in which direct U.S. military support for the Nicaraguan rebels was  prohibited by Congress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called Essential  </P> <P> North's lawyers said in court papers Monday that former President Ronald Reagan  and other top officials had sought to conceal the third-country support from  Congress and the public and that it was essential for North's defense that  jurors understand the matter.  </P> <P> They suggested that North's use of arms-sale profits from a third country --  Iran -- might be more understandable to jurors in light of this broader policy.  In return for aiding the Contras, part of a quid pro quo arrangement was that  the United States would provide "CIA covert support" to those nations, North's  lawyers said Tuesday in new court papers.  </P> <P> The former National Security Council aide still faces 12 felony counts,  including shredding documents and lying to Congress and then-Atty. Gen. Edwin  Meese III in 1986 to hide his role in the sale of arms to Iran and the  diversion of some of the proceeds to the Contras.  </P> <P> Gesell said that "some cynics" might view Thornburgh's action as an attempt to  protect the Reagan Administration, of which the attorney general and North had  been a part. But, the judge said, he does not share that view.  </P></p>

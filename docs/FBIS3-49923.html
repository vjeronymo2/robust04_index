Goncz said that the four Visegrad countries -- the Czech  Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia -- are in agreement over  all relevant issues, with only minor geographical differences.  Goncz believed the plan will be tested by concrete cooperation.  Prosperity is also important -- Budapest approaches security in  a broader context than the military alone.    Prime Minister Peter Boross stressed the peace-partnership  scheme as the first far-reaching international initiative by an  American President in office for several years to come.    Boross was happy with his talks with his Czech, Polish, and  Slovak counterparts, and called for greater efforts to solve  problems delaying setting up the Visegrad free-trade zone.</p>

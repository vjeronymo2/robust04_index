			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlo Rodado from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" </F> newscast]    [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper has talked about the  internationalization of the economy. Judging from statements he  made during the campaign, this internationalization will stress  a strong policy to promote exports, and this policy will  undoubtedly be based on a rectification of the policy on  currency exchange. To this effect, working in coordination with  the board of directors of Banco de la Republica will be  necessary.    The new president will appoint two new members of the seven  member monetary board in addition to the finance minister,  totaling three out of seven people. The new president will need  to have the concurrence of at least one additional board member  in order to adopt the necessary currency exchange modifications  to strengthen exports. It will be, therefore, a policy of  opening up to international markets.</p>

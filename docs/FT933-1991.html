			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: QVC takes the stage in battle for Paramount - Last night's increased offer looks set to spark a hostile exchange with Viacom A takeover battle royal broke out last night as QVC Network launched a Dollars 9.5bn stock and cash bid for Paramount Communications, the film and publishing company which agreed nine days ago to be acquired by cable company Viacom for Dollars 8.2bn. The offer from QVC, which is headed by Mr Barry Diller, a leading film industry figure, will be keenly contested by Viacom and Paramount, which issued a statement earlier in the day as rumours of a rival offer mounted, declaring that 'no hostile takeover bid' would be allowed to stop their merger. Nevertheless, shares in Paramount rose sharply again on the New York Stock Exchange, to close at Dollars 69 5/8 , up Dollars 1 1/4 , before QVC's late afternoon announcement. QVC's offer was last night worth Dollars 80 a share. Meanwhile, Mr Ted Turner, head of Turner Broadcasting System, has also been looking at ways of getting involved in a bid for Paramount. Other large media companies, both US and European, are believed to be eyeing up Paramount to see whether they can launch a full bid or at least profit from any post-takeover break-up of the business. Wall Street merger and acquisition specialists are salivating over the first big US hostile takeover bid since American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's Dollars 7bn acquisition of computer company NCR in 1991. It is not difficult to see why there is so much interest. Paramount owns Paramount Pictures, one of few leading Hollywood film studios not yet taken over by a large conglomerate. This makes it an extremely attractive property in a world where media businesses are keen to integrate vertically television and film production, packaging and distribution over cable networks. QVC might at first sight seem an improbable contender. It is relatively small, with 1992-93 turnover of Dollars 1bn, compared with Paramount's Dollars 4bn. However, Wall Street has been expecting great things from QVC since Mr Diller took a large equity stake in it last December and became chief executive. Mr Diller, who played a key role in building Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox group into America's fourth television network, sees a great future in home shopping as the US enters the age of interactive home entertainment. Yesterday's bid shows he is also intent on using the company as a vehicle to build a more broadly-based media empire. He has some very powerful allies. The other leading shareholders in QVC are Comcast, a large cable television service company, and Liberty Media, a cable programme supplier. Liberty was spun off in 1991 from Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable service company in the US, although it retains strong links with TCI. Mr John Malone, the chief executive of TCI is also chairman of Liberty. TCI, unlike chief rival Time Warner, the second largest cable service company in America, does not own a movie studio. Comcast and Liberty yesterday backed the QVC bid by agreeing to inject Dollars 1bn into the company, buying Dollars 500m each of convertible preferred stock. This should give much greater market credibility to the bid by Mr Diller. It has helped him offer Dollars 30 a share in cash as part of his cash and shares offer to Paramount stakeholders, compared with the Dollars 9.10 a share currently on the table in Viacom's bid, which consists mainly of stock. However, a bid by QVC could run into political and anti-trust difficulties, given its links with Mr Malone. TCI accounts for some 20 per cent of an industry whose monopolistic structure makes it far from popular in Washington - particularly since a package of regulatory reforms intended to cut cable rates seems in many cases to have increased them. The Clinton administration has yet to show just where it stands on anti-trust policy, but it has threatened to be tougher than the laisser faire Bush administration. And Mr Al Gore, the vice-president, seems to be no fan of Mr Malone. He is reported to have once called him the 'leader of the cable Cosa Nostra'. If Turner Broadcasting tried to enter the bid battle, that would create even greater complications and potential conflicts of interest. That company's leading shareholders include TCI, as well as Time Warner, whose ownership of Hollywood's Warner Brothers studios would prompt anti-trust questions. These issues apart, a rival bid could face problems over takeover tactics. First, Paramount has put in place a poison pill which allows Viacom to buy 20 per cent of its stock at Dollars 69.14 a share (the initial value of Viacom offer) under 'certain circumstances' - which presumably means a rival offer higher than that. Paramount would also have to pay Viacom Dollars 100m for non-consummation of the deal. However, dissident shareholders are already challenging the stock sale 'lock up' in the courts of Delaware, where Paramount is incorporated. Such poison pills rarely prevent bids going through. Another problem, though a long way down the road, could come from the courts of Delaware. In an important test case in 1989, the courts there allowed the board of Time to accept an offer from Warner Communications, even though it was lower than a rival offer from Paramount, on the grounds that the board deemed it to be in the group's best long-term strategic interests. How ironic, then, that Paramount should attack the idea of a hostile bid by declaring the Viacom deal would create for shareholders 'a global media entity unparallelled in the entertainment world'.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission believes it would be ideal to address beneficiary coinsurance in conjunction with the implementation of a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient services. (See Recommendation 20.) It is not clear, however, when such a system will be in place. Reducing the coinsurance requirement thus should not be delayed until implementation of prospective payment. This change is necessary to reduce the significant burden on Medicare beneficiaries who receive outpatient services in a hospital. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC understands that reducing beneficiary coinsurance will substantially increase Medicare outlays and reduce hospital payments. The Commission therefore recommends phasing in the change in beneficiary liability over a five-year period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Recommendation 23: Limit the Length of Outpatient Observation Stays <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission recommends limiting the length of hospital outpatient observation stays. Further, these changes should be coordinated with Peer Review Organizations so that appropriate short stay admissions are not denied. ProPAC supports HCFA's effort in this regard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Observation services are furnished by a hospital on an outpatient basis and include the use of a bed and periodic monitoring by a hospital's nursing staff. To be reimbursed by Medicare, these services must be reasonable and necessary to evaluate a patient's condition or determine the need for an admission. Medicare requires that the services are ordered by a physician. Observation stays are intended to last fewer than 24 hours, but there are no limits on how long an individual might stay under observation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When Medicare's prospective payment system was implemented, Peer Review Organizations examined short inpatient admissions to prevent hospitals from receiving the full DRG payment for unnecessary stays. Outpatient observation stays, paid on a cost basis, allowed Medicare reimbursement for services to beneficiaries who did not need to be admitted as inpatients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before 1989, Medicare's policy specified that if an observation stay lasted more than 23 hours, the stay would be deemed an inpatient admission. Thus, the hospital would receive the relevant DRG payment, and the stay would be subject to PRO review. This policy was never published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> however, so implementation and administration were inconsistent. After 1989, the limits for observation stays were removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC analysis indicates that even though observation stays are a small proportion of outpatient services, these stays_particularly long ones_are increasing. Because Medicare pays for these services on a cost basis, the growing number of longer observation stays has implications for higher Medicare outlays and beneficiary liability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1991, 2.3 percent of all outpatient bills had observation stay charges, an increase of 77 percent over 1989. The proportion of these bills with stays lasting more than two days increased from 7.1 percent in 1989 to 11.1 percent in 1991. The average change for all observation stays was $3,212 in 1991. The implications for beneficiary liability are substantial because copayments are currently set at 20 percent of charges. Compared with the $628 deductible for a hospital admission in 1991, the beneficiary copayment for an observation stay lasting two or more days averaged $765. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA is planning to limit the length of multiple-day observation stays. The change would require hospitals to admit a patient who has been under observation in an outpatient department for two consecutive midnights. The hospital would receive payment under the appropriate DRG, and the stay would be subject to PRO review. These changes might increase the number of short inpatient stays: HCFA plans to coordinate with the PROs to ensure that appropriate short admissions are not disallowed. The Commission supports all these efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12516 Filed 5&hyph;23&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4120&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

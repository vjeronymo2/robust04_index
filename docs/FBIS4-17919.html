			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 26, BNS -- Prime Minister Mart Laar  today told reporters that recent speculations in the press about  his forthcoming resignation are premature and groundless.    "I don't think it likely that I'll step down from the post  of  prime minister, despite claims to the contrary in the press,"  Laar stated.    Several Estonian politicians maintain that, since the last  vote of no confidence three months ago, the correlation of  forces in the parliament has changed and the parliament may  force Laar to resign.    "When President Lennart Meri congratulated me on my birthday  (April 22; Laar was on a visit to the United States last week),  he said there have been writings about my resignation in the  Estonian press he can't understand," Laar said. "Perhaps  reporters have more information than I myself do."    The premier also voiced the opinion that the press have  reached a stage when they've "run out of subjects to write about  and therefore engage in speculation."    "I know that Tiit Vahi (chairman of the Tallinn City Council  and the Assembly Party, as well as former prime minister)  hankers after the post of premier, he has openly admitted it,"  Laar noted. "It's another thing how many members of the  parliament want to see him fill that post."    The prime minister also said rumors about rifts in the  government are "exaggerated."    "The coalition is doing good teamwork and even defections  are  not likely to rock the boat," Laar declared.</p>

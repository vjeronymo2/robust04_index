			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAST STOP FOR DREAMERS;  </P> <P> MILE ZERO BY THOMAS SANCHEZ (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 334 PP.)  </P> <P> Thomas Sanchez spent his youth in Northern California where he began "Rabbit  Boss," a highly praised first novel chronicling four generations of an Indian  tribe in the California Sierra Nevada. He later explored Chicano history while  living in Southern California, where he discovered the theme for his second  novel, "Zootsuit Murders." After a four year hiatus from writing fiction,  Sanchez went to the Caribbean, where he discovered Key West, an island smaller  than the Miami Airport, lying 90 miles off the coast of Cuba. There, several  events -- the Space Shuttle launchings at nearby Cape Canaveral, a boatload of  Haitians fleeing Baby Doc, and the confiscation of ever-present boatloads of  cocaine -- forged in his mind "a new American metaphor" which became his third  novel, "Mile Zero." Sanchez has called it his "cosmic Cannery Row."  </P> <P> With the novel's panoramic opening of the Space Shuttle hurtling toward new  frontiers, Sanchez places the reader in Key West, where desperate refugees flee  to a dream of sanctuary in America while sleek powerboats race for a  championship cup. Sanchez tells the story of 1960s refugees whose paths cross  in this Caribbean paradise.  </P> <P> St. Cloud, a political activist who worked against the Vietnam War, ironically  guilt-ridden for not participating in the war, lives in a constant alcoholic  haze. He crosses paths with Voltaire, a teen-aged Haitian accused of murder who  is the only survivor of an ill-fated refugee boat. He meets Lila, a secretive  young Southern woman, who was an abused child and now struggles to break the  psychological spell of M. K. (Monkey Killer), a perverted Vietnam veteran and  cocaine smuggler who participates in Central American civil wars. St. Cloud is  hired as an interpreter by Justo Tamarindo, a Cuban American police officer,  who understands Key West's legacy of slavery, the Cuban Revolution, and the  volatile present of the marijuana, cocaine runners, the wretched illegal  immigrants, the leftover drug-fried hippies of a past generation and the  practitioners of Voodoo and Santeria.  </P> <P> St. Cloud and his wife Evelyn represent the human wreckage of the Vietnam  generation, whose lives have been shattered against the materialistic reefs of  consumer America. They are hippies of the '60s who have become the disenchanted  yuppies of the '80s. Evelyn's disappointment with life is based on her past.  Her anti-war commitment drove her to desperate extremes. She repeatedly  sacrificed her body to save the lives of young men of draft age. "Evelyn could  not stop a war, but she could start a man's conscience. Some of the bland-faced  recruits walked away from her bed, away from the airfield, drifted down the  highway, distancing themselves from a killer identity before it was too late,  abandoning their own names and families, slipping into neutral countries, or  disappearing into the cracks of a burgeoning underground."  </P> <P> In Key West, Evelyn and St. Cloud become estranged. "The unshakable guilt of  Vietnam became St. Cloud's mistress, swelling to disproportionate balance  between himself and Evelyn." Evelyn finds herself in another woman and St.  Cloud falls into alcoholism and madly in love with Lila, a girl about 20 years  old, who "was born on the losing side of the American tracks, who leaves her  violent husband to become entangled with the cold- blooded and psychologically  twisted M. K." "St. Cloud did not know if his heart was being tricked by the  fatal attraction of false romantic lights, leading him in desperate pursuit of  his own lost youth." The absent, mysterious and indestructible M. K. is a  character whom Sanchez seems to have added to portray the soldier as a victim  of the Vietnam War. By weaving together these many little narratives about the  people of Key West, Sanchez creates a magnificent tapestry.  </P> <P> Explicitly more powerful than any of Sanchez's disenchanted Euro-Anglo  characters, however, is Justo Tamarindo, whose efforts to solve a bizarre  murder deeply involve him in the rituals of Voodoo and Santeria. As a literary  creation Justo is remarkable, standing far above Sanchez's other characters.  Taking great pride in his identity and heritage, Justo is their opposite in  values and attitude toward life. In Justo Sanchez forges a new race, a new  world vision, for in him Afro-Cuban, Latin American and Euro-Anglo cultures  come together. In tracing Justo's familial roots, Sanchez splendidly narrates  the history of slavery and the contribution of Afro-Cubans in the tobacco and  fishing industries of Key West.  </P> <P> According to Sanchez, Key West has died a thousand deaths, going from the  richest city in America to the poorest. Key West died when the Shipwreck Laws  changed, when the turtles were all slaughtered, and when the lucrative slave  auctions were abolished. Justo's family survived these deaths, always bearing  seeds, to change the status quo. Justo's awareness of past and present history  simultaneously brings these people together and sets them apart.  </P> <P> There cannot be a future without a past: in this knowledge rests the strength  of Justo and St. Cloud. It is the weakness, in contrast, of M. K. and Voltaire,  weakness for they can neither face the past nor the present. They stand on the  "Southernmost point it is called, mile zero. Last hope for star-crossed  creatures dreaming in tropical pastures at the end of the American road. Last  Hope."  </P> <P> Rich in the cultural and literary intertextuality of Steinbeck and Cervantes,  Joyce and Shakespeare, "Mile Zero" is an accomplished novel. Yet Sanchez  falters: He has created truly interesting characters but placed them in a  meandering story. Their stories are individualized rather than united in a  clear and concise plot. In trying to help Voltaire, the mysterious Haitian  refugee, Justo discovers a bizarre murder. While pursuing the crime Justo loses  track of Voltaire. The resolution to Voltaire's situation and the murder reads  contrived. Voltaire is struck down by a car and the crazed murderer  disappointedly turns out to be a deranged residual hippie called Space Cadet;  and Zobop, who took on mythic dimensions, is his stream of conscience. It is  precisely the multiplicity of actions and characters in the last two sections  that weaken and subvert Sanchez's novel.  </P> <P> Despite the convoluted plot, "Mile Zero" remains worthwhile reading. For  beneath its abundant layers of information and symbolism there is disguised a  political meaning. Sanchez might call it a "moral moment" exemplified in Justo  Tamarindo, who, unlike the decadent, bacchanalian and disillusioned Euro-Anglo  characters, represents the hope and future of Key West. Sanchez has declared  that ". . . Without Justo I never would have made it through 'Mile Zero.' Justo  knew everything there was to know about Key West, about Cuba, about men and  women, family and individual honor, spiritualism and the spirit -- he is  probably the most moral man I have met, in or out of a book." The reader is  left with a desire to know more about this extraordinary man.  </P></p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Management: Throw out the old yardsticks - Building societies need a better rating system Conventional wisdom has it that growing competition in the financial services market will force building societies to adopt leaner and flatter management structures. Those that do not will, as a result, have to merge with more successful competitors. However fashionable it may be, this line of argument misses the distinctive management challenges facing building societies. Individual societies may have fat to cut but the sector as a whole is already lean and getting leaner. Many of the new challenges arise from the growing complexity of their activities over the past decade: Their core mortgage and deposit business has been overlaid with much greater product differentiation. They have become significant intermediaries in the sale of life and general insurance, and a number have set up their own insurance operations. Many large societies have diversified into new activities such as credit cards, current accounts, unit trusts, estate agency and property development. A small number have set up operations in continental Europe. The real challenge facing societies' management is the move from a simple two-product business to a complex multi-product group of businesses. Applying a mutual ownership structure to this new environment adds to the complexity. At the heart of this exercise is the need for new ways to assess organisational performance. Many traditional measures now give misleading signals. Rising staffing levels or cost ratios may say more about a society's changing business than about its operational efficiency. This becomes clear if group performance, which includes subsidiary companies, is compared with that of the society alone. Many of the new activities are undertaken through subsidiaries of the society. On this page last year two Northern Irish academics, Charlie Ferguson and Donal McKillop, attached great importance to the finding that between 1989 and 1992 the number of head office and administrative staff of most large societies increased by more than the number of branch staff ('A bureaucratic legacy', November 5 1993). They cited this as evidence of lingering bureaucracy. But their finding begs the question about what has driven the increase. Take the Alliance &amp; Leicester, which shows the largest jump in head-office and administrative staff over the period. According to Ferguson and McKillop, its headcount grew threefold from 1,815 employees in 1989 to 5,990 in 1992. But most of this increase reflects the acquisition of Girobank in July 1990, with its more labour-intensive portfolio of activities. Excluding Girobank and other subsidiaries, Alliance &amp; Leicester's head-office and administrative staff only increased by 200 between 1989 and 1992. The Alliance &amp; Leicester's experience is indicative of the sector as a whole. The value of assets per building society employee grew from Pounds 2.8m in 1989 to Pounds 3.7m in 1992, an increase of a third. Taking the most comprehensive yardstick, societies' management expenses  - which cover staff and other operating costs - fell from a low 1.22 per cent of their assets in 1989 to 1.07 per cent in 1992. If the measures are recalculated to include the assets and staff of subsidiaries, societies' organisational performance looks very different. The value of assets per employee falls from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 2.9m. Management expenses rise from 1.07 to 1.4 per cent of assets. This does not tell us that societies' subsidiaries are more bureaucratic than their core business nor that diversification has been unsuccessful; only that traditional measures of organisational performance have become less reliable. Total assets may be the wrong yardstick to measure the staffing levels and cost structures of a building society whose activities extend beyond mortgage lending.

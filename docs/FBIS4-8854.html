			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 17 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs agreed  Sunday to the deployment of a 336-member international buffer  force in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, UN spokesman Major Dacre  Halloway said Sunday.    He said the agreement was reached earlier between UN special  envoy Yasushi Akashi and Serb authorities meeting in nearby  Pale, stronghold of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.    Under it, the multinational force -- more than half of whose  members are French -- will be allowed to move around freely in  Gorazde and helicopters will be able to fly to, in, and around  the enclave, the spokesman said.    Deployment of the force was one of the conditions Akashi set  earlier for resuming peace negotiations in Pale.    The force, composed of 170 Frenchmen, 66 Ukrainians, 50  Egyptians and 50 British, has been on alert at Sarajevo airport  since Friday, ready to leave within two hours' notice of the  signing of an agreement.    The Ukrainian troops are to take up position on the hills  overlooking Gorazde, to the southeast.    Halloway said the French would leave first for Gorazde,  travelling by road, and would be escorted by Bosnian Serb forces.</p>

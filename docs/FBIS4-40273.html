			<p>BFN     [Text] Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador in Moscow, has said  that the Korean [choson] Government withdrew from the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] because this agency's  Board of Governors had recently adopted a resolution on the  North Korean issue.    During a news conference, Ambassador Son Song-pil stressed  that the IAEA Board of Governors' adoption of the resolution  meant, in reality, the start of sanctions against the DPRK.    Ambassador Son Song-pil also declared that imposing  sanctions  against Pyongyang and convening an international conference on  the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula were in no way  compatible.</p>

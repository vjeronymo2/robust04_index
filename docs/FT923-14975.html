			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Whistling for a cut Having misread the Bank of England's money market signals ahead of the May base rate cut, the City is naturally anxious to avoid the same mistake again. But that may have led it into reading too much into yesterday's money market intervention. The Bank simply does not have the leeway to follow the rate-cutting example established by the US Federal Reserve on Thursday, desirable as that would be in the encircling economic gloom. Sterling is at its lower limit against the Portuguese escudo and less than a pfennig above its theoretical narrow band floor in the ERM. A large part of its weakness yesterday reflected worries about a possible devaluation of the Italian lira rather than expectations of lower UK interest rates. But the currency is now at a level where the government cannot afford to take many risks without undermining the credibility of its narrow band promise, and thus possibly also its large funding programme in the gilts market. A quarter point base rate cut with which the markets were flirting yesterday would leave UK rates level-pegging with those of Germany. There never was much ground for assuming the UK could undercut German rates. There is even less since the Danish referendum called the Maastricht Treaty into question. That uncertainty will continue at least until the French vote this autumn. A small UK rate cut might allow a much-needed widening in bank and building society loan margins, but it would do little for the broader economy. The timing would be particularly hazardous as the Bundesbank's mid-year monetary target review looms in two weeks time. With German money supply growth 3.5 points above the top of its target range, the Bundesbank is fretting about its own credibility. The chances are its council will be more inclined to tighten further than to relax. Europe has little to offer in the way of interest rate cuts at next week's G7 summit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Volkov report under the "Policy" rubric: "Society </F> Will Choose Between Spontaneous Pricing and Administrative  Measures. The Final Decision Rests With the Executive Branch"]    [Text] Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State Duma's  Economic Policy Committee, said yesterday in a press conference  that he expects the government to work out a single program of  anticrisis measures. Differences at the Council of Ministers  are "a common thing," but they should be resolved "within the  government," he said. At the same time, the Duma is in no way  intent on "imposing on the government its approach" to adjusting  economic policy. Parliamentary hearings on the economic  situation and anticrisis measures in Russia, which have been  scheduled for 10 February, will apparently provide the stage for  competition among a number of draft programs.    Mr. Glazyev said that he fully understood Boris Fedorov's  statement that he did not know "nonmonetarist methods of  fighting inflation." "A finance minister does not have other  levers but monetarist ones," he said, "but if Boris Fedorov were  an industry minister," he would have taken into account the need  to pursue structural policy and to provide government support.    Mr. Glazyev said also that the struggle of industrial  sectors' representatives for raising customs tariffs was going  on at the Council of Ministers. In his words, "as a result of  the hyperinflation of the last two years and the artificial  propping up of the ruble exchange rate in the past six months,"  Russian products have become uncompetitive even in the fuel  sector.    According to Mr. Glazyev, "specialists and the industrial  establishment have been particularly dismayed by the excessive  tax burden placed on the current incomes" of enterprises. "A  fairly chaotic tax system impedes the government's actions and  destimulates production," he said. The approach being worked  out by his committee will apparently call for cutting corporate  taxes and increasing rent payments.    Sergey Glazyev is considered an advocate of the state's  active intervention in economic processes in Russia. Among  other things, his committee plans to submit to the State Duma  draft laws on indicative planning, on managing government-owned  enterprises, and so forth, and also to get around to devising  approaches to Russia's pricing problems. Mr. Glazyev believes  that "society has to choose" one alternative: either  spontaneous pricing or an administrative regulation of prices.    In the first case, Sergey Glazyev said, it is necessary to  carry out a regular general indexation, including budget  revenues, expenditures, and the amounts of centralized credits.  But we should take into account that in current conditions the  period of "galloping inflation" may last "fairly long."    If an approach calling for administrative price regulation  gains the upper hand, "prices in various sectors will have to be  temporarily frozen, profitability limits established, and state  subsidies introduced." Administrative methods, however, may  turn out to be ineffective owing to "a lack of administrators in  the conditions of a very loose executive discipline," Mr.  Glazyev said. In any event, despite his own reference to  society, Mr. Glazyev divulged that "the final decision rests  with the government."    This confidence in the current government displayed by a  moderate reformer, an advocate of structural policy and the  reintegration of the economy by setting up financial-industrial  groups, may be easily attributed to the similarity between his  concepts and the ideas of specialists who drew up economic  documents in the "post-Gaydar" government. What is  disconcerting, however, is Mr. Glazyev's remark about a lack of  possibilities for normal administration in Russia. It is  unlikely that he meant lackluster or corrupt bureaucrats. To  all appearances, the issue is the functional unpreparedness of  the Russian administrative system for influencing economic  processes in an efficient and rational way.    This means that monetarist declarations, made in order to  regain the West's confidence, will also remain a "paper dragon"  for the domestic industry, and structural policy will boil down  to sectoral lobbying motivated not by the selection of promising  industries, but by the struggle for survival among managers who  have access to government offices. In Mr. Glazyev's words,  economic activity in Russia comes down and, admittedly, will  continue to come down, to the reallocation of state resources.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner argues that these gains do not appear to relate to the production operations for subject merchandise, and therefore should be excluded from the general and administrative expenses calculation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with the petitioner. During verification, the respondent provided an exhibit that specifically identified the gains that related to the Komatsu plant manufacturing the subject merchandise. (See cost verification exhibit number 29.) No documentation or other support was provided to establish a basis on which to allow an offset for the gains on sales of the other plant assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 10:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aida states that the Department double counted an adjustment it made to the cost variance and general and administrative expenses in applying these adjustments to the CV format for one of the U.S. sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with Aida and have corrected the adjustment to the cost variance and general and administrative expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 11:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aida states, in its case brief, that the Department made certain clerical errors in its calculations, with respect to inland freight, packing, credit and warranty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree, and have adjusted our calculations accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Final Results of Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of our review, the Department has determined that the following margins exist for the period February 1, 1992, through January 31, 1993:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Manufacturer/exporter <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Margin (percent)  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Aida Engineering, Ltd  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 3.50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Komatsu Ltd  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 0.00  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Ind  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 10.00  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hitachi-Zosen Corporation  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 10.00  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> 1No shipments during the period.

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'S MARVELOUS;  </P> <P> THREE SURREALIST ARTISTS PROVIDE A PORTAL TO ANOTHER REALM  </P> <P> Prepare to enter . . . the fourth dimension. Dee do dee do dee do dee. . . .  Too bad newspapers don't have soundtracks. You'll have to imagine the mixture  of mysticism, physics, psychology and social commitment surrounding "Pursuit of  the Marvelous" without benefit of gimmicks.  </P> <P> The show, which opens Friday, investigates the work of three surrealist artists  active in California during the 1940s: Englishmen Stanley William Hayter and  Gordon Onslow Ford, and American Charles Howard, all of whom were active in  surrealist circles in England at the outbreak of World War II.  </P> <P> In San Francisco -- a temporary base for Howard, a summertime hangout for  Hayter and an adopted home for Onslow Ford -- the three artists helped to  invigorate an art scene that was in the process of throwing off its allegiance  to realist painting and beginning a brief love affair with abstraction.  </P> <P> Hayter, who was born in 1901 to a family of artists, studied chemistry and  geology before concentrating wholeheartedly on art. Printmaking was his passion  and challenge. In Paris in the 1920s he founded a print workshop where he  developed several innovative processes. He also became intrigued by the  subconscious investigations of the surrealists.  </P> <P> Fiercely intense in his commitment to a cause, whether it was communism or a  new theory of art, he wanted, as he wrote, to merge "the unconscious element  from which inspiration comes, and extremely rational control of the methods of  execution."  </P> <P> Using clashing, acid-toned colors (considered bizarre at the time),  deliberately ambiguous superimposed images and webs of line as intricate as  diagrams of the human nervous system, Hayter aimed to fuse the concepts of  space and time, creating a sphere extending limitlessly into space that  included both the work of art and the viewer. He expected viewers who entered  the energized fabric of his prints to find themselves peering into their "own  internal reality," as if whisked away by a new form of sci-fi time travel.  </P> <P> Howard was born in 1899 in New Jersey to a family of artists who resettled in  Berkeley when he was an infant. In his early 30s he married British painter  Madge Knight and moved to England, where he stayed until 1940 and would return  after the war.  </P> <P> A buddy of mobile artist Alexander Calder, Howard was also intrigued by making  abstract forms move in space; a critic once called his work "dynamic  architecture." But his mature paintings, begun during his years in London, deal  primarily with the struggle to find formal clarity in the midst of chaos. His  abstract forms, suggestive of biological and organic imagery, are encroached  upon by vast expanses of darkness, reflecting the gulf between dreams of a new  social order and the reality of fearsome totalitarian power.  </P> <P> Ford left England for the artist's life in Paris in 1936, when he was in his  early 20s, and became a member of the official surrealist group. Under his and  Chilean artist Matta's influence, the new wave of surrealists rejected the type  of figurative "dream" imagery associated with Salvador Dali's work in favor of  abstract explorations of the cosmic unknown.  </P> <P> Ford's paintings contained all manner of circles, whorls, floating planes,  lines of force, disembodied shadows and blobby forms -- each floating freely  through space and laying bare, as he claimed, "the secrets contained in the  universe of the human mind."  </P> <P> Quicker access to those secrets occured when the subconscious took over -- when  paint was poured freely on the canvas and the patterns could be scrutinized,  like tea leaves, for their special portents and meanings.  </P> <P> When the war started, surrealism ended as an official movement. But Ford, who  is still painting, went on to experiment with rhythmic patterns of dots -- like  atomic particles -- that aerated the canvas in a visionary way. Art was to be a  way of meditation, a portal leading from ordinary life to the realm of the  marvelous.  </P> <P> What  </P> <P> "Pursuit of the Marvelous: Stanley William Hayter, Charles Howard, Gordon  Onslow Ford," an exhibit of surrealist paintings.  </P> <P> When  </P> <P> Oct. 5 through Jan. 13, 1991.

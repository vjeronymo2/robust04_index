			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Taras Shamba, president of the </F> World Congress of Abkhazian-Abazinian People, by Mariya  Dementyeva; place and not given: "Abkhazia: "Dead Season Over"]    [Text] Shells are no longer bursting on the worn-out land  of Abkhazia today. But no one knows whether peace has set in  for a long time, or whether the war is just taking a short  breathing space. Fighters on both sides of the Ingur are  looking into the future through the slits of gun-sights and may  at any moment come together in a destructive tornado. Where has  happened to compromise? And what is more important -- the right  of a state to territorial integrity, or the right of a people to  self-determination, achieved through the blood of a battle of  ethnic liberation? In a conversation with our correspondent,  Professor Taras Shamba, doctor of juridical sciences and  president of the World Congress of Abkhazian-Abazinian People,  reflects on this. He reflects with partiality, sometimes with  prejudice -- but is it easy to behave otherwise over the new  graves of your fellow countrymen?    Of course, PRAVDA is prepared to give the floor to the other  side too.    [Dementyeva] Taras Mironovich, do you think that the war in  Abkhazia has finished?    [Shamba] For Abkhazia, only the first phase of war has  ended; it has fully rid itself of Georgian military formations.  Admittedly, groupings remain, hiding in the mountains, in  individual population centers, but by and large the active  hostilities have ended. Abkhazian armed formations have stopped  at the Abkhazian-Georgian border along the River Ingur. The  main thing for us today is to prevent a new war from being  unleashed. The point is that the Georgian government troops  which won a victory over ex-president Gamsakhurdia, have gained  full control of Western Georgia and concentrated an enormous  quantity of weapons and manpower on the border with Abkhazia.  In this connection, it must be said that the Russian leadership  and the Ministry of Defense have fully reequipped and re-armed  the Georgian government forces -- they have been given tanks,  armored personnel carriers, helicopters, airplanes, artillery,  and ammunition. This started straight after the liberation of  Sukhum [Abkhazian version opf Sukhumi], when the Abkhazian  formations approached the border with Georgia. It was done with  the aim of giving assistance to Shevardnadze in the fight  against the ex-president, and as a result, a huge military  potential has accumulated in Georgia. Once again people are  starting to look for reasons to unleash aggression against  Abkhazia. Voices can also be heard saying that the main  railroad route must be protected again, and that the return of  the refugees will be attended by the need for the presence of  Georgian troops on the territory of Abkhazia. We do not want to  be dragged into war again, we do not want the Georgian  government forces to be given a pretext for returning.    [Dementyeva] What about the railroad?    [Shamba] In all, 10-12 percent of freight was passing  through the territory of Abkhazia on its way to Georgia and  Armenia. And in the area where the Georgian population is  mainly concentrated -- in Gali, there were six instances of  attacks on trains or blowing up of bridges. All the other cases  (over 70) were on Georgian territory. The Abkhazian Government  has guaranteed, then and now, that freight would travel  unhindered through Abkhazian territory. That is, the problem  does not exist here. The desire to place Georgian government  troops along the entire mainline route, in every area, means  another occupation of Abkhazia. Naturally, the Abkhaz side  cannot agree to this at all.    [Dementyeva] Has any progress been made at the  Georgian-Abkhazian talks?    [Shamba] Peace in the region depends on how the Georgian  politicians behave. It would be wonderful if Shevardnadze and  his entourage had sufficient common sense to sit down at the  negotiating table 11 January 1994 under the aegis of Russia and  the United Nations. These should be held in Moscow or Geneva.  We need to agree on what mutual relations between Abkhazia and  Georgia should be like. Then we could start to restore the  economy, the social sphere, culture, we would be able to create  opportunities for the gradual return of refugees. After all,  Sukhum and Ochamchira have been practically destroyed, and many  villages have been completely obliterated. And difficult  experiences would await those who returned there now -- because  of the blockade by Russia, there is no light, water, bread, or  other foodstuffs. The humanitarian aid which is supposed to  pass through Krasnodar Kray to Abkhazia is also being blocked.    [Dementyeva] So far no one has heard a lucid answer from the  Abkhazian side as to why the Sochi agreement was disrupted?    [Shamba] The point is that the Georgian side used this truce  in order to move up its forces and get new weapons. But, even  though we knew this, we waited. And we trusted them. But the  deadline for the withdrawal of the equipment and the departure  of the troops was violated for the 11th time!    And when Shevardnadze claimed that by the time of the  offensive by the Abkhazians, the Georgians in Sukhum were left  empty handed, this did not correspond with reality, to put it  mildly. Pehapse the only thing lacking there was nuclear  missiles. Now that Sukhum has been liberated it is possible to  familiarize oneself with the type of weapons that Georgia had at  its disposal. They had an enormous quantity of tanks, armored  personnel carriers, "Uragan" and "Grad" systems, howitzers, and  state-of-the-art types of artillery -- 100mm and 120mm guns.  Every cloud has a silver lining -- now the Abkhazian formations  are equipped with state-of-the-art types of equipment which they  managed to capture from the enemy. Plus the ones which the  Georgians stored at dumps and bases in Sukhum and Ochamchira.    The mass media in Russia and abroad have created every  possible condition for the Georgian side to present the facts in  a light that is advantageous to it. For example, the story  about the airplanes brought down in Sukhum. They claimed that  women and children were traveling in them. But who is this  meant to fool? These "women and children" flying into the combat  operations area turned out to be a landing party hurrying to  bring assistance.    [Dementyeva] How would you argue against the accusations of  ethnic cleansing?    [Shamba] I would like to recall that the ethnic cleansing  was started by the Georgians; Georgia for the Georgians was  their idea. And these were official slogans. Karkarashvili,  the commander of the Georgian government troops in Abkhazia,  promised that he would destroy all 97,000 Abkhazians, and he  would not begrudge assigning 100,000 Georgians for this purpose.  And after all, no one has repudiated this policy. Furthermore,  Shevardnadze then appoints Karkarashvili as defense minister and  general. That means that the chauvinistic policy remains.  Would it otherwise really have been possible to arrange mass  annihilations of Armenians, Greeks, Russians, not to mention  Abkhazians? And if it were not for the personal request of the  Russian president, I think that Shevardnadze would already have  been captured and would evidently stand trial.    [Dementyeva] Did the president turn to Ardzinba directly?    [Shamba] No, the deputy foreign minister spoke to the Abkhaz  leadership on his behalf. He asked for the possibility to get  Shevardnadze out of the territory of Abkhazia alive. I will not  hide the fact that the main hopes are pinned on Russia's  peacemaking role. Although it has maintained neutrality  throughout the conflict, and although we have not received the  assistance that Georgia has received, the services rendered by  Russia in establishing peace on Abkhazian soil is enormous.  Boris Nikolayevich Pastukhov really did sincerely try to help  resolve the conflict by political means.    [Dementyeva] But nevertheless, how does Abkhazia plan to  structure its relations with Georgia?    [Shamba] For its own part, Abkhazia has decided that it must  be a sovereign, rule-of-law, democratic state. A subject of  international law which can and should, I believe, establish  relations with Georgia, with Armenia, with Russia, with Turkey,  with Greece, and with other states. At the moment it is hard to  say what the nature of these relations will be, because a great  deal depends on Georgia. And on the leaders who head it today.  Will they realize that Abkhazia is not an appendage, it is not a  province of Georgia, but a sovereign democratic state with which  relations must be constructed on the basis of equal rights?  Then all questions can be resolved. And there are a great many  common problems connected with transportation, the development  of industry, communications, and finances. If Georgia displayed  good will, we could reach agreement and have a good relationship.    [Dementyeva] But you do understand that Abkhazia is a  remarkable land, and Georgia considers it to be its own  territory. It will scarcely let it go...    [Shamba] It is not their problem whether to let it go or  not, because Abkhazia itself, by its own will, has reached  independence and sovereignty, and it now depends on the citizens  of Abkhazia what the republic's status will be. When this  status is determined, the citizens will evidently elect a new  parliament. A draft of a new Abkhazian constitution has now  been proposed. It will be discussed at the Supreme Soviet, and  if it is adopted, then the future will also need to be  determined according to this constitution. And I believe that  when the legislative organs are created, it may prove necessary  to hold a referendum. The people of the Republic of Abkhazia --  Abkhazians, Russians, Armenians, Greeks, Estonians, and  representatives of other nationalities are included here -- will  be able to determine their own fate. Abkhazia has now officially  appealed to Greece, Israel, and Russia for assistance in  returning the refugees who went to those countries during the  war. Representatives of the Greek diaspora in Moscow are  already discussing and counting up the cost of mechanisms for  returning the Greeks home.    [Dementyeva] It has repeatedly been claimed, notably by the  Georgian side, that the rights of representatives of  non-Abkhazian nationality are being violated. I understand that  the land is called Abkhazia, but a lot of different peoples live  in it and they all have the right to resolve the future of this  land together. What do you think about this?    [Shamba] The future of Abkhazia should be resolved by all of  its population. Abkhazia has always been an multi-ethnic  [internatsionalnaya] republic. Even travelers in ancient times  noted that you had to be able to speak 130 languages in  Dioscurias [ancient name of Sukhum]. Sukhum is an international  city, and it should remain that way. Ordinary people are not to  blame for the flaws of the previous policy. After all, we all  remember perfectly well how the population of Abkhazia increased  by 160,000 Georgians in the space of 10 years. Many Georgians,  who were forcibly resettled in our country in accordance with  the "Abkhazpereselenstroy" program, would return to their  homeland, but they were nevertheless sent back to Abkhazia by  force. That is how the forcible assimilation proceeded. Up to  half of the names of population centers were renamed in  Georgian, schools were closed, as was the radio, and everything  that was connected with the Abkhazian language, culture, and  literature was destroyed. But our people have a thousand-year  history...    [Dementyeva] What will be the fate of the Georgian  population? That is evidently the problem. Many Georgians who  fled from Sukhum when Abkhazian troops entered the city, say  that they have found out that their houses have now been  occupied. What will be the mechanism for returning these  Georgians home, and returning their property to them; will they  be able to feel safe in Abkhazia?    [Shamba] Following the liberation of Sukhum, unfortunately  it did not prove possible to take control of the city straight  away and establish firm law and order. Marauders and plunderers  committed outrages. War always means crimes and violence. But  the situation is now changing. Several groups of marauders and  bandits -- international ones, incidentally -- have now been  neutralized. Life is gradually settling down, and it is possible  to return refugees, including Georgians. But of course the  approach to those who want to return will be differentiated.  The horror which the Georgian formations left behind in  Abkhazia will not be forgotten in a hurry. After all, entire  villages were destroyed. But when people of various  nationalities write what was done to them.... In brief, it will  be necessary to establish, for every refugee who wants to  return, what was his personal role in the military conflict.  Whether he fought weapon in hand against the Abkhazian people  and committed evil....    As for the houses and apartments, yes, there really is a  problem here. Many houses are standing empty, some people  returning have found their houses burned down -- where are they  to go? So they temporarily occupy the empty houses. This is  not being done in an uncontrolled way, but with the permission  of the administration, and strict registration is in effect.  When the previous owners return they will definitely have to be  given back their living space, but before then, we must try to  restore the housing stock. Many of those who fought, for  instance Cossacks and North Caucasus people, want to stay in  Abkhazia. They are being authorized to temporarily live in the  houses and apartments which are standing empty, so that later,  when the situation has more or less stabilized, they can be  allocated land and given assistance in housing construction.    [Dementyeva] How many people has Abkhazia lost in this war?    [Shamba] According to foreign information, the Abkhazian  side has lost up to 5,000 people in this war, including around  2,500-2,600 Abkhazians.    [Dementyeva] What will Abkhazia do if the Georgian  Government troops nevertheless cross the Ingur?    [Shamba] I very much hope that there will be no war. But if  it does break out, I believe that the new war will bring Georgia  to a state of collapse. It will end its existence as a state.  After all, the Abkhazian formations could go further than the  Ingur... I think that the Georgian rulers should assess the  situation rather more soberly. They are dealing with not just  Abkhazian people, but the entire Caucasus region. And peace  must finally come to this region.</p>

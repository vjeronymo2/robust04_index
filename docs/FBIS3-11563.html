			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Luis Sexto] </F>   [Text] For almost three months and up to a few days ago,  the country witnessed an uninterrupted discussion. More than  80,000 meetings turned thousands of workplaces into  miniparliaments, with the workers discussing matters that have  been discussed in the past, and are to be discussed again, by  the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]. But  this was not a useless process. It has served essentially to  give Cubans an awareness of the nature of national problems and  of the alternatives for solving them gradually.    In a society ruled by overwhelming consensus, it is  impossible to adopt measures that could in one way or another  affect the economy without first consulting public opinion.    To save time, some might have recommended the use of the  government's prerogatives. In other countries in the world,  levying a tax or raising a price is not discussed with anyone.  It is a quick and unexpected blow. In Cuba, however, the  strength of the Revolution and of its regime lies in the  principle that force must not be used against the people. The  Revolution's strength comes from the people.    And never before has the Revolution so greatly needed the  support of the people and the workers. Because of this  unquestionable fact, everything discussed during the so-called  parliaments in the workplace has to be turned into a platform  for behavior, a guide for action in each workplace throughout  the country.    Work is the lever that will boost our depressed economy. It  is true that work requires material resources; that work  requires a reduction in the flow of currency; and that the  budget deficit must be reduced. These are unavoidable measures.  Above all, however, work demands the conscientious participation  of all workers.    A society that belongs to all of us and is governed by all  of  us requires that we join in the work effort despite the lack of  resources, notwithstanding the lack of incentives and despite  the lack of basic goods. Work is the guarantee that will ensure  that what is lacking today will not be lacking tomorrow. A work  ethic is essential. We are living through difficult times, and  these difficult times demand a work ethic even more urgently.    Until the ANPP decides on the appropriate fiscal measures,  each work center must be a parliament, and the workers must  continue working like members of a parliament, fighting the  bureaucratic mentality that impairs initiatives and gives rise  to passivity, fighting everything that prevents the country from  readjusting its economy through an entrepreneurial system that  promotes efficiency. All this must be done today, and right now.  (endall) 221800 fc/liautaud/lauck/en 22/2251</p>

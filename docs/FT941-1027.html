			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Property: Back under starter's orders - Demand is picking up for properties with an equine emphasis The 1994 flat racing season began on Thursday in a happier horse world than 1993. This is not just the perverse optimism that owners, trainers, jockeys and punters need to survive in a chancy business, nor the success of the recent Cheltenham festival. No, the signs are good. The December Tattersall sales at Newmarket were encouraging as prices for bloodstock beat expectations - if 'from a low base', as George Windsor Clive, of equestrian property specialist Christopher Stephenson International (CSI), remarked - and more horses are in training. Prices for horsey properties have stabilised, too, and breeders are starting to think again of buying stud farms although there is no boom in sight; prices must be reasonable to attract buyers. The Jevington Place stud farm (with 33 loose boxes) in East Sussex is now under offer, soon after CSI brought it back to the market, and will go for a sum well down on the original Pounds 1m minimum asking price. In the south-west, estate agent Millerson reports that demand has picked up for horsey properties. Families look for five to 10 acres to go with their house and two or three loose boxes. Professional riders want indoor (or outdoor) rings and a yard with plenty of stabling. Prices are attractive. In Devon, West Quither Farm near Tavistock (11 acres, four boxes, outdoor school) is on offer at Pounds 159,950; and Mews Cottage Farm near Okehampton (eight acres, eight stables, grazing rights on Okehampton common and riding on Dartmoor) at Pounds 165,000. On Exmoor, Tufters is for sale as a working business for over Pounds 300,000; it sends out out plenty of horses for hire for fox and stag hunting (the agent is named Stags, too). Stud farms have been hard to sell in recent times as the only buyers are other horse people. These must have deep pockets or be able to call on backers - who, often in the horse world, fail to show at the moment of need. Those owners who are making their stud farms around Newmarket 'quietly available' at Pounds 7,000-Pounds 15,000 an acre (through CSI) are probably wise to do so. The serious buyers will find them. In Surrey, a stud on public offer is Grafham Farm near Guildford; it has 16 boxes, an indoor school, and 48 acres of paddocks plus house, cottage, swimming pool and tennis court - all for around Pounds 600,000 from CSI. The owner is selling to move her operations to a larger property. Another that has been on the market for some time is Rookery Park near Nantwich, Cheshire (CSI, offers over Pounds 1m). New on the market is Longfield Stud at Middleton Tyas in Yorkshire (near Scotch Corner, where the A66 separates from the A1), for which Lowther Scott-Harden asks Pounds 310,000. Nearby, overlooking the village green, is West Hall, a handsome Grade II house on offer for more than Pounds 495,000. The vendors of both are the agent's chairman and his wife. Near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, West Stow Stud - in tip-top condition with 18 boxes - is for sale from Bedford for Pounds 535,000. Equestrian centres is the modern, grand name for the places in which horses are trained in the skills of dressage and show jumping. Near Cirencester in the scenic Cotswolds, Crawshaw has 13 loose boxes and a fine outdoor school. The price is down from Pounds 325,000 to Pounds 295,000 (from Butler Sherborn and CSI). In Scotland, John Bradburne is starting an equestrian property agency under his own name on April 6. An amateur rider under National Hunt rules (he rode at Cheltenham last week) and husband of trainer Sue Bradburne, he set up the equestrian side of Edinburgh agent Langley-Taylor in 1991. His new firm is taking that over. One of his first properties is Myothill riding centre at Denny in Stirlingshire, with 24 boxes and eight paddocks for Pounds 225,000. Bradburne also offers to let Easter Kilwhiss Farmhouse near Ladybank, with six boxes, for more than Pounds 600 a month. Arena UK at Grantham, Lincolnshire, is a palace among horse centres with frequent shows and a humming business: a 'good commercial property,' says Windsor Clive. Offers to CSI should be over Pounds 1m. Its French equivalent, Cristal-les-Rangs at Ozoir-la-Ferriere, 15km from Euro Disney and 26km from Paris, is available for FFr19m (Pounds 2.17m). Some financing is available from a French bank. In Yorkshire, Savills is selling Carr Hill House at Upper Cumberworth, near Huddersfield, with 17 boxes for Pounds 325,000. But if all you want is a base for hunting, Haddon Dale in Northamptonshire looks ideal: it is a late-Georgian hunting box close to the Warwickshire and Grafton hunts. It has four boxes and a sanded manege, six bedrooms, and three bathrooms to ease limbs tired from a day with hounds. Price: Pounds 390,000 (from Jackson-Stops in Northampton). If polo is your game, Pendell Polo Stables at Shurlock Row in Berkshire costs Pounds 375,000 from Agnew or Hamptons. And if your goal is to own a saddlery, Savills in Cambridge is selling the Sandon Saddlery Company in two parts (at Sandon, Hertfordshire, for Pounds 350,000 and Holt, Norfolk, for Pounds 250,000). Combined turnover is Pounds 490,000. The company specialises in side saddles and western-type saddles. And what is available for horsey folk who do not want to be too close to the muck and sweat? Across the road from Sandown Park racecourse in Surrey, Octagon is building Pemberton Place, a courtyard development with prices ranging between Pounds 245,000 and Pounds 345,000. At Newmarket, Dencora is finishing The Gallops, 18 apartments where you can wake up to see the horses exercising on the heath from your bedroom window. The agent is Jackson-Stops; prices between Pounds 85,000 and Pounds 138,000. You could, of course, choose the flat in the stable yard clock tower at Chippenham Park outside Newmarket (through Bidwells for around Pounds 79,500). The clock mechanism is in the attic.

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Scottish Widows bond reissued - At a Glance Scottish Widows has made a new issue of its Monthly Income Bond, which was criticised by some advisers when launched last year. As before, the bond consists of an annuity and a personal equity plan. The annuity pays the income - equivalent to a net 9.11 per cent per annum on the total invested - while the Pep is designed to grow to repay the annuity. But there is no guarantee that it will do so - the capital value of the units in the Pep will need to grow at 7.75 per cent per annum for this to be achieved - so this is far from a risk-free investment. It is good to see that Scottish Widows' brochure makes this very clear.</p>

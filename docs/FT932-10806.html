			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Argentine pension approval ARGENTINA'S Congress has taken an important step towards approving controversial government proposals to introduce a private pension fund system. The lower house of Congress approved a substantially altered version of a government bill, introduced last August. This now goes to the senate, where the government has a majority. It is not expected to undergo further fundamental modifications. The government says a privately managed pension fund system is needed to develop Argentina's capital markets and provide industry with long-term finance. It would also remove a heavy financial liability from the government, which is running a social security system riddled by deficit.</p>

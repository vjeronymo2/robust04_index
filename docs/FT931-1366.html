			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Keating reshuffle a 'generational change' MR PAUL KEATING, the Australian prime minister, yesterday promoted six backbenchers to the cabinet in a reshuffle designed to keep the Labor party in government for the rest of the decade. Mr Keating also moved several senior public servants and restructured a number of departments in an attempt to distance the government from the nine-year administration of Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister. He said the reshuffle represented a 'generational change' which would renew Labor's capacity to govern and prepare the party for the next election, due by mid-1996. In an unexpected move, Mr Keating took personal responsibility for Aboriginal affairs at cabinet level, one of several non-economic portfolios he has identified as priorities following Labor's election victory last week. The decision suggests that the government plans to accelerate attempts to achieve reconciliation with Aborigines and to negotiate a compromise on controversial land rights claims. The other big surprise was the appointment of Senator Peter Cook, the former industrial relations minister, as trade minister within the cabinet. Mr John Kerin, the sacked former trade minister, was not a member of the cabinet. Senator Gareth Evans remains foreign minister, with the added post of government leader in the Senate. The economic ministries are unchanged. Mr John Dawkins stays on as treasurer and Mr Ralph Willis remains as finance minister. In other moves, Mr Keating doubled cabinet representation of the health and housing department, and created separate ministries for Pacific Island affairs, schools and training, and regional affairs (within Australia). He also streamlined the cabinet committee system, drawing criticism from environmental groups angry about the abolition of the sustainable development committee, which co-ordinated big development projects. In the public service, Mr Ted Evans, Australia's chief representative at the International Monetary Fund, becomes head of the Treasury, replacing Mr Tony Cole, who is thought to have clashed with Mr Dawkins. Mr Cole and four other department heads will move to other departments or to overseas posts. The most senior of the new members of the cabinet is Senator Graham Richardson, a long-serving former minister who resigned last year after allegations about his relationship with a businessman facing fraud charges. The other new cabinet members are Mr Alan Griffiths, industry; Senator Bob McMullan, arts; Mr Laurie Brereton, industrial relations; Mr Michael Lee, tourism and resources; Mr Peter Baldwin, social security; Mr Duncan Kerr, justice; and Mr Michael Lavarch, attorney-general. Mr Baldwin and Mr Griffiths were formerly junior ministers.</p>

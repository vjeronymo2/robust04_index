			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Suely Caldas] </F>   [Text] The upcoming elections and the possibility that  Workers Party presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva  may win them have made the government fall back from its initial  idea to allow the free conversion of reals for dollars, using  its $37 billion exchange reserves for this. The idea was, like  in the case of Argentina, to allow the freedom to exchange one  real for $1 as of 1 July. This would give credibility to the new  currency given that the government would guarantee the exchange  with its reserves. That was the idea conceived by the economic  team last September when it began preparing the Real Plan, an  idea that prevailed until a few months ago.    Now, during the first months of the year, the elections have  turned up as a real factor in the political scene, as well as  all the variables and alternatives that could take place in case  the government insisted on its idea of free conversion. Thus,  the economic team began to think about the measure's  consequences and then retracted it. The greatest difficulty was  the certainty that the elections would interrupt the economic  plan's continuity and a new administration might change its  guidelines or simply revoke the plan, as indicated during the  election campaign.    Lula's growing popularity has reinforced the economic team's  decision to retreat from its initial idea. During his campaign,  Lula will certainly try to mark a difference with Fernando  Henrique Cardoso in the field in which the Brazilian Social  Democracy Party candidate has the greatest advantage -- the  economic plan -- by creating an atmosphere of uncertainty  regarding its future. What is more, the most important aspect is  that the economic agents believe that Lula may somehow freeze  the domestic debt, a fear that will be reinforced if, in keeping  with its prevailing trend, the PT's campaign propaganda is to  promise to take action against the fast and profitable  enrichment of banks in the past few years. If the government  decided to allow free conversion of reals for dollars, it would  seriously run the risk of seeing its exchange reserves diminish  quickly as people rushed for dollars in order to avoid having  their financial assets frozen [confisco]. The consequence of  such an action would be an exchange crisis worse than that which  took place at the end of the Cruzado Plan when Brazil had to  declare a moratorium on its debt.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Bush slated for stalling on global warming deal THE Bush administration has come under attack for stonewalling efforts to win a worldwide agreement on global warming at the Earth Summit due to take place in Rio de Janeiro in June. Senator Albert Gore, one of the leading spokesmen for the opposition Democrats on environmental issues, said the administration had rejected a policy of stabilising carbon dioxide emissions - one of the factors thought to contribute to global warming - at 1990 levels. 'Our position is now different from the rest of the world. There are 139 countries on one side. There is one country, led by the Bush administration, on the other side,' Mr Gore said, citing a document faxed to him by someone within the administration. Mr Gore also attacked President George Bush for not attending the summit. Mr Bush's stance on environmental issues was fiercely criticised in a debate on Sunday between the five major candidates for the Democratic party's presidential nomination. One of the Democrat candidates, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, said: 'Every one of us believes that the president of the US should go to the Rio conference and say: 'The US has been lagging on agreeing to global standards on global warming and we are going to agree right now with the Europeans on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, increasing fuel efficiency standards and whatever we have to do to meet a common standard.'' Mr William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the US wanted to sign a treaty in Rio, but cautioned that the scientific evidence on global warming was not conclusive. 'We certainly will be prepared to deal on the issue of global warming. The US very much wants to see a framework convention,' Mr Reilly said.</p>

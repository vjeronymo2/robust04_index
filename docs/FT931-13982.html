			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK electricity The outperformance of National Power and PowerGen this year suggests a market belief that British Coal pits can be saved without a sacrifice from the generators. Whether any subsidy for British Coal is funded from the nuclear levy or a new surcharge on electricity bills, shareholders will not bear the cost. The details have to be hammered out in Brussels. But it is hard to imagine the Eurocrats scuppering the scheme. A bigger risk is that the government's enthusiasm also leads to measures which the electricity regulator finds irksome. A ban on gas-fired power projects, for example, might disappoint National Power and PowerGen. Both have plans for gas-fired plant. By restricting competition in generation, though, the government would entrench the coal-burning duopoly. Even if Professor Littlechild swallowed such political interference, the chances of a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission would increase. While the Treasury is itching to sell its remaining 40 per cent stake in the generators, that might seem a distant threat. Equally, five-year deals with British Coal and the regional electricity companies should underpin earnings growth. But with the shape of government energy policy still unclear, there is plenty of room for disappointment.</p>

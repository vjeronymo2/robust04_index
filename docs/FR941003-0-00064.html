			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 106. One comment asked FDA to interpret the phrase ``conditions of approval'' in proposed &sect;314.108(b)(4)(iv) narrowly to limit exclusivity to studies conducted by the original applicant. Proposed &sect;314.108(b)(4) stated that if an application: (i) Was submitted under section 505(b) of the act; (ii) was approved after September 24, 1984; (iii) was for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved in another application under section 505(b) of the act; and (iv) contained reports of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by the applicant that were essential to approval of the application, the agency will not make effective for a period of 3 years after the date of approval of the application the approval of a 505(b)(2) application, or an ANDA for the conditions of approval of the original application, or an ANDA submitted pursuant to an approved petition under section 505(j)(2)(C) of the act that relies on the information supporting the conditions of approval of an original NDA. The comment said subsequent applicants who conduct their own studies to obtain approval should not be subject to the original applicant's exclusivity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA believes that the comment misinterprets the scope of exclusivity. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule and the preamble to this final rule, market exclusivity does not provide any protection from the marketing of a generic version of the same drug product if the generic version is the subject of a full NDA submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the act (see 54 FR 28872 at 28896). As discussed earlier, the statute does not require that the original applicant ``conduct'' the study to obtain exclusivity. FDA interprets the act to allow for exclusivity where the applicant has supported the study by providing more than 50 percent of the funding or by purchasing exclusive rights to the study.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Analysis of Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA has examined the impacts of this rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact on small entities. Title I of Pub. L. 98&hyph;417 eliminated unnecessary regulatory barriers for generic drug products and has resulted in generic competition on many important post-1962 drugs. Generic drug sales account for a significant portion of total prescription drug sales, and many of these sales would not have occurred in the absence of Pub. L. 98&hyph;417. This competition has saved consumers hundreds of millions of dollars per year, and FDA concludes that this impact is directly attributable to the statute. This rule will not affect the pace or magnitude of this economic impact. The rule simply clarifies and facilitates implementation of the act. Thus, FDA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule contains information collections which have been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The title, description, and respondent description of the information collection are shown below with an estimate of the annual reporting and recordkeeping burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Title:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Abbreviated New Drug Application Regulations; Patent and Exclusivity Provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information requirements collect information from persons who must obtain FDA approval before marketing new human drug products or generic versions of previously approved drug products. These persons must submit information to FDA in the form of applications, notices, and certifications. FDA will use this information to determine whether patent information for a drug product has been submitted and whether an applicant is seeking market exclusivity for a particular drug product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

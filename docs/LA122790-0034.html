			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS GLITTER, GLAMOUR DO BRUNCH  </P> <P> "Salmon eggs Benedict or traditional eggs Benedict?"  </P> <P> That was about as tough as the questions got for guests who attended the Red  Cross brunch staged at 21 Oceanfront (formerly the Rex) in Newport Beach on  Sunday.  </P> <P> Waiters and waitresses hovered near brunch-goers such as Red Cross Board  Chairman Donald Karcher and his wife, Dolly, making sure that their eggs were  hot, their orange juice chilled and their champagne flutes filled to the brim.  Restaurant booths were crammed with folks sporting holiday finery. (No doubt  about it, this is society's favorite spot to unwind before the Big Day.)  </P> <P> Overseeing the seventh annual event -- where the food and service are donated  -- was restaurateur Rex Chandler and his wife, Susan. "We're ecstatic today,"  said Chandler, whose new Rex restaurant in Fashion Island has become the place  to dine in Newport Beach. "The weather is beautiful and the reservation list is  long."  </P> <P> As guests enjoyed a first course of fresh fruit and croissants "Santa's little  helpers" (little girls smartly dressed for Christmas) sold Red Cross sweat  shirts, enabling brunch proceeds to hit the $50,000 mark.  </P> <P> Besides helping the needy, the local chapter of the Red Cross is the primary  source for emergency communication between military personnel and their  families, said chapter director George Chitty.  </P> <P> Last year, the local chapter provided 28,398 meals for needy families.  </P> <P> Speaking of the Rex: The new Rex at Fashion Island was the site of the recent  Christmas luncheon staged by the Sophisticates, a support group of the  Assessment and Treatment Services Center (ATSC). What made this get-together  super-hot was that it launched lunch at the Rex, giving the in-crowd yet  another chic, daytime place to be seen.  </P> <P> Among items on the menu are Thai chicken salad; a lobster sandwich (hint: order  this biggie to split with a buddy) and a French dip sandwich (for  sandwich-classic lovers, says owner Rex Chandler).  </P> <P> ATSC -- whose motto is "arrest the problem, not the child" -- provides troubled  juveniles with professional counseling. After an initial assessment, a specific  treatment is designed to help keep the juvenile out of the criminal justice  system. Also on the Rex calendar is a luncheon-auction for ATSC on Jan. 19  marking the opening of the new Lahaina Gallery at Fashion Island. Lahaina  artist Gary Swanson plans to attend.  </P> <P> Mark your calendar: The Orange County Juvenile Correction Program will be the  beneficiary of a Super Bowl party Jan. 27 at the Santa Ana Heights mansion of  Donna and John Crean. Celebrity guests are on the agenda, and hamburgers and  hot dogs will be served. Tickets are $150 per person with proceeds expected to  reach $50,000. They're calling the spot where the event will be held (John  Crean's workshop) the "Creandome." What else?  </P></p>

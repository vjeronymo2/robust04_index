			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Travel: FT Round the World Ski Expedition Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994. They have reached the US mid-west. Arnie writes If we were sailing instead of skiing, this would be the doldrums. We are not becalmed but snow in the Chicago area is hard to come by in spite of the cold spell. And vertical feet are never a strong point in the mid-west. After the dizzy heights of Colorado, we have entered the twilight zone of US skiing. We have to reach New York and we chose a route that avoided the better-known resorts in eastern Canada and instead drove across the plains of the mid-west. Resorts here are so small that you imagine you have seen one from the road and it turns out to be a white barn roof. Imagine the dry ski slopes in Britain with man-made snow on them and you have some idea of the relative size. Villa Olivier, for all its exotic connotations, is nothing more than a garbage heap cleverly converted into a small ski hill. Do not knock it. What better use could there be for a load of Chicago refuse? Plenty of Chicago children have learnt to ski there. Ditto Four Lakes Village, with a vertical drop of 100ft and rope tows, the early uphill transport. Alpine Valley, 388ft, did not exactly tower above the local countryside but it is high enough to have caused the death of Stevie Ray Vaughan, the blues guitarist, when his light aircraft crashed in fog. Nobody had told the pilot there was a man-made hill in the vicinity. Lucy and I had to climb the hill in order to ski that day since the lifts were closed following heavy overnight rain. We decided to give another minnow, Wilmot Mountain, 240ft, a miss when we heard that the owner was reluctant to give us a free ride up to the top of his hill. As we head south to Kentucky and Alabama things can only improve. Or can they?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Vienna-based correspondent Cha Man-sun] </F>   [Text] With the approaching deadline for submitting a  report on the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security  Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] again  notified North Korea, as it did previously, that it will send an  inspection team as soon as North Korea allows the sampling of  spent fuel when nuclear fuel is replaced.    In a message sent to North Korea early this morning, the  IAEA  reminded North Korea that the deadline for submitting a report  to the UN Security Council is approaching, and stated that even  though the inspection on the replacement of fuel rods has been  delayed considerably, it will send an inspection team around  this weekend if North Korea accepts the IAEA proposal by this  week.    The IAEA expects North Korea to show a positive response  this  week or early next week depending on the result of the recent  contacts with the United States. However, in case North Korea  shows a negative response, including the replacement of nuclear  fuel on its own, the IAEA's position is that a report to the UN  Security Council will be inevitable.</p>

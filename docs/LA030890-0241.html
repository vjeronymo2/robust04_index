			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> NADIA, PANAIT SPLIT, FRIENDS SAY  </P> <P> Nadia Comaneci's agent says she may have broken up with Constantin Panait, the  married man who engineered her escape from Romania.  </P> <P> The Olympic gymnast canceled her first U.S. appearance on the lecture circuit,  apparently because she was upset over the breakup, said her agent, Bob Davis.  </P> <P> She was to have given a speech Wednesday night at Nassau Community College.  </P> <P> Davis said he has not spoken to Comaneci since she left for Tokyo more than a  week ago with Panait, a roofer with a wife and four children in Florida. But  people in Comaneci's entourage say the two broke up en route back from Japan,  Davis said.  </P> <P> Comaneci is staying with friends in Montreal, Davis said, where she won the  first perfect 10s in Olympic gymnastics history in 1976. Panait is on the road.  </P> <P> Comaneci said in a recent magazine interview that she and Panait had no plans  to marry. She said last month that she intends to marry a 30-year-old fellow  Romanian who is expected to enter the United States later this year.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Gianluca Luzi report: "2000 Attend Christening of </F> `Demo-Centrists'"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- [passage omitted] The Democratic  Christian Center [CCD] was established at Rome's exhibition  center yesterday morning. It comprises the former Christian  Democrats who did not join Mino Martinazzoli's People's Party  and who will seek an alliance with the League and Berlusconi to  contest the elections. With [National Alliance Secretary] Fini,  too? Maybe. In the South, very probably.    Only 24 hours and a few kilometers separated the birth of  the  People's Party from that of the CCD, but the differences are  very sharp.    "Who are these people?" Casini asked delightedly, surrounded  by his fans. "They are Christian Democratic supporters," he  replied triumphantly. "I am very optimistic because, though it  is true that Martinazzoli and Bindi have been followed by the  sector of the Catholic world that looks to the left, we still  have all the rest." Including those who voted for the right in  the local elections. Those who voted for Fini in Rome and whom  the center wants to claim, under the new symbol of the sail with  a tricolor band and the crossed shield. It is there on the  CCD's new symbol, too but, perhaps to avoid legal problems with  the People's Party, it lacks the word, "libertas," it is blue,  and the cross is white.    "Never with the PDS" [Democratic Party of the Left],  Ombretta  Fumagalli proclaimed, and the audience rewarded her with lengthy  applause. "This," Andreotti's former heir apparent in Milan  went on, "both before and after the elections; and we say `no'  to any kind of institutional government, because that would mean  a government with Occhetto." Rosy Bindi is their bete noire.  "In the past six months," Casini said, "in the DC [Christian  Democratic Party] there has been not only a necessary cleansing  operation and change of leadership. There has also been an  outright genetic mutation of our identity. The party was  entrusted to a limited sector of Catholic associationism that  has always had a distorted perception of the left." Alberto  Alessi, one of the 23 former DC deputies who opted for the  Center, expressed this concept crudely: "Bindi stands with  respect to the People's Party as Lorena Bobbit does with respect  to her husband." And there is nobody now who does not know what  Lorena Bobbit did to her husband.    The left-wing cartel is the enemy to be defeated in the  elections, but the real adversary is Martinazzoli -- "Bindi's  hostage." It is the People's Party leader's strategy that is  criticized, of course: "Isolation is not neutral now; it  contributes to the victory of the left. Isolation is an option  that leads toward [PDS Secretary] Occhetto." The CCD, however,  presents itself as "something new on Italy's political scene:  There is no other national force," Francesco D'Onofrio said,  "that is liberal-democratic, federalist, and presidentialist.  This permits us to pursue a strategy of alliances for the  Second Republic."    Yesterday the Democratic Christian Center began this  venture.  Mastella promised a battle: "Many friends in the People's Party  have been telling me recently: Let us not harm each other in  the elections; let us seek a technical agreement. But we reject  any such possibility. We will field candidates wherever  possible, including in the North with the League and Rooting for  Italy." What about with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] in  the South? "We shall see. Their political stance is evolving."  A real war, then. And soon a war will be waged over the  inheritance. "We are paying for everything out of our own  pockets, including the rent on this room," Casini pointed out.  Carlo Giovanardi, a deputy, warned: "I am not moving out of my  DC office in Modena. Just like them."</p>

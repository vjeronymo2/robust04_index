			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Puerto Rican referendum on US link pivots on economy CAMPAIGNING is intensifying in Puerto Rico ahead of a referendum called for mid-November to determine the future political status of the Caribbean island, currently a US possession. Puerto Rican leaders say the vote is intended to end several years of debate over whether the island of 3m people should retain its 'commonwealth' link with the US, become a state of the union, or move to political independence. Announcement of the referendum date by Dr Pedro Rossello, the island's governor, has intensified campaigning by the three main political parties, which are focusing on the likely impact on the island's economy. It is not clear, however, how US legislators in Washington, who will have the last say on Puerto Rico's future, will treat the referendum result. A decision by the US Congress will be affected by considerations such as Puerto Rico's geopolitical and strategic value; the island has a large US naval base. Puerto Rico is officially described as having a 'freely associated' relationship with the US. Puerto Ricans are US citizens but cannot vote for a president. The island's representation in Washington is limited to a commissioner who has no vote to influence legislation. The incumbent New Progressive party advocates a change in the status, with Puerto Rico becoming a state of the union, while the opposition Popular Democratic party is arguing for a retention of the current relationship with the mainland. By all indications these are the options most Puerto Ricans will consider. There is little support for political independence, as indicated by the Independence party's poor showing in elections. Votes will be influenced less by political considerations than by the public's conclusions as to which political status offers the best deal for the economy. The current commonwealth status has allowed the island a significant economic advantage under Section 936 of the US Revenue Code, which encourages mainland companies with subsidiaries in Puerto Rico to deposit their profits in local banks. These deposits, totalling about Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10bn), have assisted economic growth and stability. The economy also benefits from federal welfare funds of about Dollars 4bn a year and receives hundreds of millions of dollars from rebates of federal excise taxes and duties collected on exports such as rum. Advocates of the status quo argue that Section 936 - the future of which is being debated by legislators in Washington - will be incompatible with statehood, and that as a state Puerto Rico would lose an incentive which has been the pillar of the island's rapid industrialisation. They also argue that statehood would lead the federal government, with its concerns over the deficit, to spend more through welfare payments. Mr Baltasar Corrado del Rio, Puerto Rico's secretary of state, agrees with opposition claims that, as a state, Puerto Rico would be the poorest of the union. He argues, however, that if the plebiscite supports statehood, the US Congress would be asked to 'grandfather' Section 936 for between five and 10 years after the change, and then for the island to be declared an enterprise zone with special tax incentives. The vote is expected to be close, particularly if Puerto Ricans stick to party political allegiances. In last November's gubernatorial elections the NPP took office with 50 per cent of the vote, with 46 per cent going to the PDP and 4 per cent to the Independence party. Political leaders say, however, that they expect voters to cross party lines in considering political status. In the final reckoning the vote will have to be strong enough to convince legislators in Washington that they should act on the result. Mr Corrado del Rio believes that, since it is a three-way contest, the winner should be accepted as the party which gets the most votes. Not every one is convinced of this. 'The result will not be binding on Congress,' explained one Puerto Rican analyst. 'Clearly, in such an important issue few congressmen will be moved by a result which shows 51 per cent support for statehood, particularly if there is a moderate turnout of voters. And since there are three contesting tendencies, the chances are that the winner could get less than 50 per cent of the vote. Washington would not take seriously such a result.'</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Storehouse reshuffles senior management MR DAVID Dworkin, chief executive designate of Storehouse, has wasted little time in making his influence felt at the retailing conglomerate, which includes BhS, Mothercare and Habitat. Yesterday, the company announced a reshuffling of its senior management which will lead to the departure of Mr Michael Harvey as chairman and chief executive of Habitat and the promotion of two BhS directors who worked closely with Mr Dworkin in turning round the clothing and houseware company. Ms Ann Iverson, BhS's American stores director, who previously worked with Mr Dworkin at Bonwit Teller, the US fashion chain, has been appointed chief operating officer at Mothercare, the childrenswear chain which has failed to exploit its strong market position. Mr Steve Bedford, human resources director at BhS, will also assume the post of group development director responsible for integrating managerial and operational functions across Storehouse's subsidiary companies. Storehouse said the management at Habitat had been substantially reorganised over the past few weeks with greater responsibility being devolved to three operating companies. Habitat's central management had been reduced - leading to the departure of Mr Harvey - and the directors of the three operating companies will now report to Mr David Simons, Storehouse finance director, who will take on additional responsibilities as Habitat's chairman. Mr Harvey was on a three-year contract and will receive redundancy pay for loss of office. Mr Dworkin will succeed Mr Michael Julien as Storehouse chief executive in July. See Lex</p>

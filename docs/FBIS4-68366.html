			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Bespalov (Rostov Oblast): "Taganrog Will </F> Be Russia's Main Maritime Portal to the South"]    [Text] Contrary to the forecasts of many skeptics and  in spite of the absence of a legislative base and other  difficulties, the city of Taganrog is methodically and  persistently laying the foundation for a free economic zone.    The idea was conceived and took shape two or three years  ago.  Its main advocate, Mayor Sergey Shilo, and his associates insist  that Taganrog's geopolitical position is certain to give it new  roles to play. The former southern ports of the  USSR--Ilyichevsk, Odessa, Nikolayev, Sevastopol, and Kerch--are  now part of Ukraine, and Russia's remaining ports of Tuapse and  Novorossiysk are overloaded beyond measure.    Officials in Taganrog studied the experience of existing  free  economic zones in different countries--from the United States to  China. An English firm ordered an investigation of the  possibility of establishing a free economic zone in Taganrog. A  year later the idea had taken the form of a package of solid  proposals and projects. The concept of a free economic zone in  Taganrog won the approval of the higher economic council of the  Russian Supreme Soviet Presidium. It appeared that it would also  acquire legal status at any time.    Regrettably, that time never came. There is still no law on  free economic zones, and the zone's promoters in Taganrog do not  have enough influence to "score" the status of a free economic  zone by means of a presidential edict. Furthermore, they are not  that eager to start any intrigues or to rely only on one  top-level signature.    "In the final analysis," Sergey Shilo said, "the free  economic zone is not our final goal, but only the direction we  have to take for the maximum use of all of Taganrog's advantages  and potential for the good of its inhabitants and all of Russia."    That is why Taganrog officials decided to begin laying the  foundation for the future zone piece by piece.    Are there any signs of the imposing future changes today?  Fifteen ships from distant foreign lands are being unloaded in  the port at this time. Just recently, however, Taganrog was  chock-full of defense enterprises and was off limits to  foreigners. Two military runways have been converted for  civilian use. Soon regular flights to St. Petersburg, Bulgaria,  and Turkey will be added to the Moscow run. These were the first  steps that were taken by the joint-stock company that hopes to  build an international airport in Taganrog. The construction of  a new business center has begun in the old part of the city.  There will be at least five such centers, with hotels,  restaurants, convention halls, banking establishments, and  everything necessary for business contacts and the work of  businessmen, in the Taganrog free economic zone.    And what about the new port? This key element of the plans  for the free economic zone has aroused the interest of many  local enterprises and firms. It is not surprising that several  competing groups have come up with completely different project  plans.    They say that competition generates progress, but I am  afraid  that the competition between different groups over the port will  hold up the project. In any case, the exact location of the new  port (or system of ports, according to one plan) is still  unknown. Furthermore, investments are also lacking. After all,  the English firm which was given a chance to design and build  the new port in Taganrog estimates that it will cost around 4  billion dollars and take at least eight years. Obviously,  investors need complete certainty and confidence before they can  consider investing such large amounts for such a long period of  time.    And will these investors even materialize, in view of the  fact that the status of a free economic zone for Taganrog is  still indefinite? Mikhail Ionov, the chairman of the municipal  administration's committee for the development of long-range  planning and foreign economic contacts, promises that they will.  Major Russian exporters have expressed an interest in the city,  and so have the states of the Transcaucasus and Central Asia,  which see the Taganrog transport hub as a means of access to  Europe and to large Western firms. Of course, the legal status  of a free economic zone would do much to accelerate the  attraction of big capital to Taganrog.    Everyone in Taganrog has heard about the free economic zone  and, predictably, few understand the implications of the  attainment of this goal for the city and its population.  Nevertheless, the skeptical wisecracks about the project are  giving way to sincere interest. In any case, provincial Taganrog  has never been as close to realizing the dream of its founder,  Peter I, who wanted it to be Russia's main maritime portal to  the south.</p>

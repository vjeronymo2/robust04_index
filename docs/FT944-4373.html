			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Price/Costco plans withdrawal from joint venture in Mexico Price/Costco, the US discount retailer that last year took its first step into the UK, has decided to pull out of Mexico by selling its 10 membership warehouses there to its joint venture partner. The move is a setback for the company because its scope for further expansion is limited in its saturated domestic market. It also highlights the difficulties retailers face in attempts to spread outside the US. Price/Costco's shares, quoted on the Nasdaq screen-based market, closed Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 14 1/4 yesterday. According to news agency reports, Price/Costco has entered a non-binding expression of intent to sell its Mexican operations to Controladora Comercial Mexicana for Dollars 95m. Price/Costco had no one available for comment yesterday. Three years ago, Price/Costco became the first US discount retailer to enter Mexico when it set up Price Club de Mexico with Controladora Comercial Mexicana. It has invested Dollars 71m in the venture. According to a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Mexican stores are profitable, but sales at stores open a year or more have been declining for the past three months. The prospectus cites growing competition, a slowdown in the Mexican economy, and dilution of sales at existing outlets as the venture opens new stores. Saturation of the US retail market has led an increasing number of US retailers to look outside their domestic market for growth. With last year's signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico and Canada have become two popular areas for expansion. Recently, however, there have been signs that the number of store openings in Mexico is far exceeding the rate of growth in the population's spending power. US retailers have also had to contend with unfamiliar distribution systems, and have sometimes struggled to provide the goods that Mexicans want at prices they are prepared to pay. Price/Costco's difficulties have been exacerbated by the arrival in Mexico of Wal-Mart Stores and Kmart. Both companies have set up joint ventures there, and although Kmart's presence is still small, Wal-Mart had 52 stores as of October 31.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Aer Lingus workforce poised to take 5% equity stake THE IPounds 50m (Pounds 47.2m) cost-cutting rescue plan for Aer Lingus, Ireland's state airline, appeared to have passed one of its final hurdles last night, after the Irish government agreed terms with unions for the workforce to be given a 5 per cent equity stake in the company in return for a two-year pay freeze. In addition, a sum equivalent to a 5 per cent stake will be paid in cash to the employees if the airline returns to profitability. 'Workers have achieved a major breakthrough . . . and secured a strategic stake in Aer Lingus. This is also a first in European national airlines. Aer Lingus workers will immediately become real shareholders in the company and be able to influence its strategic direction,' Mr Paul O'Sullivan, the main union negotiator, said. Earlier this month, SIPTU, the trade union representing the majority of the airline's 5,500 workforce, accepted payroll cuts amounting to IPounds 21m and 'radical' changes in work practices, involving 800 voluntary redundancies. Agreement had not been reached, however, on pay awards for the coming two years, and it was decided to refer this matter to arbitration. A tribunal ruled last week that there should be a pay freeze for two years, but which would be softened by an IPounds 2m fund to be distributed to the workforce in 1995 on condition that payroll cost-cutting targets are met. SIPTU was unhappy with the ruling and decided to suspend a ballot of its members on acceptance of the overall rescue package until the government improved an offer to give a 5 per cent equity stake in the airline to the workforce. SIPTU had earlier demanded 15 per cent; one of its officials pointed out: 'This is far less than the 45 per cent stake that has been given to the workforce in some US airlines'. The negotiations with the government were handled by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which views the outcome of the negotiations as creating a yardstick for rationalisations and pay awards in other state enterprises, such as Telecom Eireann, which are being groomed for eventual privatisation. The first IPounds 75m tranche of a IPounds 175m equity injection by the government is due to be made in December, but is conditional both on acceptance of the rescue package by the workforce, and approval by the European Commission. The injection is required to fund restructuring of the airline and the voluntary redundancies, some of which are already taking place. The airline's rivals on the intensely competitive Dublin-London route are opposed to any of the equity injection being used to set up a new low-cost, no-frills service on the route, and are lobbying intensely in Brussels to block the plan.</p>

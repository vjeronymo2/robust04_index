			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Leaked letter upset for ANC A leaked letter of intent sent by the South African government to the International Monetary Fund last year threatens to embarrass the African National Congress. The ANC put its name to a document committing a new government to fiscal and monetary discipline as a precondition for securing a five-year Dollars 850m (Pounds 574m) loan for drought relief. Mr Alec Erwin, a leading ANC parliamentary candidate, this week argued against rigid deficit ceilings, in favour of greater flexibility. But Mr Tito Mboweni, the ANC's representative on the Transitional Executive Council's finance committee, said it regarded the IMF letter of intent as 'binding'. The letter, signed by the TEC, the multiparty body overseeing government, recognises the importance of tight monetary policy, and states that 'increases in government deficit would jeopardise the economic future of the country'.</p>

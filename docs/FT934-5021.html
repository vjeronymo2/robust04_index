			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Export credit premiums cut After the Budget speech, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced cuts in Export Credit Guarantee Department premiums - some of more than 20 per cent - in a limited number of markets. The markets are Argentina, India, Mexico, Poland, Slovakia and Turkey, and the reductions will apply until the end of 1994-95 unless there is a significant deterioration in risk. Mr Heseltine also announced that cover of Pounds 3.2bn will be available for 1996-97 for 'Amber Zone' markets, which include China, South Africa, Indonesia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico. Oman, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey and Zimbabwe. Amber Zones are those in which the risk is significant or ECGD's exposure is most concentrated. The Pounds 3.2bn is a near-doubling of the annual allocation of Amber Zone cover since 1991-92 and brings the total cover for the next 3 years to over Pounds 9bn.</p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Zil heads for the capitalist road ZIL, the Russian industrial conglomerate indelibly associated with the black limousines of the former Soviet Union's top communists (pictured above, transporting president Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991 on his last visit to the UK), is to be sold off. The government said yesterday that R1bn of nominal share capital - 1m shares with a face value of R1,000 - will be offered for sale at 100 auction centres across Russia. Although Zil limousines are still used to whisk president Boris Yeltsin and his bodyguards at high speeds through the Moscow traffic, demand has fallen now that the new commercial elite prefer Mercedes and stretch Volvos. Zil also produces heavy trucks of an outmoded design and refrigerators. The cars are handmade at a rate of two or three a year, but the mode of production guaranteed that parts were not interchangeable. A company official declined to reveal the price. The cars are still popular with well-heeled tourists. They are also bought by smart young Russian bankers to conduct them from work to marble-floored dachas. The armour plating and curtained seclusion of the passenger saloons, which shielded the communist elite from terrorists and stares of the curious, now serve the same function for the new commercial princes. Western consulting companies which have studied the enterprise concluded that the task of transforming the company into a successful and profitable enterprise will be huge. It has between between 110,000 and 130,000 workers in 17 sites across Russia. The widely spread sites, wasteful production methods and archaic designs lend a Stalinist splendour, but make Zil a nightmare for rationalisation and privatisation. The shares offered represent 35 per cent of the share value of the company, with 40 per cent going to the workforce and management free or on preferential terms and a further 25 per cent held by the state for sale later.

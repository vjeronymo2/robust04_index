			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Observer: The power of the bottle Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's agriculture minister, has run into a little local difficulty with his plan to solve the imminent transatlantic trade war. If Washington carries out its threat to impose punitive duties on white wine from France, the French should respond by drinking 'lots more white wine", says Soisson. However, his prescription for an unusually merry Christmas this year has not gone down well with former health minister, Claude Evin. Responsible for a law against tobacco and alcohol abuse while he was health minister from 1988 until this year, Evin is 'furious' with Soisson's idea. He accuses him of undermining 'consciousness of the ravages that alcohol wreaks in family and social life' in a country which has the highest alcohol consumption in the world. Untroubled, Soisson retorts that he doesn't think much about the loi Evin, and that, as president of the Conseil General of his region, he would not be signing decrees for its application. That region just happens to be Burgundy. Which explains a lot. The fact that more than half of the French wines threatened by US tariffs are white burgundies explains even more.</p>

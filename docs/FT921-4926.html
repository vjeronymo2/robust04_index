			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / ANC rejects plan for cabinet participation THE African National Congress yesterday rejected proposals from the South African government that members of black opposition groups should join the existing cabinet to form a multi-racial interim government, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, said agreement had been reached on the principle that a multi-racial interim executive should be appointed by the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the all-party body which is negotiating a post-apartheid constitution. But this should not take the form of additions to the existing cabinet. Rather, a multi-party body should be appointed over the heads of the cabinet. This body would have veto powers over cabinet decisions and over parliament. The government had said on Wednesday that Codesa had achieved a 'major breakthrough' on the issue, and that blacks would join cabinet soon. Despite the disagreement, the two sides have recently made big progress in bilateral discussions.</p>

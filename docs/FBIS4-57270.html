			<p>BFN     [Text] (NA) -- Former de facto president, retired General  Alejandro Lanusse was sentenced to 10 days arrest by the Army  over the weekend for publicly criticizing the government,  unofficial sources said yesterday [15 May].    A local news agency reported that Lanusse has been under  arrest at the Military Hospital since Saturday [14 May]. Army  Chief-of-Staff Lieutenant General Martin Balza ordered Lanusse's  detention, which will extend until May 25, said the sources.    Lanusse asserted last week during a cable television  programme that the governments of former General Juan Peron and  the current Justicialist administration were "the most corrupt"  he had known.    The retired general--who headed a three-man ruling junta  from  1971 to 1973--also said that Balza should not have taken a  personal interest in the alleged murder of recruit Omar Carrasco  at a military base in Neuquen. His opinions are said to have  been taken into account by the Army's top brass in ordering the  arrest.</p>

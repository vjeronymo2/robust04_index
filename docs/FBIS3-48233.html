			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Clarification of the Thai Boon Rong Company to Mr. Sam </F> Rangsi" issued in Phnom Penh on 14 January]    [Text] I, chairman of the Thai Boon Rong Company, would  like to inform Mr. Sam Rangsi of the following:    In the remarks you made on 11 January you should have first  selected only words of truth before you uttered them because you  were speaking in the name of the government. What you said  conveyed the feeling that you alone were patriotic while all  others were the scourge of the nation. Or was it not so?    Each statement you made concerned the fault of the former  government, of former state officials. To hear you speak,  everybody else was always wrong; no one was right. I would like  to tell you that without the former government, "which you said  to be faulty," maybe you would not at all be able to show your  face in Cambodia and step on Cambodian soil as you are now.    You are a politician. You should know how to "think ahead  and in reverse" and to speak with realism. You should not  babble like a half-wit. If you find that a person is in the  wrong, you have the right to remove, reprove, fine, or sue him;  but you have no right to revile anybody at all. However, you  are not afraid even to malign the former government with which  you are currently in cooperation. By the way, what proof do you  have to gamely accuse over the public address system that the  previous government had driven vendors out of the Olympic market  at gunpoint? Does it really happen that way? Or is it merely an  attempt to cause division in the Royal Government?    I am glad to hear your remarks, which gave credits to our  company, but you should first closely examine them. My company  is always prepared to let you personally inspect its books,  because if you send somebody else to do it, that "somebody" may  not correctly inspect them as you wish, may not be as patriotic  as you are.    Regarding to remarks that "the Thai Boon Rong Company has  made a $30-million profit," I invite you to come in person to  ticket me for a fine or to levy taxes on my company. If you  appoint somebody else in your place, he may cause the nation to  incur some losses.    Do you want to solve problems, or do you want to create them  in the Kingdom of Cambodia and in the Royal Government? If you  want to solve problems, you are asked to be less liberal with  your utterances. Before opening your mouth, you should wag your  tongue a million times.    After you have read this clarification, you should keep  forever in mind that my company is run by humans who also know  what is right and what is wrong, just like yourself. You are  not the only one who knows and certainly not the only one who  can solve all these problems.    Please hurry up; do not any waste time. My company's door is  always open for you to come in to inspect it and levy taxes.    You likened investors to leeches sucking the blood and sweat  of the people. This kind of talk is inflamatory and divisive.  They are not words of the new year, the year of national  reconstruction and national reconciliation. Such an attitude  and such remarks certainly threaten investors and frighten them  in their businesses that would contribute to the rehabilitation  of the national economy. Therefore, it is more appropriate for  you to be given the title of "Minister of Economic and Financial  Destruction."    So, Mr. Sam Rangsi, please come and inspect my company. If  after you have inspected it and nothing is found to be as in  your allegations, will you be game enough to play out your  "patriotic" role?    As far as my company is concerned, it is waiting for you to  come and inspect it. If you find that my company has evaded  taxes or has imported materials for the construction of that  market more than necessary, I and my company will pay all the  taxes and accept all kinds of fines.    If you fail to find fault with my company, what will you do?  You are asked to clarify this issue and to make a firm  commitment.    Mr. Sam Rangsi, please accept our clarification as  appropriate.    Phnom Penh, 14 January 1994    Thank you,    Theng Bun Ma</p>

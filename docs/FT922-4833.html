			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Investment sales methods under attack THE INVESTMENT ombudsman yesterday strongly criticised selling methods in the industry, saying that most disputes arose out of misunderstandings of what clients had requested. The ombudsman, Mr Richard Youard, said cases referred to him had decreased in the year to the end of March to 67, from 89 in the previous year. The number of cases resolved rose from 98 to 100. But there had been a big increase in the amount paid out in compensation, with a rise from Pounds 22,655 to Pounds 114,272. The largest amount paid in a settlement was Pounds 25,031, up from Pounds 8,715 last year. About half the cases were resolved in favour of the complainant. Mr Youard said the fall in complaints - which contrasts with a marked increase in criticism of banks, building societies and insurance companies - was probably caused by the recession, which discouraged stock market investment while increasing reliance on banks and building societies. In his criticism of selling methods he referred to the lack of notes taken by salesmen at interviews. 'It's quite possible for a salesman to be a salesman and an adviser at the same time but it's difficult, and because a salesman instinctively sells, things can go wrong.' Mr Youard also criticised the level of cost disclosure for unit-trust products. These comments may have an impact on the Securities and Investments Board's review of retail investment regulation, which has settled on disclosure rules for life assurance but has yet to make firm proposals on unit-trust disclosure. The ombudsman said the 'health warning' on unit-trust marketing material, which says that the price of units can go down as well as up, was misunderstood. 'What in my view, is required as a matter of urgency is the abandonment of the present warning and its substitution in a prominent form by such words as 'you may get back less than you invested'.' He also found that the 'bid/offer' price-spread for unit trusts was misunderstood. He said he would be delighted if the expression were abandoned for ever 'since I have seen far too many cases where it has been wholly misunderstood by the investor'. It should be substituted, he said, with a simple statement that the cost of the manager's services would be deducted from the investment on the first day. The investment ombudsman deals with disputes between customers and members of Imro, the Investment Managers' Regulatory Office. Observer, Page 19</p>

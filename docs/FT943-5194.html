			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (8): Battle on standards - Paul Taylor on cordless prospects The launch of telepoint services in Britain in the late 1980s was, by general agreement, little short of a debacle which culminated in Hutchison Telecom's decision to pull the plug on its Rabbit cordless public telephone service last November. Rabbit was the last of four telepoint services in the UK to fold because of lack of customer interest but, in spite of this inauspicious start, telepoint, the UK-developed public cordless telephone service, is proving a success in some overseas markets including south-east Asia, where there are more than 300,000 subscribers. Unfortunately, the UK systems were incompatible with each other, overpriced and poorly marketed in competition with cellular services. Elsewhere in Europe, Deutsche Telekom abandoned plans two years ago for a telepoint service and Telecom Finland recently announced it would close its Pointer telepoint service because of the low level of take-up of the service. This leaves France and the Netherlands as the only European countries still offering telepoint services. There are over 50,000 subscribers to France Telecom's Bi-Bop service, which recently cut its prices, and 35,000 subscribers to the Dutch Greenpoint service but the prospects for telepoint elsewhere in Europe look bleak. In contrast in Hong Kong, three operators Hutchison, Chevalier Telepoint and Pacific Telelink, which is backed by Vodafone, the UK cellular telephone network operator, have all launched successful services and now have more than 170,000 subscribers between them out of a population of 3m. Their success has been ascribed to the density of the population and the relatively few base stations required to provide coverage in the colony. All three telepoint operators in Hong Kong have overcome one of telepoint's main limitations - its one-way only operation by basing services on telephone and pager packages facilitating pseudo two- way operation. Calls to a telepoint telephone activate a pager and if subscribers are in range of a base station they can connect with the caller by pressing one button on the phone. In order to further increase competition in Hong Kong, the government said in July it would award four additional telepoint licences to build networks based on the Japanese personal handyphone standard. DDI, one of Japan's three domestic telephone companies, announced plans in July to invest Pounds 2bn on a telepoint network covering about half the Japanese population. Telepoint has also proved popular elsewhere in Asia. Services have been launched in half a dozen countries, including Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. However China, where the first telepoint services were recently launched, represents by far the largest potential market for CT2 equipment suppliers. Meanwhile, the technology behind telepoint has found other applications  - by the end of the decade market analysts predict that up to a fifth of new office telecommunications equipment installed will be cordless. 'Wireless office equipment will grow from virtually nothing in 1993 to nearly 20 of the market by the year 2000 while wireline-based PBXs (private branch exchanges) and key systems dip correspondingly,' said Frost &amp; Sullivan, the US-based market research firm in a recent report. The uptake of cordless business communications systems is expected to be driven by falling hardware prices and the perceived benefits of the technology in terms of mobility, flexibility and productivity. The Frost &amp; Sullivan report predicted: 'The wireless office will gain popularity as the prices of systems decline. Prime target end-users include salespeople, top management, employees in distribution and manufacturing firms and healthcare personnel. 'The popularity of cellular phones and the emergence of personal communications systems will stimulate use of wireless handsets for in-building use as users increasingly seek the same convenience they are used to outside the office inside buildings.' Ericsson, the European telecommunications equipment manufacturer, claims that cordless business systems can save customers up to 30 per cent of their bills as a result of reducing the need for returned calls. Cordless systems can also save on the costs of rewiring and other configuration operations, which can be around 10 per cent of the capital cost of the system for organisations running medium-sized or large PBX systems. In addition, as Multitone, the UK-based pager and cordless telephone system supplier, points out, cordless systems are extremely cost-effective to run once installed since there are no airtime charges, internal calls are free and external calls cost the same as from an ordinary desk telephone. Like most other cordless systems, Multitone's CS500 product connects directly to a PBX, so no expensive changes are required to an existing hard-wired system and the same desk telephones and extension numbers can continue to be used. However, if cordless business systems are to flourish, there are several obstacles to overcome. In particular, in Europe there are two rival cordless business system technology standards: CT2, which has been adopted as an interim European standard and the more recent Dect (Digital European Cordless telecommunications) standard. GPT Communications Systems, a joint venture between Germany's Siemens group and Britain's GEC, and Canada's Northern Telecom have been supplying cordless office systems based upon CT2 digital technology since early last year. Northern Telecom, which is also developing a Dect system for up to 1,000 users in conjunction with Olivetti, launched its Companion CT2 cordless business systems in Europe last March and has sold over 1,000 systems in Europe and the Middle East since then and over 2,000 systems worldwide. CT2's supporters claim it is a proven and cost-effective technology ideally suited to small and medium-sized offices. CT2 handsets cost around a third of the price of their Dect rivals and are likely to retain a price advantage because of the adoption of telepoint outside Europe. However CT2 cordless business systems face a serious challenge from systems based on the Dect standard which is backed by ETSI (the European Telecoms Standards Institute) and was designed to solve the problem of providing cordless telecommunications in high-density business environments such as offices. Five of Europe's largest telecommunications equipment suppliers - Alcatel, Ericsson, Nokia, Philips and Siemens - which between them represent nearly 70 per cent of the European PBX adopted the Dect standard in March 1993 and the first Dect systems began to appear shortly afterwards. Dect's supporters claim their systems have key advantages over those based on CT2, particularly in large office buildings where traffic is high, or for mixed voice and high speed data - and they are trying to block moves which would upgrade CT2 from an interim to a full European standard. Ultimately, however, it will be the end users who decide which of these two cordless digital technologies succeeds. The battle between them has only just begun.</p>

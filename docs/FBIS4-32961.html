			<p>BFN     [Text] Jean-Claude Martineau has said Aristide will side  with France and other countries so that he is not blamed for an  invasion of Haiti. This weekend on a Montreal radio station,  president-in-exile's spokesman detailed the avalanche strategy  [strategie lavalassienne], in light of new developments in the  Haitian crisis. He almost lost his temper in light of the  pertinence of the questions of Compere Raymond Laurent, who had  him unveil his government's priorities. Martineau clearly  confessed that President Aristide will side with France and  other countries so that he is not blamed for an invasion of  Haiti.</p>

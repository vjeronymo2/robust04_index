			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Inkatha presses for autonomy CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party, took his campaign for regional autonomy to new heights yesterday in an attempt to influence democracy negotiators who will today begin debating the first draft of a new constitution for South Africa. He told a traditional gathering of tens of thousands of Zulus in Johannesburg that the African National Congress and the ruling National party aimed to destroy the Zulu kingdom, whose modern manifestation is the KwaZulu black homeland which he leads. 'How long can we be expected to give our blessings to the connivance which is obviously directed at obliterating the Zulu nation, both politically and physically from the South African map,' he asked the crowd, many of whom carried spears and clubs, and performed tribal dances. The key issue of the powers to be granted to regional governments under a new constitution is likely to be the focus of today's debate, during which South Africans will get their first glimpse of a draft new constitution drawn up by technical experts. The draft is of an interim constitution to be in force until an elected constituent assembly writes a final one. It was not clear yesterday whether Inkatha would be present for the debate. Inkatha, KwaZulu's government and the Conservatives walked out of the negotiations on July 2 after 19 of the 26 participants agreed by 'sufficient consensus' to set April 27 as the date for the first multi-racial elections. They insist that consensus on such a vital issue ought not to have been reached without them, and Inkatha has said 'sufficient consensus' must be redefined to require its assent on issues of vital interest. It has made clear that it will continue to participate in bilateral discussions on constitutional issues but the Conservatives have given no such assurance. Democracy negotiators have made substantial concessions to Chief Buthelezi on regional autonomy, but his demand that KwaZulu lose none of its current powers until a new regional constitution is in place may be hard for negotiators to swallow.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Independent Newspapers leaps INDEPENDENT Newspapers, the Irish publishing group, reported pre-tax profits doubled to IPounds 14.6m (Pounds 13.6m) for the half year to June 30. Turnover was up 5 per cent to IPounds 81.5m. The increase in profits from the previous IPounds 7.01m was primarily due to an exceptional credit of IPounds 2.65m and a sharp reduction in interest charges. The exceptional item represented a gain of IPounds 3.62m resulting from the disposal of a 2 per cent holding in Mirror Group Newspapers, less redundancy costs in Irish operations. Net interest charges fell to IPounds 751,000 as a result of the conversion to ordinary shares of the 1991 IPounds 30m converible capital bond issue before the coupon became payable this year. Total shares in issue have increased from 37m last year to some 68m as a result of the conversion and a 2-for-3 scrip issue earlier this year, and will finally amount to 79m on a fully diluted basis. The interim dividend goes up to 4p (3.3p), payable from earnings of 17.9p (9.7p restated). Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman, reported improvements across the group with increases in advertising market share and higher profit contributions from national and provincial titles in Ireland. Australian Provincial Newspapers, in which the group has a 25 per cent stake, reported a first half pre-tax profit of ADollars 11.6m (Pounds 5.2m), up from ADollars 5.1m. Mr O'Reilly said that he anticipates the cable TV subsidiary in Ireland to have 100,000 subscribers by the year-end, up from 66,000 at the end of 1992.</p>

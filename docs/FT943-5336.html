			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Unity required in tough financial times: Robert Taylor reports on the bank described as the International Monetary Fund of trade unions Unity Trust Bank - founded only 10 years ago - has been described as the International Monetary Fund of the British trade union movement. A strictly commercial institution, one of its more unenviable tasks has been to teach some declining and profligate trade unions harsh financial realities. The bank has been preparing rescue operations and giving advice to trade unions in trouble, showing them how to cut their spending programmes and improve their finances through tighter internal disciplines. Few unions have shown much expertise at running themselves efficiently as businesses. Now all of them are being compelled to seek long-term viability. Mr Gordon Beesley, the bank's managing director, said: 'Trade unions are by their nature slow to change.' Like many commercial institutions, Unity Bank ran into serious trouble in the early 1990s with bad and doubtful debts in the aftermath of the boom years. In 1991 it suffered a Pounds 1.4m operating loss. In the following year it had to write off Pounds 580,000 in bad debts. Last year it had to take even more drastic action by writing off a further Pounds 5.72m against earlier provisions and to make an additional provision of Pounds 1.1m. Mr Beesley said: 'This was a prudent measure against the expected shortfall between our customers' debts and the value of the assets offered as security for their loans.' But he also pointed out that none of those provisions were due to any difficulties from the bank's loans to any of its trade union customers. 'It was the impact of the decrease in property values in respect of security offered by our corporate customers,' he said. The bank's president is Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT transport union general secretary. His union is being drastically restructured as it battles to match its expenditure with its current income. He believes that all trade unions and the bulk of their local branches will eventually bank with Unity. At present 44 trade unions have invested Pounds 3.5m between them in Unity's capital and loan stock. More than 12,000 union branches and 46 union head offices have accounts with the bank. Since its formation Unity has seen its balance sheet climb from Pounds 16m to Pounds 151m. Mr Beesley believes Unity will become less of a bank and turn itself into 'a group of financial service companies' in the next five years. It has already started to diversify. Unity has a growing balloting service for unions when they hold strike ballots and leadership elections. Another part of the group is developing union membership benefits. For the past six years it has run an investment management service with more than Pounds 1bn assets in its care for unions' pension, general and provident funds in an alliance with Co-operative Bank. At the end of last year it was managing the funds of 12 clients with assets worth Pounds 95m between them. Unity also manages occupational pension schemes. In a joint venture with the Colonial Mutual group it established Jacques Martin Unity last year to administer industry-wide pension schemes. It has been expanding its activities to encourage employee ownership and share ownership schemes, particularly in employee buy-outs and privatisation. As much as 73 per cent of Unity's customers are still trade unions and affiliated organisations and last year they made up 62 per cent of the bank's customer account liabilities of Pounds 132.3m. But Mr Beesley says that Unity is widening its customer base outside the trade unions. 'Our strategic objective is to continue increasing the number of customers and the value of accounts from the charity and voluntary sectors,' he said. 'This helps us to meet the community aspirations that underpinned the setting up of Unity Trust 10 years ago.'</p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIRD CRAFT DIVERTED EASTERN PILOT'S ATTENTION BEFORE HE HIT PLANE  </P> <P> The pilot of an Eastern Airlines jetliner that crashed into a smaller plane did  not see it on the runway until the last minute because he had been watching  another jetliner that landed in front of them, federal investigators said  Friday.  </P> <P> A Continental Airlines jetliner had been cleared to land on the same runway  ahead of the twin-engine Beechcraft Air King, which was struck from behind by  the Eastern Boeing 727-200, said Robert MacIntosh, a National Transportation  Safety Board investigator.  </P> <P> The accident at Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport late Thursday killed  the pilot of the smaller plane and injured the co-pilot.  </P> <P> The Eastern jet, which was rolling down the runway at 120 m.p.h., sheared off  the roof of the twin-propeller plane, which was owned by Epps Air Service and  based at a suburban airport, authorities said. There were no injuries to the  141 passengers and 8 crew members aboard the Eastern plane.  </P> <P> Before the Eastern jet collided with the Beechcraft, the air traffic controller  had told the Continental pilot to stop between runways after he had cleared the  airport's northernmost runway, MacIntosh said.  </P> <P> All three planes had been cleared to land on the runway, and all three pilots  were tuned to the same radio frequency with the controller, he said.  </P> <P> MacIntosh said the controller told the Eastern pilot, 23-year veteran Ralph  Orlando, that he had his plane in sight.  </P> <P> Shortly after that transmission, the controller asked the pilot of the  Continental plane to "hold short" of the parallel runway, an order MacIntosh  said meant that the plane should stop between the two runways. He said  investigators had not determined why that order was given.  </P> <P> The Continental pilot, who was not identified, did not immediately acknowledge  the instruction, and the tower controllers discussed among themselves whether  they thought the pilot had heard it, MacIntosh said. Shortly thereafter, the  Eastern pilot reported having hit the Beechcraft.  </P> <P> "The captain (of the Eastern flight) stated he had been looking down the runway  in some awareness of the Continental. He saw the tail of the (Beechcraft)  aircraft a very short time before impact," MacIntosh said.  </P> <P> MacIntosh said that investigators would spend the weekend examining the cockpit  recorder tapes and studying the distances between the planes, the approaches of  the planes and the controller's conduct.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 25 May (Business-TASS) -- The State Duma  committee on economic policy has spoken in favor of increasing  Russia's military expenditure in 1994 to up to 55 trillion  rubles, thus supporting the Duma's defense committee on this.  If the State Duma were to approve this initiative during the  debates of the budget in its second reading, the overall  increase for national defense would exceed the original sum by  17.9 trillion rubles. The proposal to increase Russia's  military expenditure to up to 55 trillion rubles was supported  by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.</p>

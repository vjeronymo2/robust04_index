			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / US consulate for Vladivostok The US has received permission to re-open its consulate in the Russian far east port of Vladivostok this summer, the regional governor, Mr Vladimir Kuznetsov, said yesterday, AP reports. US diplomats will work from a former communist party dacha, or summer home, while negotiating a permanent location. The governor did not rule out the possibility the US might re-acquire the property that served as its consulate from 1890 until the 1917 revolution and again from 1933 to 1949. Vladivostok was closed to foreigners until 1991 because of its large Soviet naval base. Mr Kuznetsov said the decision to allow the reopening of the consulate followed the visit of an official delegation led by Senators Frank Murkowski of Alaska and Steve Summs of Idaho.</p>

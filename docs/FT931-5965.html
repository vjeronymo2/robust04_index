			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market report Aluminium prices extended earlier declines during afternoon LME trading, falling to 3 1/2 -month lows and ending weak, but copper and zinc finished steady after rallying from depressed morning levels. ALUMINIUM reeled under speculative fund liquidation, as well as option hedge selling. There is very little significant consumer interest at present, so further falls are possible, although the market is becoming oversold, dealers said. Three-month COPPER edged away from an early 3 1/2 -month low of Dollars 2,139 a tonne, with the market regaining Dollars 2,150 by the close, up Dollars 4. Technical buying emerged below Dollars 2,150, while heavy option-related selling was not in evidence. Today's declarations are expected to be more lively than recent expiries, dealers said. ZINC rallied strongly in the afternoon, with the fall to a 17-month low of Dollars 993 a tonne for three-month metal attracting short-covering and bargain-hunting, although further declines below Dollars 1,000 are likely.

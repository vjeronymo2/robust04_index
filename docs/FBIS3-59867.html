Jerath: "The Raphel Rhetoric; U.S. Line </F> on Kashmir Might Spur New Strategic Alliance"]    [Text] We must indeed thank Robin Raphel. Deliberately or  inadvertently, she has given us a peep into her mind and  forewarned us of the direction in which her thoughts are running  and the shape she intends to give to U.S. policy on South Asia.    Whatever the State Department may say now to defuse her  bombshell, India cannot afford to ignore the signals coming loud  and clear from her comments. She is, after all, the point person  in Washington for South Asia. Moreover, she has a blank page on  which to write and was hand-picked for the job by President Bill  Clinton whom she knows personally. When a key person such as  Raphel gives a backgrounder, her statements cannot be dismissed  as off-the-cuff remarks and must be presumed to be inputs for a  policy in the making, if not a part of official policy already.    The most disturbing element in Raphel's statement  questioning  the validity of Kashmir's accession to India is that she has  sought to give a quantitatively new dimension to the entire  issue. She has chosen to revive a 1947 U.S. position, which held  Jammu and Kashmir as disputed territory even before the United  Nations put an international seal on it in 1948, thus taking the  dispute beyond the confines of Indo-Pak rivalry over the state  and the consequent threat of a nuclear war in the subcontinent  which Washington has been touting as the reason for its  excessive concern. In fact, Raphel's comments clearly hint at a  direct U.S. interest in Kashmir which is not necessarily  circumscribed by its policies on India and Pakistan.    Washington's escalating interest in Kashmir must be seen in  the context of its strategically sensitive location. It provides  direct access into Tibet and consequently China. It is also  contiguous with the Islamic Crescent with a border just 20  kilometres away from the Central Asian Republic of Tajikistan  where the battle lines currently being drawn by the U.S., Russia  and Iran to gain supremacy could change the destiny of the  entire region. If the U.S. desire for a toehold in this area  after the Second World War was primarily to contain Russia,  today, its guns are trained on China and Iran. And Kashmir, with  its unique position, has the potential of becoming a key factor  in the new geopolitical strategy being fashioned in Washington  to deal with the two nations the U.S. sees as major threats.    It is worth noting that the U.S. was the first country to  open an embassy in the Tajik Capital of Dushanbe. It is also  significant that Raphel's present tour, said to be aimed at  acquainting herself with South Asia, takes her to Dushanbe and  Moscow after Dhaka, Islamabad and Kabul.    To give Washington the benefit of the doubt when it says  that  Raphel's remarks are not a policy statement, it is true that the  attempt to redraw the geopolitical map of the region by linking  Kashmir to the Central Asian belt is merely one of the options  being explored by strategists in the U.S. The Clinton  administration's bewildering flip-flops on the Kashmir issue  indicate that a policy has yet to be formulated. But the  mounting pressures and the red herrings that pop up from time to  time clearly suggest that the U.S. intends to keep its options  on Kashmir open.    By letting the cat out of the bag on the new thinking in  Washington, Raphel may have done us a great favour. If, indeed,  her statements do not yet constitute U.S. policy, India must  move in before they do and firmly link Kashmir to its own  survival as a modern, secular, market democracy. An independent  Kashmir, subject to buffeting pressures in a region where  ambitious powers are striving to carve out spheres of influence,  cannot benefit anyone, neither India, nor Pakistan, nor even the  Kashmiri people. One only has to look at Afghanistan to see the  consequences of meddling in areas where dormant tribal  affiliations can resurface with a vengeance in bloody ethnic  strife.    Has the world already forgotten the brutal onslaught on  Kashmir by Waziri tribesmen from the North-West Frontier in  September 1947 when the state was not under India's protective  umbrella? Can Pakistan afford a sharpening of existing  fissiparous tendencies in Baluchistan and the NWFP [North-West  Frontier Province] once a free Kashmir which includes POK  becomes a reality?    As for India, the Kashmir question has never been so vital  for its future. A second partition, once again on religious  lines, fostered by Pakistan, could destroy the foundation of the  Indian nation. An independent Kashmir is bound to raise a big  question mark on the status of 120 million Muslims in the rest  of India, making the bloody aftermath of the Ayodhya crisis look  like a teddy bear's picnic.    The trouble is that the perceptions of the Raphels of this  world are shaped by shallow interactions on Delhi's cocktail  circuit where flippant remarks pass off as studied analysis, and  compounded by a decidedly grim situation on the ground in the  Valley. Raphel is therefore not alone in believing that India  has lost Kashmir, that it never was a part of the Indian  maintream, that severing the state from the rest of the country  will not have any economic, social or political consequences  here.    It is imperative for India to disabuse policy makers and  strategists, not just in Washington but in other Western  Capitals as well, of the fundamental fallacies in their  perceptions without indulging in xenophobic hysteria or  jingoism. The unanimous outburst here against Raphel's  statements is a good beginning. The strong reactions Raphel has  provoked send a more effective message than any official  exchange.    Unfortunately, Washington is too far away to understand the  depth of feeling in India. There must be a follow-up to the  protest. What is needed is a concerted strategy -- some  "creative diplomacy," to use Washington's new catchword -- to  hammer in some home truths to those who think they can resolve  the problems of this region.    Here again, the Clinton administration may have unwittingly  helped us. In trying to extricate itself from the tight spot in  which it finds itself thanks to Raphel, the State Department has  trilateralised the Kashmir issue by including China-held parts  of the state in its definition of disputed territory. Although  there has been no reaction from Beijing yet on the controversy,  China cannot but be aware of the implications for its security  of Washington's formulations. Similarly, Iran, which considers  itself a major player in a region which has opened up with  demise of the Soviet Union, will be watching events here very  closely.    Quite clearly, the Clinton administration has ended up  muddying the waters and if it is not careful, it may soon find  that its ham-handed attempts to redraw the lines in this region  will make allies of those it wants to see least in a strategic  convergence -- India, China and Iran.</p>

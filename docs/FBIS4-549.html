Last  night, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the RPF, said their fighters  had reached the Rwandan capital to restore law and order and  install a new administration. They said they had a total of  3,000 men in Kigali. Peace, they said, was going to be restored  quickly. However, after a quiet and uneventful night, a fierce  gun battle began at 0430 GMT this morning with heavy artillery.  [passage omitted]</p>

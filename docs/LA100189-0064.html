			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT  </P> <P> Houses may average a million dollars per in Aspen, but budget travelers can  still make an economical stop in the area.  </P> <P> One of the best deals in town is the Little Red Ski Haus, a 101-year-old,  red-and-white Victorian home at 118 Cooper St.  </P> <P> Back in the late 1800s, when Aspen was a silver mining town and Cooper Street  was called Fanny Girl Street, it's believed that this house was a brothel. Now  it's a cozy B&amp;B with 51 beds, two blocks from the center of town.  </P> <P> You can book into shared men's or women's dormitory rooms (maximum four beds)  for $20 a night in the summer or $30 to $33 a night in the ski season. There is  a seven-night minimum stay in winter.  </P> <P> One of the nicest things about the home is that it offers a comfortable  atmosphere of camaraderie for solo travelers. Guests mingle in the main lounge  at breakfast and enjoy coffee on the front porch or in front of the fire.  Breakfasts are free -- continental in the summer and full breakfast in winter.  </P> <P> Guests range in age from teens to octogenarians. In winter, most visitors are  from Australia. During the summer months you can expect a mix of travelers and  music students, or guest music festival performers. For reservations, call  (303) 925-3333.  </P> <P> Although it doesn't have the same interesting atmosphere and history, the St.  Moritz at 334 W. Hyman St., phone (303) 935-3200, also offers clean, low-cost  lodgings. Accommodations are in several dormitory rooms (most limited to three  beds) and cost $19 a night in the summer, $14 in the spring and fall. There is  a pool and lounge, plus TV, refrigerators and microwave oven.  </P> <P> Campers and hikers can get information from the tourist information office in  the Wheeler Opera House or at the Forest Service Office on the edge of town at  806 W. Hallam St.  </P> <P> Several of the camping areas require reservations 10 days in advance, but sites  such as Maroon Lake campground operate on a first-come basis. At the Forest  Office you can buy the helpful White River National Forest map (it includes  1,500 miles of hiking trails) for $2 and "Trail Guide For Hikers" for $5.95.  </P> <P> Bikers can get information about special paths in the area from cycle rental  shops. Both road and mountain bikes are available. Expect to pay $4 to $6 an  hour, $20 to $25 a day, depending on type and quality.  </P> <P> The view of the mountains from Maroon Lake is one of the most photographic  sights in Colorado. You can reach the area by taking the free Aspen Highlands  bus from town, which connects with a special summer tour bus that offers a  30-minute trip with commentary for $3. You can catch a different tour bus back  if you want to stay to camp or hike.  </P> <P> The Aspen Highlands bus also takes you past the 500-acre T-Lazy-7 Ranch --  phone (303) 925-7040. It's one of the few stables in the nation that allows you  to ride without a guide. Rates run $16 an hour.  </P> <P> The $1.50 Snowmass bus from Aspen will take you to Ranch Arts Center, where,  for 24 years, leading artists have come to lecture and teach one- to three-week  courses in photography, ceramics, woodworking, painting and drawing.  </P> <P> On Tuesdays at 6 p.m. a community potluck dinner is held at the log cabin  compound. Everyone is welcome to contribute. At 7 p.m. one of the guest artists  gives a free lecture.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN WATCH;  </P> <P> GIVE US A HINT  </P> <P> California is in its second week without a state budget. Gov. George Deukmejian  insists that the $3.6-billion deficit must be eliminated without a tax  increase. Democratic legislators resist any solution that relies solely on  cuts.  </P> <P> The result is a fiscal crisis that deepens with each passing day.  </P> <P> California also is in the second month of a gubernatorial campaign. Republican  Pete Wilson and Democrat Dianne Feinstein both decline to take specific  positions on the budget question.  </P> <P> It would be more than helpful, though, to know what their inclinations are on  so fundamental a problem of governance, since it almost certainly will reoccur.  </P> <P> As John Vasconcellos, the obviously frustrated chairman of the Assembly Ways  and Means Committee put it, "If you're going to govern, you ought to tell  people how you're going to govern."  </P> <P> Since Walter Mondale's disastrous experiment with candor in 1984, candidates  have been reluctant to be specific about taxation. California voters, however,  need to know where the candidates stand on taxes, the growth of entitlements  and where their priorities are in an era of fiscal limits.  </P> <P> Both Feinstein and Wilson are instinctual moderates with pragmatic rather than  ideological attitudes toward public policy. Since they are inclined to decide  issues on a case-by-case basis, voters ought to judge them on the same basis.  The budget crisis is as good a place as any to start.  </P></p>

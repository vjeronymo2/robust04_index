			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. A description of how the proposed modification differs from the original application;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The reason for the proposed modification; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Any other information that the Bank determines is necessary to review the proposed modification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.11(c)(1) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall review the request for modification, shall re-score the application as proposed to be modified according to the scoring criteria used in the AHP funding cycle in which the application was originally approved, and may approve such request if the following factors are satisfied:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The project as proposed to be modified continues to meet all of the requirements of this part; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The project as proposed to be modified continues to score high enough that it would have been approved in its AHP funding cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.11(c)(2) of the proposed rule provides that if the application does not satisfy the requirements in paragraph (c)(1), the Bank in its discretion may approve the request for modification if the reason for the modification is due to circumstances outside the control of the applicant or sponsor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.11(d) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall forward to the Board a detailed summary of any modification of an AHP application approved by the Bank, including how the Bank re-scored the project, within 30 calendar days of the approval of such modification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Use, Calculation and Verification at Initial Disbursement of AHP Subsidized Advances or Direct Subsidies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Use of Subsidized Advances or Direct Subsidies Within Reasonable Period of Time and Verification of Reasonable Progress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, the threshold requirement in the Board's existing AHP regulation that the project have the ability to begin using Bank assistance within 12 months is omitted as a threshold requirement in the proposed rule. See 12 CFR 960.5(a)(2)(iv). In addition, setting a fixed period of 12 months may not be appropriate in all cases, because what is a reasonable period of time will vary from project to project depending on the type of project and the circumstances of the project. However, the Board does believe that funds received under the AHP should be used within a reasonable period of time after approval of an AHP application. Because what is a reasonable period of time is so project specific, the Board believes that the determination of such periods should be left to the discretion of the Banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, &sect;960.12(a) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall in its AHP implementation plan identify what constitutes reasonable progress by the sponsor towards using subsidized advances or direct subsidies within a reasonable period of time after the approval of an AHP application for different types of projects, and explain how it intends to verify such reasonable progress.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.12(b) of the proposed rule provides that the sponsor must demonstrate that reasonable progress is being made towards using the requested funds within a reasonable period of time after approval of the AHP application, as determined by the Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.12(c) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall verify the efforts of the sponsor to determine whether it has satisfied the requirement in paragraph (b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.12(d) of the proposed rule provides that if the sponsor fails to satisfy the requirement in paragraph (b), the Bank shall cancel the AHP award, and shall not disburse any subsidized advances or direct subsidies through the applicant to the sponsor, and the full amount of any previously disbursed subsidized advances or direct subsidies shall be returned to the Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Survey of North American Business Locations (8): Southern comfort for BMW - Barbara Harrison discusses a car company's move to South Carolina Alongside interstate highway 85 in South Carolina stands a large billboard with the BMW logo on it and this statement: 'Soon the world will know South Carolina craftsmanship.' The billboard seems a proud and defiant answer to all those who harbour doubts about why BMW chose to locate its first US car plant in the American Deep South. Many non-southern Americans still regard the South as an unsophisticated backwater, whose people are under-educated and unskilled. Referring pejoratively to all southerners as 'Bubba', the sceptics snidely asked: 'Can Bubba build BMWs?' The question held a special edge, since no European car company, much less one that built luxury cars, has ever succeeded in manufacturing in the US. Yet, BMW is the 46th German company to invest in South Carolina's Spartanburg County, in the Piedmont of the Appalachian mountains. It is the 76th German firm to invest in South Carolina. 'The capability of South Carolinians is well known in Germany,' says BMW spokesman Bobby Hitt. But Mr Hitt, himself a native South Carolinian, acknowledges that the state's stake in the plant's success is high. South Carolinians 'have the success of the plant in their hearts and minds because they know it's a statement about our people', he said. This is so despite many other foreign investors in South Carolina, which ranks 13 out of the 50 American states in total foreign investment. But the BMW plant has the highest profile of the lot, which includes Robert Bosch, Michelin and other European high-end machining and high-technology manufacturing firms. BMW's primary reasons for choosing South Carolina were straightforward. Labour and overall operating costs were relatively cheap, suppliers were at the ready (including the 28 US companies that already served the company's German plants), the labour force was available and of good quality, the US is the company's second largest market and the state's Dollars 130m incentive programme was attractive. BMW is pleased with its move so far. The Dollars 400m plant, on which construction began in April 1993, opened its doors on schedule for the first workers in July. The 1.2m sq ft building rises in windowless pristine white from a 1,039-acre site, which still bears construction equipment and dirt mounds. Construction work continues on the 17,000 sq ft Zentrum, or visitors' centre, which is the architectural centrepiece of the plant. In keeping with BMW's high profile, the Zentrum will be used for a display of BMW's history and as a staging point for tours of the plant. The plant, which will be officially inaugurated next month, has all manufacturing operations under one roof and among its innovations is an assembly line that crosses itself, like an upside down small 'e'. The reasoning behind the design is almost purely to pump up the morale of the workforce. After a car completes the U-shaped production portion of the line, it is turned and rolled down through the middle for final testing. This allows those who work at the start of the line to see the finished product - and, of course, be on hand for any last-minute touching up. The plant's initial 520 workers, including fewer than 30 Germans, produced their first car on September 8. Although the plant was designed to make any model BMW, the first car was a 318i. The plant will make the 318 and the 325 models over the next year, and then start in August 1995 with the yet-to-be-unveiled roadster. Production is expected to rise to 290 units a day in 1996 with a workforce of 1,200. By the end of the decade, the plant is expected to employ 2,000. While it is too soon to render a judgment on whether Bubba can make BMWs, the company is satisfied with its workers so far. It has, however, been extremely selective. When the job application deadline was reached last November, nearly 60,000 people had applied. The starting hourly wage is Dollars 12 and it rises to Dollars 16.20. This is modest by US auto industry standards, but enviable by any South Carolina measure. The firm is giving preference to those who live in the area, but it is also seeking bright and ambitious people who see themselves making a career at BMW. The worker who drove the first car off the line, for example, is a former school teacher. One of the attractions of South Carolina is its excellent technical training colleges. But BMW is no doubt cautious about pro-union people. While the company says it is not anti-union, South Carolina is a right-to-work state and BMW at least harbours a hope that its plant will stay out of the grasp of the United Auto Workers' Union. It is concentrating on creating a culture of worker empowerment. People are trained to work in teams and be independent decision-makers. To cut down on the attitude of 'us and them', there is no executive dining room, all employees including the president wear a simple white work jacket bearing the BMW logo, and there are no walls separating the plant's top brass from the floor workers. Whether inculcating the concept of worker empowerment will insulate that plant from unionism remains unclear. But were the plant to be organised by the UAW, it would be an aberration in South Carolina. Meanwhile, BMW's investment has brought a string of its suppliers. Twelve suppliers have already relocated into the area, bringing investment of more than Dollars 114m and more than 1,000 additional jobs. Another dozen suppliers of the estimated final 70 for the plant are expected to relocate in the state. The added investment by suppliers not only makes operating easier and cheaper for the company but provides yet more reasons (mostly in the shape of jobs) for BMW's success to be in the hearts and minds of South Carolinians.</p>

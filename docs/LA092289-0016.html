			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MOBIL PARTY GETS SMALLER, BUT TORRANCE STILL DUBIOUS  </P> <P> Mobil Oil, which earlier had announced plans to have 10,000 to 12,000 people  attend a daylong open house at its Torrance refinery Oct. 7, now estimates that  only 6,000 to 8,000 people will come, with no more than 2,000 at any one time.  </P> <P> But Torrance Assistant City Manager Albert Ng, who had opposed holding the  gathering at the refinery because of safety concerns, said Thursday that he  continues to think a city park would be a better place for such a large group.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Still a Lot of People'  </P> <P> "They could have the assembly in a park site and bus the people (to the  refinery) for tours," he said. "Two thousand is still a lot of people."  </P> <P> Torrance Fire Marshal Richard Nanney said the city's fire prevention office is  reviewing Mobil applications for permits to hold a public assembly and to erect  canopies.  </P> <P> "Part of the review is on the maximum size," he said.  </P> <P> The refinery -- the focus of investigations prompted by a series of explosions,  fires, gas releases and fatal accidents -- was planning to spend up to $200,000  for jugglers, clowns, hot dogs, hamburgers, a Ferris wheel, a carousel, bus  tours of refinery process and control units and informational booths.  </P> <P> Mobil spokesman Barry Engelberg said the lower estimate of attendance is not an  attempt to mollify the city by planning a smaller celebration.  </P> <P> "We have not planned to downsize our open house," he said. "You refine things  as you go along. I just didn't want to give the impression that we were going  to scale down the thing. The estimate of people changed."  </P> <P> Mobil officials say the party is to polish the beleaguered refinery's image,  part of a campaign that has also included advertisements in local newspapers  and the publication of a newsletter sent to all Torrance residents.  </P> <P> They say the campaign is not intended to influence a lawsuit filed against  Mobil in April, in which the city of Torrance seeks to have the refinery  declared a public nuisance, or to sway Torrance voters, who will face a ballot  measure in March that would effectively eliminate the use of acutely hazardous  hydrofluoric acid at the plant.  </P> <P> Mobil reacted bitterly to the city's initial opposition to its open-house plans  in mid-August, accusing the city of unconstitutionally violating its rights.  </P> <P> City Atty. Kenneth Nelson said then, however, that there are limited grounds on  which the city can refuse permits, and Mobil continued to pursue its party  plans.  </P></p>

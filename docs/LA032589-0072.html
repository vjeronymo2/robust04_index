			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA WEST REGIONAL FINAL AT DENVER;  </P> <P> UNLV'S SPEED TAKES ON SETON HALL'S STRENGTH  </P> <P> Jerry Tarkanian's "skinniest team in America" spent Thursday night beating  Arizona, the team many regarded as the best in America.  </P> <P> Now, Nevada Las Vegas -- with only one senior on its roster -- takes its thin  front line against Seton Hall in the West Regional final today for a spot in  the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament's Final Four.  </P> <P> If the Arizona game was a battle between the best in the West, this one shapes  up as a struggle between the brawn of Seton Hall and the speed of UNLV.  </P> <P> Seton Hall, true to the tradition of the Big East, averages 223 pounds across  the front line, and Ramon Ramos, the 6-foot 9-inch center, tips the scales at  250.  </P> <P> UNLV's front line averages only 199 pounds, and none of the players is shorter  than 6-7.  </P> <P> One of UNLV's thin men is David Butler, a 6-10, 200-pound center who, rather  than talk to recruiters when he was at San Jacinto Junior College in Texas,  simply had "UNLV" cut into his hair.  </P> <P> "Coaches would come in and want to talk to me," Butler said. "But once they saw  UNLV on my head, they backed off."  </P> <P> Butler believes Seton Hall's lack of speed could help UNLV.  </P> <P> "Their inside guys are pretty good," he said. "But I don't feel they run the  court real well. A couple of times, they weren't getting back."  </P> <P> Tarkanian, sitting nearby, sensed bulletin-board material, and cautioned  Butler.  </P> <P> "Better be careful," he said.  </P> <P> "I am being careful," Butler said. "I watched the game closely."  </P> <P> Besides Butler, UNLV's front line is made up of Moses Scurry, 6-7 and 205;  Stacey Augmon, 6-7 and 192, and substitute George Ackles, 6-10 and 200.  </P> <P> Scurry is the closest thing the Rebels have to a bruiser. But what he lacks in  size, he makes up for in intimidation, opening his mouth wide for a ferocious  shout with every rebound he pulls down.  </P> <P> Seton Hall, struggling to overcome an underdog label despite being the  third-seeded team, counters with Ramos, Daryll Walker at 6-8 and 215, Andrew  Gaze at 6-7 and 205, and substitute Frantz Volcy at 6-8 and 220.  </P> <P> Tarkanian concedes the weight difference, but that's about all.  </P> <P> "I think they are a little stronger," he said. "I think we're quicker. I don't  think they're tougher."  </P> <P> Seton Hall has an interior defense that drew the compliments of Indiana Coach  Bob Knight after the Pirates eliminated the Hoosiers Thursday.  </P> <P> Seton Hall Coach P.J. Carlesimo, like Tarkanian, is looking to the interior  game.  </P> <P> "They're a little bigger and might be a tad quicker," he said. "We're more  physical. Hopefully, our people will hold them inside."  </P> <P> The improvement of UNLV's inside game has coincided with the Rebels'  late-season run.  </P> <P> After beginning the season with only three returning players -- guard Stacey  Cvijanovich, Clint Rossum and Augmon -- the Rebels struggled a little early.  </P> <P> "We were 15-6 at one time, and I was wondering if we'd win 20 games," Tarkanian  said.  </P> <P> UNLV lost only one more game the rest of the way, to Louisiana State, and has a  29-7 record.  </P> <P> Butler, in particular, has been important in the run, and is averaging 18  points a game during the tournament, compared to 15 overall.  </P> <P> Despite Seton Hall's 29-6 record, which includes three losses to Syracuse,  there are those who are trying to pin the Cinderella label on Seton Hall, the  second-place team in the Big East.  </P> <P> "I think they'll start to understand once we get to Seattle," Walker said.  </P> <P> Carlesimo said of his players: "They're good, and they know they're good."  </P> <P> As for the Rebels, any doubts about themselves were dispelled in the 68-67  victory over Arizona, narrow as it was.  </P> <P> "Going into (Thursday night's) game, I thought Arizona was the best team in the  country," Tarkanian said. "I thought they had a good shot at winning the whole  thing. Seton Hall is a good team, but I don't think they're as good as Arizona  was."  </P> <P> West Regional Notes  </P> <P> Sean Elliott finished his career at Arizona with 735 points this season and  2,555 in all. . . . UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian picked Arizona, Oklahoma, North  Carolina and Indiana to win in Thursday's semifinals. All four lost. . . .  Tarkanian thought it so unlikely that the Rebels could beat Arizona that he  told his wife, Lois, that if the teams played 10 times, UNLV would win once.  </P></p>

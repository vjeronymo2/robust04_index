			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Letter: Standards on the decline Sir, I am horrified to note that the European Commission is likely to legislate against the British system of hallmarks in order to harmonise downwards to a lesser standard ('EC looks set to ban precious metal symbols', June 3) and hope that this will be resisted at all costs. What is next to go in the new State of Europe, perhaps the three-pin plug? After all, it, too, constitutes a higher and safer standard that that used in continental Europe.

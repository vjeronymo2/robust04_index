			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Shorts to shed 350 missiles jobs Short Brothers, the Belfast-based aerospace company, is axing 350 jobs at its missile division. It said it had failed to land expected orders for its plant at Castlereagh, Belfast, but hoped that some workers might be redeployed. Shorts, a subsidiary of Bombardier of Canada, last year agreed to join forces with Thomson-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics group, to make short-range ground-to-air missiles. Shorts' missile division employs 800 people. Unions said the 350 job losses 'raised serious questions' about the future of the Castlereagh-based missile division. Mr Joe Bowers of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union said the losses continued the 'rolling programme of redundancies' by Shorts in recent years. Staff at the division were planning a walk-out in protest, he added. Unions said that the decision undermined the ability of Shorts to continue as an independent missile systems designer and developer.</p>

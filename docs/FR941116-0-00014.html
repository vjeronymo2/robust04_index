			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A proposed rule seeking comments regarding the adjustment of the value of imported cotton was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on Wednesday, August 3, 1994 (59 FR 39480&hyph;39485). One comment was received during the comment period (August 3, 1994&hyph;September 2, 1994). This comment is addressed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule increases the value assigned to imported cotton in the Cotton Board Rules and Regulations 7 CFR 1205.510(b)(2). This value is used to calculate supplemental assessments on imported cotton and the cotton content of imported products. Supplemental assessments are the second part of a two-part assessment. The first part of the assessment is levied on the weight of cotton produced or imported at a rate of $1 per bale of cotton which is equivalent to 500 pounds or $1 per 226.8 kilograms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Supplemental assessments are levied at a rate of five tenths of one percent of the value of domestically produced cotton, imported cotton, and the cotton content of imported products. The agency adopted the use of the calendar year average price received by U.S. farmers for Upland cotton as a benchmark for the value of domestically produced cotton. The source for this statistic is ``Agricultural Prices'', a publication of the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the Department of Agriculture. Use of the average price figure in the calculation of supplemental assessments on imported cotton and the cotton content of imported products yields an assessment that approximates assessments paid on domestically produced cotton.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The one comment received suggested the use of the marketing year average price received by U.S. cotton producers instead of the calendar year average price, which is also published by NASS. According to the commenter, this would be more consistent with the fiscal period recognized by the cotton industry and would bring the value of the imported cotton closer to the value of domestic cotton.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this comment the Agency consulted with NASS in order to form an opinion as to whether the calendar year or marketing year average price would be more appropriate. The marketing year average price, published by NASS, is calculated using monthly average prices from August of one year through July of the following year. The final adjusted marketing year average price is published in October each year. The calendar year average price is calculated from monthly average prices from January through December each year and published as a final figure on January 31 each year. Because the calendar year average price is made available on a more timely basis the agency will continue to use the calendar year average price as the value of imported cotton for the purpose of calculating the supplemental assessment on imported cotton and the cotton content of imported products. Insofar as the appropriate value to be placed on imported cotton compared to the value placed on domestic cotton is concerned, the time period used to average such value when assessing imported cotton does not materially affect the outcome. This is because the value placed on domestic cotton for the purpose of supplemental assessments is based on actual sale prices of each bale of cotton. Since imported cotton is in the form of products, it is necessary to average the value of bales over a period of time in order to arrive at a bale equivalent value of the cotton content of imported products for the purpose of calculating the supplemental assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current value of imported cotton based on calendar year 1992 as published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 52215) for the purpose of calculating supplemental assessments on imported cotton is $1.160 per kilogram. Using the Average Price Received by U.S. farmers for Upland cotton for the calendar year 1993, which is $0.543 per pound, the new value of imported cotton will be $1.197 per kilogram.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An example of the assessment formula and how the various figures are obtained is as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> One bale is equal to 500 pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One kilogram equals 2.2046 pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One pound equals 0.453597 kilograms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One dollar per bale assessment converted to kilograms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> A 500 pound bale equals 226.8 kg. (500&times;.453597)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $1 per bale assessment equals $0.002000 per pound (1 <!-- PJG 0001 unknown --> 500) or $0.004409 per kg. (1 <!-- PJG 0001 unknown --> 226.8). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Supplemental assessment of 5/10 of one percent of the value of the cotton converted to kilograms <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Average price received $0.543 per pound or $1.197 per kg. (0.543&times;2.2046)=1.1970. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 5/10 of one percent of the average price in kg. equals $0.005985 per kg. (1.1970&times;.005)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total assessment per kilogram of raw cotton is obtained by adding the $1 per bale equivalent assessment of $0.004409 per kg. and the supplemental assessment $0.005985 per kg. which equals $0.010394 per kg. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

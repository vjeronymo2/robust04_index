			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INDIANS REARED OFF THE RESERVATION  </P> <P> As a non-Indian who worked on an Indian reservation in Arizona from 1978 until  1985, I would like to respond to your coverage of the Indian Child Welfare Act.  In my position as director of Tribal Social Services, I experienced the impact  of the act both on our reservation and through networking with other tribes.  Initially, I had concerns about some aspects of the law, but quickly became  aware of its importance and necessity.  </P> <P> The difficult identity problems faced by Indians raised outside the Indian  culture were apparent. I saw several adult Indians return to the reservation  after growing up in non-Indian homes saying they needed to figure out who they  were and where they fit.  </P> <P> I saw Indian children, who had been taken into non-Indian homes as infants,  experience sudden problems and disruptions when they became teens, with some of  those families requesting that they be removed. There were young girls who  identified beauty as being blonde and blue-eyed, and another little girl who  had nightmares of Indians chasing her.  </P> <P> There was the prospective adoptive mother who attempted to give the Indian  children some sense of identity by having them attend a school-sponsored Indian  culture program and by providing other external cultural awareness. When we  brought them to the reservation for a visit, they asked to see the tepees. They  had no concept that their ancestors never lived in tepees and no real sense of  being Indian.  </P> <P> I repeatedly saw tribal courts make very thoughtful decisions in (Indian Child  Welfare Act) cases, and their focus was always the best interest of the child.  To outsiders, this may not be so obvious. Poverty may be prevalent on  reservations, but material wealth is not an important criterion in determining  heritage.  </P> <P> The young woman involved in the current case remembers alcohol and child abuse  as a child. We all know that these also occur off the reservation. In addition,  today, tribes have access to better tribally designed family support programs  that are part of the same movement that produced the (Indian Child Welfare  Act). I believe that the (Indian Child Welfare Act) is not only legally  correct, but is also morally correct.  </P> <P> LINDA HOWARD  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

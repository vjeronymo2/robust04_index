			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Frivolity with discipline THE emphasis that Emma Hope puts on discipline makes you wonder whether by nature she is as whimsical as her shoes. But it has probably been her saviour during the recession which has sent so many small businesses to the wall. Having started out with an order for 50 pairs of shoes in 1984, the 29-year-old designer now sells about 7,000 pairs a year and her annual turnover ranges between Pounds 400,000 and Pounds 500,000. To cope with the rapid expansion of her business, she has employed a management consultant who comes in once a month to help her with the accounts and stock control. 'Having someone to come in is a discipline,' Emma says. Increasingly difficult trading conditions have taught her to keep her eye firmly on the business's bank balance. 'I always know how much money is in the bank,' she says. 'After all, if you are not making a profit, you might as well do something else.' The recession has instilled a healthy dose of caution in her. She will not cut an order for shoes until she has received a deposit of 50 per cent of its value, and she spends a large amount of her time getting references about clients and chasing up confirmations on orders. Other precautionary measures include keeping overheads as low as possible, not over-borrowing ('It's terribly easy to get a loan but so difficult to pay it back') and making costings as high as possible. But discipline would be a waste of time if it were not for the desirability of Emma's shoes, for which women and men are willing to pay an average Pounds 120-Pounds 130 a pair. What makes her shoes for women so instantly recognisable are their flattering, elongated line, the sculpted, Elizabethan look, and the attention to detail. In her shop you can see purple velvet, embroidered pumps, paillette-strewn court shoes in red, black and white, and black, high-heeled shoes enlivened with a thick diamente strap across the front. Her shoes for men are carefully welted and look as if they would last forever. Emma has carved a profitable niche for herself in the bridal shoe market. She has created 15 styles - ranging from ivory silk shoes with roses in peach silk to pumps embroidered with pearl beads - which roll over year after year. 'Most women are only brides once, and they are not so conscious of the price,' she explains. She sells about 2,000 pairs of bridal shoes a year. Emma learnt shoe-making at the Cordwainers College in London. She has never had much trouble in drumming up business but she has had 'the most awful disasters' in manufacturing the shoes. Initially, she had to rely on one factory to cut the leather for the shoes, one to sew them, and so on. 'It was all very stressful,' she recalls. Four years ago, though, she found a small factory run by Greeks in the East End of London where the shoes are made by hand. 'The quality is a lot better because they are responsible for the whole product,' Emma says. The downside is that she has to be really organised in getting all the components together - most of them come from Italy - and in chasing up orders. The cost of making a shoe is half labour and half materials. But on top of that are other costs, such as shop staff, which come to about Pounds 45,000 a year. Travelling to and attending trade fairs also is expensive and costs about Pounds 15,000 a year. Emma designs two collections annually which she shows at London's Olympia, Dusseldorf and New York. Wholesale accounts for a large amount of Emma's business. Of her total yearly production, 5,000 pairs are sold that way, half of them exported to the US, Japan, Germany and Scandinavia. Her shoes are stocked by Harrods and small boutiques in London as well as Barneys and Bergdorf Goodman, the New York department stores. Having her own shop has proved invaluable in spite of it being tucked away in a quiet street in Islington, north London. The rent is much lower than fashionable locations such as South Molton Street in the West End, and it has enabled Emma to learn about all aspects of retailing from display to stock control and credit card transactions. 'You also find out what sells and what doesn't,' she says, thanks to the feedback from customers who come to the shop - something she gets rarely from her wholesale clients. She is looking for a partner to finance a shop in central London for which she would supply the shoes. With the factory in the East End running at full capacity, Emma is looking to expand production of women's shoes in Italy. She has embarked on a licencing agreement for men's shoes with a factory in Northampton, under which she will be responsible for design but the factory will produce the shoes under her label and send them straight to clients. Emma also plans to expand into leather goods, a natural progression from shoes. She already has some great ideas for handbags - the sort that you can fit A4 paper into and designed so that pens don't get lost at the bottom - but she will not give away more than that.

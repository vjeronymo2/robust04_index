The first correction concerns the amount of funding available. The total amount listed as available, $14,881,000, is corrected to read $18,481,000. The additional $3.6 million reflects the determination that $2 million to be used for the second year of two-year FY 1993 Private Enforcement Initiative awards, and $1.6 million to be used for the second year of two-year FY 1993 Fair Housing Organizations Initiative awards, will be funded out of FY 1995 funds. This is because the second year of funding is subject to not only the availability of funds, but to an annual performance review. The amounts of funding under these two Initiatives are corrected accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the sequence of eligible activities under the Private Enforcement Initiative is also corrected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the following corrections are made in FR Doc. 94&hyph;11762 to the NOFA titled, ``NOFA for Fair Housing Initiatives Program; FY 1994 Competitive Solicitation'', published on May 16, 1994 (59 FR 25532): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

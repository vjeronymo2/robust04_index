			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VLADIVOSTOK STRUGGLES TO ATTRACT FOREIGN INVESTMENT;  </P> <P> SOVIET FAR EAST: AILING INFRASTRUCTURE IS A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IN EFFORTS TO  MAKE THE REGION AN ECONOMIC BRIDGE LINKING THE SOVIET UNION WITH PACIFIC RIM  NATIONS.  </P> <P> A Japanese television producer, frustrated in his attempts to communicate with  counterparts in the Soviet East Asian capital of Vladivostok, gave two fax  machines to the local television station in July.  </P> <P> It was a nice try, but Hiroshi Kikuchi's gift failed to remedy the situation.  </P> <P> When he returned to Japan, he found telephone lines were so poor he could not  get through to his fax machines.  </P> <P> Serious gaps in services and facilities in the Soviet Far East are a major  stumbling block in efforts to make the region an economic bridge linking the  Soviet Union with the rapidly expanding Pacific Rim nations.  </P> <P> Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev envisioned Vladivostok becoming "our widely  opened window on the East" in a major policy speech in the city in 1986.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has since agreed to open Vladivostok to foreign travelers in 1991.  </P> <P> The city, which serves as home port to the Soviet Pacific Fleet, has been  closed for decades under a cloak of military secrecy.  </P> <P> In preparation for the opening, Vladivostok has invited selected businessmen  for a preview.  </P> <P> Their aim is to encourage foreign firms to locate factories in the area to  process their natural resources -- coal, timber and fish -- rather than just  shipping them off, as is now the case.  </P> <P> "Today the task is not to sell raw materials but to sell manufactured  products," said Victor Tikhomirov, chief of the foreign economic affairs  department for the Primorsky region.  </P> <P> "They have an obsession about value-added processing," said an American  businessman.  </P> <P> Vladivostok hosted more than 400 foreign business delegations in 1989, a  government official said.  </P> <P> Most were Chinese, but several were from America, Japan, South Korea,  Australia, New Zealand and Western Europe.  </P> <P> Hewlett Packard Co. discussed the possibility of building a computer plant,  city officials said. Toyota representatives checked out conditions for  automobile assembly, and Alaska Airlines spoke of a flight from Anchorage to  Vladivostok, they said.  </P> <P> But their interest has not gone beyond the talking stage.  </P> <P> "They say they want people to come but how can you do business without a fax  machine," asked a Japanese businessman after a recent visit to the area.  </P> <P> "Transportation is bad," he continued. "Delivery is a problem. They run out of  materials. Workers quit because they cannot improve their life style no matter  how much they earn."  </P> <P> "They don't have the capital, labor or infrastructure to turn out products,"  said an American executive in the timber industry.  </P> <P> "There is a lot of bureaucracy," he said, adding that uncertainty over whether  the Soviet Union's new openness will continue adds risk to any venture.  </P> <P> Against those odds, it seems unlikely Vladivostok will ever attract heavy  foreign investment.  </P> <P> But the city's leaders have launched a sincere drive to do just that.  </P> <P> "We are working at those problems now," said Valery Lozovoy, who heads up the  city's foreign trade initiative. "We know we cannot improve international  contacts without improving our infrastructure."  </P> <P> Their first task, they believe, is to win more economic freedom from Moscow.  </P> <P> The Soviet East Asians have grown tired of watching their vast stock of  resources being sold off and the profits shipped to Moscow.  </P> <P> They want the central government to back off and let them plow the profits from  foreign and domestic sales into their sorely lacking infrastructure.  </P> <P> "Only 1.5% of the profits from the export of timber have been returned to the  region," said Igor Sukhachev, head of the regional ministry of external  relations.  </P> <P> On average, only about 20% of the profits are returned to the region, but  Moscow has recently agreed to increase that figure to between 30% and 80%,  Sukhachev said.  </P> <P> The city leaders have begun studying ways to rebuild the airport and  communications systems, two areas in desperate need of new funds.  </P> <P> Fifty miles east of Vladivostok, a free economic zone is set to open in 1990 at  the deep sea port of Nadhodka.  </P> <P> Special tax incentives will be extended to foreign companies.  </P> <P> But again, lack of services, bureaucratic interference and a problematic work  force raise serious doubts about the success of the venture.  </P></p>

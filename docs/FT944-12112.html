			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Japanese poll reform bill moves on The final stage in Japan's dramatic five-year campaign to purge political corruption and weaken party factions' grip on power quietly cleared the lower house of parliament yesterday. The house endorsed, with most parties' assent, a bill to redraw the boundaries of Japan's multi-seat constituencies, to create a mixed system of UK-style single-seat districts and continental European-style proportional representation. It brings an unobtrusive climax to the most drastic changes to Japan's political system since the present constitution came into effect in 1947. After approval by the upper house around the middle of this month, all but automatic, Japan's new electoral system will take effect in mid-December, after a statutory one-month delay for the electorate to digest the changes. This completes a complex package of political reforms, designed to make governments more responsive to the electorate's aspirations and less dependent on the special interest groups that support the so-called 'iron triangle' of business, politics and bureaucracy. The political sacrifices required to make progress on the plans have cost the life of four governments since the project got off the ground in 1989, and introduced a new element of open confrontation into the previously cosy political consensus. The new system will force politicians to compete harder for seats and so end the comfortable careers of dozens of older members of parliament, who fought against reform because their former constituencies will cease to exist. Reform was mooted to counter public disgust at the political class, following the Recruit shares-for-favours scandal in the late 1980s. The main part of the reform package passed parliament in March. It consists of four bills to establish the new electoral system, ban business donations to individual politicians, establish a Y30.9bn (Pounds 195m) annual state subsidy for political parties to compensate for the curb on funding, and set new campaign rules. Objections by the conservative Liberal Democratic party, then in opposition, forced the government to water down the more radical original version of the package. After last March's agreement on the bulk of the reform package, it remained for an independent panel to draw up the new constituencies, accepted by the lower house yesterday. Two other final reform bills were also agreed yesterday, to invalidate the election victories of candidates jailed for buying votes and to set legal qualifications to become a political party. The LDP's return to power four months ago gave it full scope to ensure that its own softer version of political reform got through parliament. While this guaranteed smooth passage for reform yesterday, the outcome poses a subtle rather than radical threat to the political faction system at the foundation of old-style Japanese politics. Some political analysts argue that the tougher competition needed to win parliamentary seats might, perversely, strengthen political factions' power.</p>

PLO Executive Committee Member Samir Ghawshah told a MENA  correspondent in Tunis that at its meeting last night, the  Palestinian leadership also requested an urgent Arab League  meeting to discuss the massacre and take the necessary measures.  The PLO asked its Arab League representative to present the  request.    The PLO will also follow up efforts to convene an urgent UN  Security Council meeting to adopt a positive stance on the  events.    Ghawshah said the Palestinian leadership had decided to call  the PLO Executive Committee into a full urgent meeting in Tunis  to follow developments.    On the Palestinian leadership's position on U.S. President  Bill Clinton's invitation for the PLO and Israel to send  delegations to Washington to hold prompt talks to advance the  peace process, Dr. Samir Ghawshah said the Palestinian  leadership has not yet determined its position on the  invitation. He added: The purpose of the talks, the level of  attendance, and the date must be known. So far, the PLO has  received no details about the call.    Dr. Ghawshah denied reports that President Clinton had  invited 'Arafat for a meeting with Rabin in Washington.    He said the Palestinian leadership will follow the results  of  the massacre on all levels, especially the developments in the  occupied territories.    He added: We are awaiting the decisions Israel is going to  make regarding the massacre, and we will determine our position  accordingly. We want to know whether Rabin wants to achieve  peace and security or to keep the territory and sponsor the  settlers.    Ghawshah said the recall of the Palestinian negotiators is  in  preparation for the adoption of a clear position on the  negotiations--suspending them, withdrawing from them, or  boycotting them.    He said the situation is very serious in the occupied  territories. We are discussing all aspects of the issue and  will make the decision that preserves our people, he said.    Ghawshah stressed that the peace process is in a crisis  after  the massacre, which showed the world that it is the  Palestinians, not the Israeli settlers, who need security.</p>

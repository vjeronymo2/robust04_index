			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Midlands tram contract awarded CENTRAM, a company formed by construction group Taylor Woodrow and rail equipment maker Ansaldo Trasporti of Naples, was yesterday chosen by the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority to build and operate the first line of a local tram system, Paul Cheeseright writes. Centram will pay Pounds 10m towards the building costs and will receive a franchise to operate the regional light rail rapid transit system without subsidy for 20 years. The capital cost of the project at April prices is Pounds 112m, leaving Centram and Centro, the operating arm of the passenger transport authority, to find Pounds 102m before construction starts. The total cost, including land purchase and an allowance for inflation during the projected three-year construction period, is Pounds 135m. Midland Metro will run 20km from central Birmingham, via West Bromwich and Bilston, to Wolverhampton, using mainly existing railway trackbeds. Only in Wolverhampton will the line run along the street. Centro hopes construction will start in 1994-95. 'The only impediment to it going forward is finding a slot in government spending plans,' said Mr Bob Tarr, its director- general. By selecting a private sector partner, Centro hopes to take advantage of the government's readiness, expressed in the Autumn Statement, to look favourably on private-sector or public-sector plans for infrastructure developments. It needs Pounds 50m from the Department of Transport. At present the government's budget of about Pounds 50m a year for regional light rail projects is being spent in Sheffield. The west Midlands project is said to be the next in line. The balance would come from local authority borrowing, once the government is prepared to give credit approvals, and from the EC.</p>

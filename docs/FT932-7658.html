			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / BCCI auditor probe halted THE HIGH COURT yesterday granted Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, the chance to delay an investigation into its role as auditor to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International by the profession's highest disciplinary body, Andrew Jack writes. Mr Justice Tuckey granted the firm leave for judicial review at a two-day hearing in July to determine whether it could delay an inquiry by the Joint Disciplinary Scheme of three of the UK's leading accountancy bodies. The JDS maintains that it has a duty in the public interest to examine the role of the firm in the circumstances surrounding the collapse of BCCI. But Price Waterhouse said any proceedings from the inquiry would be subject to discovery and could prejudice the outcome of writs against the firm by the liquidators to BCCI for more than Dollars 8bn. It also disclosed for the first time that the joint monitoring unit which regulates auditors in chartered accountancy firms had inspected PW with an extended remit to consider its role as auditor to BCCI. It has not had its right to conduct bank audits rebuked as a result.</p>

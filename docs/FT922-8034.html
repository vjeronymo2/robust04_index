			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Management: Breaking the taxman's code - Virginia Rounding went through the hoops in an attempt to become a top civil servant. She found that her Renaissance concepts were not enough Number 24 Whitehall has a daunting look about it. It is the home of the Civil Service Selection Board and the place where Britain's high-flying civil servants are chosen. I recently went there for a two-day programme of tests and interviews - in the hope of joining Her Majesty's Tax Inspectors. Inside everything is painted an institutional dark green and most of the rooms are empty. The first test is to find the third floor common room - not easy as the door is closed and displays an arrow pointing somewhere else. Inside, two rows of armchairs face each other and are gradually filled by nervous-looking applicants. Most look like recent graduates, in their first suits, and there is only one other woman. No one speaks. At 9am, the CSSB administrator arrives with a silent colleague who hands out badges displaying our names and numbers as well as a clip-on lunch pass. We are led off for our first assignment. This is called 'Biographical Information'. After filling in our CSSB number, we have 35 minutes to write about our leisure pursuits, important memories, our regrets, and experiences that have marked us. We have to describe ourselves as both our best friend and worst enemy might see us. There is also the usual Civil Service interest in parental places of birth, ages at death and so on. At this point we are told about the competition. There are 15 vacancies this year; there were more than 2,000 applications and we are now in the last 75 to 100. Next we have coffee and rather nice biscuits while we meet our assessors - the chairman, an 'observer' and a psychologist. We are put in groups of four and sit round an oblong table, while the three assessors look on silently. The observer selects a topic - 'Should boxing be banned?' - and we discuss it while the assessors take notes, their faces betraying nothing. Without warning, the observer changes the subject: 'Will universal peace ever be attained?' Ten minutes later we are sent back to the test room. Each candidate is given a dossier entitled 'Sink or Swim'. The problem is centred on a fictional shipyard - Hopper Ltd which is experiencing problems. Three options are available: to let Hopper go bust and buy from the US the Navy supply vessels that it makes; to save the yard with an injection of public funds; or to let a Far Eastern company buy it. Candidates have two hours to write an analysis and recommendation for 'our minister'. This takes us up to lunch, when most of us decide to avoid the subsidised restaurant - wisely, we gather from those who do try it. The afternoon begins with the first of the 'cognitive' tests. Rather like Mensa intelligence tests, these are supposed to introduce an objective element and have to be completed at great speed. Next, we write a letter on behalf of our 'minister' giving a diplomatic response to somebody who has been laid off at the shipyard. My last assignment of the day is an interview with the psychologist. She is friendly, but I leave with the impression that she finds me odd. There is no-one in the common room, so I remove my badges and go home. The next day is a similar mixture of tests, group work and interviews; by now there is a certain camaraderie among the candidates. The first part of the morning is taken up by an exercise in which we each chair a 15 minute meeting. In the first session, we pretend to be embassy staff at an emergency meeting called by the British Ambassador to Batrakia. The prime minister is arriving tomorrow, but British sailors have been disgracing themselves and are now in jail. Local and British journalists are writing inflammatory copy. Our job is to tell the PM whether to come. Next we weigh the pros and cons of spending Pounds 50,000 on a park for the disabled rather than a sculpture called 'The Hulk', and discuss the merits of a football stadium on the site of the defunct Hopper's Shipyard. The assessors remain impassive. Today's cognitive tests are horrible, especially the one where you have to fill in the missing domino in what look like increasingly random patterns. But the young man next to me finishes early and sits ostentatiously creaking his shoes. There remain the interviews with the observer and the chairman. With the observer, a civil servant from another department, I discuss creeping privatisation in the NHS and the merits of the National Curriculum. The chairman, a retired tax inspector, seems in reflective mood and we end the day discussing the Renaissance concepts of decoro, sprezzatura and grazia. And that's the last I hear from CSSB - until a week later when I receive a two-line letter saying I have not been selected for appointment as HM Inspector of Taxes. Oh well, I never did like playing dominoes much. The author has returned to her job as an administrator of The Consort of Musicke, an early music group.</p>

Contrary to those quoted in  your articles, Stevens hasn't changed from a kind man into a barbarian.  Non-Muslims do not appreciate a Muslim's jealousy for his faith in the face of  such vicious attacks as Rushdie's novel.  </P> <P> No, Yousuf Islam is not some evil caricature of his former self. He is the same  thoughtful man who has sought after truth and has committed himself to what he  believes in.  </P> <P> MICHAEL NOVIKOFF  </P> <P> Desert Hot Springs  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER ROAD HAZARD  </P> <P> The article on March 30 encouraging your readers not to ignore traffic  citations was well intended, I am sure, but failed to address a problem that my  experience suggests may be quite serious ("Avoiding Jam: Act Fast on Traffic  Tickets" by Lynn Simross). A few months ago I received notification that I had  illegally parked in San Francisco and was ordered to pay the appropriate fine.  This notwithstanding the fact that I had not been to San Francisco for some  years and on the day of the alleged offense my car was at least 500 miles away  from the site.  </P> <P> I called the court of jurisdiction and was informed that such errors were  frequently made and that the record would be corrected.  </P> <P> I still have not received such confirmation.  </P> <P> My concern was triggered by the experience of my stepdaughter who by mail  received a similar citation from the City of Oakland, a city she has never had  the pleasure of visiting and on a day when she and her automobile were both  here in Southern California. She attempted to correct the error by mail and  after receiving no reply to numerous letters she assumed the matter was over.  </P> <P> Much to her surprise when she attempted to register her automobile she was told  she had outstanding warrants and would be unable to do so until the fines and  additional penalties were paid. After pursuing it as far as she could without  incurring further expense and inconvenience, she finally gave in and paid the  total amount in order to register her vehicle.  </P> <P> In the course of my phone calls to San Francisco, I was told that 5,000 to  10,000 parking citations are issued daily and that approximately 1,000 to 1,500  of them are manifest in error. No mention was made of efforts to correct these  errors on the part of the authorities and my questions about that were left  unanswered. One wonders how many thousands of dollars are being extracted from  innocent motorists who lack the time or knowledge to seek justice. The lack of  concern about my inquiries makes me wonder if these citations are truly errors  or perhaps part of a scam perpetrated by people in the court offices or by the  cities themselves who know that correction of these erroneous tickets will not  be pursued.  </P> <P> PATRICIA S.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 7 June (MTI) -- The Hungarian Foreign  Ministry follows with sympathy the efforts of the Slovak  politicians who take a genuine stand for fulfilling the norms  accepted at the time of their country's membership in the  Council of Europe, spokesman for the Hungarian Foreign Ministry  Janos Herman said today. Herman made the comment at his usual  Tuesday [7 June] press briefing in answer to a question on how  Hungary received the fiasco of the so-called "sign bill" in  Bratislava's parliament. The bill would have made it possible  to use road and village signs in the Hungarian language.    Herman stressed that Budapest is highly appreciative of the  fact that Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik indicated his  government's intention to re-submit the bill on the use of  Hungarian signs to Parliament as soon as this becomes possible  under the Slovak constitutional framework.    Herman also said the text of the Hungarian-Slovak  deportation  agreement has, in effect, been completed, and now only requires  an agreement on the date for signing it.</p>

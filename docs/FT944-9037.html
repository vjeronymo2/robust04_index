			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Government to take advantage of thin legislative programme The government is to take advantage of its relatively thin legislative programme to introduce several uncontroversial but overdue measures of law reform, Robert Rice writes. It hopes to make use of a new parliamentary procedure for uncontroversial law reform known as the 'Jellicoe procedure' to bring in five bills based on reports by the Law Commission, the government's law reform body. The procedure, named after the Lords select committee which recommended it, was used earlier this year to pass the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1994. It involves the use in the Lords of a special public bill committee which has powers to receive evidence on a bill from interested parties before considering it clause by clause, so speeding its passage. The government's recent record on implementing reforms recommended by the commission is poor. More than half the 40-plus reports produced by the commission since 1984 remain under consideration or have not been implemented. Among the five bills is a private international law bill which would modify and clarify the rules on the payment in England and Wales of interest on judgment debts and arbitration awards which are expressed in foreign currency, and the rules by which UK courts decide which country's laws should apply in a civil negligence cases with a foreign element. There will also be a civil evidence bill to abolish the hearsay rule, which prevents witnesses giving evidence second-hand in civil trials. The rule frequently results in increased costs and delays and can result in relevant evidence being excluded altogether where witnesses cannot attend court. The other bills will reform domestic violence laws and aspects of the law on wills.</p>

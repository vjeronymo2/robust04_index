Turnover totalled Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 5.73m). Earnings emerged at 2.9p (2.2p) and the interim dividend is a same-again 1.2p. In the opening quarter of 1994, the company experienced a collapse in retail demand for clothing produced by its UK customers, resulting in a 'significantly lower' volume of turnover.

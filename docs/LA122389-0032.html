			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERE'S A FUND WAY TO SUPPLEMENT NFL DRAFT  </P> <P> Regarding the issue of NFL teams drafting underclassmen and the potential  damage to marginal players, how is this for a solution:  </P> <P> Any NFL team signing a player with eligibility remaining should be required to  fund a $100,000 trust fund for the player. Such fund could be used only for the  athlete's continuing college education.  </P> <P> The effect is to protect the athlete's opportunity to get a college education  and also to raise the stakes for teams that draft underclassmen.  </P> <P> JEFF YOUNG, Los Angeles  </P></p>

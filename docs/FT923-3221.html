			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (13): 'No one owes us a living' - Sir Anerood Jugnauth, the prime minister, is interviewed by Michael Holman Question: Where will the impetus for growth in the 1990s come from? Answer: The economy is now in a new phase of its industrialisation process, characterised mainly by diversification into capital and technology intensive manufacturing. Diversification will broaden our production base and reduce our dependence on sugar, textiles and tourism. Capital and technology, along with the production of up-market goods and services will raise our productivity. More impetus for growth will come from the financial services sector. In fact, this sector is poised to become the fourth pillar of our economy. The offshore business centre and the freeport will help growth and lead us on the path to become a newly indus-trialised country. Q: Are you disappointed at the pace of diversification in the export processing zone (EPZ)? A: I would certainly prefer things to move faster. The world recession has slowed down investment, but I am confident that as the international economic situation improves, there will be growing demand for products such as electronics and jewellery, in which we are diversifying. Q: How serious a constraint is the skills shortage? A: In the short term it is not a serious problem, since we allow firms to contract expatriate workers. For the long term, we are investing massively in training. Q: How will you cope with the changing international trade environment? A: Insofar as sugar is concerned, the European Community sugar protocol for ACP members will hold for an indefinite period. However, as regards the Multifibre Agreement, Mauritius presently enjoys preferential access to EC markets, which may not be the case if the MFA is not upheld. But we are already preparing ourselves for tougher competition. No one owes us a living. Diversification, modernisation, quality improvement, productivity - focus on these areas will help us maintain our competitive edge. Q: Is enough being done to protect the environment? A: We are doing the maximum we can. Our approach is very much related to sensitising our population through school and public campaigns, and since the publication in 1988 of a national action plan, government is proceeding with 32 projects covering all aspects of the environment. Q: Can Mauritius afford its 'welfare state' facilities - free education, free health services, social security benefits, subsidised basic foods? A: To tell you the truth, I am worried. I have warned that we cannot go subsidising food for everybody. I even say for certain types of medical care, people who can afford to pay should be made to pay. I and my colleagues are going to study these things very carefully, and a committee is being set up . . . it just cannot go on like this. Q: Are you closer to a solution for Diego Garcia (the coral atoll forming part of the British Indian Ocean Territory, serving as a US military base, claimed by Mauritius)? A: I sincerely hope so. I have received a letter dated July 1 from the British government which opens the way for further discussions. I am satisfied the grounds have been cleared for a mutually satisfactory solution. Q: Does Mauritius provide any lessons for Africa? A: Two factors in particular have contributed to our success, and which I believe are prerequisites for successful development anywhere: political stability in a democratic context, and heavy investment in human resources.</p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Bank of Scotland Bank of Scotland has a number of excuses for the jump in its second half provisions. Those at its Bank of Wales and Countrywide subsidiaries were a one-off adjustment. With luck the larger hits, like that for Isosceles, will not be repeated, so provisions should fall this year. But there remains the nagging doubt that the latest figures also reflect the quality of the bank's loan book. If so, the decline could be marginal, especially given Bank of Scotland's relatively low provisions earlier in the recession. This matters because the bank needs retained earnings to underwrite growth at the operating level. Second half operating profit rose 46 per cent on the same period of 1991-92. That was thanks partly to a reduction in the underlying growth rate of costs but it also reflects higher lending, particularly on mortgages. At 5.8 per cent the tier 1 capital has reached the point where assets cannot grow unchecked. The shares have under-performed the sector by 10 per cent since last September. Until the trend on provisions is clearer, it is too early to bet on Bank of Scotland recovering its premium rating.</p>

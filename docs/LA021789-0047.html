			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITE HOUSE BOWS TO PLEAS; EPA TO BE PUT ON OFFSHORE OIL PANEL  </P> <P> The White House, responding to pleas from environmentalists and dissent within  the Administration, is planning to include the Environmental Protection Agency  in a task force deliberating the future of offshore drilling, officials said  Thursday.  </P> <P> The move will reverse an earlier decision to exclude the EPA from the panel,  which is to be headed by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and will include  top-level representatives from the National Academy of Sciences and the  Department of Energy.  </P> <P> That exclusion had sparked an outcry from drilling opponents, who saw EPA as  their ally in efforts to halt drilling for environmental reasons, and from  agency officials anxious to regain a central role in environmental policy.  </P> <P> No formal decision to invite EPA to join the task force has yet been taken, a  senior Administration official said Thursday night. But he said that Bush aides  now have "no objections" to including its representatives on the drilling task  force.  </P> <P> An Interior Department source, meanwhile, said that he already had been  informed that the EPA would be invited to play a key role in the task force's  discussions.  </P> <P> Officials described the turnabout as a victory for new EPA Administrator  William K. Reilly, whose assertive style is making aides to Interior Secretary  Lujan increasingly edgy.  </P> <P> Already senior advisers to Lujan have met to discuss the prospect that the EPA  chief, though not a member of Bush's Cabinet, might become the dominant force  within the Administration on environmental and conservation issues.  </P> <P> The special drilling task force was formed last week by President Bush, who  called for delays in plans for drilling off the Southern and Northern  California coasts until the panel made decisions based on an attempt to balance  environmental and energy needs. The task force faces a deadline of Jan. 1,  1990.  </P> <P> Among the most vocal critics of EPA's exclusion from the group was Sen. Pete  Wilson (R-Calif.), who on Wednesday sent Bush a letter urging that the panel be  broadened to include the agency.  </P></p>

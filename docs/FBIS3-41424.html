Dr. Panya Sonkhom, the Director of the Department of Medical  Sciences of the Ministry of Public Health, said that 116 water  samples had been taken from the waterways which pass by the  various factories in the Maptaphut and Laemchabang Industrial  Estates and flow close to populated areas. The samples had been  taken each month for 14 months [sic] from March 1991 to February  1992. They were analyzed for toxic chemicals which would be  dangerous to the health of the people in these watersheds. The  analysis did not find any PCB's in any of the samples, but lead  was found in 37 of the samples or 31.7 percent, and mercury was  found in 19 of the samples or 16.4 percent.    Dr. Panya said that among the samples in which lead and  mercury were found, there were samples which exceeded the  standard for the maximum level allowed for waste water, namely,  there was one sample with lead over 20 micrograms per deciliter,  and there was one sample with mercury over 0.5 micrograms per  liter. Even though this survey did not find any PCB's, a cancer  causing substance, and found lead and mercury which exceeded the  standards set in only one sample each, nevertheless the  department would continue to check for toxic chemicals in the  environment, and it had requested assistance on a continuing  basis from other units involved to help keep track of  environmental pollution in order to support the development of  the eastern seaboard and to avoid health hazards for the people  in this area in the future.</p>

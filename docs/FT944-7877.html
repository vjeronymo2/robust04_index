			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US clears tested Australian beef - Contracts &amp; ventures The US yesterday agreed to release for sale Australian beef exported after October 25 but said it required further testing of beef exported before that date because of possible contamination from a chemical used in the growing of cotton. Recent decisions by the US and Japan to ban temporarily the sale of Australian beef have clouded the industry, which earns around ADollars 3bn of overseas revenue annually, making it the nation's third largest export sector. The Cattle Council of Australia, representing Australian cattle farmers, expressed relief that the US had agreed to accept the testing procedures which Australia now has in place. Samples of beef exported to the US before October 25 and still in the export pipeline are due to be returned to Australia where the tests will be conducted later this week. Despite progress on the US front, Australia has yet to allay Japanese concerns. Moreover, a number of smaller buyers of Australian beef - including Canada, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico - are understood to have joined the temporary ban. According to federal officials, more than 12,000 tonnes of Australian beef is being held at storage or customs facilities in these countries, while around 30,000 tonnes is in the Japanese pipeline.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (17): Dream motorways take shape - Roads Poland, a flat country at the centre of Europe, is a road builder's dream. As traffic density builds up and the importance of transit traffic grows, an ambitious toll motorway building programme costing over Dollars 6bn and stretching until 2007 is taking shape. Mr Boguslaw Liberadzki, the transport minister, argues that the financial burden of the programme cannot be carried by the state. Nor should the state operate the 2,600km of the north-south and east-west motorways he wants built over the next 15 years. 'I don't believe that a state-owned enterprise will do this in the most efficient and profitable way possible,' he emphasises. 'Nor do I think that the state should take on new debt burdens to finance the programme - it has enough on its plate as it is,' he adds referring to Poland's heavy existing foreign debt. His words would not raise eyebrows if coming from a minister in Poland's previous free-market liberal governments. But Mr Liberadzki is a member of the centre-left government elected in last autumn and his words reflect the market-orientated pragmatism of the new generation of social democratic politicians even though their origins trace back to the communist years. In another break with the past, Mr Liberadzki is also determined that the new Motorway Agency, which will oversee the road building programme and operate the routes, will 'above all be staffed by qualified financiers and lawyers rather than by engineers'. The state will oversee the new agency, and be reposnible for procuring the land requird. Land purchase alone is expected to cost 1,500bn zlotys a year for the next two decades, and amount to around 15 per cent of the cost of the entire programme. The agency will also be responsible for ensuring that the motorways, once operational, are kept in good repair. But the engineers will be 'on tap, not on top' as they were in the socialist period. Mr Stefan Kirk, of Morgan Grenfell which helped finan ce Hungary's M1 motorway linking Budapest with the Austrian frontier, underlines that 'expert advice is of particular importance in view of the financial complexity of these projects'. Each new road will need 'reliable and adequate traffic projections' before proceeding, he adds. Mr Liberadzki agrees that Poland needs in-depth market studies to analyse the surroundings of the routes up to 50km on either side and to look for ways of channelling maximum traffic on to the tollways. He still has time for the studies as the draft law governing the road building and operating programme is still at the consultation stage between government departments. It is expected to be approved by parliament later this year. Only then will the main routes be put out to tender by the Motorway Agency to consortia capable of offering construction, capacity financing and operating ability. Mr Liberadzki says Dollars 500m should suffice to build between 150km and 170km of motorway in the first stage of the 138,000bn zloty (Dollars 6.2bn) programme. The focus at present is concentrated on raising private funding. There is little sign of more substantial funds coming from the European Union, in spite of grandiose plans for trans-European networks, including a Berlin to Moscow road link, unveiled last December by Mr Jacques Delors. The four main routes planned include the 626km east-west motorway linking Terespol on the eastern frontier to Warsaw and on across the western border to Berlin, and the 502km link between Gdansk on the Baltic with the southern border. Another 482 km east-west link is planned in the south between Medyka and Germany. The most controversial project is a 365km motorway which would link Scandinavia via the port of Szczecin to the Czech frontier and on to southern Europe. The latter roadway was added to the programme last December. The previous government's programme, accepted in the summer, only contained the first three routes. But Scandinavian interest in acquiring fast access to central and southern Europe through Poland is high and traffic in the western territories is growing fast. At the same time a new high capacity road would help to relieve the pressure on the German autobahns on the other side of the Oder-Neisse rivers which mark the border.</p>

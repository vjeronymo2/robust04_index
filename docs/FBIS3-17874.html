			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 30 TASS -- A special commission is  being set up to work out a mechanism for implementing the  agreement on civil accord in Russia. The commission will  consist of representatives of the Russian president, government,  both chambers of the parliament, State Duma factions, as well as  public and cultural figures, according to Federation Council  speaker Vladimir Shumeyko.    The draft agreement says "civil accord should be perceived  as  a process to involve all forces of society, which support the  principles laid in the agreement". Concrete issues are to be  elaborated at round-table discussions and by ad-hoc work groups,  the speaker told reporters on Wednesday.    Shumeyko stressed that the agreement should be implemented  only in full compliance with the Russian Constitution and laws.  The Conciliation Commission will be empowered to examine and  make public cases of agreement violations by any side, and even  to demand that the given side be excluded from the signatories.    The upper house speaker views the agreement on civil accord  in Russia as a document of paramount political and social  importance. But he warned against regarding this document as "a  substition of the existing Constitution".    Shumeyko told reporters that the agreement had been put on  the agenda of the Federation Council's session scheduled to open  next week. He called to speed up work on the text, because "if  we try to bring it to perfection, it may never see the light of  the day", the speaker emphasised. He believes that the text of  the draft agreement should be distributed among upper house  deputies. If they agree to it, they may instruct the Federation  Council speaker to take part in its filalizing in coordination  with other structures. A similar procedure should take place in  the parliament's lower house, as well as in all parties and  movements, Shumeyko said.</p>

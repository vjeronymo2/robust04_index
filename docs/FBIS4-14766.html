			<p>BFN     [Text] On Saturday the Working Moscow movement declared  that President Yeltsin's proposals for accord and civic peace  were a propagandistic piece of demagoguery and that the  president made a new attempt to disorient the people.    The statement by the Working Moscow was delivered to  Interfax. It says civic peace will be unattainable in Russia  without the restoration of Soviet power.    The Working Moscow was willing to join efforts to draw up an  agreement for civic peace but different classes and social  groups could reach accord only if they obeyed the provisions of  constitutional law.    In the Working Moscow's view, what Yeltsin said contradicted  his own constitution.    The Working Moscow quotes several provisions of  constitutional law violated by Yeltsin. First and foremost,  Yeltsin violated the national constitution last fall by signing  Decree 1400 which did away with Soviet rule and provoked many  civilian casualties.</p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: AGB market research sale reported to OFT A GROUP of food and packaged goods companies has complained to the Office of Fair Trading about the possible sale of AGB Research - the private Maxwell market research group - to its rival AC Nielsen of the US. Mr Murdoch McKillop, the Arthur Andersen administrator, is in the process of finalising the AGB sale. The deadline for bids for various parts of the AGB business was Friday, and he hopes to announce the purchasers later this week. The most important of the AGB businesses include the continuing market research panels on grocery and food sales. The company also produces figures for research into television ratings. The bidders include Nielsen, the Dun &amp; Bradstreet market research subsidiary. Companies including Kraft Foods, Nestle, and Unilever, have complained to Sir Gordon Borrie, the director general of Fair Trading, arguing that a Nielsen takeover would amount to the creation of a monopoly in large consumer panel research in the UK. AGB operates Superpanel, a family panel 8,500 strong which records all food and packaged goods purchases on a weekly basis. The families in the panel have barcode scanners in their homes and produce a very accurate record of purchases. Nielsen operates a rival 7,000 strong panel called Home Scan. Mr Paul Freeman of Kraft General Foods, chairman of the Superpanel Users Group, has written to Sir Gordon pointing out that a takeover of AGB by Nielsen would give the company an effective monopoly of continuous panel research in the UK. Mr Freeman has asked the OFT to determine whether this would be in the public interest. The OFT has said that when it has official confirmation of a Nielsen bid for AGB it will look into the issue as an apparent concentration of market power. The Superpanel Users Group also surveyed its members and every company asked  -virtually all of Britain's leading food and packaged goods companies - said it was not happy with a Nielsen takeover. Copies of all Mr Freeman's letters to the OFT have been sent to Mr McKillop and other potential purchasers such as GFK of Germany. Because AGB has joint ventures on continuous research in other European countries such as France, Spain and Germany Mr Freeman argues that there are also European Community competition implications in any possible Nielsen takeover. The administrator, whose job is to realise the maximum from the assets of AGB, now faces a difficult dilemma: if Nielsen has made the highest bid, does he accept even though such a decision could lead to an OFT investigation? Nielsen declined to say yesterday whether or not it had bid for AGB, but argued that the two companies accounted for no more than 20 per cent of the market research business in the UK. AGB is also responsible for providing the raw material for the BARB television viewing figures - a contract Nielsen would also like to win.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDENT LOANS  </P> <P> Regarding your editorial "Stemming Student Loan Defaults" (April 7), please let  us encourage responsibility. When a student takes out a loan to help with his  college education, he is making a commitment and a pledge to repay that loan!  Go after the $2 billion in loans that are not being paid back!  </P> <P> Again, the "good guy" who is being responsible and pays his or her bills  doesn't get any encouragement, but we're just supposed to find all kinds of  excuses for acts of irresponsibility. We must restore values and promote  responsibility or this generation of beautiful young people is doomed. Let us  wake up before it is too late!  </P> <P> HELEN LESKO ROGERS  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: True to form - Directors' transactions Directors can, from time to time, prove rather predictable and this week's dealing is an example. Elliot Bernerd's property group, Chelsfield, came to the market in December last year and, with the exception of a dip at the end of March, has held up well. Michael Broke, deputy chairman, has sold 250,000 shares at 170p, which more than halves his holding. Shares in Titon Holdings, the specialist building materials company, have been climbing steadily over the past three years. Many directors were buying shares at around 66p in June and July of 1991 at a time when these were, largely, friendless. Since then, there have been obvious temptations to take profits, and few directors have been unable to resist. The latest sales, at 215p, were executed by Alan Goodman and Alan Mellenchip. After Goodman's sale of 150,000 shares, he is left with just 113,000, while Mellenchip has cut his holding to 256,000. Consensus and earnings forecasts for the year to September 1994 suggest a prospective p/e of 15 this year, falling to 14 in 1995. Far Eastern stock markets have tumbled faster than their western counterparts and, inevitably, this has taken a toll on Standard Chartered. John McFarlane has spent the past three months buying shares, his latest purchase of 45,000 at 228p adding to the 100,000 he bought a week previously at 271p. Consensus dividend forecasts for the year to December 1994 put Standard Chartered on a prospective dividend yield of 4.3 per cent, rising to 5 per cent the year after.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          No of Company                   Sector      Shares   Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Chelsfield                Prop       250,000     425       1 English China Clays       ExIn        21,068      93       1* ISA International         Dist       613,359     785       4(2*) MacFarlane                PP&amp;P       200,000     460       1 Mid Wynd Inv.

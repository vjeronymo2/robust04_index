			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Political Editor Mary Binks] </F>   [Text] When China's most senior official in charge of Hong  Kong affairs, Lu Ping arrives in the territory this afternoon it  won't be to the fanfare of a people straining to return to the  fold of the mother country. Rather, the reception of Mr Lu may  well be akin to the Zen concept of "the sound of one hand  clapping". The wish to applaud the visit will be tempered by  the uncertainties of the transition of rule and the realisation  that the bitterness which has fuelled those uncertainties is as  entrenched as ever.    Mr Lu's refusal to meet Governor Chris Patten is one of the  clearest signs yet that the fallout over political reform is  hindering cooperation on other transitional issues as much as it  ever did. Until now, both sides have at least attempted to  bridge the gulf with rhetoric.    China believes that Mr Patten breached key understandings  between the two countries by unilaterally embarking on  constitutional reform. But Mr Patten hasn't acted alone. And  what China doesn't seem to realise is that by attempting to  isolate the Governor it risks isolating the people of Hong Kong  by exacerbating their uncertainties and alienating their  sympathies.    As much as China may want to, it will be impossible to  undermine Chris Patten's influence on Hong Kong matters in the  run up to 1997. Rather, in this case in particular, the Chinese  leadership has allowed Mr Patten to launch a counter-offensive  against Mr Lu's rejection of his invitation. The Governor has  scored some points in suggesting that the Chinese side has not  been prepared to put aside injured national pride for the sake  of discussing the concerns of Hong Kong people in the transition  period.    The civil service is jittery over whether there'll be  sufficient seats on the through-train straddling 1997. There is  no through- train for the three tiers of government, and China's  economic problems coupled with its crackdown on dissidents has  caused widespread unease.    Mr Lu will, of course, have extensive and thorough  discussions with China's 200 or so advisers in Hong Kong,  community think-tanks and business leaders over the course of  this week. But the advice he receives may not differ much from  that which has been channelled through the regular Hong  Kong-China conduits of the National People's Congress and the  Beijing-appointed Preliminary Working Committee (PWC).    The meetings of the PWC--for the first time in the territory  this week--will no doubt show the people of Hong Kong that  Beijing is perfectly capable of looking after their interests  despite its strained relations with Britain. That may be cold  comfort for the majority of people who are not deluded into  thinking that China indulges in grassroots decision-making. The  PWC isn't seen as a power broker in Beijing and the plethora of  Hong Kong advisers has little more influence. The real  decisions are made within the upper echelons of the Chinese  leadership. Everyone knows that.    What the Hong Kong people want to see is some semblance of  cooperation between the two sovereign states as the only sure  way to minimise uncertainty and instability in the run up to  1997. How much clout did Mr Lu have in deciding whether to  accept the Governor's invitation to meet anyway? Surely a  decision to meet would not depend entirely on Mr Lu but on the  approval of more senior Chinese leaders.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: A tax on the markets Mr Lamont may have thought he was pleasing voters by refraining from any net tax increases, but his budget does little for financial markets. There has been no interest rate cut; at Pounds 50bn next year's PSBR is considerably larger than expected; and changes to the ACT regime - of which more below - cast a shadow over the equity market. Perhaps the chancellor decided that by making equities less attractive to institutions, he would encourage them to buy gilts. That remains to be seen. What is clear is that, on the basis of yesterday's figures, PSBR problems will dog the recovery for years to come. The deficit will still be Pounds 30bn in 1997-98. The risk in raising additional revenue in 1993-94 was always that of hitting confidence in the early stages of recovery. But knowing that the pain is simply deferred will do little for consumer spending. Despite unpopular planned measures such as extending VAT to domestic fuel and increased national insurance rates, the PSBR trend may force the government into swingeing spending cuts in November. The nagging worry is whether it would then have the courage to act. Yesterday's effort again betrays the anxieties of a government afraid to court unpopularity while it has a small majority. It will not do much for the gilts market. Mr Lamont conceded the relaxation of the funding rule, but offered no extra retail incentives nor the steeper yield curve which would encourage banks to buy. The authorities might hope to engineer that with another cut in base rates, but that could be hard to square with concern over the exchange rate, especially since, despite Mr Lamont's insouciance, a large current deficit cannot be financed indefinitely.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Management: Companies seek more help - In a Nutshell Small companies believe the UK government should be playing a greater role in helping them gain access to finance, according to a survey of 750 companies carried out by the British Chambers of Commerce. About 80 per cent thought the government could provide more help. It could help to create low, fixed rate and longer-term borrowing for small companies. It could also reduce 'red tape', particularly that involved in applying for finance under the Loan Guarantee Scheme, which is now available up to Pounds 250,000 and can be taken as part of packages of finance that include bank debt.

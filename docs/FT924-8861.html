			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Letter: UK would be biggest victim in trade war Sir, Far more worrying than the slippage of the timetable for the ratification of the Maastricht treaty is the threatened outbreak of protectionism unless progress in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks can be swiftly resumed. The consequences of a trade war would be disproportionately serious for Britain, which is more dependent on trade than almost any other industrialised nation. Surely even the most dogged Euro-sceptic can now understand that, if we remain on the fringes of the European Community, or even if we pull right out of it, we shall be worse hit than any by a world trade war; that it is therefore more than ever vital for us to be at the heart of the European Community trying to influence it towards compromise in Gatt and to open trading policies.

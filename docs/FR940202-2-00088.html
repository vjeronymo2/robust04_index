The company is privately owned and produced no motor vehicles during the 12 months preceding the filing of its petition. The first prototype of the Ace was shown in 1986. Since then, the company has spent much time redesigning it ``to meet the increasingly higher standards of emissions and safety *&blank;*&blank;* with the original intentions of achieving first sales into North America.'' To date, the petitioner has spent approximately 5,000,000 Pounds Sterling on the project, 100,000 of which (and 1,250 man hours) have been spent in the past two years in research and development relating to meeting the automatic restraint requirements of Standard No. 208. Because the Ace is a full convertible, the company found that it could not adopt an automatic seat belt system. Additional design changes, development and actual testing are necessary in order to install in the Ace an airbag system that meets Standard No. 208. Being a small manufacturer of motor vehicles, the petitioner has had to rely on the expertise of outside parties in the design and development of necessary components. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AC has concluded that modifications of the following will be required to accommodate driver and passenger side airbag systems: Interior dash and cockpit components, seats, steering wheel and chassis. The estimted cost of these modifications is 750,000 Pounds Sterling, exclusive of testing costs. The company's balance sheet shows that its cumulative losses, which were approximately 1,500,000 Pounds Sterling as of December 31, 1989, has increased to approximately 4,275,000 Pounds Sterling as of September 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The company anticipates that it will be able to conform by November 1, 1996. It projects total sales of 200 units in 1994 and 350 in 1995, half of which are proposed for North American sales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Arguments Why an Exemption Would be in the Public Interest and Consistent With Traffic Safety Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to grant an exemption, the Administrator must also find that the exemption is in the public interest and consistent with the objectives of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. In support of its petition, AC has informed NHTSA that the Ace will be equipped with a three-point restraint system that conforms to Standard No. 208, ``the mountings of which have been tested in accordance with and achieved FMV210 (sic) US standard approval.'' Further, except for the automatic restraint requirements, the Ace has been designed to meet all other Federal motor vehicle safety standards, and the bumper standard. It will be manufactured ``using the following US sourced components: Ford engine, transmission, exhaust, wiring and associated components.'' According to the petitioner, ``US parts sourcing and dealer network labor involvement is also in the best interest of the US economy.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the petition described above.

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Letter: Beyond the economic chill in Japan Sir, Please do not listen only to the gloomsters. Your analysis of the impact of Japan's latest rate cut ('Time runs out for the patience principle', July 27) paints a picture of a nation with nothing to look forward to but economic rigor mortis. It is true that corporate profit growth rates, capital expenditure, business confidence, consumer spending and the Tokyo stock market have all taken a buffeting. But gloomsters overlook two factors; one economic, the other sociological. With a full-year net trade balance close to (or above) Dollars 100bn, no government budget deficit, and gross national product on course for at least 2 per cent growth, Japan's economy is still more robust than any other among the G7 nations. But perhaps more significant; whenever in the past the Japanese economy has been hit by what looked like a knockout blow, as it was by the quadrupling of oil prices in the 1970s, its response has always been a period of analytical reflection (known as 'hansei') - followed by re-emergence as a more efficient and better-structured economy ready to enter another formidable growth phase. I'm going to watch it happen all over again. Richard A J Maynard, managing director, Capital Resources International (Europe), 17-18 Picton Place, London W1M 5DE</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 5 May (EFE) -- It was reported officially  today that a Peruvian military court has annulled the life  prison sentence imposed in March on drug trafficker Demetrio  Chavez, aka Vaticano, and has sentenced him to 30 years in  prison.    The maximum sentence for Vaticano was commuted by the  Supreme  Court of Military Justice (CSJM) because although it believed  Vaticano cooperated with terrorist groups, he never participated  directly in murders.    The CSJM, which also sentenced Chavez to pay $50 million in  compensation to the government, reported that it has been proven  that Vaticano maintained close links with terrorists, and  exerted influence on armed groups, especially on the Shining  Path [SL], based on his economic power.    "That allowed the SL to intensify actions in that zone (the  Huallaga Valley) and in several other parts of the country, with  the resulting selective murders," a document released by the  CSJM states.    The document states that Vaticano's influence reached, among  other zones, the Cuchara Valley, where since 5 April security  forces have been carrying out a great antisubversive offensive.    The SL protected the illegal airports and the landings and  takeoffs of the airplanes in which Vaticano had been sending  drugs to Colombia since 1990, the document states.    In exchange, the drug trafficker gave the SL weapons,  ammunition, communications equipment, and from $10,000 to  $20,000 in cash for every airplane that took off with 500 kg of  cocaine.    Demetrio Chavez was arrested on 28 February in Cali,  Colombia, during an operation coordinated between the Colombian  and Peruvian authorities, and expelled on the same day to Peru  as an "undesirable."</p>

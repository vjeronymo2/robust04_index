			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Yongqian (1728 3057 6197): "Brief Look at </F> China's Fighter Aircraft Development Level"]    [Excerpts] From the founding of the Republic to the present  time, the development of China's fighter aircraft has gone  through two stages: From importation and copying to indigenous  design and manufacture, from low grade to high grade. At the  present time, there are over 3,000 fighter aircraft in China's  various military services, placing it third in the world. At the  end of the 1970's, China was successful in designing and  manufacturing the Jian-8 fighter. At the present time, China has  already armed itself with the third generation fighter, the  Jian-8 II and has the fourth generation in development and it  should be in service before the year 2000. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Analysis of Fighter Capabilities </H5>   Engine China's advanced fighter aircraft, the  Jian-8 II, employs two WP-13A [Turbojet-13A] engines, each  developing only 6600 kg of thrust with afterburner: This is the  Jian-8 II's greatest innate inadequacy. In comparison, the  Mig-29M's RD-33K engine develops 8820 kg of thrust on  afterburner, so obviously the RD-33K engine is more advanced.  Total thrust for the Jian-8 II's two WP-13A engines is 13,200  kg, with a thrust-weight ration of 0.95, while the Mig-29M's two  RD-33K engines have a total thrust of 17,640 kg, and a  thrust-weight ratio of 1.1. We can thus see, in comparing the  thrust-weight ratios of the two aircraft, the Mig-29M is  obviously superior. The thrust-weight ratio is a reflection of  an aircraft's maneuverability and climbing characteristics. This  is one of the deficiencies of the Chinese fighter.    Aerodynamic Configuration Foreign fighters change  their aerodynamic configurations about once every ten years. For  example: In the 1940's we had the swept-wing aircraft, in the  50's the delta wing, in the 60's the variable swept wing, in the  70's the tapered wing [biantiao yi 6708 2742 5065], in the 80's  the canard wing, and in the 90's the composite wing. In the  process of developing the Jian-8 II, the Chinese quite possibly  studied aerodynamic configurations of the Mig-21, the Su-15, the  Mig-23 and the F-4. They eventually chose the delta wing. The  reasons for making this choice were:    1. China's manufacturing technology was exceedingly  backward;  their stock of relevant technology was obviously inadequate, and  this had a direct impact on model development.    2. China's research and development of a fighter grew out of  their self-defense requirements, which mainly emphasized  intercept capabilities, with relatively stringent requirements  for high altitude and high speed capabilities, and the delta  wing can fulfill these design requirements.    Actually, the delta wing has some unique advantages: Air  resistance at high speeds is low, there is plenty of open space  inside the wing structure, it is light weight, it has good  rigidity, and it is not prone to vibrations in a high angle of  incidence attitude. However, the delta wing also has some  obvious drawbacks. For instance, its aspect ratio is small, and  at subsonic speeds it can induce increased drag; the surface  area of the wing is great, which also increases friction drag;  when operating the elevons there is a relatively great loss of  lift. In addition, in powered flight, the detached vortex which  is depended on for increased lift can cause a certain amount of  resistance. Also, because the delta wing is thin as well as  swept back, lift is slow to alter with changes in the angle of  attack, and for this reason, in order to produce the greatest  lift, the required angle of incidence is rather great, and this  affects the pilot's field of vision, especially on landing  approach, when one can be constrained by altitude limitations:  In this instance, the lift required has to be obtained from  increases in velocity. All of these can degrade its  maneuverability in subsonic patrols and at low and medium  altitudes and take-off and landing characteristics. This is why,  in the 1970s when air combat was emphasized, foreign fighters  seldom used a pure delta wing. The United States and the former  Soviet Union both employed tapered wings, and only France and  China chose to use the delta. On the Mirage 2000, France used  fly by wire technology which, to a certain extent, compensated  for the delta wing's deficiencies. But China's Jian-8 II,  despite not employing the electrical relay controls, improved  its characteristics by using coupled take-off and landing  ailerons which can be shifted forward and automatically correct  the curvature of the wing during air combat or take-off and  landing. In sum, the supersonic characteristics of the Jian-8 II  are superior to those of the Mirage 2000 and the F-16A, and, in  fact, in turning capability it surpasses the Mirage 2000-5.  However, at subsonic speeds it does not equal either the Mirage  2000 or the F-16A.    Maneuverability If we say that by and large  China's aircraft can compare with the U.S.'s and the former  Soviet Union's aircraft in maximum speed level flight and  service ceiling, then the deficiencies in maneuverability which  directly affect combat effectiveness are rather obvious. For  instance, the maximum rate of climb for the Jian-8 II, Mirage  2000-5, F-16C and the Mig-29M are, respectively, 250 ms [meters  per second], 305 ms, 360 ms, and 368 ms; the smallest turn radii  are respectively: 800 m, 950 m, 610 m, and 400 m; acceleration  from Mach 0.8 to Mach 1.2 respectively: and 25, 22, 18 and 15  seconds. In regard to maximum service overload, for the Jian-8  II it is 9 g, for the Mirage 2000-5 it is 9 g, for the F-16C it  is 9 g and for the Mig-29M it is 12 g. Thus, if the Jian-8 II  would rely solely upon flight characteristics in combat with  these aircraft, the probability of success would be rather low.  One of the main reasons for creating a Chinese fighter aircraft  with rather weak characteristics was because its thrust to  weight ratio was so low. The Jian-8 II's thrust to weight ratio  is only 0.95, while for the Mirage 2000-5 it is 0.97, for the  F-16C it is 1 to 1.1, and for the Mig-29M it is 1.1 -- all of  these are superior to the Jian-8 II.    On Board Firepower and Control Systems  Navigational and on-board electronic equipment have always been  a weak point for China. Although the Jian-8 II's radar employs a  pulse Doppler system and has look-down shoot-down capabilities;  it is, after all, only 1970's technology. Today, advanced  foreign fighter aircraft, such as the Russian Mig-31 and the  Su-35, employ multi-function phased array radar. Besides this,  there are other advanced foreign fighters, such as the Mig-29M,  the Mig-31M, the F-15E, the F-16C and the Mirage 2000-5 which  have forward-looking infrared detectors, laser-spotting tracking  equipment and other supplementary search equipment. Some  aircraft, such as the Mig-29M, use target search instruments  connected with a helmet mounted aiming device. In summation, in  the realm of firepower and control systems, the Chinese fighters  are lagging some 15 years behind advanced foreign levels.    Combat weapons Chinese fighter aircraft generally  carry aircraft cannons and their short-range firepower is  relatively powerful. However, relatively speaking, their  armament is somewhat weaker than comparable foreign aircraft.  The Jian-8 II can carry only 4 to 6 AAM (air to air guided  missiles), (2 medium range, 4 short range), and has a maximum  external load rating of 4,500 kg. The Mig-29M, on the other  hand, can carry 6-8 AAM (4 each medium and short range) and its  maximum external load is 6,000 kg. Because the accuracy and  range of China's AAM is somewhat less than that of the foreign  counterparts, so they greatly emphasize maximum firepower in  each missile launch. However, as the technical level of China's  air to air missiles improves, their size and weight will  gradually be reduced and their destructive force will be  enhanced.  <H5>  Summation of Experience, Flying Into the Future </H5>   Summing up what has been said, the technological level,  combat capability, on-board equipment and weapon systems are  some 10 years behind the United States and Russia. There are  many reasons for this, the main reasons being:    Weak technological base, development time too long  The development time for the Jian-8 fighter was almost 15 years.    Technical equipment lacking Key aircraft  technology is not the product of basic research but is tested  and proven in the air. The United States carried out a great  deal of basic research during the 1950s and 1960s, insuring that  there was an ample store of technology to support the  development of the F-15 and F-16. In their aircraft development  work, the former Soviet Union met some of the same problems  China met, but they quickly compensated for them and were able  to develop the Mig-29 and the Su-27 fighters.    Engine and onboard equipment development has not  advanced, thus the development of the model and major components  is uncoordinated.    One thing that should be noted is that since the 1980's  China has intensified the search for and research of new  technologies so that China's fighters of the 1990s can attain a  higher level, and an excellent base is established for further  development in the 21st century.</p>

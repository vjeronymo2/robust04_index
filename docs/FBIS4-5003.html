			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo -- On the evening of 5 April, Kosei  Oyadomari, mayor of Naha City in Okinawa, visited the Foreign  Ministry together with Kosuke Uehara, director general of the  Okinawa Development Agency. There, they met with Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata and asked the Foreign Ministry to make  efforts for an early return of Naha port facilities (Naha  Military Port). Oyadomari said: "To attain the goal, which is  included in the third Okinawa development program, of attracting  5 million tourists to Okinawa, it is necessary to improve port  facilities."    Hata showed his understanding of the purpose of the request.  However, referring to the Japan-U.S. security pact, he said:  "The government needs to look for an appropriate site where the  functions of the port will be moved. While taking this into  consideration, we will study measures."    Oyadomari said: "The return of Naha Military Port was agreed  upon at a Japan-U.S. Joint Committee meeting in 1974 on  condition that the Japanese Government provides a site where the  functions of the port will be moved. But regrettably, this  agreement has not yet been carried out." Noting that Okinawa  heavily depends on revenue from tourism, Oyadomari also said:  "In the third development program, Okinawa has set the goal of  attracting 5 million tourists to Okinawa by enhancing its  industrial economy. But this goal will not be attained unless  the port facilities are improved. I hope the port will be  returned as early as possible."    Director General Uehara, who also attended the meeting,  said:  "The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee needs to discuss specific  measures (for the return of the port) at an early date. I think  the people in mainland will also welcome the return of military  bases on Okinawa, particularly Naha Military Port." Uehara then  asked Hata to visit Okinawa.</p>

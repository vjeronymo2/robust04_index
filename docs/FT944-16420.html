			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Northern Rock establishes indemnity insurance offshoot Northern Rock, the 11th largest building society with assets of Pounds 7.2bn, yesterday announced that it had established its own 'captive' company to provide mortgage indemnity insurance. Northern Rock is the latest society to take advantage of a relaxation of restrictions by the Building Societies Commission last year. This allowed societies to own more than 15 per cent of a non-life insurance company. Indemnity insurance protects lenders against repossession losses by making up the deficit if a property has to be sold for less than 75 per cent of its purchase price. This was common in the early 1990s. Northern Rock's move to provide indemnity insurance through a Guernsey-based company with initial authorised capital of Pounds 8.5m comes after it switched indemnity insurance from Sun Alliance to Commercial Union last year. The investment manager for the captive insurance company will be Kleinwort Benson (Guernsey), and it will be regulated by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / ICI, Du Pont close to deal with Brussels on assets swap IMPERIAL Chemical Industries of the UK and Du Pont of the US are close to a compromise with European Community competition authorities which would allow both companies to proceed with a planned swap of worldwide chemical assets. The outline agreement has been negotiated between senior executives of the two companies and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner. It will be discussed by advisers to the 17 commissioners today and put to the full commission on Wednesday. Two weeks ago, the EC's merger task force, which reports to Sir Leon, concluded that the ICI-Du Pont deal would have to be blocked, on the grounds that it would give Du Pont a dominant position in the Europe nylon carpet fibre market. The deal involves ICI swapping its worldwide nylon interests for Du Pont's acrylic business and Pounds 250m in cash. The companies had argued that it would be difficult to meet the task force's objections by divesting ICI's nylon carpet fibre business, because this is closely integrated with the rest of its fibre production. Sir Leon is understood to have agreed a compromise solution involving ICI's fibres factory in Germany, one of three European plants to be transferred to Du Pont. The compromise is thought to fall short of a requirement that the factory be sold to a third party. The commission has been discussing with the two companies the possibility that part of the factory's capacity could be given up to a competitor, together with related research and development facilities. A compromise should get the commission out of a tricky political situation at a time when Brussels is under pressure to rein in its powers. The commission has only blocked one of the 120 mergers which it has examined since a new community merger regulation came into effect two years ago. Commission officials said yesterday that they thought it very unlikely Sir Leon's colleagues would oppose his recommendation. Dow Chemical switches to D-Mark invoicing, Page 19</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli, former secretary </F> general of Hizballah, by Muhammad Shuqayr in Beirut; date not  given]    [Excerpts] [Shuqayr] Do you have a position in Hizballah?    [Al-Tufayli] I do not have an official position in  Hizballah. As is known, I have given up official positions for  some time. However, I am with them through thick and thin. I  am always their brother. I prefer not to go into details. It  is an internal affair.    [Shuqayr] It is said that you secluded yourself before the  parliamentary elections?    [Al-Tufayli] I avoid talking about that issue in the media.  I had my own view, and my brothers had their own view. It was  an exceptional case. At any rate, please allow me not to  address this issue in press statements. [passage omitted]    [Shuqayr] What is your position on the post-peace stage?    [Al-Tufayli] In order for us to be in the picture the  question should be seen from all angles. There are a group of  proposals in the region about the post-peace stage, like the  question of resisting normalization peacefully. Some quarters  are dealing with this question and setting conditions for it.  What is important is not for me to look at the issue, program  it in my mind, and form a beautiful picture of it. What is  important is reality.    The question of resisting normalization through peaceful  means and nonconfrontation with the Arab regime is not  practical. Because the Lebanese regime clashed with those  opposed to the Gaza-Jericho agreement at a time when it was  opposed to this agreement. It killed and wounded many of them  without any justification. It has ignored the case, not  bothering to investigate it, despite its promise to do so. I  was right in my position toward the regime and the government,  and there is no need for me to reiterate it.    As for the second point, resisting normalization peacefully  means in practice economic, informational, and diplomatic  competition, and so on. Competitiveness between the Arab and  Western markets is nonexistent, especially if we note that the  U.S. economy serves the Zionist economy. And the United States  has on several occasions reiterated its promise to guarantee  prosperity for the Zionist economy and fight any Arab boycott.  This means that competitiveness -- even in its weakest forms --  is not possible, because we do not have anything with which to  compete with the Western economy. We daily wait for the sea to  feed our children, that is what the West sends us....    Thus resisting normalization after peace -- and in such a  manner -- is impractical. [passage omitted]    [Shuqayr] What do you mean by saying that resisting  normalization will lead to clashes with the regimes?    [Al-Tufayli] For example, in the form of a demonstration in  an Arab street condemning a political sin, and, as a result, the  authorities confront it. Or in the form of an article by a  writer, which the authorities may regard as a threat to its  security, stability, and peace with the enemy, hence they resort  to punishment, pursuit, and judgment, especially as we know that  our regimes cannot accept criticism, so how can they be expected  to allow major opposition to take place?    I would like here to point out that I do not mean military  opposition, because I do not believe that there should be  military opposition to the existing policy in Lebanon, because  that would not serve the issue of liberating Palestine and our  country. On the contrary, it would thwart the liberation march.  I say that it is our duty to bear all psychological and  physical pressures the regime may exert and to focus on the  confrontation with the enemy, whatever the price. Even if that  leads to formal trials, executions, and so on.    I am for carrying out operations against the Zionist entity  and the symbols of this entity, even if the price is the  execution and killing of the mujahidin by Arab regimes. That  should not prevent them from continuing their resistance.    [Shuqayr] How can a peace in which Lebanon is a partner  alongside Syria be reconciled with your call for launching  military resistance?    [Al-Tufayli] We as a people are entitled not to comply with  any treaty by which the Lebanese regime abides. We must  continue to resist our enemy by all military means despite the  Lebanese regime's opposition. Even if the entire world joins  the peace process. Our duty and task is to complete the march  of confrontation and liberation against the Zionist entity.  [passage omitted]    [Shuqayr] This position may cause a clash with the allies,  specifically Syria.    [Al-Tufayli] I am not talking about the present situation  and conditions. I am talking about an assignment for all Arabs  and Muslims inside and outside Lebanon. I am saying that these  should be assigned to continue the liberation march. We in  Lebanon are part of this march. I do not claim that we can  liberate Palestine, let alone southern Lebanon, on our own. I  say that continuing the march in Lebanon and elsewhere  represents a start for a big tendency in the long term, in order  to reunite ranks in the framework of a major liberation  operation. That requires a great deal of work and changes.  This is what I meant. [passage omitted]    [Shuqayr] So you are for a new form of armed struggle?    [Al-Tufayli] Of course, I am for armed struggle anywhere.    [Shuqayr] But conditions are not favorable?    [Al-Tufayli] I believe they are, and they will be more  favorable after peace is established. Egypt remains the biggest  proof of this. In my view, the anger and bombings the Arab  world is experiencing are the natural result of the stage of  peace and normalization with the Zionist entity. The more the  regimes move toward peace, the more the peoples move away from  them and toward liberation.    [Shuqayr] So you are for returning to the situation that  existed in Beirut in the past.    [Al-Tufayli] I do not mix up questions, and we must  distinguish between what is Western and what is Zionist, which  remains a target for us as fighters, militarily, diplomatically,  economically, or informationally.    [Shuqayr] Even if it is decided to establish diplomatic  relations?    [Al-Tufayli] Of course we will resist that diplomatic  presence. But we should not touch the other diplomatic missions  or communities. Nor should any establishments -- except those  belonging to the Zionist entity -- be hit. [passage omitted]    [Shuqayr] But you will in the end clash with Syria, on the  grounds that it will support legitimacy to prevent operations  after liberation?    [Al-Tufayli] When I see a Zionist target, I will hit it.  And if the price for that is my martyrdom, so be it. I will  not cause any problem with anyone. I have caused a problem for  myself. I have never fought against the Lebanese Army or the  Syrian Army. I fought against the Jews and patiently withstood  the results.    [Shuqayr] Is that a personal opinion, or does it represent  Hizballah's position?    [Al-Tufayli] True, these are personal views.    [Shuqayr] Did you not raise this opinion in Hizballah?    [Al-Tufayli] That issue should not be discussed through the  media. [passage omitted]</p>

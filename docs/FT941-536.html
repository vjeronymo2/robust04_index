			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Voting system leaves small groups in cold Italy's victorious right was yesterday claiming that its electoral success was based on overwhelming nationwide support for the alliance of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the federalist Northern League and the far-right National Alliance. But the Progressive Alliance of seven left-wing parties said the result showed Italy had split into three clear parts - the north, centre and south  -with parts of the centre of the country, a traditional stronghold for communist and socialist voters, seeing off the challenge of the right. In Umbria, for example, Progressives were elected in all the first-past-the-post seats, while in Tuscany, the left won 80 per cent of the seats. What was clear, however, was that Italy's complex new voting laws had produced a parliament shorn of many of the smaller parties which used to win seats under the old electoral system. The reformed Socialist party, the Sicily-based clean government movement, La Rete, the Greens and the centre-left Democratic Alliance all failed to attract more than 4 per cent of the votes. As a result, they will not be entitled to any of the 155 seats in the 630-seat lower house which were 'reserved' for smaller parties under the proportional system. Some candidates should enter parliament under the first-past-the-post system, however. All four parties were part of the Progressive Alliance, which instead has had to rely on the stronger performance of its main components, the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) and the hardline candidates of Reconstructed Communism. Mr Giuseppe Ayala, leader of the Democratic Alliance - which had attracted the support of left-leaning figures from business and the arts - admitted yesterday that the small parties had made a serious tactical error in conducting separate campaigns for support under the proportional system. Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, formerly Italy's environment commissioner in Brussels and spokesman for the Greens, claimed that the small parties could not compete with the televisual power of their larger opponents. The most impressive victories for the parties of the right came in the south, notably in Sicily. The leader of La Rete, Mr Leoluca Orlando, who became mayor of Palermo as recently as November with 75 per cent of the vote, had to watch while National Alliance and Forza Italia candidates, including film director Franco Zeffirelli, captured all but a handful of the Sicilian seats. But Mr Giuseppe Chiarante, PDS leader in the Senate, warned that the new voting system risked 'leading Italian democracy up a dangerous blind alley' which would make it difficult for the right to govern the country. The new rules also punished, as expected, the centre parties of the Pact for Italy. Most notably, Mr Mario Segni, who left the Christian Democrats and successfully pushed for a referendum on voting reform last year, has found himself in the embarrassing situation of having to take up one of the parliamentary seats allocated under the proportional system which he sought to abolish after losing his first-past-the-post seat. However, the defeat of the left was not a rout. The Progressive Alliance may be able to make life difficult for the government in the Senate, where Forza Italia, the National Alliance and the League fell short of achieving an absolute majority. As the postmortem began among the Progressives, it was clear that the left would not simply allow itself to be pushed around in either house of parliament. Mr Chiarante admitted that, particularly in the north, the left had suffered a heavy defeat. But he added: 'It's now essential to transform this electoral pact (between the parties of the left) into a firm democratic unity, using this grouping as the basis and the point of departure for a more markedly dynamic and innovative political strategy, which will prevent the right from presenting itself as the newest and most modern force.'</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MIZE, GRADY SCORE EAGLES TO SHARE LEAD  </P> <P> Larry Mize and Wayne Grady had eagle-3s to highlight rounds of six-under-par 66  and share the first-round lead with upstart Steve Lowery in the Atlanta Golf  Classic Thursday.  </P> <P> Mize, winless since taking the 1987 Masters, chipped in from 35 feet for his  eagle on the 548-yard 11th and Grady, winner of last year's Westchester  Classic, rolled in a 25-foot putt on the 499-yard 18th.  </P> <P> Lowery, who lost his card when he finished 157th on the money list in 1988,  played a bogey-free round, parring his last eight holes. His longest birdie  putt was a 20-footer on No. 16.  </P> <P> The trio had a two-shot lead over 10 others after an ideal day for scoring on  the 7,018-yard Atlanta Country Club course.  </P> <P> South Africa's Nick Price, who tied for second last week in the Colonial, and  Scott Hoch, who lost the Masters in a playoff last year, headed the group at  68.  </P> <P> Non-winner Lisa Walters birdied her last three holes to join six other players  in a tie for the lead after the first round of the LPGA Corning (N.Y.) Classic.  </P> <P> Walters, Judy Dickinson, Trish Johnson, Tammie Green, Diana Heinicke-Rauch,  Cathy Johnston, and Alice Ritzman all shot three-under-par 68s on their first  trip around the 6,006-yard Corning Country Club Course.  </P> <P> Pat Bradley, Kris Monaghan, Marianne Morris and Robin Hood were one shot back  at 69.  </P></p>

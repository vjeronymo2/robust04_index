			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Very little is being said about the state of play in  the border row between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi  Peninsula and the islands in the Gulf of Guinea. The region has  been the scene of clashes, of troop movements, and flight of  populations of Nigerian nationals. Now, President Eyadema of  Togo has turned up in Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, setting  speculative tongues wagging. On the line to Yaounde, Ajoa  Yeboah-Afari asked our reporter, William Moles, if it was known  what President Eyadema was doing there:    [Begin recording] [Moles] Well, nothing has been said,  especially, yet. In fact, the government has been tight-lipped  over all the negotiations that have been going on in the last  few weeks. But I do know that President Eyadema met with  President Paul Biya this morning for half an hour, but I have  just missed them at the Hilton at lunch time. I just heard from  sources at state television that he is now on his way to Abuja.  They also said that he had sent his foreign minister to Abuja  on Monday [28 February]. So, I don't think there is much doubt  that he is here in some kind of negotiating role between Nigeria  and Cameroon. Also, sources at the Foreign Ministry here told  me that President Omar Bongo from Gabon will also be arriving in  Yaounde shortly. State radio reported earlier on this week that  he wanted to use his experience to negotiate between Nigeria and  Cameroon over the Bakassi dispute.    [Yeboah-Afari] We understand that there is also a French  naval vessel nearby. Can you confirm this?    [Moles] Yes, I can confirm this. I have had confirmation of  this from the French Embassy here. At the Nigerian Embassy,  they are rather alarmed by the arrival of this French frigate  they call the (Vondemiere). It came to the port in Douala last  night with a crew of about 90 sailors. At the French Embassy  they say that it is just here for a routine surveillance trip  and that they were also here last September. But obviously, the  Nigerians here are naturally a bit skeptical about that.    [Yeboah-Afari] Well, we understand that the French Embassy  are saying that the current round of negotiations are going on  quite smoothly. What would you say to this?    [Moles] Well, they haven't actually revealed a great deal  about negotiations. All they did say to me was that there has  been some progress in the negotiations after their meetings in  Abuja on Tuesday [1 March], and they also said that the fierce  pronouncements of Baba Kingibe, Nigeria's foreign minister, in a  press conference yesterday, were rhetorical and they didn't  really say the atmosphere in which they talks were conducted.  They really have not said much more than that. [end recording]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The revised rule also allows the building/facility owner or employer to demonstrate, pursuant to specific criteria, that the material does not contain asbestos. The criteria, specified in paragraph (k)(4)(ii) are similar to the inspection protocols for schools in AHERA, such as sampling and analysis by a certified building inspector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA also considered allowing the use of specific information in the building/facility owner's possession relating to construction specifications to rebut the presumption. However, many who made submissions during the supplementary comment period, pointed out to the Agency that building records were rarely adequate to convincingly establish the absence of ACM in buildings and recommended that they should not be used for rebutting the presumption (Ex. 162&hyph;2, 162&hyph;4, 162&hyph;5, 162&hyph;7, 162&hyph;11, 162&hyph;12, 162&hyph;13, 162&hyph;19, 162&hyph;22, 162&hyph;24, 162&hyph;25, 162&hyph;27, 162&hyph;31, 162&hyph;32, 162&hyph;33, 162&hyph;36, 162&hyph;39, 162&hyph;42, 162&hyph;44, 162&hyph;45, 162&hyph;46, 162&hyph;54). Some felt that building records might be useful in confirming, but not rebutting, the presumption, while others deemed the only reliable records were comprised of an AHERA-like comprehensive building survey with bulk sampling data (Ex. 162&hyph;1, 162&hyph;12, 162&hyph;13, 162&hyph;24, 162&hyph;27, 162&hyph;36, 162&hyph;50, 162&hyph;58). An owner of commercial properties observed that he had often found it easier to sample the PACM than to locate adequate documentation (Ex. 162&hyph;29). A group of environmental lawyers recommended that since EPA in its NESHAP rule declined to rely on building records, OSHA should also for consistency (Ex. 162&hyph;22). Members of a consulting firm, noted that before 1980, materials containing less than 5% asbestos by volume were said to be asbestos-free (by EPA). Thus, such materials would be unlikely to appear on building records if they had contained less than 5% asbestos (Ex. 162&hyph;7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In considering the numerous comments on the subject, most of which affirmed the general inadequacy of building records to rebut the presumption, OSHA has not included this as a method to establish that a building material does  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> contain asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs (k)(1)(ii) and (k)(2)(ii) set out the notification provisions for owners and employers. They instruct them concerning who must be notified of the presence of ACM/PACM and how. Briefly, owners must notify employers who bid for work in or, as tenants, will occupy space where ACM/PACM is present. The owner must also notify employees who will perform work subject to this standard in such areas before such work is begun. This work consists of Class I through IV asbestos work, and the installation of new asbestos-containing material. Similar provisions apply to employers who are not owners. [Paragraph (k)(2)(ii)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BCTD suggested that notice of ACM take place early in the contracting process (Ex. 162&hyph;42) and a representative of the Interstate Natural Gas Association agreed that pre-bid notification of contractors was needed (Ex. 162&hyph;9). OSHA agrees. Requiring notification to prospective contractors at bid time will improve employee protection. Knowledge about asbestos presence gained after bidding may cause the bidder to dilute protection in order to salvage the bid. Contractors may lose time and money if they conscientiously stop a job when asbestos is discovered. Other participants echoed these reasons (see, e.g., NCRA, Tr. 2430&hyph;2432; Testimony of C. Gowan, Tr. 834&hyph;835.) Notifying employers leasing space containing ACM was also recommended (Ex 162&hyph;29).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standard provides that notification may be either in writing or via a personal communication between the owner and persons owed notification or their authorized representatives. OSHA expects that in the case of contracts for work to be performed, notifications will be included in the bid documents. In other cases it may be ``faxed,'' telephoned or otherwise communicated. OSHA believes these notifications, supplemented by clarified labeling requirements [see (k)(7)(vii)], and regulated area posting, will provide ample information to workers so they will not inadvertently be exposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

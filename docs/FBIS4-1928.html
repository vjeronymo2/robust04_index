			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Han Zhuping (7281 4376 1627) and Wang Lianwei (3769 6647 </F> 0251): "Earnestly Maintain Consensus Between the Association  and the Foundation"]    [Text] The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Straits [ARATS] and the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] have  held their fourth working talks in Beijing. Through further  exchanging opinions, they deepened their understanding of each  other's viewpoints and put forward new opinions for settling the  differences. This should be affirmed. However, the talks did  not reach written agreement on the issue of "sending back people  who enter the other side's area in violation of the regulations  concerned" and two other technical issues according to the  expectations of the leaders of the two organizations while in  Beijing, and failed to exchange opinions and talk about the  issues of "jointly cracking down on maritime smuggling and  robbery and other criminal activities," "protecting intellectual  property rights on the two sides of the straits," "building up  ties and mutual assistance between law courts on both sides of  the straits," and a number of economic and technological issues  enumerated by the "Agreement of the Wang-Ku Meeting." This was  indeed a regrettable point.    The fourth working talks between ARATS and SEF were arranged  during the Beijing talks in February, and the subjects of the  talks were also written into the "joint press bulletin." After  major consensus was achieved at the Beijing talks, the principle  issues for the working talks were solved. In the general  framework of the draft agreements on the three issues, the  working talks should have made smooth progress. However, after  the two sides held repeated discussions over six days, and  although ARATS continued to adjust its opinion by accepting many  of SEF's opinions, they still failed to reach agreement on the  three issues. This made people think that, just before the  fourth working talks, some institutions in Taiwan had overthrown  part of the consensus reached by the Tang- Chiao talks and  called for "maintaining the bottom line of the ARATS-SEF Taipei  talks under the precondition of giving consideration to the  dignity of legal jurisdiction." It seemed that one could not  just blame technical factors for the failure of the recent talks  to make major progress.    The understandings reached by ARATS and SEF in their Beijing  talks must be treated seriously. Only by maintaining the  consensus can the two sides reach agreement on the relevant  subjects in their working talks. From the Wang-Ku talks to the  Tang-Chiao talks, ARATS and SEF were solemnly authorized to  handle relevant affairs, and should conscientiously deal with  such affairs. They responsibly signed relevant agreements and  press bulletins. The important agreements and consensus formed  the principle for the development of mainland-Taiwan relations  in the future, and also formed the precondition and foundation  for the working talks between the two organizations. The Taiwan  side overthrew part of the "Tang-Chiao consensus," and this  damaged the foundation and atmosphere for the working talks  between the two organizations. This inevitably had a serious  impact on the fourth working talks. Some people on the Taiwan  side often said that the two sides of the straits should have  "sincerity" and should "keep good faith" and "respect each  other." Did the haphazard negation of the consensus reached by  the responsible officials of the two organizations represent  such "sincerity" and "good faith"?    Zou Zhekai, deputy chairman and secretary general of ARATS,  recently said that in the course of settling various technical  issues between the two sides of the straits, it is necessary to  follow the principle of "avoiding politics, considering things  as they stand, handling easy things before difficult ones, and  seeking common ground while reserving differences." Adopting a  realistic attitude and avoiding political issues was the  consensus reached by responsible officials of the two  organizations. Settling problems by consensus is not only a  sensible and understandable way of settling the differences  between the two organizations, but also represents the principle  for developing mainland-Taiwan relations in current  circumstances that should be followed and safeguarded. Only  thus can the linkage between ARATS and SEF be freed from the  obstruction of various political issues and function as a smooth  channel of communication, thus guaranteeing the development of  relations between the two sides of the strait.    There is no wonder that differences exist in the working  talks between the two organizations, and this is very normal.  They should jointly seek solutions through increasing mutual  trust and understanding in the course of discussion. As long as  both sides are sincere in making efforts to make progress, they  may succeed in reaching agreement next time if they fail this  time. Continuous exchanges and discussions will bring the two  sides' opinions closer and closer, and they will eventually  solve their problems. However, it is the common wish of the  people on both sides of the straits that there be a consensus  and less differences in the development of relations between the  two sides of the strait and that a written agreement will be  reached on the three technical issues [shi wu xing yi ti 0057  0523 1840 6231 7344].</p>

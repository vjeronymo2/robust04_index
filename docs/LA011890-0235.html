			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RECORD COLD SLOWS HOUSING STARTS, OFF 8%  </P> <P> Housing starts, slowed by record cold weather over much of the nation last  month, declined 8% in December and ended the year at the lowest level since the  recession year of 1982, the government reported today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said the December decline helped slow construction of  new homes and apartments to 1.37 million units in 1989, compared to 1.49  million units the previous year, a 7.6% drop.  </P> <P> The 1.37 million starts last year were the lowest since 1982 when 1.06 million  units were built. Both the Federal National Mortgage Assn. and the National  Assn. of Home Builders are forecasting about 1.37 million starts in 1990.  </P> <P> Before the abnormally cold weather hit last month, the housing industry had  been held back through much of this year by high interest rates, which have  moderated recently.  </P> <P> Starts dropped from a high of 1.68 million units last January to 1.26 million  units in September before rebounding to 1.43 million units in October. Starts  fell again in November, to 1.34 million units, pulled down by a 15.3% decline  in multifamily projects.  </P> <P> Fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.78% at the end of December after peaking at  over 11% last March.  </P> <P> Construction of single-family homes in December fell 10% to an annual rate of  904,000 units after falling 2% in November. That was the lowest since 862,000  units were started in December, 1982.  </P> <P> Apartment construction declined 2.4% to an annual rate of 331,000 units,  compared to a 15.3% decline in November.  </P> <P> The Northeast posted the steepest decline, down 23.3%. That was followed by a  10% drop in the South and a 9.8% decline in the Midwest. Starts rose only in  the West, where they gained 3.4%.  </P></p>

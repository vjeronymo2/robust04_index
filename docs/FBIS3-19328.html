			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Trend Away From Popular Parties </F> Checked"]    [Text] Election year 1994 has begun with success for the  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and the Greens, and  defeat for the Bonn coalition parties the Christian Democratic  Union [CDU] and the Free Democratic Party [FDP]. In the Landtag  elections in Lower Saxony on Sunday [13 March], the SPD and the  Greens obtained an absolute majority of seats. The Greens, who  had been in government with the SPD until now, were also able to  improve their results significantly. By contrast, the CDU  suffered heavy losses and had to make do with the worst results  in 35 years. The FDP will no longer not be represented in the  Landtag. The protest parties received well below 5 percent. The  Mannheim-based "Research Group Elections" arrived at the  following conclusions:    "Few voters (22 percent) in Lower Saxony expected an  absolute  majority for the SPD, and only 37 percent wanted the SPD to  achieve an absolute majority. Even among SPD supporters, over a  third did not want the party to have an absolute majority.  Nevertheless, the Lower Saxony results represent an end to the  trend away from the popular parties, which was in evidence since  the last elections. The SPD and the CDU were able to win the  backing of 80 percent of the electorate. That is somewhat less  than four years ago, but significantly more than in the  elections in Hamburg in September of last year, when the SPD and  CDU jointly were only able to obtain 65 percent. Despite  hurricane-like weather conditions, the turnout was still high at  73.8 percent.    ``The Lower Saxony elections drew attention to the current  political situation at the federal level. The CDU and the FDP  felt that above all. The CDU, which on scale of between - 5  and + 5 still achieved an average level of + 1.3 in Lower  Saxony four years ago, now only obtained + 0.3, and the FDP,  which scored + 0.7 percent four years ago, now only achieved  - 0.3. However, the SPD's image also registered a drop from  + 1.7 at the last elections to + 1.4 in these elections. Only  the Greens registered an improvement, from - 0.6 to - 0.1 now.    ``In view of the position at the outset, the room for  political maneuver at the land level was limited for Lower  Saxony's parties. Both the SPD and the CDU were able to profit  from the relatively high standing of their leading politicians.  Thus, Minister-President Schroeder scored an average of + 1.4  on a scale of between - 5 and + 5 among all the citizens of  Lower Saxony and + 2.8 among SPD supporters, faring only  marginally better than his challenger Christian Wulff, who  obtained + 1.2 among all those polled and + 2.7 among all CDU  voters. However, asked to make a direct comparison, 47 percent  of all the citizens of Lower Saxony would want to see Schroeder  as minister-president, and only 33 percent opted for Wulff.    ``What was also decisive for the SPD result was that the  party succeed in gaining the support of the bulk of its 1990  voters: As many as 77 percent of SPD voters this time had also  voted for the party the last time, 8 percent came over directly  from the CDU, and almost every tenth one came from the group of  those who were not eligible to vote last time or did not vote.  Among its classic regular voters, that is, unionized workers,  it could almost gather two-thirds of all votes.    ``Despite its losses, the CDU was also successful in its  traditional areas: In its strongholds, it suffered below  average losses in view of its strong position at the outset.  Among the Catholics in the countryside, it obtained 55 percent.  In the countryside as a whole, it achieved 47 percent, and 48  percent among the over-sixties, one of its strongest sources of  support. The losses among all social structure subgroups were  roughly similar.    ``The federal political climate was not the only factor  determining the failure of the FDP. The work of the FDP as an  opposition force in the Lower Saxony Landtag was also assessed  negatively. The FDP's attitude toward the coalition question  also had an effect. Before the elections, FDP voters wanted a  clear answer to the question of with whom would the FDP want to  govern after the elections. Neither in Lower Saxony nor at the  federal level do FDP's regular voters suffice for the party to  cross the 5-percent threshold.''  <H5>  Clear Gains for the Greens </H5>   ``The Greens were the only party that made clear gains and  obtained its best result in these Lower Saxony Landtag  elections, also faring well among voters in the 18-25 age group  (17 percent) on this occasion at the expense of the SPD, but  achieving lower results among the 25-34 age group (13 percent).  By contrast, the SPD was able to maintain its 1990 result among  the latter group. The Greens were able to obtain their best  result among young women below the age of 24, gaining 19 percent  of the vote.    ``The fact that the Republikaner results were well below the  5-percent mark was due to the loss in importance of their key  issue, the asylum and foreigners question, which is only ranked  among problems of major importance for the land by 10 percent of  the inhabitants of Lower Saxony and, on the other hand, to  increased competence of the popular parties on important  political questions. The agreement that was reached on nursing  attendance insurance was undoubtedly a signal in this respect.    ``On the question of solving the most important issues in  the  land, a land government led by the SPD undoubtedly has an  advantage over one led by the CDU. In the case of unemployment,  which is considered the most important issue in the land by 68  percent of the inhabitants of Lower Saxony, 28 percent believe  that an SPD government would be better at solving the problem  and only 14 percent would be more inclined to have confidence in  a CDU government, but 30 percent of the citizens in Lower Saxony  consider both parties to be equally capable of solving the  problem, whereas only 22 percent think that neither party can  solve the problem. On the issue of the economy too, there is  more confidence in the SPD in Lower Saxony (27 percent) than in  the CDU (21 percent), although in this case too, most (28  believe) that both an SPD-led and CDU-led government could solve  economic problems and only 17 percent think that neither party  is capable of doing so. Overall, there is significantly more  confidence in the ability of the two largest parties to solve  problems than a few months ago.''</p>

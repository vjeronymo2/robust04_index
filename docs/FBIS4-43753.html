			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has declared that he  believes in the benefit of developing cooperation among the  Central Asian republics, which share a common history, culture,  and geography. Demirel hosted a dinner in honor of Turkmen  President Saparmurad Niyazov at the Cankaya Mansion tonight.    In a dinner toast, Demirel remarked that the relations  between the two countries progressed significantly, strengthened  by cultural and linguistic ties. Pointing out that the  beneficial talks held with President Niyazov today gave a brand  new impetus to bilateral relations, Demirel said: I have no  doubt that Turkish-Turkmen cooperation, the legal foundations of  which have largely been concluded as a result of the  approximately 40 agreements reached between the two countries,  will be further enhanced on the basis of equality, mutual  interest, love, and respect.    The two countries were forced to live apart and yearned for  one another in the course of history, Demirel explained, adding  that they are now experiencing the happiness of reunification  after a separation of hundreds of years.    [Begin Demirel recording] We are following with appreciation  the reforms launched under your capable leadership and the  distance covered by your country despite all the difficult  conditions. We appreciate the constructive approach you have  adopted while you build and strengthen your national state and  conduct good relations with your neighbors. This approach  contributes to peace and stability in your region. We believe  in the benefit of developing cooperation among the Central Asian  republics, which share the same history, culture, and geography,  and which face similar needs and problems. With its serious and  balanced foreign policy based on open doors and positive  impartiality, Turkmenistan has occupied the position it deserves  in the international arena. [end recording]    Demirel concluded by saying that in this difficult  transition  period, Turkey considers it a brotherly duty to support and  assist Turkmenistan in every field.    In his speech, Niyazov stated that Turkish firms have  contributed to the development of his country's economy. He  explained that approximately 20 Turkish firms are conducting  business in Turkmenistan. Pointing out that the conflicts in  Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, and Georgia affect his country as well,  Niyazov remarked that important tasks fall on international  organizations in resolving these conflicts. He stressed that  Turkmenistan shares the same views as Turkey in international  issues. Niyazov noted that the project to transport Turkmen  natural gas to Turkey is very important for both countries.    Attending the dinner were Kamer Genc, acting speaker of the  Turkish Grand National Assembly; Prime Minister Tansu Ciller;  General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff; Murat  Karayalcin, state minister and deputy prime minister; some  ministers; and other guests.</p>

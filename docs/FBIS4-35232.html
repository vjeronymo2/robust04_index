			<p>BFN     [Text] Al-Sulaymaniyah, Iraqi Kurdistan, 30 May (INA)--The  renegade Jalal Talabani's gang has carried out killings and acts  of destruction in Kou Senjaq, claiming the lives of 250 people,  including 150 civilian women and children.    In a report published today, citing arrivals from that area,  the newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH says that this massacre, in which an  entire family of a mother and her five children were killed, was  planned by two criminals; namely, Jabbar Faraman, who is called  the minister of peshmerga affairs; and Shaykh Ja'far, a military  commander in the so-called Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which  is led by Jalal Talabani. This was part of a plan worked out by  the traitor Talabani to liquidate the Kurds who are hostile to  his treasonous political line and who reject his affiliation  with the foreigners.    Mas'ud Barzani still rejects Talabani's return from Damascus  to his headquarters in Iraqi Kurdistan via the area of Bahdanyan  [name as received] under Barzani's personal guarantee. Military  confrontations between the groups of these two renegades are  still raging in several areas of Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On Monday [23 May] the Ukrainian parliamentary  delegation to the talks with the Crimean parliament held a  session in private in Kiev. The head of the delegation Boris  Oleynik refused to disclose the approach of Kiev to the  negotiations. "I have gone through 25 different conflicts and  know what these comments lead to," he told INTERFAX-Ukraine.    Oleynik, a prominent poet, before the collapse of the Soviet  Union was deputy chairman of the House of Nationalities of the  USSR Supreme Soviet.    He said he also banned commentaries on the situation by all  members of his delegation. So far it is only known that the  final list of delegates will be announced late on Monday evening.    The Crimean delegation is expected to arrive in Kiev at  about  1100 on Tuesday. The same day it intends to return to  Simferopol.</p>

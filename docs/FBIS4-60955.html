			<p>BFN     [Text] A visit to Budapest by an official Kazakh delegation  led by Deputy Foreign Minister Konstantin Zhigalov was devoted  to examination of the possibilities to deepen and broaden  political and economic integration between Hungary and  Kazakhstan. The guests from Almaty visited one of the largest  Hungarian enterprises -- the Videoton joint stock production  amalgamation, whose products are well known on the former USSR  market. The Kazakh delegation was interested first of all in  the progress of privatization of large Hungarian enterprises, in  the level of involvement of working collectives in this process.    According to one of the leaders of Videoton, Peter Lakotosz,  his enterprise has begun to establish close links with  Kazakhstan. Hungarian foreign policy pays increasing attention  to the development of ties with the Asian republics of the  former USSR which have gained their independence, said Andras  Kelemen, political state secretary of the Hungarian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. He stressed that during this visit a framework  for a joint agreement aimed at strengthening Kazakh-Hungarian  ties in all fields will be discussed.</p>

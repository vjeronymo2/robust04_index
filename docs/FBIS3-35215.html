Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam led those who received  al-Bid at the Damascus International Airport.

Al-Bid made a statement to the correspondent of the Syrian  Arab News Agency in which he said:    "We are glad, while visiting the sisterly Syrian Arab  Republic, to meet with our brothers in this fraternal country,  led by President Hafiz al-Asad, to discuss fraternal bilateral  relations and ways of bolstering and developing them, in  addition to the Arab and international situation.    "It is an opportunity to acquaint our Syrian brothers with  developments in Yemen and the results of national dialogue and  efforts contained in the document of pledge and accord that will  be signed in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on the 10th of the  blessed Ramadan.    "We believe that it is an opportunity to discuss with our  brothers in the beloved Syria the means of healing the rift,  restoring Arab cohesion, and organizing the single Arab house in  a manner that will contribute to the restoration of Arab  solidarity and the activation of the Arab nation's role among  the nations. This will come in the wake of new international  circumstances and changes, and in a manner that allows the Arab  nation to confront the dangers and challenges facing it.    "On this occasion, I am pleased to express my satisfaction  with the development of fraternal relations between our country  and the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic, and to emphasize the  importance of developing these relations in a manner that serves  the joint interests of the two fraternal Yemeni and Syrian  peoples, and the issues that concern our Arab and Islamic  nations, and strengthens the role and status of the two  countries in the Arab and international arenas."    Al-Bid is accompanied by Dr. Yasin Sa'id Nu'man, a Yemeni  Socialist Party Political Bureau member and head of the  secretariat of the party's Central Committee.</p>

After a private meeting, the two leaders  will join their delegations for further talks. Yeltsin will  also meet local intellectuals and get involved in a signing  ceremony for a package of bilateral agreements with the outline  friendship and cooperation treaty being the main one.    The source said work was in progress to put final touches to  some 20 draft papers but the two heads of state would sign only  those which were ready by February 3.    In the meantime, spokesman for the Transcaucasian Group of  Russian Troops Gennadiy Dolgachev told Interfax that the  President would probably be accompanied by Defence Minister  Pavel Grachev.

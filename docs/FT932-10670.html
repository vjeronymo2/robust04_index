			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sullivan sells 10% stake in BEP MR DAVID Sullivan, publisher of the Sunday Sport, has sold his 10 per cent stake in the Bristol Evening Post. Credit Lyonnais Laing, the securities house, placed Mr Sullivan's 1.64m shares with two institutions at an average price of 334p a share raising some Pounds 5.48m. The sale might be seen as a concession of defeat for Mr Sullivan's ambitions to move into mainstream newspapers. The shares were bought for about 300p each some three years ago and the sale is unlikely to have generated a profit once carrying costs and brokers fees are taken into consideration. That concession was signalled in early March when he and Ms Karren Brady, the Sport's marketing director, announced that they were moving into football. They head a company called Roldvale which bought 84 per cent of Birmingham City Football Club for an undisclosed sum. Mr Sullivan, who made his fortune through the sale of a string of sex shops in 1981, built up his stake in the middle-market BEP in late 1989 and early 1990. He was subsequently blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission from taking a controlling stake in the tabloid. The MMC ruled that his ownership would not be in the public interest. However, as recently as last November, Mr Sullivan said he planned to fight the ruling after buying The News and Echo, a new regional Sunday newspaper for Yorkshire and north-west England. He was hoping that control of more conventional newspapers would alter his case. Mr Sullivan yesterday refused to make any comment regarding the sale.</p>

The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved, the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (ATSF)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (FRA Waiver Petition Docket Number SA&hyph;93&hyph;8)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ATSF seeks a waiver of compliance from certain sections of 49 CFR part 231, Railroad Safety Appliance Standards. ATSF is requesting a permanent waiver of the provisions of 49 CFR part 231 which requires that bolts attaching handholds and other safety appliances on freight equipment be ``riveted over''. Title 49 CFR 231.1 (h)(4) requires that side handholds be securely fastened with not less than 1/2 inch bolts with nuts outside (when possible) and riveted over, or with not less than 1/2 inch rivets. Several other sections in part 231 address the application of safety appliances (sill steps, ladder treads, etc.) which requires that they be securely fastened with not less than 1/2 inch bolts with nuts outside (when possible) and riveted over, or with not less than 1/2 inch rivets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATSF states that there is an inconsistency in the manner in which bolts on freight cars and those on locomotives must be secured. The regulations pertaining to bolts securing handholds on locomotives contain no similar requirement. See 49 CFR 231.30.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATSF relates that they use state-of-the-art elastic stop nuts which are not riveted over but have locking effectiveness and application advantages superior to those of metal bolts that are ``riveted over''. ATSF states that because there appears to be no safety related justification to treat safety appliance standards differently, the requirement that bolts on freight cars be riveted over is superfluous.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comments, they should notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket Number SA&hyph;93&hyph;8 and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Chief Counsel, Federal Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications received before April 18, 1994 will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. Comments received after that date will be considered as far as practicable. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.&hyph;5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on March 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Phil Olekszyk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Deputy Associate Administrator for Safety Compliance and Program Implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;6277 Filed 3&hyph;17&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;06&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / World Trade News: Mixed credits dispute muddles UK trade outlook - Industry says some export contracts are endangered by official indifference BRITISH capital goods exporters, already alarmed by what they see as government's efforts to undermine the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), are facing a new worry which has widened the gulf between them and a once supportive government. The Pounds 97m allocated to mixed credits - export credits sweetened by aid  -in 1991/2 has been fully committed less than a month into the government's financial year. As a result the Overseas Development Administration has closed the window for new deals till April 1992. Top executives of companies such as GEC,NEI, Balfour Beatty and Trafalgar House have fulminated privately about the cover restrictions and premium increases imposed by the ECGD. Now they point to thenews on mixed credits as confirmation of their worst fears about the government's indifference to their fate. Without the mixed credit facility - commonly known by the initials ATP, which stand for 'aid and trade provision' - they say they will be unable to sign up new orders in important markets such as China, Indonesia, Malaysia, India and Thailand where such financing is regarded asnormal. To save deals now in the pipeline for these markets, they must try and delay signing the contract, which makes pricing difficult at a time of high inflation at home. Or they must arrange expensive bridging finance for their customer, or transfer the procurement abroad to a country which is not so stingyabout its aid budget. Government officials are at pains to point out that the closure of the ATP window for the remainder of the financial year does notconstitute a change of policy. It has happened simply because the UK's recent remarkable run of success in winning orders with ATP money. Foremost amongthese is the Pounds 400m order recently won by Cementation International and BalfourBeatty to build a hydro-electric power station in the Malaysian state of Kelantan. But there have been other deals - for rural communications, railwaysignalling and track rehabilitation in Indonesia, for the Ankara metro and truck supplies to Zimbabwe - which have swelled the total. There is, however, little doubt that the lack of much official sympathy for the exporters' plightreflects the fact that large parts of the government have always viewed ATP with scepticism. Though it was originally conceived as a political device to justify an increase in the overall aid budget, the Overseas Development Administration harbours worries about the real developmental value of money spent in this way. The Treasury is concerned that ATP constitutes another unjustified subsidy to exporters on top of those they already receive through payment of claims by ECGD and routine interest subsidies on export credits. ATP credits account for some 15 per cent of the ECGD book, officials argue, and the facility adds to the concentration of its business in a limited number of markets. Exporters say that one reason why there has been a bunching of ATP deals in the current year is that some contracts were delayed last year, particularly in Indonesia, because of uncertainty over the availability of ECGD cover. Now ECGD cover is available, but suddenly there is no aid money. A look at the figures suggests this smacks a little too much of conspiracy. The ATP budget was underspent last year, but only by Pounds 4.5m out of a total of Pounds 98m. This suggests that it would have been difficult to fund some of this year's projects had they gone ahead earlier. Part of the problem relates to the funding of concessional loans. The government built up a large volume of lasting commitments in the first threeyears of its concessional loan programme which ended in March. The result is that part of the ATP budget is automatically taken up with subsidies on loans agreed some years ago. From this financial year, the system of accounting for such loans is being changed. The government will pay lending banks a sum equivalent to its total grant commitment during the drawdown period of the loan rather than making a series of 'pay-as-you-go' subsidies each year until the loan matures. The banks must then devise a technique to spread thesubsidy through the life of the loan. Though the details are still undernegotiation between the banks and the City, this will mean that fewer concessional loans can be agreed in future, though it will also obviate the problem of a ballooning ATP budget as more commitments are added to the books. The simple answer would be to increase the ATP budget. But Mrs Lynda Chalker, the aid minister, told parliament yesterday that additional resources were not available for the ATP in the current year. Britain has supported efforts in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to reach a new internationalagreement limiting the use of mixed credits. With these talks about to climax it would look odd for the government to raise its ATP budget. In fact, government officials say, they regard the OECD discussions as the best way of dealing with the problem. Envisaged in the OECD is a tough agreement that willseverely limit mixed credits for otherwise commercially viable projects as wellas those to richer countries and for large projects. This is little comfort for exporters who say they do not believe the agreement will be enforceable. Japan will continue to offer large amounts of 'untied' mixed credits which will end up supporting its own exports, they say. Only Britain will end upplaying by the new rules. In the old days, said one executive, the Department of Trade and Industry would have lobbied hard for an increase in the ATP budget. But Mr Peter Lilley, the secretary of state, is said to be economically dry and unsympathetic. 'We haven't had a positive secretary of state in a very long time.' ECGD bid dropped, Page 11</p>

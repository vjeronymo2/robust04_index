			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Amsterdam SE issues takeover barriers warning THE AMSTERDAM Stock Exchange yesterday issued a warning to 20 listed companies that they must comply with modified rules, agreed last year, which limit the total allowable number of barriers to hostile takeover. The bourse posted notices to a number of companies, including Hoogovens, the steelmaker, and Nutricia, the biochemicals concern, warning that they must limit their anti-takeover barriers to a total of two. The limitation, agreed last year, was aimed at opening up what remains one of the most tightly-defended systems of corporate ownership in Europe, but many companies have yet to comply. The stock exchange has given laggards until February 15 to comply with the regulations or face possible but unspecified sanctions. The warning came as the exchange unveiled a plan aimed at shoring-up its competitive position against London's electronic SEAQ exchange, which has siphoned-off a substantial share of business in recent years. A newly-announced two-tier trading system involves a split of the market into separate institutional and retail segments. Trading in the 30-odd leading international issues will be conducted on a computer-based wholesale system on which offered 'buy' and 'sell' prices are displayed; institutions and brokers will moreover be given access to an additional system upon which they will be able to deal directly with each other. Remnants of the present trading system will be preserved for the retail side of the market; intermediary dealers, known in Holland as hoekmen, set prices and match buy and sell orders from their smaller and less powerful clients. The plan follows two years of study by a panel set up specifically to formulate ways of defending Amsterdam's long-term existence as a financial centre. Its recommendations are similar to measures adopted recently by the New York Stock Exchange. Full details, together with new proposals to revise the bourse's cost structure and fees, will be placed before the bourse membership for approval next month.</p>

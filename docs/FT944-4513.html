			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Rail fund painting fetches Pounds 3.74m One of the finest 17th-century Dutch landscapes, painted in 1665 by Meindert Hobbema, sold for Pounds 3.74m at Sotheby's in London yesterday, Antony Thorncroft writes. It was one of 17 old master paintings sent to the auction by the British Rail Pension Fund. Fourteen found buyers for a total of Pounds 6.7m. The Hobbema was bought by the Netherlands government for the Mauritshuis gallery in The Hague. The pension fund started buying art as an alternative investment in the late 1970s.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetsowv] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 12 TASS -- "The central executive  committee of the Russian Communist Party strongly protests  against NATO aggressive actions in Bosnia," says a statement of  the communist party's central executive committee circulated  here today.    The document calls on factions of the State Duma and the  Federation Council to denounce the policy of the United States  and NATO in Bosnia, which does not help to achieve peace in the  region.    It says that peace in former Yugoslavia can be achieved with  exclusively political means.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: AMERICAN ECOLOGY STARTS $23.5-MILLION SITE FUND  </P> <P> American Ecology Corp., an Agoura Hills waste-management concern, plans to set  aside $23.5 million in reserves in the fourth quarter for future costs of  cleaning up and closing waste-disposal sites.  </P> <P> The reserves, which amount to a third of American Ecology's annual sales, will  result in the company posting a loss for all of 1988, said spokeswoman Nicki  Hobson. American Ecology earned $4.7 million on sales of $68 million in 1987.  </P> <P> A significant part of the reserves will be earmarked for cleaning up a leaking  chemical-waste disposal plant that American Ecology operated in Sheffield,  Ill., the company said. American Ecology based the amount of reserves in part  on a recent independent report, prepared for the U.S. Environmental Protection  Agency, that outlined the site's problems, Hobson said.  </P> <P> Separately, Browning-Ferris Industries, a waste-management conglomerate in  Houston, signed a definitive agreement to invest $28.5 million in American  Ecology. In exchange, Browning-Ferris would get preferred stock, convertible  bonds and warrants which, if converted to common stock, would give  Browning-Ferris 51% of American Ecology.  </P> <P> The deal, originally proposed last October, is expected to be completed in  mid-April.  </P></p>

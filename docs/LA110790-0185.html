			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MAXI PRIEST MAINTAINS A HIGH NOTE  </P> <P> NEW YORK -- Maxi Priest recently was out shopping in London and decided to buy  some clothes. He found a nice store, selected a pair of trousers and went into  the dressing room.  </P> <P> When he came out, a line had formed for autographs.  </P> <P> "Obviously, the attention is there a lot more than it was before," said Priest,  whose sunny smile and sunny No. 1 single, "Close to You," have made him a man  worth waiting for.  </P> <P> "When I go to a club, I like to find my little corner and dance and see what's  going on, trying to enjoy myself the way I used to enjoy myself."  </P> <P> He insists that success will not change him. And even if you've heard that a  million times before, this time it might be true; Priest has always been the  center of attention. Aunts and uncles fussed over him. Girls followed him in  high school. Party guests gave him money.  </P> <P> "I was brought up in a family of nine kids, and I was the second-youngest,"  said Priest, 27, who grew up in southeast London. "When you grow up in a big  family, there's so many personalities that you learn to deal with all different  kinds of people. That also helped me develop my personality."  </P> <P> He thinks he's close to becoming a major star. "Just a Little Bit Longer" is  the next single off "Bonafide," and Priest predicts that if it becomes a hit,  "All doors are open."  </P> <P> "I know I've been gifted by God," he said. "I think there's a light shining on  me."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] President Alpha Omar Konare on 21 February  received delegations from the following opposition parties:  National Committee for Democratic Initiative, Union for  Democracy and Development, BDIA, PLT, PSP, PIDT, UDD, UFDP, and  UNDP [expansions unknown]. The parties presented an open letter  to the president of the Republic concerning the prevailing  situation of insecurity in the country. Two parties whose names  appear in the text of the letter did not sign it and were not  represented either. They are the Malian Party for Development  [PMD] and the Rally for Democracy and Progress [RDP]. Seidou  Guindo discloses the content of the communique issued at the end  of the meeting.    [Guindo] The signatories of the open letter indicated that a  system of violence has been established and is characterized by  blind repression, state terrorism, and censure. In the face of  this the situation, the signatories appealed to the president of  the Republic, the guarantor of Republican institutions, for an  immediate end to all violence: ransacking, arson, physical  aggression, threats and insults, and acts perpetrated by private  militia. They pledged to search for the appropriate means to  ensure their own protection and that of their leaders and to  take every action to counter the activities of the private  militia of the Alliance for Democracy in Mali if the militia is  not immediately disbanded. The signatories also called for the  reopening of schools, independent Radio Kaira, release of  university and high schools students and all other arrested or  kidnapped citizens in order to create a conducive atmosphere for  the resumption of dialogue. They also called for an immediate  holding of a national debate on the current social and political  crisis facing the country which threatens the very existence of  the nation.    The president of the Republic thanked his guests for the  initiative. He recalled all the efforts made by the country's  authorities to stifle the crisis and check any excesses that may  be detrimental to the democratic process. [passage omitted]    He deplored the silence observed by certain partners and  called on all and sundry to join in fighting violence which, he  said, is the worst enemy of democracy. This is why, he added,  the Republican laws must be enforce and they will be. The  essential this is that all must be done according to the norms  of a state where there is the rule of law.    Addressing opposition party representatives on education, he  said it was tragic that schools have been closed down. He  regretted that during his tenure conditions are not ripe for  students to be asked to return to classes which have been  desperately empty for a long time. He called for dialogue to be  pursued. Despite the suspension of dialogue by Association of  Malian Students and Pupils, the president of the Republic  reaffirmed his desire to strive for the reopening of schools  under conditions that are more conducive for academic work.    The president of the Republic also touched on the question  of  the closure of Radio Kaira and referred to the operational  program for independent radio stations. He expressed his  unflinching attachment to press freedom, a mainstay of democracy.    During the talks, the president of the Republic stressed the  need for all democrats and patriots to understand the necessity  of the security forces's role in preventing excesses linked with  self-defense or with the emergence of private militia. I would  not tolerate the existence of any private militia, no matter the  origin, the president said. He then called on the party  representatives to produce evidence of the existence of such  militia and arraign them before the Republican institutions. He  said he himself will see to the strict respect of rights and  public information. [passage omitted]    Speaking on allegations that the president has been  exercising pressure on magistrates, he called on his detractors  to reveal, on their honor, the identity of those who were  subjected to such pressure and expressed his concern, as  chairman of the Higher Council of the Magistrature, to ensure  that the judiciary is independent and reliable as the case is in  a state where there is the rule of law. Finally, President  Konare said he welcomed proposals from all quarters relating to  education, devaluation, and even to state media management. To  conclude, he asked the party representatives not to view this  meeting as a mere formality or just a way of calling the  national and international communities to witness only for each  side to turn coasts later and stick to its earlier position  instead of striving to find a lasting solution to the present  situation.</p>

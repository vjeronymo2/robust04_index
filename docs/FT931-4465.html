			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Czechs plan second wave of privatisation THE Czech government plans to sell companies and property worth CzK500bn (Pounds 12.1bn) in a second wave of disposals of state assets from next autumn, the privatisation ministry confirmed yesterday. More than 2,100 companies are earmarked for privatisation, though more may be added to the list until the March 15 deadline for approval by the ministry. Sectors affected by the programme include industry, agriculture, housing, services and health care. Candidate companies include names such as Budvar (beer), and Crystalex (fine glass) as well as Kotva, Prague's leading department store. Cesky Plinarsky Podnik, the Czech gas distribution and transport company, Chemopetro and Kausuk (oil refineries), and Zetor, the tractor manufacturer from Brno are also included, as are several steel companies. About 30 per cent of the value of assets to be privatised will be sold by issuing vouchers to the public that can later be used to bid for shares. The remainder will be sold through direct negotiations with potential investors, by public tender or auctions. The first wave of privatisation was completed last December before the break-up of the former Czechoslovakia into separate Czech and Slovak states on January 1. This transferred assets worth CzK630bn to the private sector. About 1,500 companies were privatised by vouchers alone.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Mar 23, BNS -- Ex-Lithuanian Defense  Minister Audrius Butkevicius supposes that the recent search in  his apartment, as well as the arrest of Vladas Laurinavicius,  president of the Kaunas-based Selma association, are part of a  defamation campaign which is already coming to light.    At a press conference in Vilnius Tuesday, Butkevicius said  the campaign was initiated by certain politicians who want  deterioration of Lithuanian-Russian relations and seek to strike  a blow to Russia's democratic forces, President Boris Yeltsin  and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. The former minister said  businessmen who are annoyed by Selma's activities are also  involved in the affair. Butkevicius said other motives are even  more pragmatic. He noted that in order to complete the  withdrawal of Russian troops from Lithuanian territory in time  it was necessary to prove to the Russian military that every  family would be given an apartment. But neither Lithuania nor  Russia had money to build housing.    The ex-minister said an agreement was reached that the money  paid by Lithuania for Russian weapons would be used for the  purpose. Lithuania purchased 5,000 Russian-made automatic rifles  and two PT boats. Russia chose Selma to build apartments by way  of contest and agreed to transfer the money to its account.    Butkevicius noted that the sum paid for the weapons was  enough to carry out only part of the housing project. In his  words, Russia decided to find other ways of financing the  project and agreed with Selma to barter oil for apartments. The  former minister said a barter contract was supposed to be signed  in Kaliningrad March 18, but the association's president was  arrested.    Butkevicius said actions of the Lithuanian prosecutor's  office clearly show that the whole case is fabricated. The  ex-minister said everybody, including himself, found out 10 days  in advance that searches would be carried out in apartments of  former and present Defense Ministry employees. There were  constant leaks of information and "even if anybody had anything,  nothing was kept at home," he said.    In Butkevicius' opinion, an attempt is made to create  tension  in Lithuanian-Russian relations. "Everybody knows that an army,  whose concentration in the Kaliningrad region is the biggest in  Europe, can be involved in politics only through social  problems."    The ex-minister sharply criticized activities of Prosecutor  General Arturas Paulauskas, MP Vytautas Petkevicius, who heads  the parliament's National Security Committee, and MP Vytautas  Juskus, who is the head of the parliamentary economic crimes  commission. Butkevicius said he met with Prime Minister Adolfas  Slezevicius Monday and agreed to participate, if necessary, in  the premier's meeting with the military and administrative  leadership of the Kaliningrad region. "But when I found out that  such experts as Paulauskas, Petkevicius and Juskus would take  part -- I decided to hold aloof."    Butkevicius categorically denied reports that the actual  weapon prices considerably differed from the ones indicated in  contracts. The ex-minister said he expected a scandal and has  documents and contracts to deny all accusations.</p>

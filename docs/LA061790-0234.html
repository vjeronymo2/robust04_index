			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEANER GAS: IS IT CLEAN ENOUGH?;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: OIL FIRMS HAVE SCRAMBLED TO BRING OUT LOWER-EMISSION FUELS. BUT  STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORS WANT THEM TO GO FURTHER. THE INDUSTRY SAYS THE  PRICE WILL BE HIGH, THE SUPPLY IN JEOPARDY.  </P> <P> Oil refiners are in a drag race for the public's gasoline dollars, but the flag  they're after isn't checkered. It's green.  </P> <P> Oil companies that once sold high octane, drivability or detergent additives  are now touting fuels that burn cleaner and produce less smog.  </P> <P> Last week Chevron Corp. became the latest of eight oil companies to introduce a  lower-emission gasoline since Atlantic Richfield Co. started the trend last  September with its EC-1 gasoline.  </P> <P> Just how clean are these new fuels? Not as clean as they probably will have to  be. And just how far is the oil industry willing to go in producing cleaner  gasoline? Apparently, not much farther than it already has.  </P> <P> Ultimately, the question may become: How clean can we make gasoline and how  much are we willing to pay for it?  </P> <P> The oil companies hope to sell more gasoline by exploiting growing  environmental awareness among consumers. But as Congress and the California Air  Resources Board contemplate stricter clean air rules, the oil companies also  want to demonstrate that gasoline should be the cleaner-burning fuel of the  future.  </P> <P> Arco's EC-1 may have helped boost gasoline atop the agenda of lower-emissions  fuels, displacing methanol, ethanol and compressed natural gas as the clean  fuel of choice among federal regulators. "We didn't come out with EC-1 to  increase share of market but to increase share of mind," said George H.  Babikian, president of Arco Products Co. in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> So far, however, none of the new gasolines would satisfy all the proposed  regulations before Congress or the state air resources board.  </P> <P> EC-1 comes closest. Others, such as Shell SU 2000E, Chevron Supreme Unleaded  and Exxon Plus, differ only slightly from ordinary gasolines. Others fall  somewhere in between. Phillips, Conoco, Marathon and Diamond Shamrock are also  selling reduced-emissions gasoline in various parts of the country, and Amoco,  Sun and Citgo are considering bringing out their own reformulated gasolines  soon.  </P> <P> All the new gasolines are being sold in tightly restricted markets, reflecting  the limited ability of oil refiners to produce them. The fuels are being made  by juggling components from other gasolines -- and refiners can take that only  so far without making major investments in new refining equipment.  </P> <P> That may underlie the oil industry's opposition to new gasoline formulations  proposed for a revised federal Clean Air Act.  </P> <P> Despite its rush to sell lower-emissions fuels, the oil industry -- led by its  main trade group, the American Petroleum Institute -- lobbied hard but  unsuccessfully against the proposed Congressional formulas, which it derisively  called "Government Gas."  </P> <P> The API estimated that the new regulations would require $10 billion to $30  billion in capital expenditures by refiners, forcing up to one-third of them  out of business. The new rules would mean retail prices could be higher by 10  to 15 cents per gallon and could even lead to gasoline shortages, the institute  claimed.  </P> <P> The industry would prefer that Congress set targets for auto emission  reductions rather than specify gasoline formulas. It would be more efficient  and less costly to let refiners then devise their own formulas to meet the  targets, the industry argues.  </P> <P> It also wants regulators to await the results of a multimillion-dollar joint  research project being conducted by the oil and auto industries on various  formulations of gasoline before settling on a formula. Those results won't be  ready until year-end.  </P> <P> But air quality officials insist on specific standards.  </P> <P> "There's no other way to regulate the actual emissions from fuel, because there  can be a variety of cars that would use it," said state Air Resources Board  spokesman Bill Sessa. At issue are the proposed changes in the federal Clean  Air Act contained in bills approved by the U.S. Senate in April and the House  of Representatives last month. The bills differ in a number of ways, but both  would mandate changes in the way gasoline is refined. A final version of the  revisions must be hammered out in a conference committee.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the state Air Resources Board staff is developing proposals for  reformulated gasoline. The board is supposed to vote on them in September.  Where federal and state regulations overlap, the state board's rules would take  precedence. Unlike Congress, the state is also contemplating rules that would  require the use of alternative fuels beyond gasoline.  </P> <P> The proposed rules would be among the most sweeping since state and federal  governments began dictating what goes into gasoline. California led the way in  the 1970s by setting limits on vapor pressure, or the tendency of gasoline to  evaporate. It later required the phase-out of lead, a toxic substance linked to  learning disorders in children.  </P> <P> Since then, other states that once regulated only octane have begun to set  standards for gasoline components.  </P> <P> The federal government got into the act later. In 1975, it followed California  in requiring the phase-out of lead nationwide, perhaps the biggest change in  the refining of gasoline until now. Just last year, the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency set national standards for vapor pressure.  </P> <P> "We have gone through major sea changes in the required chemical composition of  gasoline over our history," said industry analyst Bernard J. Picchi at Salomon  Bros. in New York. "Perhaps the most dramatic switch was the change from leaded  to unleaded gasoline, and I think that was actually a more wrenching change for  the industry than what is being contemplated here -- and that transition took  place without there being a major dislocation."  </P> <P> In contrast to the API, the EPA estimates the added cost to consumers of the  new gas rules will be only 5 to 10 cents per gallon. Moreover, the API's  $10-billion to $30-billion capital estimate is high, critics argue.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration puts the cost of the entire clean air law -- not just  provisions dealing with reformulated gasoline -- at just $21.5 billion.  </P> <P> There is also disagreement over what effects the House and Senate versions of  the Clean Air Act would have.  </P> <P> Both bills would require the addition beginning in 1992 of high levels of  oxygenates to gasoline sold in the nine smoggiest U.S. cities, including Los  Angeles. More oxygenates would promote more efficient burning and reduce  certain emissions, proponents argue.  </P> <P> Both bills would also make refiners reduce aromatics and benzene, the most  polluting components of gasoline. (Unlike the Senate bill, the House bill gives  refiners flexibility on gasoline formulation, if they can meet or exceed  emissions standards.)  </P> <P> "The legislation passed by the House sets extremely stringent standards for  reformulated gasoline," said Charles J. DiBona, president of API.  </P> <P> He added in a statement: "Unless substantial changes are made in this  legislation by a House-Senate conference committee, it may not be possible for  the industry to continue to meet the fuel needs of consumers."  </P> <P> Among other things, API argued that there is a significant shortage of a key  oxygenate, methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE. Lower-emissions gasolines now  on the market all contain MTBE, but generally at less than half the levels that  would be required by 1994.  </P> <P> Critics of the oil industry argue that refiners are less worried about higher  costs or fuel shortages than they are about losing control of what goes into  the nation's gasoline pool -- and giving up some of the attendant profits.  </P> <P> By requiring higher levels of oxygenates, Congress will force refiners to go to  outside sources for the chemicals if they can't make enough themselves.  </P> <P> If the oxygenate is MTBE, that would mean eventually relinquishing control of  15% of the gasoline pool. Some of that business would undoubtedly go to foreign  manufacturers.  </P> <P> If refiners are forced to rely on ethanol, it would mean a sizable increase in  business for Archer Daniels Midland, the agriculture conglomerate that produces  about 45% of the nation's ethanol.  </P> <P> Critics also argue that API has exaggerated the disruption that would result  from the new rules.  </P> <P> Even some refiners admit privately that they can accommodate the requirements  of the proposed clean air bills, though they may not like having to shell out  the capital investments.  </P> <P> "Nobody likes to be forced to make dramatic changes that aren't kind of  market-driven and that you have time to work into," said David Kem, general  manager of marketing in North America for Conoco Inc. in Houston. "But this  industry has adapted to other things, and I think it will adapt to this."  </P> <P> "I do not think it is going to result in the closure of refineries; in fact, I  would argue just the opposite," Picchi said. "As a result of the new higher  level of capital spending required to retool refineries . . . , you'll probably  see refiners at the same time taking advantage of the situation to spend more  money to expand capacity."  </P> <P> That's because the clean air requirements could make it easier to get permits  that might otherwise be hard-won, particularly in environmentally sensitive  areas such as Los Angeles, he said.  </P> <P> Atlantic Richfield, for one, is planning to expand gasoline-making capacity at  its refineries in Carson and Cherry Point, Wash., at the same time that it  retools to make more reformulated gasoline.  </P> <P> In the next five years, Arco plans to spend $1.1 billion at the refineries to  make reformulated gasoline. After that, it will spend $1 billion to $1.3  billion to meet future requirements for the fuel.  </P> <P> Shell, the nation's largest gasoline marketer, which introduced a reformulated  gasoline in April in the nine smoggiest cities, is studying upgrades at six of  its seven refineries -- a process that will take years and cost billions.  </P> <P> MTBE capacity nationally is about 100,000 barrels per day, well short of the  289,000 barrels expected to be needed for gasoline consumed in the nine  smoggiest cities as required under the proposed revisions, said Roy Sugimoto, a  researcher with the consulting firm DeWitt &amp; Co. in Houston, which tracks  MTBE projects.  </P> <P> But 110,000 barrels per day of new capacity is already planned, and  construction on several plants could begin within the next year or two at an  average cost of $160 million to $180 million per plant, he said.  </P> <P> Tenneco is planning one of the new MTBE plants -- a 12,500-barrel-per-day  facility to be completed in the spring of 1992.  </P> <P> "We are aware of an additional five to six projects of similar size now being  planned in the industry and expect that between eight and twelve projects could  be built in the United States by 1994 to meet growing octane and clean-air  demands," Tenneco executive Michael Falco wrote in a letter to Sen. Thomas A.  Daschle, the South Dakota Democrat who co-wrote the Senate amendment.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, it's too early to say whether any of the existing reformulated  gasolines is taking its market by storm. But early signs are that the fuels are  winning some public acceptance.  </P> <P> Arco says EC-1, being sold in the Los Angeles area to former customers of its  leaded regular gasoline, has been gaining market share slowly each month and  now accounts for about a third of the leaded regular market in Southern  California.  </P> <P> That performance is particularly good given that the regular leaded market is  declining, Arco's Babikian said.  </P> <P> Have the new gasolines had a measurable effect on air quality? Again, it's too  soon to tell. California air quality officials confirm Arco's claims that EC-1  would cut pollutants from older cars by about 20%. But clean-air advocates  agree that the current reformulated gasolines are only a first step.  </P> <P> "We have no idea how clean you can make a refined petroleum product," said  David Hawkins, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an  environmental group. "And I'm not sure the industry has any idea either."  </P> <P> REFORMULATED GASOLINES NOW ON THE MARKET  </P> <P> COMPANY: ARCO  </P> <P> GASOLINE: EC-1  </P> <P> VOLATILITY (maximum summer RVP): 8 psi  </P> <P> AROMATICS (maximum % by volume): 20%  </P> <P> BENZENE (maximum % by volume): 1%  </P> <P> OLEFINS (max. % by vol.): 10%  </P> <P> SULFUR (parts per mil.): 300  </P> <P> OXYGEN (% by weight): 1%  </P> <P> WHERE AVAILABLE: Southern California  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMPANY: DIAMOND SHAMROCK  </P> <P> GASOLINE: RG-87  </P> <P> VOLATILITY (maximum summer RVP): 8.5  </P> <P> AROMATICS (maximum % by volume): 20%  </P> <P> BENZENE (maximum % by volume): 1%  </P> <P> OLEFINS (max. % by vol.):10%  </P> <P> SULFUR (parts per mil.): 300  </P> <P> OXYGEN (% by weight): 1-2%  </P> <P> WHERE AVAILABLE: Denver area  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMPANY: SHELL  </P> <P> GASOLINE: SU 2000E  </P> <P> VOLATILITY (maximum summer RVP): 8.0-8.5  </P> <P> AROMATICS (maximum % by volume): 40%  </P> <P> BENZENE (maximum % by volume): 1.3-2.2%  </P> <P> OLEFINS (max. % by vol.): 10%  </P> <P> SULFUR (parts per mil.): 100  </P> <P> OXYGEN (% by weight): 1%  </P> <P> WHERE AVAILABLE: New York, Hartford, Conn.; Philadelphia, Baltimore,  Washington, Los Angeles, San Diego, Houston, Chicago, Milwaukee  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMPANY: MARATHON  </P> <P> GASOLINE: Amaraclean  </P> <P> VOLATILITY (maximum summer RVP): 9.5  </P> <P> AROMATICS (maximum % by volume): 25%  </P> <P> BENZENE (maximum % by volume): N/A  </P> <P> OLEFINS (max. % by vol.): N/A  </P> <P> SULFUR (parts per mil.): 100  </P> <P> OXYGEN (% by weight): 1.8%  </P> <P> WHERE AVAILABLE: Detroit area  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMPANY: PHILLIPS  </P> <P> GASOLINE: SuperClean Unleaded Plus  </P> <P> VOLATILITY (maximum summer RVP): 8.5-9.0  </P> <P> AROMATICS (maximum % by volume): 20%  </P> <P> BENZENE (maximum % by volume): 0.8%  </P> <P> OLEFINS (max. % by vol.): 10%  </P> <P> SULFUR (parts per mil.): 300  </P> <P> OXYGEN (% by weight): 1-2%  </P> <P> WHERE AVAILABLE: Denver and St. Louis  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMPANY: CONOCO  </P> <P> GASOLINE: Regular RXL  </P> <P> VOLATILITY (maximum summer RVP): 8.5  </P> <P> AROMATICS (maximum % by volume): 17-22%  </P> <P> BENZENE (maximum % by volume): 1.5-2.0%  </P> <P> OLEFINS (max. % by vol.): N/A  </P> <P> SULFUR (parts per mil.): 300  </P> <P> OXYGEN (% by weight): 2.5% (winter)  </P> <P> WHERE AVAILABLE: Denver, Yellowstone  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMPANY: EXXON  </P> <P> GASOLINE: Exxon Plus, Exxon Supreme  </P> <P> VOLATILITY (maximum summer RVP): 8.5  </P> <P> AROMATICS (maximum % by volume): 35% (avg.)  </P> <P> BENZENE (maximum % by volume): 1%  </P> <P> OLEFINS (max. % by vol.): 15%  </P> <P> SULFUR (parts per mil.): 300  </P> <P> OXYGEN (% by weight): 1% (N.Y. only)  </P> <P> WHERE AVAILABLE: 20 Gulf Coast and Northeastern states  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMPANY: CHEVRON  </P> <P> GASOLINE: Chevron Supreme Unleaded  </P> <P> VOLATILITY (maximum summer RVP): 8.0-8.5  </P> <P> AROMATICS (maximum % by volume): 35-40%  </P> <P> BENZENE (maximum % by volume): 2.0-2.5%  </P> <P> OLEFINS (max. % by vol.): 5-13%  </P> <P> SULFUR (parts per mil.): 100-200  </P> <P> OXYGEN (% by weight): 1%  </P> <P> WHERE AVAILABLE: L.A., San Diego, Santa Barbara, Ventura, Houston, Washington,  Baltimore  </P> <P> NOTES: RVP=Reid Vapor Pressure  </P> <P> N/A=Not available  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENT AND PROPOSED GASOLINE STANDARDS  </P> <P> OTHER PROVISIONS:  </P> <P> SENATE BILL For nine dirtiest cities  </P> <P> VOLATILITY (maximum summer rvp): --  </P> <P> AROMATICS (maximum % by volume):  </P> <P> 1992: 30%  </P> <P> 1994: 28%  </P> <P> 1996: 25%  </P> <P> BENZENE (maximum % by volume): 1992: 1.0%  </P> <P> OLEFINS (max. % by vol.): --  </P> <P> SULFUR (Parts per mil.): --  </P> <P> OXYGEN (% by weight): 1992: 2% (b)  </P> <P> 1993: 2.5  </P> <P> 1994: 2.7 (e)  </P> <P> OTHER PROVISIONS: Requires 15% reduction in ozone-producing volatile organic  compounds (VOCs) by 1992  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOUSE BILL (c) For nine dirtiest cities  </P> <P> VOLATILITY (maximum summer rvp): --  </P> <P> AROMATICS (maximum % by volume):  </P> <P> 1992: 30% (a)  </P> <P> 1994: 28%  </P> <P> 1996: 25%  </P> <P> BENZENE (maximum % by volume): 1994: 0.8%  </P> <P> OLEFINS (max. % by vol.): --  </P> <P> SULFUR (Parts per mil.): --  </P> <P> OXYGEN (% by weight):  </P> <P> 1992: 2% (b)  </P> <P> 1993: 2.5  </P> <P> 1994: 2.7 (f)  </P> <P> OTHER PROVISIONS:  </P> <P> 15% VOC cut by '94  </P> <P> 20% cut by 1997  </P> <P> 25% cut by 2000  </P> <P> 15% toxics cut by '94  </P> <P> 20% by 1997  </P> <P> 25% by 2000  </P> <P> </P> <P> CALIF.

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Setback for Canadian banking deal THE LAURENTIAN Bank's plan to buy part of Standard Trustco for around CDollars 55m (USDollars 47.8m) has run into opposition. Several institutional lenders to Standard Trustco, saying they are owed CDollars 100m, have asked the courts in Ontario to appoint a receiver so they can take control of the company. The receiver would operate Standard Trustco and negotiate the sale of assets with any bidders, including Laurentian Bank. Standard Trustco is in default on loan payments to 25 creditors, including Bank of Tokyo Canada and Swiss Bank Corporation. Laurentian Bank, based in Montreal, proposed taking over part of Standard Trustco's operating subsidiary, Standard Trust, with deposits of CDollars 1.2bn and more than 30 branches. But this was conditional on approval of the lenders, who now object to the terms. The trust company is financed separately. Standard Trustco is 48 per cent held by Roman Corporation, the holding company of the late Canadian mining magnate, Stephen Roman. It also controls Denison Mines, a big Canadian uranium producer also facing financial problems. BEAR Stearns has issued Dollars 150m of non-callable senior notes due April 15, 1998, the US investment bank said. The 9 1/8 per cent notes were priced at 99.58 to yield 9.207 per cent or 130 basis points over Treasuries.</p>

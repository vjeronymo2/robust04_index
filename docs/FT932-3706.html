			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: US economy Yesterday's US unchanged producer prices index was greeted by some like the relief of Mafeking. The worsening inflation picture had increased speculation that the Federal Reserve was about to raise interest rates. Yet the much-improved figures also hinted at more good news to come. A spike in food prices has yet to be unwound and tobacco prices actually rose during May, against the trend of the cigarette brand wars. The immediate threat of higher rates has thus receded. Nevertheless, increased interest rates later in the year are still a possibility, with hints from the Fed suggesting that consumer price inflation remains too high. The Fed chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, is due to give his regular testimony to Congress next month. If he lays less emphasis on the health of the financial system and more on inflation, that will probably mark an ending of the Fed's easy money policy. An autumn interest rate increase would, however, coincide with the impact of President Clinton's budget package. That will probably prove quite deflationary, and the risk is that both fiscal and monetary policy will be tightened simultaneously. Growth may thus slow in 1994. While inflation is not low enough to please the Fed, tough conditions may prevent companies widening margins. That will make the strong earnings increases which Wall Street currently expects harder to achieve. Equities are still vulnerable.</p>

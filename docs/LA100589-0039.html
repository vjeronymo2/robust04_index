			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PAIN IS PLAINLY NOT ON THE WANE FOR MCMAHON  </P> <P> Is Jim McMahon hurting, or isn't he? If he is hurting, how badly?  </P> <P> These questions refuse to go away, and they received another airing Wednesday  when the Chargers began preparations for Sunday's game against the Broncos in  Denver.  </P> <P> The latest round of confusion began when the Chargers listed McMahon as  questionable on their injury report because of a sore back. This meant -- on  the surface at least -- that they felt the veteran quarterback had only a 50-50  chance to play Sunday.  </P> <P> Since McMahon had gone all the way against the Phoenix Cardinals last Sunday,  his entry on the injury report was a surprise on two counts.  </P> <P> McMahon has had sore ribs since the season opener, but the problem obviously  hasn't been serious. Also, the Chargers reported after the Phoenix game that he  had a stiff neck. They didn't mention anything about his back.  </P> <P> The mystery deepened when McMahon took his full complement of snaps in  Wednesday's practice session. And, predictably, both he and Coach Dan Henning  said afterward that he definitely would play Sunday.  </P> <P> When McMahon was approached on the matter, he said, "It's just the same old  nagging thing I've had all year."  </P> <P> Asked why he had been listed as questionable, he said, "Ask them. I didn't say  anything. I've played for three weeks with it, so why would there be any  question about playing this week?"  </P> <P> McMahon added that he wasn't happy about the way the offense had functioned in  the workout.  </P> <P> "If we play like we practiced on offense today, we're not going to do a hell of  a lot," he said. "Maybe it was just a bad day, but we didn't do much."  </P> <P> Good day or bad, the question at hand was McMahon's physical condition, and  this was how Henning dealt with it in his meeting with reporters:  </P> <P> Question: McMahon was listed as questionable, yet he worked out. Why  questionable?  </P> <P> Answer: He strained his neck in the Phoenix game.  </P> <P> Q: But now they say it's his back that hurts?  </P> <P> A: Well, it's the back of his body.  </P> <P> Q: But why questionable?  </P> <P> A: I don't make up the list.  </P> <P> Q: Is there any question that he will play?  </P> <P> A: No, he's just questionable. But he practiced and didn't show any ill  effects. He's been taking treatments. It's a nagging-type thing.  </P> <P> Q: Why is he listed as questionable this week when he wasn't last week?  </P> <P> A: I don't know. Does it make any difference? It's probably because we're  pressed to make up the report before practice each Wednesday.  </P> <P> Q: Then is there any doubt that McMahon will play Sunday?  </P> <P> A: I think the guy will play.  </P> <P> That settles it, then. McMahon is still sore, be it in the ribs, neck or back,  but you can count on his presence at quarterback in Denver.  </P> <P> Also on the Chargers' injury front, Henning said that offensive tackle Joel  Patten (knee) probably would miss Sunday's game and that wide receiver Quinn  Early (knee) and cornerback Sammy Seale (shoulder) wouldn't play unless they  healed quickly.  </P> <P> "Patten just doesn't figure to be ready," Henning said. "Early is between  doubtful and questionable. He says he'll be ready, but being a receiver, he has  to have his normal speed, and I don't know if he will. Seale can't do any  hitting right now, so I'd call him questionable."  </P> <P> Patten was listed as doubtful, and Henning said he planned to start Joey Howard  in his place. Howard, 6-5 and 305 (two pounds lighter than Patten), was the  Chargers' ninth-round draft choice last year but spent the season on injured  reserve with a bad knee. He didn't play at all this season until Patten got  hurt in the third quarter in Phoenix.  </P> <P> Patten didn't practice, and Larry Beightol, offensive coordinator and offensive  line coach, said, "I have a rule that if a guy can't practice one of the two  work days (Wednesday and Thursday), he can't start. Right now, Howard is the  starter."  </P> <P> Told of this, Howard said, "I'm looking forward to the opportunity, but it's so  far off. This is only Wednesday."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Five Chargers listed as questionable are expected to play Sunday. They are  running back Marion Butts (sternum), wide receiver Anthony Miller (back), wide  receiver Darryl Usher (hamstring), strong safety Martin Bayless (quadriceps)  and H-back Rod Bernstine (knee). . . . Listed as probable are center Courtney  Hall (ankle), defensive end Burt Grossman (wrist), defensive end Lee Williams  (back), cornerback Gill Byrd (ankle), linebacker Gary Plummer (shoulder) and  offensive tackle Brett Miller (knee). . . . The Broncos have a brief injury  report. Nose tackle Greg Kragen (knee) is out and center Keith Kartz (ear), an  alumnus of San Dieguito High School, is probable.  </P></p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Peru's top lady to run for top job Ms Susana Higuchi, wife of President Alberto Fujimori and in recent weeks his most outspoken critic, has announced that she will run as an opposition candidate for the presidency of Peru in the election due next April. Her decision - which Peruvians were half-wanting, half-dreading - follows six weeks of public feuding by the presidential pair. It will polarise the national political scene. Many Peruvians also fear it will cloud their country's rapidly improving international image with the spectre of instability. Announcing both her candidacy and the formation of a new political movement  -Harmony Twenty-first Century - Ms Higuchi firmly rejected that interpretation. 'When I see so much corruption, so many broken pledges, I feel the moral obligation to confront the closed circles of political power,' she said. 'I will fulfil the commitments my husband assumed, but with the transparency Peru deserves.' Her husband and his ruling alliance may accuse her of disloyalty, but her intention, she said, is to expose illegality, unconstitutionality and corruption within the government, rather than to oppose policy. In past weeks, Ms Higuchi has laid a series of allegations before state prosecutors, denouncing various cabinet ministers for corruption. The charges, she complains, have been shelved with only cursory investigation. She also says her private telephone is constantly tapped and that she is being prevented from seeing her four teenage children. Although early opinion polls do not indicate much public support for Ms Higuchi, her corruption allegations - if substantiated - could be damaging to an administration which has vaunted its honesty and 'technocratic' approach. Besides, with Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, former UN secretary-general, expected to announce his candidacy on September 23, what once looked to be an easy ride to re-election for Mr Fujimori could be a tough campaign. Mr Fujimori, exasperated at the transformation into political opponent of his once-loyal wife, who was a linch-pin of his 1990 presidential campaign, has stripped her of her official title of First Lady. Ms Higuchi has now moved out of the government palace to camp in a pre-university academy which she founded years ago with her husband. From there, she will run the foundation for underprivileged children over which she presides - and her campaign. The Harmony political movement - the word 'party' is still taboo in Peru thanks both to previous political crises and systematic vilification of the party political system by Mr Fujimori - is, as yet, an unknown factor. It seems to be rooted in a women's group with backing from several respected feminist lawyers who have been helping Ms Higuchi to launch her political career. There remains a legal stumbling-block to a candidacy by Ms Higuchi, however. For her to run, the national electoral board, which is supposed to be independent, will have to quash a law, recently passed by the ruling Fujimori alliance, which prohibits relatives of the president seeking elective office in Peru. Ms Higuchi claims the law is unconstitutional.</p>

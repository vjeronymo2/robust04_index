			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHENEY COURTS SUPPORT AS NOMINATION HEARINGS BEGIN  </P> <P> President Bush's second defense secretary-designate, Republican Rep. Dick  Cheney of Wyoming, moved quickly Tuesday to rally support for his confirmation,  promising to make tough budget choices and to consult closely with lawmakers on  the controversial issue of nuclear missile modernization.  </P> <P> But in his first day of confirmation hearings, Cheney, 48, cautioned against  reducing U.S. military forces before the Soviet Union has made good on its  promises to scale back Soviet forces.  </P> <P> "There's a real danger in the West that the perception of change (in the Soviet  Union) will outstrip the reality of change," Cheney warned. The United States,  he added, must not "fall into the trap here of responding to the proposal of  the week" in devising its arms control negotiating positions and in seeking  savings in defense spending.  </P> <P> Hailed by home-state Republican Sen. Alan K. Simpson as "steady and  unflappable," Cheney faced friendly questioning by the Democrat-controlled  Senate Armed Services Committee, whose rejection of Bush's first choice, former  Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.), led to Tower's defeat last Thursday on the Senate  floor.  </P> <P> In the wake of the Senate's close scrutiny of Tower's personal life, Cheney  took pains to allay fears that his heart condition would impose restrictions on  his service.  </P> <P> In a letter delivered Tuesday to committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.),  Washington-based cardiologist Allan M. Ross said that Cheney, who has had three  heart attacks since 1977, has been cleared "to pursue unrestricted professional  and recreational objectives."  </P> <P> He wrote that Cheney's high cholesterol levels have been reversed with drugs,  but added that "Cheney's pharmacological regimen is free of any side effects  that would affect his judgment or behavior."  </P> <P> Ross' letter was one of several documents, including tax filings and extensive  financial disclosure forms, that the Senate panel has received on Cheney since  the Wyoming legislator was chosen last Friday.  </P> <P> Nunn promised that the committee will deal with Cheney's nomination speedily  and some lawmakers said they hope he can be confirmed later this week. But  Nunn, who engineered Tower's 53-47 Senate defeat last week, would not give a  timetable, warning that no final action will be taken before the White House  provides further documents, including a full background check by the FBI.  </P> <P> "We will not be taking any shortcuts," Nunn said.  </P> <P> At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater was asked when the FBI  checks on Cheney will be finished. "They're trying to move those as rapidly as  possible. . . . I don't have a specific date," he said.  </P> <P> Cheney also sought to assure committee members that his lack of military  service was not the result of any effort to avoid the draft. Cheney volunteered  an explanation for his failure to serve in the military. When he became  eligible for the draft in 1959, Cheney said, older men were being drafted. He  added that he was in school pursuing graduate degrees between 1963 and 1968,  when he would likely have been drafted, and that he was given a parental  deferment after 1966, when his first daughter was born.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I would have been happy to serve had I been called," Cheney said.  </P> <P> Cheney's comments on defense policy, an area in which his legislative  experience has been limited, were greeted favorably by committee members who  praised his reputation for competence.  </P> <P> Cheney said he had not made a decision on one of the most controversial issues  facing him. He said that in the past he has backed development of a rail-based  scheme for the MX missile as well as a small mobile missile widely known as  Midgetman.  </P> <P> But he acknowledged that he will have to make a decision soon. "Obviously we're  in a situation where for budgetary reasons we have to make tough choices"  between the two options, Cheney said. "Under ideal circumstances, we would be  able to proceed with both," he added.  </P> <P> He did, however, dismiss one of the principal criticisms lodged against the  cheaper rail-based scheme for MX -- that it would be vulnerable to a surprise  Soviet nuclear strike.  </P> <P> "As a general proposition, I believe we do have adequate early warning  capabilities," said Cheney, who has been a member of the House Select Committee  on Intelligence for five years. "I personally think that the odds of a  bolt-from-the-blue attack are extremely remote."  </P> <P> Cheney also told the committee that the Bush Administration's decision to  freeze the defense budget this year and permit only modest growth in the next  may force many unpopular decisions, including possible reductions in "Star  Wars" missile defenses and troop cuts.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is, we can't buy everything we want to buy with the money we  have today," Cheney said. "I see that as a mandate."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USIU TO MEET WITH OTHER SCHOOLS ABOUT FORMING A NEW CONFERENCE  </P> <P> Two years ago, U.S. International Athletic Director Al Palmiotto surveyed  available Division I independents to see if there was interest in forming a new  athletic conference. Eight of the 13 schools he contacted replied.  </P> <P> On May 3, officials from prospective members will meet at USIU to discuss  details of the proposal, giving Palmiotto a clearer idea of how close USIU is  to reaching its goal.  </P> <P> In February, Palmiotto received commitments from Chicago State, Northeastern  Illinois, Missouri-Kansas City and Wisconsin-Milwaukee. With recent interest  shown by Sacramento State and Cal State Northridge, the possibility of  assembling a conference of six teams -- the minimum required by the NCAA -- has  taken another step forward. Southern Utah and Youngstown (Ohio) State are also  considering membership.  </P> <P> Palmiotto said he hopes the meeting will settle several issues, including the  appointment of a commissioner and the naming of a director of marketing and  broadcasting.  </P> <P> "I hope to get a commitment from athletic directors and coaches," he said, "to  resolve the sports, choose a date to venture forth and to put in our  application (to the NCAA) and to get funding commitments for the application."  </P> <P> The conference would begin in 1991-92, although the Gulls already regularly  schedule several of the interested schools. Palmiotto said the NCAA-minimum six  sports would most likely include men's basketball, cross county, golf, tennis,  soccer and baseball.  </P> <P> "Some of the schools have some more variables to look at," Palmiotto said, "but  we think we have six sports, and that's what's important. And we're almost all  aligned."  </P> <P> If those sports were chosen, Chicago State would have to add two sports, four  other schools one.  </P> <P> Palmiotto originally had planned a private meeting with Dennis Keihn,  Northeastern Illinois athletic director and someone with whom he has worked  closely on the project. But Palmiotto opted for the joint meeting instead and  said everybody but Wisconsin-Milwaukee will be there.  </P> <P> "We have some great cities in Chicago, L.A. and San Diego. Those are great  markets," Palmiotto said. "One big thing, is we're looking at schools with  great marketing ability in their areas, and TV is a key ingredient in those  market areas."  </P> <P> Traveling long distances will still be a problem but one Palmiotto thinks will  be minimal.  </P> <P> "I know a lot of people think we're all over the place," he said, "but the fact  is, when you join a conference, 50% of your games are home already."  </P> <P> Because many of the schools are clustered in the same areas, Palmiotto said  travel could actually improve.  </P> <P> "The athletes won't be away as much on a consistent basis," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO CHARGES ON PILOT WHO UPSTAGED B-2  </P> <P> No criminal charges will be brought against Brian Green, the private pilot who  upstaged the planned debut of the B-2 stealth bomber when he made an  unauthorized landing Saturday at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale.  </P> <P> Green made an innocent mistake, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley.  </P> <P> "There was no criminal intent," Cooley said. "He had a flight plan. He became  disoriented."  </P> <P> Green still could face possible suspension of his pilot's license or other  administrative action by the Federal Aviation Administration.  </P> <P> Green, of Porterville in Tulare County, was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of  criminal trespassing. Air Force Plant 42 was closed for the planned inaugural  flight of the once super-secret B-2 when Green landed his Cessna 172 on a  runway near the stealth bomber and a horde of security agents, military  officials, reporters and camera crews.  </P> <P> Green was headed from Porterville to Agua Dulce Airpark with his 9-year-old  nephew and 8-year-old niece when he became lost and decided to land at the  nearest airport. The Air Force control tower personnel were unable to reach him  because he was on a different radio frequency.  </P></p>

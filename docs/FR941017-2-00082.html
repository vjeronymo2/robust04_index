If a member organization receives an exercise instruction or tenders an exercise notice to the OCC pursuant to one of the exceptions described above, the member organization must maintain a memorandum setting forth the circumstances giving rise to the exception. If the member organization is relying on either the first or third exception described above, it must promptly file a copy of the memorandum with the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As used herein, the term ``member organization'' also includes individual members of the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Amex Rule 980.

For a member organization or clearing member, an exercise instruction is a notice to The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') to exercise an option that would not be automatically exercised pursuant to OCC's exercise-by-exception procedure (``OCC Rule 805''), or not to exercise an option that otherwise would automatically be exercised pursuant to the OCC Rule 805. See infra note 14. The OCC has separate rules regarding the cut-off time by which exercise notices must be delivered to the OCC by the clearing members. The proposed rule change does not in any way affect the rules of the OCC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In most cases, exercise instructions are transmitted to Exchange clearing members electronically through the Clearing Management and Control System (``C/MACS''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 980 also does not apply to expiring index options.

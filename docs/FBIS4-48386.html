			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 18 SAPA -- Political exiles who  returned to South Africa under temporary indemnity from  prosecution have had their period of indemnity extended to May  17, 1995. The announcement in a Government Gazette this week  has nothing to do with the possible amnesty for political  offenders mentioned by president Nelson Mandela in his  inauguration speech on Tuesday last week.    Exiles who committed politically-motivated crimes before  October 8, 1990 were granted temporary indemnity from  prosecution for a one-year period and this has been extended  every year by a year at a time.    The provision is understood to embrace cabinet ministers,  among them Housing Minister Joe Slovo who is a former chief of  staff of the African National Congress' armed Wing Umkhonto We  Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], and Umkhonto commander and now  Defence Minister Joe Modise.    As the indemnity act of 1990 now stands, people who  committed  offences before October 8, 1990 may apply for indemnity from  prosecution for politically-motivated offences. The  constitution provides for this cut-off date to be extended until  December 6, 1993. Mr Mandela has indicated that the cabinet  will soon take a final decision on the matter.</p>

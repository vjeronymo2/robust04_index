			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> No Idol Worship for MTV: Singer Billy Idol was told by MTV once again to cut it  out. The original version of Idol's new video, "L.A. Woman," was rejected by  the channel because of several alleged references to bondage.  </P> <P> MTV objected particularly to the depiction of a Marilyn Monroe figure who is  featured on a telephone pole as part of a dream sequence at the beginning of  the video. Idol said that the image was to be a metaphor for what L.A. does to  its women. The edited version of the video premiered Wednesday on MTV. Two  years ago, the channel rejected Idol's original video for "Hot in the City."  Chrysalis Records will release a home package in September that will contain  unedited versions of Idol videos.

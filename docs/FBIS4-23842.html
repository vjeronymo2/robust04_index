			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The approval of the document regarding the  installation of the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] and its senior officials has been postponed due  to last minute differences. Everything remains the same, since  at the last minute the UNITA representatives decided to postpone  approving the document being discussed, alleging that they need  more time to reflect. UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin  Beye, who is mediating the Angolan peace process, is trying to  control the situation by holding constant meetings with the  UNITA team.    Meanwhile, the mediator has decided to release the  government's negotiating team until 1600 tomorrow. It is  presumed that by then UNITA may have a concrete and objective  idea regarding the document still being discussed, which  well-informed sources say may be approved. If that happens, the  government and UNITA negotiators will then discuss the  implementation of modalities on installing UNITA and its senior  officials.</p>

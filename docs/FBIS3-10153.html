			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 17  February.    The auction of the Ilo copper processing plant was suspended  on 2 February after the three companies that won the  international bid declined to submit their offers in the face of  the $70 million base price proposed by the government. They also  were compelled to make a $20 million minimum investment. (Lima  LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 3 Feb 94 p 8)    The Economy and Finance Ministry on 11 February assumed  responsibility for the total foreign medium- and long-range debt  of National Telecommunications Enterprise Peru, Entel Peru, as a  step to its privatization, which will begin on 28 February. So  far there are five consortiums interested in buying Entel and  the Peruvian Telephone Company, CPT. The base price is $525  million, of which $190 million will be used to increase CPT's  capital and the remainder will be divided between CPT and Entel.  (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 12 Feb 94 p A23)</p>

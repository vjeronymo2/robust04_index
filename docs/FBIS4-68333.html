			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Veronika Romanenkova: "Orientation on the Sun. </F> The `KoronaS-I' Station Looks Steadily at the Star"]    [Text] An automatic universal station with orientation on  the sun, the "KoronaS-I," was launched on the morning of 2 March  from the Plesetsk cosmodrome by means of a Tsiklon booster. The  implementation of the international project "KoronaS" (Complex  Orbital Circumterrestrial Observations of Solar Activity),  initiated yesterday, will make it possible to obtain new data on  the star closest to the Earth. The sun is not only an energy  source vitally important for earthlings, but also is the object  responsible for magnetic storms causing malfunctions of  equipment and even its complete breakdown.    The space vehicle will carry 12 sets of instruments, four of  which exceed the world quality level. These include the Russian  Terek telescope, the Defos, intended for research on global  solar oscillations, the SKL for research on solar cosmic rays  and the Sors solar microwave spectrometer.    The booster and vehicle were fabricated in the Ukraine.  Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, France, the  United States and Germany also participated in the project.    The participation of these countries in the project is  attributable to the fact that Russia already for many years has  studied the sun and has attained good results. But recently  there has not been enough money to go around. And it has been  advantageous for other countries to join with the USSR, saving  considerable sums and entering the ranks of leaders in the solar  research field.    The automatic orbital station, being situated alongside the  sun, will make measurements whose implementation from the Earth  is impossible. With its assistance it will be possible to make a  more detailed study of the sun's internal structure, to  investigate the phenomena transpiring on this star, and to  ascertain the reason for the "escape" of jets of matter from the  sun.    The guaranteed lifetime of the KoronaS-I is a year, but  Professor Viktor Orayevskiy, doctor of physical and mathematical  sciences, scientific director of the project, director of the  Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave  Propagation (IZMIR), Russian Academy of Sciences, hopes that the  satellite will operate for six or seven years, to the next solar  activity peak. The "KoronaS-I" will operate in a so-called  quasisolar synchronous orbit. This means that for approximately  25 days the satellite will not "set" in the Earth's shadow but  will "look" at the sun. Then a drift of the orbit will occur,  the space vehicle will enter the shadow and after some time will  return to its place.</p>

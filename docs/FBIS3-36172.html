During these sessions, the  final composition of these committees was determined, and there  were also discussions about the paramount questions which the  upper chamber's deputies will soon be addressing. A chairman of  the Committee for Security and Defense Questions was also  elected. This was Petr Shirshov.    Compared to some of the other committees, this one is not  particularly large. It comprises only 18 people, one of whom is  a woman. The committee members represent practically all of  Russia's regions, including the eight Far Eastern regions. It  is to be noted that the committee's deputy chairman is a seaman,  Captain First Rank Petr Premyak, who is also chairman of  Kamchatka Supreme Soviet of People's Deputies. The committee  also comprises many former and "active" servicemen. For  example, readers are quite familiar with Committee Member Ruslan  Aushev who basically needs no introduction. Other committee  members are just as well known -- Maritime Kray Administration  Head Yevgeniy Nazdratenko, and also defense industry lobbyist  Petr Romanov who ran for the post of deputy chairman of the  upper chamber.    They will be expected to tackle a considerable work load.  They know about the decision by Army General Pavel Grachev,  Russian Federation minister of defense, to establish a special  group to cooperate with the upper chamber committee, including  cooperation on security and defense issues. It will comprise  four people.    Following discussion of the main spheres of its activity,  the  committee leaders proceeded to allocate the responsibilities and  work organization of the apparatus.    From the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA file: Committee Chairman Petr  Petrovich Shirshov is a major general of the reserve. He was  born in 1945. He is a Russian. He graduated from Orenburg  Higher Surface-to-Air Missile Command School. He has served in  the Air Defense Forces. He has performed military service in 12  locations. His most recent posting is the city of Bryansk.</p>

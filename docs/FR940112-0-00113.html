			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Section 500.2&blank;Terms Defined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is making both significant and minor technical changes to this section. The Commission amends subsection (a) to include a reference to the 1992 statute amending FPLA and subsection (c) to reflect that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency rather than the Secretary of Agriculture enforces the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. Subsection (d) deletes references to repealed statutes. In addition, throughout these proposed amendments, a few non-substantive, technical changes have been made. In subsection (h), as in other proposed amendments, the metric equivalent for an existing inch/pound reference is added. The use of both systems in the regulations is called for by the FPLA and is consistent with the requirements of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Public Law 100, 15 U.S.C. 205b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (j) is new and defines the term ``SI metric,'' a term used throughout the proposed amendments to the regulations. The definition is derived from official Federal Government publications relating to metric terminology. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The definition makes reference to the statutory authority granted to the Secretary of Commerce to interpret and modify the International System of Units (SI) for the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Preferred Metric Units for General Use by the Federal Government,'' Federal Standard 376B, General Services Administration, January 27, 1993; ``Guide for the Use of the International System of Units,'' NIST Special Publication 811, U.S. Department of Commerce, September, 1991; and ``The International System of Units (SI),'' NIST Special Publication 330, U.S. Department of Commerce, August 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two comments addressed the use of the term ``SI metric'' in the regulations. NIST wrote that it is confusing and redundant: a) to use the term ``SI metric'' system because it implies that there are metric systems other than the International System of Units (SI), and b) to use ``SI metric'' to modify a metric unit name. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (An example of the latter would be the reference to ``SI metric kilograms'' in &sect;500.8(d) of the new rules). NIST recommended using either ``SI'' or ``metric.'' NCWM recommended that ``you consider eliminating use of the terms `SI metric' in association with the metric units *&blank;*&blank;* because the terms stand by themselves as metric units.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  NIST, 12, 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  NCWM, 19, 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has decided not to accept these suggestions. The substantive 1992 amendments to section 4 of the FPLA repeatedly make reference to ``the SI metric system,'' and the Commission in its amendments is merely adopting the statutory language. While the comments offer other acceptable means of expressing metric terms, the Commission believes its amendments must be consistent with the statutory language. The rules do not require that labels use the term ``SI metric'' or any other name for the measurement system. The rules only require the disclosure of the contents using the units of the SI metric system and the customary inch/pound system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (k) is new and defines the term ``customary inch/pound,'' which is used in the 1992 metric amendments to section 4(a)(2) of FPLA (15 U.S.C. 1453) and throughout the proposed amendments to the regulations. One comment addressed this matter. NIST wrote: ``the term `customary inch/pound' should not be used as a compound adjective (e.g., customary inch/pound system or customary inch/pound statement). Both terms are independent descriptors for the collection of measurement units we currently use in the United States and their use together is confusing.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission has decided not to accept this suggestion. Congress in amending the FPLA in 1992 used the term ``the customary inch/pound system of measure.'' The Commission intends to be consistent with the statutory terminology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  NIST, 12, 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsection (l) is new and defines the term ```e' mark.'' This is a certification mark used in the European Community (EC) to establish that the package is appropriately filled in accordance with EC standards. The term is defined because the amendments to section 500.6 (Net Quantity of Contents) allow the term to be used in addition to the mandated content quantity disclosure. Failure to allow the use of the mark could be an impediment to American companies selling in the EC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

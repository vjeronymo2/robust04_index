Although many people are sceptical, the Ministry of  Electronics Industry is determined to foster some electronics  giants in this country.    This will be an arduous task, but an urgent one as well.    Currently, most of the country's 18,000 electronics  factories  will suffer from their weak competitiveness and many of them  will be closed," said Lin Yuanfang, deputy director of the  ministry's Department of Economic Operation and Structural  Reform.    The value of China's electronics production last year  exceeded 130 billion yuan ($14.94 billion). However, the figure  is only 26 percent of Matsushita's annual revenue.    China has set up more than 200 electric groups, but they are  still fledglings. None can be called a giant.    Shanghai Audio and Video Ltd Co, organized by the city's  four  television makers, is now the country's largest electronics firm.    But is annual revenue last year, about 3.5 billion yuan  ($402  million), is just 0.7 percent of Matsushita's sales.    One important reason that no large enterprises have emerged  in this country is that investment in the industry has been so  scanty, said Shao Huiwen, deputy director of the ministry's  Department of Overall Planning.    During the Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1986-90), the  government injected only 7.1 billion yuan ($816 million) into  the industry for technical renovation and capital construction,  less than 1 percent of the government's total investment in the  economy.    The government promised 13 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) for  the industry during the 1991-95 period, but that still lags far  behind demand, Shao said.    The amount is less than what many big-name foreign companies  spend each year on developing new products.    To make matters worse, such meagre investment must be  divided  among many projects around the country. Thus, Shao said, no  project will get enough capital for renovation and expansion.    To improve China's competitiveness in the world, the  ministry  has proposed setting up some large electronics groups in the  country.    "We hope that these biggies would help rationalize the  distribution of resources and steer the development of the whole  industry," said Lin Yuanfang.    As the first step, the ministry plans next year to set up  several electronics groups each with annual revenue exceeding 5  billion yuan ($575 million).    By the year 2000, there will be three to five big names in  China with annual revenue surpassing 30 billion yuan ($3.4  billion) each.    The ministry will also select some promising enterprises  and,  through preferential treatment, help them expand into large  groups.    A detailed programme on how to generate China's Sony or  Matsushita will be disclosed very soon.</p>

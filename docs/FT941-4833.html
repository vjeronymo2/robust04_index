			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: GM Europe operations depressed by charges General Motors' Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations in Europe suffered a 56 per cent fall in net profits to Dollars 600m in 1993. Mr Louis Hughes, GM Europe president, said in spite of the decline the Opel/Vauxhall operations had remained the most profitable volume car business in Europe for the fourth year in succession. Several of GM's closest rivals in Europe suffered big losses last year. Mr Hughes said the Opel/Vauxhall financial performance had been depressed by one-off charges totalling about Dollars 800m arising from restructuring measures and exchange rate losses. The Opel/Vauxhall workforce was cut by about 7 per cent to 84,900 people at the end of 1993 from 91,500 at the end of 1992 and there was widespread short-time working at several GM Europe plants. Mr Hughes warned that little growth was expected in the west European car market this year, although a stronger recovery could begin in 1995 with sales forecast to exceed 12m next year. According to industry estimates new car sales in west Europe fell by 15 per cent last year to 11.45m units. Mr Hughes said GM was planning to further internationalise its operations using the Opel car operations as the spearhead. The Opel technical development centre in Germany was the group's lead design and engineering organisation outside North America. Opel designed products are being built in eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, South America and Australia. Mr Hughes said GM Europe was planning small volume assembly projects in India, Indonesia and Thailand and eventually in Malaysia. In the long term studies were being conducted that could lead to Opel car assembly in China, Russia, Zimbabwe and the Philippines.</p>

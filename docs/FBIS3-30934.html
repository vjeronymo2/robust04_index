			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic] </F>   [Text] For the fifth day running the chetnik hordes are  carrying out attacks with all available means. They are bringing  new forces and hardware all the time and are constantly  attacking Bihac and the Cazin commune.    (?Four) brigades of the Serbian aggressor reinforced with  police units from Banja Luka, Prijedor, Drvar, and 200 artillery  pieces of various kinds have already been on the offensive for  five days now, destroying civilian facilities and (?pounding)  every millimeter of the defense line. The attacks with 155-mm  howitzers, multiple rocket launchers, tanks, and mortars of all  calibers are horrific, but the defenders, who are defending the  Bihac region and Bosnia- Herzegovina bare-handed, have put up  heroic resistance. In brief, this is the picture of what  happened on the (?Grmusko-Srbljanski) plateau, Hasin Vrh, and  Barakovac last night and this morning.    The chetniks are attacking in waves, treading over their  dead  comrades, and leaving them behind. This illustrates sufficiently  that their intentions are to enter Bihac. There is hand-to-hand  fighting.    According to the old recipe, the chetniks are trying to make  up for every failure to breach the lines by attacking civilian  facilities. According to the unconfirmed reports, several  civilians have been wounded. Some of them have been killed.  There are a large number of wounded defenders. Material damage  is immeasurable.    The Assembly of the Bihac Commune and the Command of the 5th  Corps have again contacted the UN and UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] vehemently protesting, reminding the sleepy  international community of the fact that it has declared this  very region to be a protected zone, of Resolution 836, of the  bloody rampage of the Serbian aggressor, and of the suffering of  the innocent.    Stocks of food have long ago run out. The overcrowded  hospitals are without medicines. Humanitarian aid has not  arrived for a long time. This is all being watched with  indifference by those who issued new ultimata and alleged  threats yesterday. Will the new massacres, victims, and  suffering of a nation again be allowed in front of everyone?    The morale of the defenders, the heroes of the 5th Corps, is  exceptional. The support of the people from all sections of the  free parts of the region is limitless. There are more and more  volunteers who are arriving to join the units to defend, as they  say, their region and human dignity with their bodies. While we  are reporting fierce hand-to-hand fighting is under way on the  (Grmusko-Srbljanski) plateau and Barakovac. Artillery shells  are showering down on every part of the defenders' line and the  entire Bihac region. A message is being sent from every part of  this region: Bihac will be defended, regardless of the fact  that more chetniks are being brought. According to information  available at present, some 2,000 chetniks are on their way.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGIC'S EJECTION LEFT FAN DEJECTED  </P> <P> Imagine my excitement going to the Lakers' opener and getting to see an  injury-free Magic Johnson back in action. Imagine my rage 3 1/2 minutes into  the game when the official threw the league's MVP (and the Suns' Kevin Johnson)  out of the game for a harmless shoving match. I appreciate the officials trying  to keep the game clean, but when they deny 17,000 high-paying customers the  right to see their hero because of a silly scrape, the NBA has committed the  ultimate technical foul.  </P> <P> If the league expects fans to pay to see their game, they better provide the  product.  </P> <P> And shame on referees Bill Oakes, Greg Willard and David Jones. The  double-ejection was a gutsy call. And totally brainless.  </P> <P> RICK WALLACE, Malibu  </P></p>

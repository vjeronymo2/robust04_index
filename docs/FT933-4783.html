			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / International Company News: Alusuisse warns of payout cut as profit slides 42% ALUSUISSE yesterday reported an unexpected 42 per cent slide in first-half net income, to SFr49m (Dollars 35m). It warned of a 20 to 30 per cent fall in earnings for the full year, and a possible dividend cut. The bad news sent shares of the Swiss aluminium, fine chemicals and packaging group tumbling. The bearer shares ended SFr20 lower at SFr510 on the Zurich borse. Alusuisse, which has been struggling for three years to reduce its dependence on the volatile aluminium business, was again badly hurt by the disarray in this sector. Group sales in the first half were down 6 per cent, to SFr3.15bn, and aluminium revenues slumped 12 per cent to SFr1.37bn. Operating profit was off 24 per cent, to SFr152m, as profits from continuing aluminium businesses slumped 47 per cent to SFr46m. Four aluminium subsidiaries in Germany, which are being run down or sold, recorded operating losses of SFr42m. Mr Theodor Tschopp, chief executive, pointed out that in 1989 the four German subsidiaries yielded operating profits of DM100m, whereas this year they would lose DM100m in spite of aggressive cost-cutting. Such a swing was not due to the cyclical nature of the business nor to the recession, but to the ongoing structural crisis in the aluminium sector. This was blamed on unfair competition from government-subsidised smelters and low cost imports from eastern Europe. Mr Tschopp foresaw no return to 'the old intact, ideal world' in aluminium. The group, then, would continue to eliminate operations that had no future, and would concentrate on building its chemicals and packaging businesses. Its chemical division managed to raise operating profits by 17 per cent, to SFr88m, in the first half, in spite of flat sales of SFr791m. The performance of high value-added fine chemicals for life science applications made up for sluggish sales and prices in primary materials for plastics. The 12 per cent rise in packaging division sales, to SFr736m, was attributed to the transfer of activities from the aluminium division. Operating profit was flat at SFr63m. Mr Tschopp said there was no sign of recovery in most of the group's markets. As the second half tended to be seasonally weaker than the first, he forecast that consolidated net income for the year would slide to between SFr80m and SFr100m, compared with last year's SFr121m. Mr Hans Jucker, chairman, indicated that once again the dividend was not secure. 'It is our goal to leave the dividend unchanged if possible. However, that depends on the progress of our restructuring measures, on the general economic situation, and on the start of the new year 1994,' he said.</p>

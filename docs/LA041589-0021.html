			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW JUMPS 41.06 AS CONCERNS OVER INFLATION SUBSIDE  </P> <P> The stock market ran up its sharpest gain in nearly six months Friday, inspired  by an apparent easing of inflationary pressures.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials jumped 41.06 to 2,337.06 for its best  single-day showing since it rose 43.92 points last Oct. 20.  </P> <P> The increase allowed the index to end the week with a net gain of 32.26 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide trading  of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,074 up, 404 down and 474  unchanged.  </P> <P> Volume on the Big Board floor was 169.78 million shares, up from 141.59 million  in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues,  including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the  over-the-counter market, totaled 201.10 million shares.  </P> <P> The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of finished goods  rose just 0.4% in March, compared to 1% increases in each of the two preceding  months.  </P> <P> "The worst fears that some market observers had expressed regarding the  possibility of a big increase in the producer price index were soundly  refuted," said Marshall B. Front, economist at the Chicago investment and  mutual fund management firm of Stein Roe &amp; Farnham.  </P> <P> Separately, International Business Machines reported first-quarter earnings of  $1.61 a share, up from $1.57 in the year-ago period.  </P> <P> Wall Streeters generally responded positively to that showing in light of IBM's  warning a few weeks ago that its results this year were not likely to live up  to some of the most optimistic estimates in the financial world. IBM shares  gained 1 5/8 to 110 7/8.  </P> <P> On a busy day for government economic data, the Commerce Department reported  that the nation's trade deficit widened to $10.5 billion in February, and the  Federal Reserve said industrial production was unchanged in March from the  month before. Both numbers were pretty much in line with advance estimates.  </P> <P> General Electric, which reported better-than-expected earnings for the first  quarter Thursday, rose 1 3/4 to 47 in heavy trading.  </P> <P> Other gainers among the blue chips included Merck, up 1 1/2 at 67 1/4;  McDonald's, up 1 3/8 at 53 3/4; Philip Morris, up 2 1/8 at 119 5/8; Coca-Cola,  up 1 3/8 at 52, and Du Pont, up 2 1/2 at 106 1/2.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, share prices wandered to a higher close Friday, while the dollar  firmed in a last-minute rally after an otherwise listless day ahead of the  release of key U.S. economic statistics.  </P> <P> On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei index rose 86.50 points to  close at 33,150.44 in the thinnest trading in three weeks.  </P> <P> In London, stocks closed firm after a string of economic data from both sides  of the Atlantic that were close to market expectations, dealers said. The  Financial Times 100-share index closed 24.9 points higher at 2,053.6, with 593  million shares changing hands.  </P></p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown denies policy rift DIFFERENCES within the top ranks of the Liberal Democrats over nuclear defence and post-election strategy emerged yesterday to plague Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader. Plans for another session of 'photo-opportunities' on the Isle of Wight were hastily recast to enable him to mount a damage-limitation exercise over statements by Mr Simon Hughes, party environment spokesman, on the BBC's Election Call radio programme. Mr Hughes revived the controversy that bedevilled the Liberal-SDP Alliance during the 1987 general election by suggesting that abandonment of nuclear weapons would be considered by the Liberal Democrats in their promised review of defence policy. He also expressed a clear preference for Liberal Democratic participation in a Labour rather than a Tory government in the event of a hung parliament. Mr Ashdown met a barrage of questions with repeated assertions that the statements by Mr Hughes, who has declared his support in the past for unilateral nuclear disarmament, were consistent with the party's manifesto. This promises a comprehensive review of defence policy and expresses the belief that, given the improved international situation, further arms cuts 'will be able to be made without in any way endangering security'. Mr Hughes argued that his discussions with Mr Menzies Campbell, the party's defence spokesman, indicated that the need to retain a nuclear deterrent could be considered. Mr Ashdown was adamant that the party's defence policy was based on Britain having a 'credible and deliverable' deterrent for the foreseeable future. He acknowledged that this could involve a 'fewer number' of nuclear warheads than currently planned for the Trident submarine fleet. Mr Ashdown attributed Mr Hughes's preference for participation in a Labour government to the fact that he represented Southwark Bermondsey, an inner-London constituency, which he won in a by-election from Labour. Liberal Democrats in other constituencies, he said, might prefer to link with the Tories.</p>

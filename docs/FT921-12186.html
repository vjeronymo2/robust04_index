			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / The Guinness Trial: Change to rules on disclosure recalled SIX MONTHS after the battle for Distillers in 1986, the City Takeover Panel altered its rules to require disclosure of indemnity arrangements during bids, the jury at Southwark Crown Court heard yesterday. Mr Graham Walsh, a former director-general of the panel, said the change resulted from an investigation of the Turner &amp; Newall takeover of AE, the engineering group. It had been discovered that Barclays Bank and Midland Bank had been given undisclosed indemnities against loss totalling about Pounds 4m by Hill Samuel, AE's merchant bank, in connection with purchases of AE shares. Cross-examined by Mr Roger Seelig, a former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell, Mr Walsh agreed that Barclays had disclosed its share purchases but not the indemnities, and that Midland had disclosed neither. The panel, which had not criticised either bank, had been told that those concerned had 'addressed their minds' to the issue of disclosure. Mr Walsh also agreed that in its published statement on the case in October 1986 the panel had said that in future its rules should be interpreted as requiring disclosure of indem-nity arrangements invol-ving associates of companies involved in takeovers, as well as of the relevant share dealings. Mr Walsh, who was Morgan Grenfell's head of corporate finance when it acted for Guinness in the battle for Distillers, is a prosecution witness in the trial in which Mr Seelig and Lord Spens, former corporate finance managing director at the Henry Ansbacher merchant bank, deny fraud and false-accounting charges. The case against the two defendants centres on undisclosed indemnities given to purchasers of Guinness shares during the bid. The trial continues today.</p>

L. Dobretsov, Joint Institute of Geology, </F> Geophysics and Mineralogy, Siberian Department, Russian Academy  of Sciences, Novosibirsk; UDC 551.14+536.25]    [Abstract] Findings from projects undertaken under the  program Global Environmental and Climatic Changes and articles  in leading international and Russian journals published during  1991-1992 are reviewed and two principal groups of problems are  examined: geological factors in global changes in the  environment and importance of catastrophes and periodicity of  geological processes. The influence of endogenous processes  caused by periodic mantle plumes on global changes is expressed  through periodic bursts of catastrophic volcanism both in the  oceans and in the island arcs, as well as periodic changes of  movement of an ensemble of lithospheric plates and relief in the  ocean and on the land, which in turn results in a change in the  system of currents in the hydroatmosphere and climatic changes  with periods of 30-34 million years. Shorter period changes are  related to cosmic factors, especially Milankovitch cycles,  although an interaction between endogenous and cosmic factors is  reflected at all levels. Short-term changes in currents and the  entry of CO[.sub]2[/] may be stimulated by endogenous  processes, and vice versa, changes in the Earth's magnetic field  associated with endogenous factors may be superposed on solar  activity changes. During periods of magnetic field reversal  solar plasma may be ``locked'' in the Earth's magnetic field.  All such theoretical concepts examined in this study require  further development, particularly the theory of mantle plumes  and their interaction with asthenospheric flows.

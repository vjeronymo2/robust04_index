			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- The coalition failed to  break a stalemate in the Diet on Friday [18 March], as the  opposition continued to hold up deliberations on the fiscal 1994  budget over its demand that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  come clean on a questionable loan, Diet sources said.    Sadatoshi Ozato, parliamentary strategist of the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), spurned a demand made by his  coalition counterpart Koken Nosaka to end the weeklong boycott  of business at the House of Representatives Budget Committee,  the sources said.    Nosaka, chairman of the Diet Administration Committee of the  Social Democratic Party, the largest force in the seven-party  coalition, urged the LDP to put an end to its parliamentary  walkout and rejoin deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget, they  said.    Debate on the 73.08 trillion yen budget is already two  months  behind and compilation of a stopgap budget to cover government  outlays for the initial 50 days of the new fiscal year starting  April 1 is now unavoidable.    The LDP refuses, however, to budge unless Hosokawa agrees to  submit documents that back up his assertion that he repaid a 100  million yen loan from a scandal-ridden trucking firm, they said.    In past Diet sessions, Hosokawa has repeatedly said he took  out the loan to help finance repairs on his residence in  Kumamoto Prefecture and later repaid the loan to the Sagawa  Kyubin network of trucking and parcel-delivery companies.    On Friday, the LDP established a panel of legislators to  investigate the premier's loan scandal, naming former  International Trade and Industry Minister Hikaru Matsunaga as  its chairman.    The party says the money was actually an unreported  political  donation.    LDP President Yohei Kono said, "the premier should take the  initiative in clearing up suspicions over the loan issue, as the  essence of political reform lies in alleviating public distrust  in politics."    Hosokawa told reporters at his official residence, "I have  submitted to the Diet documents that can be submitted."    "As I have responded (to the opposition's questions) on the  issue very honestly, it is difficult to comply (with further  demands for documents on the loan)," he said.    Hosokawa also voiced reluctance to agree to the opposition's  demand that his former Secretary Masatoshi Miyama testify before  the Diet on the loan affair.    "I question the wisdom of summoning private citizens to the  Diet as witnesses. We have to refrain from setting such a  precedent," he said.    With the two sides adamant in their positions, next week's  Diet session is expected to be contentious.    "We will undergo very strained Diet business from next  week,"  Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chief of the LDP's Political Reform  Headquarters, told a meeting in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture.    "The LDP will continue to proceed for the time being by  linking the submission of the documents and summons of  witnesses" to starting deliberations on the budget, he said.</p>

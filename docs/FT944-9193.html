			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (1): Economic strength is put to the test  -Hugh Carnegy and Hilary Barnes see a weakened government trying to cut unemployment, defend a costly welfare system and clarify its attitude to Europe Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Denmark's Social Democratic prime minister, pulled off a remarkable political conjuring trick in September. Although his coalition suffered what amounted to a stinging reverse in the general election - with one member-party failing to win re-election to the Folketing - Mr Nyrup Rasmussen nevertheless returned to power at the head of a weakened but relatively secure three-party government. By exploiting Denmark's fragmented parliamentary jigsaw of nine parties, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen was able to side-step a surge in support for the right-wing Liberal party, securing the establishment of a minority Social Democratic-Radical-Centre Democrat coalition with the backing of two left-wing groups, the socialist People's party and the Unity List. As the restored prime minister set about continuing his dogged twin task of attempting to lower Denmark's 12 per cent unemployment rate, while defending its extensive and expensive welfare system, it was left to an eccentric independent candidate in the election to liven up an otherwise dull contest. Mr Jacob Haugaard, a well-known comedian, became only the third independent to win a seat in the Folketing since 1915. His party of 'Consciously Work-Shy Elements' polled 23,200 votes in the city of Arhus, with its promise of tailwinds for cyclists, more boyfriends for single mothers and more gifts from Father Christmas. The success of Mr Haugaard, clad in his suits sewn from old sacks, amounted to more than just a frivolous side-show in the election. Like all good satirists, he made a pointed comment about Denmark as well as raising a laugh. The country has grown used to two-thirds of the adult population receiving their incomes from the government, either as dependants on the welfare state or as employees of the government itself. But although the economy is performing more strongly than most in Europe, unemployment poses a long-term threat to Denmark's comfortable system of state hand-outs and safety-nets. The opposition, spearheaded by the Liberals under Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the party's combative leader, has argued strongly that reforms to trim the welfare state are needed to create the conditions for significant employment growth. The Liberals won 13 more seats in the election, to hold 42 out of the 179 Folketing seats. But their Conservative and Progress party allies lost seats, dashing the chances of a right-of-centre government. Instead, the Social Democrats and their allies, promising to sustain and even enhance the welfare state, hung on to power, despite the loss of seven of the SDP's 69 seats and the ousting from parliament of the Christian party, previously a government member. The result was hardly a ringing endorsement of Mr Nyrup Rasmussen, a rather colourless leader whose central stance since he became prime minister in early 1993 has been a defensive attachment to the welfare system. But the electorate appeared to be willing to give him a further opportunity to achieve the daunting target of turning around unemployment without having to give up the benefits that flow from the state. What, then, is the government's strategy for meeting these expectations? The first step is to enact a 1995 budget that trims a budget deficit which has grown over the past two years following a relaxation of fiscal policy made to help stimulate the recovery. The government's budget proposal aims to reduce the general government (including local authorities) financial deficit next year to close to 3 per cent of gross domestic product, the upper limit set by the European Union in the Maastricht treaty as one of the covergence criteria for European monetary union. A more restrictive fiscal stance will be one of the factors holding down 1995 GDP growth to around 3 per cent, compared with expected growth of up to 4.5 per cent this year. But the government recognises that it must reduce the share of GDP accounted for by public expenditure - at 60 per cent, second only to Sweden in Europe - to ensure the national debt, interest rates and inflation are kept under control and conditions for steady employment growth secured. To do this, it is likely to seek support for its budget from the Liberal and Conservative parties, rather than from its left-wing allies. 'We had support from the Socialist People's party to form a government. But we have told them from the beginning that, in respect of the budget, there will be no step out of line from the guidelines we have set for a reduction in expenditure and a reduction of the deficit,' says Mr Mogens Lykketoft, the finance minister. The government has also set in train a tax reform to lower the country's high income tax rates, shifting the burden towards so-called 'green' taxes such as higher petrol prices, increased taxes on CO emissions and other similar measures. At the same time, it is looking to active labour-market policies to reduce unemployment. It is committed to ensuring that collective wage agreements, in the two-year wage round due to be negotiated over the next few months, are moderate and exert no upward pressure on annual inflation, which is currently running at around 2 per cent. But the core labour market strategy is to enhance skills levels and promote job-sharing, rather than to dismantle Denmark's high minimum-wage and benefit levels. This year, the government's main response to unemployment has been to promote a 'leave from work' scheme which allows people state-subsidised time off from work (up to one year in every five) to study, rear their children or simply take a break. At present, more than 75,000 are on such leave. The right-of-centre opposition and most business leaders are highly critical of this approach, saying it has little real effect on unemployment and can even create labour shortages in some sectors. Most notably, the health services have been forced to look abroad for nurses to compensate for the absence on parental leave of some 3,000 of the country's 45,000 nurses. The government's critics argue that it is unrealistic to expect that training schemes can lever most of the unemployed - some two-thirds of whom are long-term unemployed - back into jobs. 'You cannot make a computer programmer out of someone who is a potential doorman,' commented one senior Danish economist. Instead, they call for measures such as lower unemployment benefits and lower minimum wages to price more people into work. Without that, they say, Denmark will not be able to generate the service-sector and small-company jobs growth that the government is seeking to lead the way to lower unemployment. Despite the minority position of the government, however, it seems likely to be able to survive, thanks to the lack of a realistic alternative coalition. Mr Ellemann-Jensen hopes to woo the Centre Democrats back into the Liberal-Conservative camp (the three parties were in coalition during much of the 1980s). But the party shows no sign of being prised loose from the present government, at least until after the next general election. In the meantime, an issue which may strain the government is Denmark's relationship with the EU. Next year, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen faces the task of formulating the country's position for the EU's 1996 intergovernmental conference which will review the Maastricht Treaty on European union. Denmark only approved Maastricht in a referendum last year after it had secured agreement from its EU partners to opt out, if it so chooses, from key provisions covering EMU, the formulation of a common defence policy, EU citizenship and some legal matters. Many Danish leaders, including some senior Social Democrats, are beginning to argue that Denmark should be prepared to drop these exemptions in order to play a full role in the EU's development, a step that would require a further referendum. But the Socialist People's party and the Unity List - the latter a fiercely anti-EU organisation - are resisting such a move. Mr Nyrup Rasmussen's hope of achieving a consensus position going into the IGC looks forlorn. However, the clear referendum votes in Sweden and Finland, Denmark's Nordic neighbours, to join the EU should help the prime minister, as their membership will establish a strong Nordic presence in the Union and bolster support for the EU among Denmark's notoriously sceptical electorate. The effect will be further reinforced if Norway, in its referendum on November 28, also votes to join.</p>

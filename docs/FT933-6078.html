			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Arts: Vale of Glamorgan festival The Proms and Edinburgh may overshadow August, but there are some idyllic outlying festivals. You could do worse than sample the charms of Presteigne, a small town astride the picturesque mid-Wales border, where a modest, friendly bank holiday chamber music event has taken off during the last few years. But for the charged atmosphere of live contemporary music-making, make for coastal St Donat's. This summer's Vale of Glamorgan festival is a minimalist's paradise. David Williams, the festival chairman, who, with another hat on, helped sway a healthy Pounds 25,000 grant from the Welsh Arts Council, explains: 'We felt we should do something constructive, not just for new music in broader terms, but for living composers. It seemed more positive to concentrate resources rather than dissipate them, and promote a worthwhile series focusing on the diversity of contemporary works in particular, post-modernist music since the '70s.' The principal sponsors, Allied Steel and Wire (ASW), have proved an added lifeline, injecting several thousands and, no less important, setting up gatherings to help widen the sponsorship net. At Cardiff's unspoiled Victorian Coal Exchange on Bute Square (the city's former commercial heart), John Metcalf's decidedly adventurous programme was launched last week with a mesmerising, sold-out evening by the American composer Steve Reich, fresh from his South Bank triumph with The Cave. Llandaff Cathedral offers an ampler venue tonight for a full-scale John Adams concert, climaxing with his celebrated Whitman Civil War setting The Wound Dresser - like his operas Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer, something of a cult piece. Getting to the outside-Cardiff events is easiest - be warned - by car. But it's well worth the effort. These attractive smaller venues bring their own rewards, be it the atmospheric oak-rafted fourteenth century Bradenstoke Hall, part of St Donat's Castle within the Atlantic College campus, or the medieval wall-painted St Illtud's Church in Llanylltud Faur (Llantwit Major), an early Celtic Christian site with the added merits of an adjacent pub-studded square and a good surfing beach a mere two miles' distance. Minimalist the diet may have been - but by no means monochrome. The Smith Quartet, one of Britain's answers to the Kronos, made appearances at both venues, the hall marginally the better for sound and paradoxically more intimate, thanks largely to the players being raised on a dais. Like the 'modernism' it purports to replace, postmodern and minimalist fare is a mixed bag. The Smiths' reading of the now legendary Different Trains was somewhat differently balanced from Reich's own - not quite as haunted, perhaps, but clear and forceful. The South African-born, Princeton-associated Kevin Volans' Second Quartet, Hunting/Gathering, seemed to be questing for a style as much as anything. Its repeating motifs and unfinished paragraphs have all the intensity of a short-running sitcom. Bones stick out balefully, rather as Steve Martland's Patrol is all sinew - laborious invention, oddly conventional and quintessentially dull. But nothing can take away from the dedication of these players. Volans' Third Quartet, Songlines, like his Rimbaud (and Bruce Chatwin) inspired Almeida chamber opera The Man who strides the wind (L'Homme aux Semelles de Vent), was a revelation: riddled with imaginative ideas, well teased out, an array of string sounds that 'delight the ear and hurt not', that constantly challenge, dazzle and amaze. And Graham Fitkin's quartet Servant, like the Michael Nyman encore the following night, gave clear evidence of how minimalism can successfully subsume native and wider traditions. You can still catch John Adams tonight at 7.30. Next summer's festival includes Australian Peter Sculthorpe and - yes - Gorecki. So book early (Tel. 0446 794848 792151).</p>

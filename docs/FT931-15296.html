			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Ward counsel addresses jury MR THOMAS WARD, the US lawyer and former Guinness director, misled no one over the nature of the Pounds 5.2m 'success fee' paid to him by the company after its takeover of Distillers, an Old Bailey jury was told yesterday. In an unusual move, addressing the jury before any witness gave evidence, his counsel, Mr Anthony Trollope QC, said Mr Ward strongly denied the accusation that he had stolen the money by pretending it was for a third party. Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chief executive, had agreed to the success fee and Mr Olivier Roux, the company's former finance director, had known the nature of the payment before authorising it, Mr Trollope said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mr. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, the vice chairman of  the Presidential Council, said that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih had  begun the secession when he declared the war on the south. He  said in a telephone call with the Kuwaiti AL-SIYASAH newspaper  today that it is impossible for 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to enter  Aden and that his forces are suffering from the shortage in  water and foods. He added that the northerners looked at the  unity as occupation and occupation is rejected.    Mr. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri pointed to the contradictions in  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's stand. He sought for an Arab solution to  Iraq's occupation of Kuwait in 1990 and now rejects the possible  Arab solution to the Yemen crisis. Al-Jifri said there is no  return to the unity with those who look for control and  occupation, saying that DY [Democratic Yemen] has vast stocks of  weapons and food supplies, while the north suffers from  shortages in fuel and wheat.    On 'Ali 'Abdaliah's conditions to stop the fighting in  return  for cancellation of the declaration of the Republic, al-Jifri  said: There is no discussion of the cancellation of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen.</p>

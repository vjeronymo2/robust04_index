			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Survey of Personal Pension Plans (8): How to read the vital statistics As concern mounts over the future survival of so many life offices, investors should vet providers' credentials thoroughly before parting with their cash. Consulting actuaries AKG, which provides technical information within the financial services market, produced a 'vital statistics' checklist for investors, drawn from its financial-strength reports on UK insurance companies*. Here, we use Standard Life's vital statistics to illustrate the checkpoints. Standard Life: The vital statistics. . . Type of organisation: Mutual. Life offices can be mutuals or proprietary. Mutuals effectively are owned by their policyholders - they cannot raise finance on the stockmarket. Proprietary companies ought to give the life office capital security, but they also have to pay dividends to shareholders. Ultimate owner: Standard Life. As a mutual, Standard's ownership requires no further investigation. The point about available capital may be important, as competition intensifies and profit margins reduce. Owners of proprietary life offices should be vetted for the same reasons. Funds under management: Pounds 30,738bn. As the largest mutual in the UK, Standard Life's financial strength is unquestioned. For other life offices, this figure provides a useful indicator of size and commercial muscle. As a further indicator, you should also look at last year's new business figures: Free asset ratio: 17.04 per cent. This refers to assets in excess of those held to meet liabilities, expressed as a percentage of total assets. Free asset ratios generally are higher for providers of with profits funds, which use the free assets to support current and future business. *For details on the 'Vital statistics' guide and the financial strength reports on UK insurance companies, contact: AKG, The Old Dutch House, 134 High Street, Dorking RH4 1BG.

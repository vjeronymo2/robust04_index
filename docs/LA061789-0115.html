			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADAMS CASE CENTERS ON 'LOST' NEGATIVES  </P> <P> Ansel Adams incorrectly told U.S. Department of the Interior officials that  negatives for pictures featured in a new book of his work had been destroyed in  a fire when, in fact, they were housed in his vault, new court documents  charge.  </P> <P> Moreover, the vice president of a publishing company defending itself in  litigation over the book contended in an affidavit filed in U.S. District Court  earlier this week that a wide variety of what may be some of Adams' most famous  pictures "would be the property of the U.S. government."  </P> <P> Adding to contentions originally made in an interview with The Times, John  Diamond asserted in the court filing that "many more of Adams' photographs than  was originally suspected are in the public domain." Diamond referred to  photographs Adams took while working as a government employee but which Adams  had stipulated to be part of his private work.  </P> <P> The allegation that Adams gave government officials incorrect information on  the fate of the negatives for the Mural Project, a series of 225 images of  national park scenes that Adams shot in 1941 and 1942, is contained in  documents filed by Day Dream Publishing, Inc.  </P> <P> The company is the chief defendant in the federal court suit filed in Los  Angeles earlier this year by the Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust. The trust  is seeking an injunction to prevent Day Dream from capitalizing on Adams' name  in promotion of its book, "The Mural Project," a photographic anthology of 85  of the national park images. Day Dream also seeks to publish wall calendars and  date books using the disputed photographs.  </P> <P> Day Dream and the book's two authors assembled the volume using copies of  prints made by Adams from the original negatives. The 226 prints are part of  the public-domain collection of the National Archives and copies are available  to anyone willing to pay fees averaging about $10 per photograph.  </P> <P> The fate of the Mural Project negatives has emerged as a central issue in the  federal court litigation. Officials at Yosemite National Park said they  attempted twice, without success, to learn from Adams the fate of the negatives  in the year or so before the photographer died in 1984.  </P> <P> In court documents filed by the Adams publishing trust earlier this year, the  photographer's estate revealed that the negatives are in the trust's custody,  housed in Adams' personal vault on the grounds of his home in Carmel Highlands,  Calif.  </P> <P> But Day Dream charged in the new court documents that Adams told Interior  Department officials that the negatives had been lost in a fire. And on Friday,  Jill Brett, a National Park Service spokeswoman in Washington, confirmed that  Adams discussed the destruction of the negatives in a visit to Washington with  his wife, Virginia, in 1979.  </P> <P> Brett said Adams had come to Washington to inspect the surviving Mural Project  prints. The photographs were commissioned for anticipated mural-size display in  Interior Department buildings. The huge enlargements were never executed,  however, and only a set of conventional-sized prints, made by Adams himself,  have remained.  </P> <P> According to a 1979 Interior Department employee newsletter that published an  account of Adams' visit, the photographer told officials the negatives were  destroyed in a fire in 1937 -- four to five years before the photographs were  actually made.  </P> <P> In his affidavit, Diamond charged Adams and his trust engaged in "a deception  that is ongoing and prolonged." However, David Vena, a Los Angeles lawyer who  is one of the Adams trustees, responded Friday that Adams was notorious for his  inability to remember dates -- a foible to which Adams alludes in his  autobiography to explain his ascribing at least four different dates to his  most famous image, "Moonrise, Hernandez, N.M.," shot in 1941.  </P> <P> Vena said the trust is not certain whether all or only some of the mural  project negatives are in the Adams vault. He said a detailed comparison of the  prints in the National Archives with negatives in the vault would have to be  made since Adams made several similar shots of each image.  </P> <P> The similarity of images in question is pertinent to the dispute over whether  other Adams photographs should be considered in the public domain. In his  correspondence and employment arrangements with the Interior Department, he  stipulated he would mix his government photographing with his private work.  </P> <P> Thus, one of his most famous pictures, "White House Ruin, Canyon de Chelly  National Monument, Ariz.," made in 1942, is almost identical to an image in the  government collection and published in the new book.  </P> <P> Vena said there is no doubt that some prints made by Adams in his lifetime that  are now highly valued on the art photography market were, in fact, made from  Mural Project negatives. He said the question is not relevant to the dispute  over publication rights and rights to use Adams' name and reputation in  connection with promotion of the unauthorized book.  </P></p>

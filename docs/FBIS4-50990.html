			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 23 (XINHUA) -- The State Education  Commission from this year forward will share costs for selected  universities with local governments.    A spokesman announced here today that the commission will  jointly build Xiamen University with the Xiamen Municipal  Government.    The university, which is located in the Xiamen Special  Economic Zone facing the Taiwan Straits, was previously mainly  financed by the central government.    In the next four years beginning this year, the Xiamen  Government will provide 10 million yuan each year to support the  university, with the State Education Commission providing the  rest.    Another three universities and colleges jointly built by the  State Education Commission and the local government are in  Shanghai. They are Fudan University, Shanghai Communications  University and Shanghai Foreign Languages College.    The reform is the latest effort to ease the funding  difficulty in universities. Teachers' salaries are expected to  rise after the reform.    The local governments will acquire part of the rights to run  those universities.</p>

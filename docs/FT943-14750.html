			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Management: Executives out of hibernation - Senior staff are moving jobs again Senior managers are on the move again. There is not yet a return to the carefree years of the late 1980s, when risk was considered an irrelevance and job-hopping became a way of life. But the grim determination to cling on to secure but frustrating jobs is giving way to increased willingness to change employers. 'People are looking round a bit more,' says one executive. 'They are less scared than they used to be.' According to Garry Long of MSL, a recruitment consultancy which monitors advertised demand for executives: 'It will be a long period before people forget the worries of the recession. But there is a willingness to be a bit more risky in making a move.' MSL believes that job opportunities increased by 30 per cent in the quarter to April and by 22 per cent over the year. Admittedly, this is from a low base - the number of job openings a year ago was at its lowest level since MSL's records began in 1959. The increase in top job mobility has been reflected in the performance of headhunters. John Viney, chairman of Heidrick &amp; Struggles, an executive search company, says the number of directors' jobs handled by his firm has doubled in the past two years. One explanation for brisker executive turnover could be pent-up frustration after having to tread water during the recession. The downturn, together with the trend for companies to shed layers of management and flatten hierarchies, restricted promotion opportunities within companies. Ambitious executives, who find their progress blocked, may now feel increasingly tempted to change employer. The pick-up in economic activity, moreover, may create a need for a different sort of executive. Just as the recession revealed the flaws of many of the ambitious, growth-hungry executives who ran companies in the late 1980s, the recovery may highlight the shortcomings of any cautious, less visionary executives who in many cases succeeded them. According to Viney, the focus is moving from cost-cutters towards marketing people, many of whom have been in hibernation. 'In the recession, companies are interested in financial people who can turn around the business,' he says. 'As companies come out of recession, they are interested in business development, marketing or strategy-minded people.' This argument is supported by MSL's figures. The most striking improvements in job availability were in marketing and sales, which increased by 39 per cent over the year. The pick-up in demand for executives, though, varies with the seniority of the job. The top jobs tend to be less sensitive than middle management posts to fluctuations in the economy because companies need a core number of directors, even when they are shedding jobs. That said, directors have not escaped the pain. 'Over the last few years, it has been a very difficult time for directors' jobs as companies have gone to the wall,' says Ira Chalphin, employment spokesman of the Institute of Directors. The number of new directors' jobs is likely to expand relatively slowly as the economy improves. But Chalphin notes that new directorships are still being created by the trend for management buy-outs and by the government's strategy of spinning off businesses out of the public sector. The activity is nevertheless likely to be greater further down the ranks. 'During the recession, people tended to get rid of middle management and make senior managers more accountable for activities,' says Steve Garlick, director of GMBM, a recruitment and research consultancy. 'Now directors are finding it necessary to direct, rather than manage. There is a need for more middle managers.' While this may be possible, in some cases the upturn will not help everyone seeking to improve their job prospects. Many industries are continuing to cut costs. Many middle managers are still under the threat of redundancy, as companies restructure and cut out management layers. Although opportunities are increasing, they tend to be limited to those who fit employers' needs precisely. 'As companies are emerging from recession, the skills they need are very specific,' says Jonathan Wright of Lawrence Caine, a recruitment consultancy. Moreover, the recession has blunted the opportunities of many managers to develop marketable skills and, at worst, excluded some talented individuals from the job market completely. In the short term, at least, the pick-up in demand will tend to benefit those who have been in the right place at the right time.</p>

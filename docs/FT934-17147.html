			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Rail fares latest in VAT spotlight THE GOVERNMENT has asked British Rail to assess the effect of imposing value added tax on train fares in a move that will fuel speculation that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is planning to extend further the VAT base in his November Budget. In particular, the move will add to expectations at Westminster that Mr Clarke is planning to levy a lower than expected rate of VAT on domestic fuel, while extending the base of the tax to public transport, newspapers and other goods which are currently zero-rated. BR warned that levying the tax at the full rate of 17.5 per cent could depress fare income by about Pounds 200m, or 10 per cent. The imposition of VAT would lead to more pressure to reduce services, and could result in fares being further increased to make up for lost revenue, it said. BR said yesterday that it had provided information about VAT to the Department of Transport in response to a request during the summer. BR is already suffering from a fall in revenue caused by the recession. There have been reports that this could result in fare increases of up to 8 per cent even before the imposition of VAT. A move to impose VAT on fares in November would be highly controversial after the angry reaction when the then chancellor Mr Norman Lamont announced plans to extend the tax to domestic fuel in the March Budget. But Mr Clarke hinted in Washington earlier this week that any new tax increases will be on spending rather than income. Ministers had a foretaste in August of the likely reaction to steep BR fare increases. They were forced to play down the significance of leaked plans to raise some London rail ticket prices by 16 per cent. A complicating factor is the government's rail privatisation proposals, which have been criticised by some Tory backbenchers and have yet to clear the Commons. Most other EC countries already levy indirect taxation on public transport at between 4 per cent and 7 per cent. In light of this, BR had already studied the impact of VAT on fares before the government's request. VAT surcharges will now only be levied on late payers and not on those who submit their returns late, Customs and Excise said yesterday. There will also no longer be any surcharges for less than Pounds 200. The changes follow moves to make the VAT system more fair to business.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (16): Environmental issues may apply the brakes - The Supercars Deliveries are to start within the next few days of by far the fastest and most expensive roadgoing Jaguar cars ever built. Buyers from around the world are each paying Pounds 350,000 - enough to acquire 12 'ordinary' Jaguar saloons - for a limited production run of 350 examples of the XJ220, a mid-engined two-seater sports car capable of 212mph. But environmental considerations mean that the big, 542 brake horsepower 'supercars' are likely to be the last of their type - at least from Jaguar, according to JaguarSport, a 50-50 joint venture company set up in 1988 between Jaguar and Mr Tom Walkinshaw's racing organisation, which has developed and is making the cars. The XJ220 is one of several 200mph-plus supercars, each costing up to Pounds 530,000, currently making their debuts. Most were conceived towards the end of the economic boom of the late 1980s. But their appearance coincides with widespread recession and almost exactly with the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, with its concerns about the adverse impact on the environment of the motor vehicle. 'We all recognise that a long-term shift is taking place in what will appeal to buyers. No-one can afford to ignore the environmental issues', acknowledges Mr Bill Donnelly, sales and marketing director of JaguarSport. For that reason, he suggests, the XJ220 will probably turn out to be the ultimate roadgoing Jaguar. 'We'll take a different slant in the future; something smaller and lighter, with the emphasis very much on weight-saving'. A further irony is that the new wave of supercars is rolling towards the market at a time when it is becoming increasingly likely that the last country in which their performance could be used to the full, Germany, will have its autobahns speed-restricted not by its own, but common EC legislation. At Monte Carlo, McLaren Cars - a subsidiary of the grand prix racing group - has just given the motoring press its first glimpse of the F1, McLaren's own roadgoing, Pounds 530,000 'supercar'. Based on grand prix technology, it will go on sale next year. Yamaha of Japan last month unveiled the OX99-11, a street-legal machine which uses a de-tuned version of its Formula One grand prix engine and which has room for only the driver. Reflecting the unique status of the UK as the world centre for motor sport-based technology, the 'Ox' will be produced not in Japan but Yamaha Motor's UK subsidiary, Ypsilon Technology, at Milton Keynes. It is is also expected to cost more than Pounds 500,000. The Bugatti name has been resurrected for a 200mph-plus supercar due to enter production later this year in Italy, rather than Bugatti's native France. These cars eclipse in price and performance even vehicles such as Ferrari's F40, the Lamborghini Diablo and Porsche 959. The question is, who will buy them? The answer from all their makers is that they are being snapped up by discreet, exceptionally wealthy entrepreneurial types scattered in small numbers around the world. And unfortunate though the timing of the XJ220's launch is in many ways, Mr Donnelly insists that all 350 cars are pre-sold. According to JaguarSport, 1,500 would-be owners have applied to buy the cars, backing their orders with the requisite Pounds 50,000, non-returnable deposit. However, the market for used Ferrari and other classic sports car markets has suffered the most spectacular collapse in its history over the past two years. And there is increasing speculation within the investment car market about whether JaguarSport's confidence and that of other supercar makers may prove misplaced. The order terms for the XJ220 allow holders to sell their options to another party. Originally, this was seen as offering the potential for a premium. But the recession has meant that some would-be owners have needed to make a distress sale in an attempt to recoup the Pounds 50,000 - and to avoid payment of a second Pounds 50,000 tranche due under each contract six months before a car is delivered. Worse, according to stories doing the rounds of the international 'investment car' market, some would-be sellers have had difficulty disposing of their options. Fearing that they might have to fulfil their contractual obligation to buy the car, at least some are said to have formed so-called shell companies into which to sell their options - and which it would be pointless for Jaguar to pursue for payment. Jaguar and JaguarSport profess themselves to be relatively unperturbed. The part payment system means that JaguarSport should get warning of potential problems at least six months before construction of that particular car is due to start. 'If there are problems, it simply won't get built - at least not until another firm buyer is found', said a Jaguar spokesman. With an expected total world market for new cars this year of just under 40m, in percentage terms the XJ220 and its cohorts represent an almost infinitesimal proportion of the market. McLaren Cars plans to make only 300 of its extraordinary F1, a three-seater with the driver's seat in the middle and an array of mind-stretching technology including fan-assisted suction to stick it more firmly to the road. Yamaha's production plans have yet to be disclosed, but total envisaged production also does not exceed a few hundred. About 200 units a year are envisaged for the Bugatti EB110, a 200mph-plus supercar from an Italian-based reincarnation of Bugatti, perhaps France's most famous pre-war make. By comparison, Ferrari is a common volume producer: it builds 4,000 cars a year - and even the most expensive Testarossa sells in the UK for a mere Pounds 130,000.</p>

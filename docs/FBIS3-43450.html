			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Abbey Makoe] </F>   [Text] Commanders of various Self-defence Units [SDUs] in  Katlehong on the East Rand were yesterday on the brink of  resuming their "war" despite having agreed to a ceasefire on  Tuesday. A source who yesterday morning attended the  commanders' meeting, which was aimed at implementing the  ceasefire, said it ended after only 30 minutes when commanders  from three sections walked out in protest against a call for  peace.    At the centre of the threatening move was mistrust, sources  said. The mistrust element came into being when Hadebe Section's  SDU members allegedly murdered the leader, "Commander Mbogani,"  after he was seen near Kwesine Hostel. A source said while most  residents did not walk near the hostel for fear of their lives,  Commander Mbogani at one stage boasted to his followers about  having been in and out of the hostel unharmed. "Instead of  being praised for bravery Commander Mbogani was accused of being  an Inkatha Freedom Party spy. He was tried in a kangaroo court,  found guilty and sentenced to death," a source who was present  at the trial said.    Seventeen residents have since been killed in the subsequent  internal clashes between the SDUs. The death toll since New  Year's Day stood at 17 yesterday. However, ANC regional  executive member Mr. Robert McBride told a news conference in  Johannesburg that only four of the 17 deaths were as a result of  the SDUs' internal fighting.    Some of the sections that disagreed on effecting the  ceasefire came from the violence-plagued Mavimbela, Radebe,  Ncala and Sali sections. A source who attended yesterday's  meeting said: "Most of the commanders who walked out were  against their boundaries being opened to people not living in  them."    The source added: "That means if I live in Ncala I cannot  enter Mavimbela, otherwise I will be killed." At the time of  going to the press McBride was said to be "working very hard"  trying to resolve the problem and avert the threat of renewed  SDU clashes.    In another development, police pounced on the home of slain  Monwabisi Mzukwa, alias "Commander Boja," in the early hours  yesterday and arrested five suspected SDU members. "We seized  one Walther PPK pistol, one magazine and three rounds of  ammunition," said Warrant-Officer Michelle Erasmus. She said  the five men were expected to appear in court soon on charges of  illegal possession of weapons.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Soft water scales new heights Hard water containing high concentrations of calcium bicarbonate can lead to a build-up of calcium scale in household plumbing and water heating equipment, reducing pipe diameters and lowering the efficiency of hot water appliances and central heating systems. Most conventional water-softening treatments rely on adding chemicals but can create other problems by changing the chemical composition of the water and making it too soft. Now a French company called Rauh has developed a novel way to prevent scaling without using chemicals. The Twin Master system uses electrical fields and magnetic or electro-magnetic impulses to prevent scaling. It helps to create free-moving calcium crystals that simply wash out of the tap. The company claims that the water retains its valuable mineral salts but costs less to heat and prolongs the life of household appliances and plumbing. Rauh: France, 47 09 36 72.</p>

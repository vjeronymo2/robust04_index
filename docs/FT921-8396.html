			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Hanson launches defence of dividend policy HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, has launched a counter offensive in response to criticism that its move to a quarterly pay-out amounts to a dividend cut. In an attempt to persuade fund managers and analysts that shareholders would be better off under its new dividend policy Hanson has pub- lished a note showing that UK share- holders with 100,000 shares would receive net interest of Pounds 45.42, assuming 10 per cent interest rates, thanks to the earlier payment. To minimise its advance corporation tax liability for the year to Sep- tember 30 1992, Hanson last week announced that it would pay its divi- dend quarterly from July. There would be three further payments in October, January and April. The quarterly dividends would not be less than 2.75p totalling at least last year's 11p by April. Last year shareholders received 3.15p in July and 7.85p in February. Hanson argues that while share- holders will be worse off in July, when they will receive 2.75p compared with last year's interim of 3.15p, they will be better off by April since they will have received three quarters of the dividend earlier than under the old dividend policy. At a meeting of analysts and insti- tutional shareholders last Friday, Lord Hanson, was reported by several people present as suggesting that the total dividend this financial year may be more than 11p. One analyst said: 'Lord Hanson made it clear that he was irritated that some commentators had suggested that the group's move to quarterly pay- out was designed to hide a dividend cut and made it clear that the group was quite likely to pay more than last year's 11p.' Hoare Govett, the group's brokers, are predicting a quarterly dividend of 2.82p, making a total of 11.28p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The battles in Angola around the UNITA [National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebel headquarters  at Huambo and the government-held towns of Malange and Cuito  have been continuing. Aid flights have been interrupted and,  according to government figures, the death toll at Cuito has  reached 200, with 800 wounded, and the figure is expected to  rise. It is ironic that the fresh eruption in the war comes at  a time when the peace talks in Lusaka are apparently on the  verge of a conclusion, with only the crossing of T's and the  dotting of I's outstanding. On the line to Luanda, Akwe Amuso  asked Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Chikoty why, in view of the  progress in Lusaka, the fighting had eruped again.    [Begin recording] [Chikoty] We think that UNITA has been  using constantly some kind of pressure on the military side.  Maybe UNITA was expecting that the government might not make  important concessions, as far as their participation is  concerned in government. We have now made all the concessions,  as far as their participation in government is concerned and so  far there has been very little reaction on that. But on the  other side, what we have felt is that there is intense fighting  around Cuito. As I say, we have registered many deaths and we  are going to register many more because they have been shelling  the city of Cuito for the last five days, I think, and you can  imagine that they are launching over Cuito as many as 500 bombs  a day, and that is a lot.    [Amuso] UNITA, for its part of course, is accusing the  government of having been largely responsible for escalating the  situation. In fact, it is accusing the government of using  chemical weapons in Cuito.    [Chikoty] No, first of all is that this is wrong. You cannot  say that the government is responsible for the situation in  Angola. UNITA has been fighting against the government after  loosing the elections, taking over a number of places. The  government has never been in an offensive position. The  government has always been in a defensive position, as you may  know. If UNITA wants, in fact, to end the crisis, they have to  accept unconditionally the offer that the government has made:  we stop everything, we sign a final cease- fire through the  negotiations that are taking place in Lusaka. The problem is  that there is constantly a tendency in some international media  to give reason or to be promoting UNITA's cause.    [Amuso] But whether you or I like it or not, UNITA is in a  position to go on prosecuting this war. Doesn't that mean that  you are going to have to make more concessions in Lusaka?    [Chikoty] We have made last and final concessions. What we  have given to UNITA so far is what is most acceptable to  everyone. This offer was considered as extremely important, as  we have gone beyond what the mediation has asked the government  to do. We have offered everything that could be acceptable.  [end recording]</p>

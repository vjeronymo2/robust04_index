Press reporting has tried  to unravel the complicated business operations which led to the  arrest and has supported the view that the penal code which went  into effect in March will require much more accountability from  company directors than before.  An article in the Paris financial  daily LES ECHOS criticized Belgium for the "unjustifiable"  jailing of such a respected figure over what in the past would have  been deemed minor events easily resolved in court.  An article in  the Paris daily LIBERATION questioned Belgium's motives, noting  there had been a long history of Belgian resentment against French  business aggressiveness in that country.      The Event      An article in the 8 June issue of the Paris daily LIBERATION was  typical of media attempts at explaining Pinau-Valencienne's arrest.  It claimed that the events that led to the arrest began in 1992 when  Schneider decided to reorganize one of its Belgian subsidiaries, the  Cofibel group.  Backed by France's Elf oil company, Schneider  offered to buy controlling interest in two of the group's companies,  the Cofibel holding company and Cofimines.  Several Belgian minority  shareholders objected to the price offered by Schneider for the  shares and accused Schneider of having juggled its accounts and  hidden some operations.  These shareholders lodged a complaint,  which was settled in 1993.  However, the Belgian courts decided to  pursue their own investigation and at the end of May called Pineau-  Valencienne to Brussels and-- "surprising everyone"--arrested him.  They also arrested Italian businessman Valentino Foti, founder of  the Sirix Intervitrum glassworks company.  The two were charged with  conducting  "financial operations which significantly reduced  the assets of Belgian companies" to the detriment of minority  shareholders.  According to the charges, the Schneider group  benefitted, "under suspect conditions, from important liquid assets  to the prejudice of Belgian subsidiaries" on the order of some 3  billion Belgian francs (BFr).  Moreover, the investigation also  involves "offshore affiliates" belonging to the Cofibel and  Cofimines companies which according to the Belgian court "remain  hidden, as much from shareholders as from regulatory authorities."  The dividends from these affiliates, domiciled in tax havens, have  evaporated," the court claimed, "to the tune of BFr1.8  billion."      Support and Motives      In the 30 May issue of LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, an article notes the  widespread support Pinau-Valencienne has received from the business  community.  While this support comes from a wide variety of top  French businesses, according to a 2 June article in the same daily,  it also includes backing from Schneider's U.S. subsidiary, the  Square D company, and from U.S. companies on which Pinau-Valencienne  is a board member: Bankers Trust, Equitable Insurance Company, and  Whirlpool.      The article also claims that the scandal in part is the result of  often strained business relationships between Belgium and France.  It observes that Belgians often sees the French as "arrogant,"  especially when they want to buy Belgian companies, such as when the  Accor group bought Belgium's Wagon-Lits and Suez bought Societe  Generale de Belgique.  Belgians fear they are losing their  industries' "crown jewels" to the French and have been particularly  "attentive" recently to French initiatives in their country,  according to the article.      With the Schneider affair, old wounds have opened, according to  the article's "Belgian sources."  They claim that Belgium has not  forgotten that Schneider was originally a Belgian company, the  remnants of the Empain business empire which made its name in the  Belgian Congo before it became independent.  These sources add that  the intervention of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur--according to  Italian Television broadcasts, Balladur contacted Belgian Prime  Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene about the affair--exacerbated Belgian  irritation with France, so much so that Belgian Justice Minister  Melchior Wathelet found it necessary to announce that in Belgium's  system politics did not intervene, no matter what the case before  it.      Swiss Connection      An article in the 10 June LE FIGARO reports remarks by Luc  Jacquier, head of Cofibel and Cofimines's Swiss company Finamines,  who confirmed to Swiss and French journalists that Finamines was  indeed a "caisse noire" or secret holding."  Finamines, the article  notes, was created during the 1960's to manage the Empain group's  mineral resources after the Congo became independent.  According to  Jaquier, Finamines's Panamanian holdings, Mitraco and Tramico, had  been hidden from tax authorities as well as from shareholders of  Cofibel and Cofimines.  He pointed out that Pinau-Valencienne may  not have been aware of these two companies and that in any case had  not personally profited from them.  Jaquier claimed these  companies were the responsibility of the late Jean Verdoot, former  head of Schneider's Belgian companies, and that it was he who signed  the payment orders and he who organized the companies.      Released from jail on his own recognizance on 7 June, Pinau-  Valencienne responded to Jacquier's statements in the 11, 12 June  issue of LIBERATION.  He explained that the company in Switzerland  had been established for the sole purpose of protecting Belgian  expatriots.  He also declared that Schneider had never received,  either directly or indirectly, any money from offshore affiliates,  "other than through the Belgian companies Cofibel and Cofimines."  The article points out, however, that in the first instance, Pinau-  Valencienne did not explain why the Swiss company still existed 30  years after the Congo became independent and, in the second, his  affirmation of innocence in receiving offshore money was "curious"  since it is precisely the point of the court case against Schneider  that fraudulent capital movements were processed through Cofimines  and Cofibel.      Media Explanations      Most Paris financial dailies tried to unravel the complicated  facts behind the arrest of Pinau-Valencienne, a clear example of  which appeared in an article in the 8 June issue of LIBERATION.  The  article noted that the charge of defrauding Belgian shareholders  revolves around the "common" practice of group affiliates buying  shares of other companies in the group to provide fresh capital to  the parent company.  The parent company is required to buy back the  shares at a later date at the same price.  However, in December  1990, during one of these operations, Schneider sold its Belgian  affiliates 4 percent of it Arbed subsidiary, which Schneider  should have then rebought later for the same price, or BFr3,900 per  share.  In the meantime, the shares had dropped in value to BFr2,000  per share but depreciation was never accounted for in Cofimines's  balance sheet.  When minority shareholders asked for explanations  about the lack of accounting for depreciation, they discovered that  not only had the depreciation not been allocated to Cofimines's  accounts but that Schneider did not adhere to the requirement to buy  Arbed back from Cofimines for the original BFr3,900 per share.  Schneider instead undervalued the Arbed shares by BFr580 million at  the time of the repurchase.      The article also confirms the Belgian courts statement about  Schneider owning offshore companies.  Schneider's organizational  chart currently shows several offshore companies based in Bermuda or  Panama, such as Mitraco, Tramico, Itrec, and SHL.  The most  "mysterious" of these companies, according to the article, is  Tramico, based in Panama.  Appearing for the first time in  Schneider's charts in the mid-1980's, it is officially only 49  percent owned by Schneider, which has never revealed the ownership  of the remaining 51 percent.  As a minority owner, Schneider  does not have to publish, nor consolidate, Tramico's accounts.  The  article claims that Tramico was the "black hole" in the Cofibel-  Schneider galaxy: it bought shares in other companies, resold them  some years later, loaned money, and received money.  Schneider sold  Tramico in October 1992, just before offering to buy a majority  share in Cofibel and Cofimines.  Other companies may also have been  "hidden," the article points out, noting the Belgian court's Swiss  investigation.      Rumors surrounding the scandal that Schneider is involved in  money laundering, according to the article, stem from the fact that  one of Cofibel's affiliates was Valentino Foti's Italian-Swiss  company Fimo, which in 1991 Italy and the U.S. Drug Enforcement  Agency discovered was laundering money for the Sicilian mafia.  Foti  is still being held in Belgium and the Italian courts are  investigating his part in the scandal.      Commentary on Director Responsibility, New Penal Code      Articles and editorials in the Paris financial dailies have also  focused on the repercussions the arrest has made in the business  community, especially the "alarm" it has evoked over the criminal  responsibility of the directors of large conglomerates for what  occurs on their watch.  Assistant director of editing, Didier  Pourquery, writing in the 31 May issue of LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES,  claims the scandal will pose "in clear and worrisome terms" the  question of director responsibility.  Usually, this responsibility  is that of a director to his board or to his shareholders.  But  today, such responsibility has another sense, a legal responsibility  for the activities of the companies over which he presides. In  France, a director is responsible before the courts for business,  social, stock exchange, and other regulations affecting the normal  life of a company.  Additionally, he is also criminally responsible  under common law for everything that happens in his group, Pourquery  continues.  It is this last responsibility which must now be giving  the heads of numerous groups a "fit of dizziness."      On 9 June, deputy director of editing, Francois Roche, writes in  the same daily that the scandal will also open debate on how  companies are organized and managed.  He contends that Schneider is  not atypical of those groups composed of multiple companies, some  all over the world, which were put together in the 1980's when  maximum leveraging was sought for financing purposes.  The utility  of such organizational structures has been questioned during the  last few years and many companies have started to simplify their  financial and legal structures to better concentrate financial  resources.  According to Roche, this is exactly what Pinau-  Valencienne was trying to do.      However, the debate is also over control, Roche contends.  He  points out other examples where control procedures over important  financial decisions have not worked, such as in cases involving  Paribas, Ciments Francais, or with Pechiney in its aluminum  operations.  At a time when "each pencil and eraser" must be  accounted for in a budget, these capital movements often involve  hundreds of millions of francs.  The problem is thorny, Roche  states, because it calls for the head of a company to control the  acts of subordinates and partners sometimes near but often far  away.  Roche concludes that this scandal is of such a magnitude that  it certainly justifies new regulations being imposed on large  groups.      Deputy director of editing of LES ECHOS, Nicolas Beytout,  contends that jailing the director of a holding company for the  adventures or misadventures of one of its subsidiaries is  unjustifiable.  He observes that the image of French companies will  suffer because of the scandal and that they will have to adopt a new  code of conduct, unfortunately similar to what U.S. companies have  followed for years.  The United States, Beytout claims, is a  paradise for lawyers and lawsuits, for a "nitpicking" judiciary, and  "obsessional exploitation" of a whole slew of legalities which  little by little have been imposed on the business community.  He  adds that this U.S.-style "drift" is dangerous.  It obligates  companies to pay inordinate attention to the weakest and most  dispersed consumer or minority shareholder.  Pineau-Valencienne, who  was one of the symbols in the beginning of the 1980's of a divorce  between business and politics, and at the beginning of the 1990's a  symbol of the new international dimensions of French business, could  well be the symbol today of an "eruption" of judges in the daily  life of companies, Beytout concludes.      An article by Nathalie Hamou in LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES on 31 May  states that the new Penal Code, which replaced the Napoleonic Code  of 1810, introduced a major innovation into French law--that of the  criminal responsibility of legal entities.  Companies can in the  future, like individuals, be charged by the judicial system for  their actions.  This new obligation on the part of companies has not  gone unnoticed by company directors.  Hamou reports that the  Confederation of French Employers (CNPF) drew attention to the  uncertainties in the new Penal Code a few weeks ago.  The CNPF fears  that it will reverse the "recent" trend of decriminalizing business-  related issues and lead to "repression."  The motives of the  legislators who wrote the Penal Code were to share the criminal  charges between the company and its directors.  However, the system  is flawed, the CNPF pointed out, since only the criminal  responsibility of the directors could be engaged in cases of  violations because it was "impossible" to "get at" individual  companies.

Among them:      -- Former Civil Guard director general Luis Roldan was accused of  embezzling millions of dollars and has been a fugitive since April  29.      -- Former Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion accepted full  responsibility for allowing Roldan to escape and resigned.      -- Former governor of the Bank of Spain Mariano Rubio was  arrested and sent to jail for tax evasion and insider trading.      -- Rubio's financial adviser and former chairman of the Madrid  stock exchange Manuel de la Concha was also arrested and jailed on  tax fraud charges.      -- Former Agriculture Minister Vicente Albero presented his  resignation over tax irregularities and connections with the office  of Manuel de la Concha.      -- Former Finance Minister and parliamentary spokesman leader  Carlos Solchaga and former Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera were  forced to relinquish their parliamentary seats because of their  connections with the Rubio and Roldan cases respectively.      Economic Implications      According to recent press accounts the corruption scandals will  not have long-lasting effects on the economy.  Although there is  speculation in the media that Gonzalez may not finish out his term  as prime minister (ABC 5 May) and reporting that People's Party (PP)  Chairman Jose Maria Aznar has repeatedly called for his resignation  (El PAIS 6-7 May), a recent article in the 15 May issue of LA  VANGUARDIA by Juan Tapia and Enric Tintore disputes this.  Tapia and  Tintore cite Finance Minister Pedro Solbes as noting, "the danger of  political instability has been completely surmounted, and the  financial markets are behaving well again."  Asked if foreign  investment into Spain would be curtailed due to the political  uncertainty in Spain, Solbes replied that investments by large  companies are planned well in advance and therefore would not be  altered by the crisis.  He believed that investments by small and  medium-sized companies might be delayed but remarked that the  government had "accepted its political responsibilities" regarding  the corruption cases and he hoped that "no further problems" would  arise.  IMF Director General Michel Camdessus echoed Solbes's views  in an earlier report published in an 11 May article in LA VANGUARDIA  by Manuel Estape.  In this article, Camdessus stated his belief that  the atmosphere of corruption would not affect Spain's economic  recovery.  He noted that this atmosphere "cannot delay investment  decisions amply justified by the macroeconomic prospects and the  growth potential" of the Spanish economy.

EU      ECO-FIN AGREES ON RULES FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES--An article in LES  ECHOS reports that the EU's Eco-Fin Council, which met on 7 June,  has found a joint Community position on reinforcing the capacity of  EU authorities to regulate financial service companies.  A result of  the International Bank of Commerce and Credit (BCCI) scandal which  caused the EU to review its regulatory practices, the directive Eco-  Fin will submit to the EU Parliament is called the "Post-BCCI"  directive and will complete the systems already put in place by  other EU directives aimed at financial services.      The new directive will add a supplemental condition to the others  in order for a financial company to be approved in other member  countries.  The directive stipulates that when a financial company  belongs to a group, the group's structure should be sufficiently  transparent to allow adequate oversight of the company on an  individual basis.  The directive also stipulates that credit and  insurance companies have their headquarters in the same member state  in which they are legally incorporated.  Additionally, the directive  fleshes out the list of organizations with which the authorities can  exchange confidential information and expands auditors' obligations  to notify authorities when they come across any irregularities in  monitoring financial companies.  (Dian I. 733-6286) (Paris LES ECHOS  in French 8 Jun 94 p 22)      CAR MANUFACTURERS FORM NEW RESEARCH GROUP--The Association of  European Automobile Manufacturers (ACEA) recently formed the  European Council for Automotive Research and Development (EUCARD) to  administer common research programs and act as a lobbying group in  Brussels.  According to an article in the Paris daily LE MONDE, the  group has agreed on a common research program worth about 12 billion  francs (Fr); 40 percent of the financing will be requested from the  European Commission within the framework of the Fourth Common  Research and Development Program.  The article states that this  organization is the European response to the American USCar group  which receives large government subsidies.  EUCARD will focus on  research on environmentally clean cars, improved safety devices, and  manufacturing methods.  (Ruth H. 733-6284) (Paris LE MONDE in French  1 Jun 94 p 21)      FRANCE      EDITORIAL ON CLINTON, BENTSEN, KANTOR--Deputy director of editing  for  the Paris business daily LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, Pascal Aubert,  writes that President Bill Clinton's visit to Paris on 7 June held  no important messages and typified an administration which was  "deficient in diplomatic action."  Aubert characterized Clinton's  speech before the National Assembly as a "warm account" but  basically "banal" and U.S. diplomatic discourse as "singularly  impoverished and unclear."      However, Aubert points out that where Clinton may appear  "fluctuating and indecisive" in foreign affairs, his activism on the  economic and trade front is not.  Clinton excels in this arena,  according to Aubert, and the strong U.S. presence in Paris during  his visit coincided with a familiar U.S. double offensive against  the high interest rate levels in Europe and Japan's deficiency in  contributing to world economic recovery.  "Through persistence,"  Treasury Secretary LLoyd Bentsen and U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor have acquired a reputation of effectiveness that  Clinton should envy, Aubert continues, adding that this is so  despite the fact that Germany's Bundesbank "does what it wants when  it can" and the Japanese Government "does what it can when it  wants." (Dian I. 733-6286) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 8  Jun 94 P 40)      SAPIN SUPPORTS DEFICIT REDUCTION FIRST--Dominique Seux reports  that Bank of France Monetary Policy Committee member, Michel Sapin,  wants France's deficit reduced before proceeding with efforts to  reduce the cost of labor or reduce income taxes.  Although Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur has announced that he intends to reduce  the deficit to around Fr275 billion next year, Sapin apparently  wants him to reduce it even further.  In making his views public  following the government's announcement it would take in about Fr12  billion more this year than initially expected, Sapin has added his  voice to the debate over how these supplemental funds should be  used.  Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy has already suggested that  these surplus funds be used to reduce labor costs rather than lower  income taxes, and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has indicated that  he wanted to do both at the same time.  Sapin's position, however,  is in line with that of Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet  who has sounded the alarm over the French budget deficit--Fr315.6  billion in 1993, Fr301.4 billion expected for 1994.  Seux claims  Sapin also was reacting to the increase in long term interest rates,  which reflect the financial markets' concern over the deficit.      However, the French Government for now is thinking of using the  extra revenue to finance some Fr20 billion in new expenses not  initially forecast, to privatize a state-owned company in the fall,  and to cover capital increases for Air France and Bull.  To reassure  the financial markets, the government has for several weeks repeated  that there will not be an increase in the deficit this year and  defends part of the new expenses, which will be used to stimulate  jobs, as the cost to fight unemployment.  Nonetheless, the  government cannot avoid the debate over how to use funds which are  expected as economic growth continues.  Despite Balladur's assurance  that the deficit will not increase, the debt service will, Seux  contends, and will limit what can be accomplished in other areas.  This is all the more true since long-term interest rates have  increased.  (Dian I. 733-6286) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 7 Jun 94 p  2)      COB JUSTIFIES SANCTION POWER--The Stock Exchange Commission  (COB), which has recently been criticized for its selective use of  sanctions against companies' stock operations, has issued a report  defending its powers, claiming they have been proven effective,  reports an article in LES ECHOS.  In its last monthly bulletin, the  COB stated that four years after direct sanction powers were given  to the organization, there have been 15 cases where sanctions have  been applied.  The COB noted that when the market was deregulated  and opened to competition, the COB filled a void in policing market  operations.  At the time, the COB did not have the authority to do  so nor did professional organizations.  Although there was a penal  code for such matters, litigation was very rare and courts were  slow to decide on the often media-hyped affairs which needed fast  decisions.  In any event, the report argued, the legitimacy of COB  sanctions exists in legal precedence, such as those practiced by the  Competition Council and the High Council on Audiovisual.      Although the COB is satisfied with its new sanction power, it  admits that it must use it cautiously.  In one of the cases annuled  by the courts, the textile company VEV affair, the terms of the  communique which announced the opening of a sanction procedure had  been judged as having influenced  the presumption of innocence.  The  COB report questions, however, how such announcements can be done at  all in a society more and more under the influence of the media.  Answering such a question is all the more urgent for the COB, which  has a mission to protect savings and investment information,  according to COB head Pierre Fleuriot. (Dian I. 733-8286) (Paris LES  ECHOS in French 8 Jun 94 p 21)      GERMANY      EXPERT EXPLAINS LAGGING GERMAN INVESTMENTS IN ASIA--In an  interview with the DEUTSCHES ALLGEMEINES SONNTAGSBLATT, Oskar  Weggel, the head of the Hamburg Institute for Asian Studies, asserts  that Germany has "slept through" recent economic developments in  Asia.   According to Weggel, Germany frequently lags behind such  countries as the Netherlands in investments in the region.  As an  example, he cites the country's failure to take advantage of  Vietnam's ties to the former East Germany to get in on the ground  floor of Vietnam's rapid development.      Weggel attributes Germany's disinterest in Asia to the country's  "macabre Eurocentrism," noting that the entire German economy is  oriented toward Europe and North America, and to German arrogance,  or the notion that everything must be done according to German  tradition.  Weggel says German firms often ask where the treaties  are for the extensive Chinese trading network, because they expect  there to be an equivalent of the EU treaties of Rome and Maastricht.  In fact, Weggel asserts, informal contacts are much more important  in Asia:  "Capital means personal trust, the main work is personal  relations."  Building up a relationship takes time, and German firms  are often very short-sighted and unwilling to invest in something  that will not pay off immediately.      In addition, Weggel argues, medium-sized German companies cannot  break into the Asian market because they are afraid of competition  and reluctant to band together.  He cites the example of a meeting  of the Eastern Committee of the German Economy, where firms are  requested to ask questions before the lecture begins but everyone  waits to do it privately afterward because they are afraid the  competition will hear.  While acknowledging that German companies  receive less help from their government than their French or  Austrian counterparts do, Weggel asserts that the government cannot  be relied upon as a "cure."  (Wendy S. 733-6506) (Hamburg DEUTSCHES  ALLGEMEINES SONNTAGSBLATT in German 27 May 94 p 4)      ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY FLOURISHING--The German  environmental technology industry is flourishing, according to an  article in the 18 May FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU.  The National  Association of the German Waste Disposal Industry (BDE) estimates  that the industry's total sales increased last year by 10 percent to  about 75-80 billion German marks (DM), with an additional 10-percent  growth in sales and employment expected this year.  Some 680,000  workers are currently employed in the industry, a number the German  Institute for Economic Research (DIW) estimates will increase to 1.1  million by the year 2000.  The BDE believes the industry would grow  even faster if the German Government would pursue a "more rigid"  environmental policy.  The industry expects, for example, that a  further boost to growth would result from a proposed  manufacturing  recycling law which would require manufacturers to take back and  recycle their products.      Large companies from outside the environmental technology sector  have discovered this growth and moved to acquire small and medium-  sized companies in the industry, creating a problematic  concentration of business power.  The IFO economic research  institute has already warned of "cartel-like structures" in the  field.  Large, well-funded electrical utility companies have been  especially active investors and about half of all industry sales now  benefit these "energy giants," with around 1,000 small and medium-  sized companies dividing up the rest.  Environmental industry  experts expect the degree of consolidation in the sector to increase  even further.

Founded on the initiative of Finance Minister  Theo Waigel, the foundation promotes the creativity of small and  medium-sized companies in finding practical solutions to  environmental problems, provides an impetus for ecological  innovation, and reduces the initial risks for companies adopting  ecologically friendly production technologies.  In addition, the  foundation lends support in the areas of environmental technology,  research, and education through its provision of ecological  information and consulting services.  About 70 percent of the  projects the foundation has funded are in the new laender.  Among  them is the Dresden Ecology Center, where environmental experts from  business and government meet to exchange experiences and explore new  avenues of transferring know-how.  In Magdeburg, the foundation is  supporting a project which, for the first time, will produce teflon  fibers by means of a fluidized solids technique, without the use of  heavy metals.  The fibers are a versatile asbestos substitute.  (Joel S. 733-6503) (Hamburg DIE WELT in German 18 May 94 p WR4)      ITALY      BANK OF ITALY GOVERNOR ON ECONOMY--At an annual board meeting on  31 May, Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio issued the following  observations and warnings:      Tax rates: Reducing tax rates would only increase the deficit and  the national debt.  At 44 percent of GDP, the Italian tax rate is  not out of line with those of other EU countries and is in fact  lower than in some.  Other than for interest rates and pensions,  social spending is not out of line when compared internationally.      Social welfare: The total projected present value of future  social welfare obligations for the present population is 2.4 times  GDP.  Unless corrective measures are instituted, the yearly cost of  social welfare will soon grow more rapidly than national income.  Privatizing national insurance is not feasible and would require  setting aside capital "equal to half of the national assets" for  current obligations alone.  Instead, benefits should be gradually  limited and a partial private system should be introduced.  Doing so  would require adequate tax revenues.  Pension funds should be  encouraged because they will make available massive amounts of  capital and will redistribute family assets towards long-term  financial investments.      Domestic consumption: Encouraging economic recovery by  stimulating domestic consumption would require changes in budget  policy.  At the same time, interest rates would have to increase to  keep prices down.      Increased investments: Economic recovery should be the result of  increased investments.  Currently investment seems to be increasing  but not enough to make up for the 11-percent drop in 1993.      Government procurement contracts: Suspending the Merloni law,  which instituted tight controls on government contracts that brought  public works to a standstill, was necessary to get public works  moving again after a 16-percent drop in employment and investment in  1993.  However, government contracting should be carried out in  total "transparency and correctness."      Tax evasion: Fighting tax evasion is an indirect way of favoring  investments and employment.  It would lower the tax burden on those  who do pay their taxes.  To fight tax evasion, controls and  collection should be made more efficient.      Bank losses: Bank losses primarily due to uncollectible loans are  destined to grow.  To help address the problem, the banking  oversight committee has examined four projects for the partial  conversion of loans into stocks. However, banks can vaunt the 60  trillion lire which they have loaned to companies being  restructured.      Undervalued lira: The lira is still undervalued, although not as  much as in the second half of 1993, when in real terms the lira was  depreciated even compared to 1987." (Anilla B. 733-6283) (Rome LA  REPUBBLICA in Italian 1 Jun 94 p 3)      TREASURY MINISTER ON ECONOMIC PLANS--In an interview given to  INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE correspondent Alan Friedman, newly  appointed Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini discussed the new  government's plan for economic recovery.  Below is the description  of the plan and further details provided by Dini:      Employment: Reduce the cost of workers' benefits for employers  who hire.  Extend this benefit to three years.  Establish tax  incentives to help companies create new jobs and investments.  Simplify the tax system and reduce the kinds of taxes imposed, which  now number 200.      The government is currently examining three additional  initiatives to stimulate employment: accelerate depreciation of new  plants and equipment, reimburse taxes tied to investments, and  exempt from income tax any profits reinvested by companies.      Dini stated that new revenues could be generated to pay for such  stimulative measures by raising the value-added tax (VAT) on certain  consumer products and by a general pardon for real estate tax  evaders.  Most importantly, he added, creating new jobs will  increase revenue through the taxes paid by the newly employed.      Privatizations: "Privatize almost everything" to reduce the  government's excessive presence in the economy.      Dini stated that he would like to speed up privatization and  believed the government could earn 80 trillion lire from the sales.  The first state companies to be sold off will be the National  Electric Power Board (ENEL) and the Telephone Finance Company  (STET).  Many companies belonging to the Institute for Industrial  Reconstruction (IRI) will also be privatized, among which  Finmeccanica and Ilva.  Dini said the government's objective is to  get out of companies such as IRI altogether and also give up  companies belonging to the National Hydrocarbons Company (ENI), such  as Agip, Snam, and Snamprogetti.      Asked what he thought about the debate over public companies,  Dini replied that in the case of STET and ENEL, which provide public  services, the government will try to keep a "golden share" to  maintain some control.  For other companies, the type of  privatization will be decided on a case by case basis.  For some,  the British public company model will be used; for others, a hard  core of institutional investors will be created; others will be sold  outright to both foreign and national investors.  "There is no one  absolute model," Dini said, however, efforts must be made to prevent  a public monopoly from becoming a private one.      Public debt: Dini confirmed that in 1994 the national debt will  reach the expected amount of 159 trillion lire.  Since Italy intends  to go ahead with full integration into the EU, the national debt  will have to be reduced.  Dini expects the deficit will begin to  "stabilize" by 1995 and the trend reversed by approximately 9  percent of GDP.      Lira and the EMS: Dini believes the lira is undervalued but that  this is helpful for international trade.  He would not give a date  for the lira's reentry into the European Monetary System (EMS) but  doubted it would be this year.      EU economy, interest rates: Dini stated he believed Europe was in  the middle of a slow economic recovery and could stand lower  interest rates without risking inflation.  However, he said, Italian  interest rate policies must be "very prudent" to avoid high long-  term interest rates that would hinder investments.  Dini noted,  however, that in a global economy, EU rates also depend on U.S.  rates.

Some 35 percent of the Swedish firms surveyed said  they would probably hire new workers this year, while only 15  percent thought they would reduce their staffs.  The difference, 20  percent, tops the corresponding figures for the EU countries.  In  fact, in most EU countries, more firms planned to lay off workers  than hire them.  Swedish companies are also more optimistic than EU  firms in their expectations for profits, exports, sales, and  advertising and marketing.  In addition, only 14 percent of Swedish  firms thought they would have long-term financing problems while,  for example, 31 percent of German companies predicted such  difficulties.  Anders Meyer of Lindebergs attributes the Swedish  optimism to the fact that Swedish firms are starting out at a lower  point after the recession. Meyer believes that the initial optimism  will have worn off by next year.  (Wendy S. 733-6506) (Stockholm  DAGENS NYHETER in Swedish 10 May p 37)      TURKEY      MILITARY CONTROLS LARGE SECTOR OF ECONOMY--The Turkish Army Aid  Association (OYAK), which functions somewhat like a military credit  union, controls a large sector of the country's economy, according  to an article in WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE.  OYAK was founded after the 1960  military coup as an officers' treasury that would provide its  members with loans at favorable rates, pay contributions to the  state pension plan, aid injured veterans, and run vacation homes.  Today the organization has 80,000 members, with 10 percent of all  officers' and noncommissioned officers' pay going to OYAK.  The  association owns 25 companies, among which are a French Renault  production facility in Turkey, three Turkish automobile  manufacturers, six cement factories, several construction firms and  food companies, and the Sigorta insurance company.  It is currently  cooperating with the French company Elf Aquitaine on building a  network of some 45 gas stations. OYAK, whose sales have been  estimated at DM8.5 billion per year, was one of the few Turkish  conglomerates to earn a profit last year; it is exempt from most  state taxes and fees.  Although Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has  promised extensive privatizations of state-owned companies, no  politician would dare touch OYAK's "empire."  OYAK also shields its  members from daily Turkish life:  officers live in OYAK subsidized  apartments, shop at OYAK discount stores, and vacation at OYAK  vacation villages.

Listed in  the report are the following suggestions:      -- The state should decrease its involvement in the economy.      -- The underground economy must be absorbed into the legitimate  economy.      -- Tax revenues have to be increased by decreasing the tax rate  and broadening the tax base.      -- The government should support investment activity on a par  with foreign competition.      -- Foreign trade and investment must be fostered.      -- Consensus and stability in the work-force market must be  achieved.      -- Interest rates must be brought down to the EU median.      -- The cost of energy has to be brought down to the EU median.      -- Greater importance has to be given to education.      -- Economic laws and regulations must be coordinated with those  of the EU.      -- An economic and social council has to be established. (Ender  C. 733-6285) (Istanbul NOKTA in Turkish 3-9 Apr 94 p 32)      PRIVATE SECTOR REACTS TO AUSTERITY--According to an article in  DUNYA which discusses the government's austerity program, the  private sector is "leaning" toward production cuts and layoffs as a  way to survive the current economic crisis with minimal losses.  The  article indicates that private companies have to do so because of  decreased sales and higher interest rates.  Beyond production  cutbacks and layoffs, companies have taken the following measures:      -- Scrutinized what they import because of the instability in the  foreign exchange markets.      -- Begun to pursue new export markets.      -- Large companies are closing down their unproductive  subsidiaries.      -- Minimized inventories and offered incentives for cash  purchases.      -- Ended long-term payment plans, asking that daily payments be  made.      In addition, another article on the same page listed specific  austerity measures taken by some of Turkey's leading corporations:      -- KOC Holding: The company will avoid excessive debt, pursue  export markets, withdraw from activity outside its main business.      -- Mavi Kablo: It cut back its production by 20 percent, lowered  its inventory to a minimum, payed off bank loans to avoid nondaily  expenses, stopped investing, adopted a three month budget, and  expedited payments.      -- Kavala: The company will downsize, cut expenses, and pursue  exports.      -- Kale Porselen: It has cut all its credit ties with banks, sold  TL12 billion of its capital to the public, laid off 50 employees,  closed down two of its electroporcelain ovens, and is pursuing  exports.      -- Alarko Holding: It is waiting to see how effective the  government's economic package will be.  It is considering stopping  investment if there is a snag in its implementation.

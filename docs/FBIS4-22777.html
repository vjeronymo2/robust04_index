			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Vladislav Borodulin and Yelena Kotelnikova under </F> the rubric "Meeting of the Government Presidium": "Voucher  Privatization Has a Successor"]    [Text] The numerous attempts of the members of the  government to look past 1 July 1994 took the form of a document  yesterday; at a closed meeting of the government, Anatoliy  Chubays presented a five-page "Concept of Post-Check  Privatization." But the meeting was closed for a different  reason--the government was beginning to prepare for the  "economic" meeting with Boris Yeltsin.    According to the authorized representative of the prime  minister, Valentin Sergeyev, at the meeting reports were heard  from several ministers on progress in fulfilling the  government's March decree. This document is essentially the  Chernomyrdin cabinet's program of action. As was expected, the  ministries in fact failed to fulfill the decree and the premier  expressed "dissatisfaction" with his subordinates' work. His  discontent is even more justified since the top government  officials are to meet with Boris Yeltsin in the near future. At  that time the government is supposed to present its plan of  action for the future. In a talk with the KOMMERSANT  correspondent, the leader of the analytical group under the  president, Aleksandr Livshits, noted: "The government holds  meetings and discusses some matters, but the main thing is still  lacking--reforms." He promised to "complain" about the  government to the president. Thus, from Chernomyrdin's  viewpoint, examining the concept of post-voucher privatization  becomes crucial--some of the president's complaints regarding  the lack of an overall concept in the work of the executive  branch of power can be eliminated in that way.    The concept of the second stage of privatization prepared by  Goskomimushchestvo [State Property Committee--GKI] specialists  illustrates that the ideologues of denationalization are  prepared not only to promote but even to defend the new  priorities related above all to creating conditions needed to  adapt to the market during an enterprise's privatization. Basic  attention will now be devoted to selling large blocks of stock  to those investors who are prepared to invest the most capital  as soon as possible. Small investors will acquire stock at  specialized auctions. All this differs fundamentally from the  idea of voucher privatization, the essence of which is achieving  social accord while implementing destatization  ["razgosudarstvleniye"] of enterprises by using checks as the  main means of payment and granting preferences to the employees  of the enterprises. But now GKI specialists acknowledge that  voucher privatization has exhausted its social role (of the  20,000 medium-sized and large enterprises subject to  privatization, 80 percent have been made joint stock companies,  and about 40 million citizens have become owners). The nature of  the privatization procedures must also take into account the  nonpayment crisis and the drop in production--standardized  methods are unacceptable here. And the new concept is based on  liberalizing those methods and individualizing the approach to  each enterprise (bankrupt enterprises in particular), as well as  extensively enlisting local authorities and interested  ministries in the privatization process. This obviously gives a  chance that not just the government will approve of the new  concept. At the same time, however, the change in the tactics of  privatization gives the GKI ideologues reason to expect that  this process will remain under their department's control.

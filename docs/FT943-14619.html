			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / European bourse plan for small companies A group of leading European stockbrokers, venture capitalists, investment bankers and stock exchange representatives have formed an association to create a pan-European stock exchange for fast growing companies. The new group, the European Association, has obtained funding from the European Commission for research into the likely number of potential listees on the new exchange. The research is expected to be completed by mid-November. Existing mechanisms for the trading of small company shares were proving inadequate in providing capital throughout the economic cycle, the group said. It cited the closure of the Unlisted Securities Market in London and the Dutch Parallelmarkt as examples of small company exchanges which have failed to aid investors. Participants are seeking to model the new exchange along the lines of Nasdaq, the US-based stock market, which has grown to be the world's second largest in turnover by listing shares of small, fast-growing companies. The European Venture Capital Association is the prime sponsor for the project. Nasdaq has already said it supports the venture and would like to be a minority shareholder in a new exchange. However, the London Stock Exchange has already ruled out participation in a UK-based specialist exchange for small company shares and has dismissed suggestions that a pan-European exchange would be effective. However, several other European exchanges, particularly the Paris Bourse, have embraced the concept. Several members believe the main challenge will be to get agreement on whether the new exchange should be a single entity cited in one centre or a 'federation' of exchanges based in different centres. Other issues are where to cite the exchange's headquarters and whether to rely on an existing bourse's trading mechanism or whether to import a new system.</p>

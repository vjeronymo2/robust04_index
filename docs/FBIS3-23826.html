			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Yasin: "A Program Which Cannot Be </F> Realized"]  <H5>  [9 Feb p 2] </H5>   [Text] Before expressing my opinion on the program for  socioeconomic reforms in Russia submitted by a group of  prominent scientists, I would like to say a few words in place  of an introduction. I have mixed feelings with respect to the  persons who were named among its authors. After all, I worked  with them for many years and I am very friendly with them,  despite what they write and the kinds of views they express. I  am deeply convinced of their high values and respectability.  This makes it more complicated to evaluate the document they  drafted. Nevertheless, in pointing out the prism of personal  relationships, I realize that the public is not very concerned  about my emotions in this regard.    I would single out three elements, three lines, in this  document. The first concerns the critical assessment of the  current situation and the condition of the Russian economy. A  great deal is right here, and many facts which attest to the  situation that has taken shape are absolutely correct: it is  really alarming and precarious. I do not think there can be any  particular disagreement about this.    Moreover, I do not think it possible to share the views of  those who reassure us somehow and maintain that nothing in  particular, nothing alarming, is taking place and that  everything is more or less normal. I do not think we can permit  ourselves to make such an assessment now and over the next  several years.    Second. In my view, the assessment of the situation, mainly  its roots, the underlying causes, is subjective in nature to a  significant degree. The persons who made the assessment are  honest and reputable, of course. Although not all their names  were given. All the same, it is one-sided, and it seems to me  that this is not suitable for an academic approach to  consideration of a problem.    What does the lack of objectivity consist of? First of all,  the unequivocally negative conclusion about the intention and  progress of those reforms which were implemented in 1992 and  1993, the condemnation of monetarism and price liberalization.  It seemed to me that an objective analysis of the positive  changes and shifts in the economy, mainly toward a transition to  the market, would have been more appropriate. But these shifts  are completely obvious, and only a blind person can fail to see  them.    Those who were called upon for many years to restructure the  Soviet planned economy into a market economy ought to have  turned their attention to this. I am deeply convinced personally  that objectively, regardless of anyone's will or wishes, we  approached a turning point at the end of 1991 when there should  have been a breakthrough. By that time, we could no longer  continue on a evolutionary path. I have written about this many  times, and I continue to hold the same view.    There were other alternatives as well, of course. But then  the program's authors should have said what these alternatives  were and the price we would have to pay for them. My analysis  shows that the ones which could have been proposed for that  period and later, through 1992, would have resulted in more  severe consequences than the ones which exist now. For this  reason, it is not right to make a categorical judgment about  what is worse and what is better in this case: when some plan  has already been implemented, the alternatives which were not  put into effect always can seem better.    I insist: a sensible, unbiased analysis shows that other  alternatives would have been worse. What I observed, working  together with L. Abalkin in N. Ryzhkov's government, convinced  me: the gradual, evolutionary path of development which was  conceived in the political and economic situation at that time  led to a catastrophe. A breakthrough was inevitable sooner or  later.    It took place. The consequences turned out to be severe, not  only because of errors and miscalculations in the work of the  Gaydar government, but the problems which had accumulated before  then. I would say that the scale of the challenge was much  greater than human abilities to respond to it so that everything  turned out all right, so that no one suffered, so that there  were no complaints from the academicians.    This is why they are not assessing the situation as a whole  adequately, in my view.    Third. What is the constructive part of the document? I will  not deny that there are individual elements in it which deserve  to be discussed, and possibly even realized. But as a whole, the  spirit of these proposals seems unacceptable to me. And not  because it may seem that I am ideologically inclined in favor of  one alternative as opposed to another. No, there is a different  reason: either the measures proposed will not produce the  results expected and will lead to negative consequences that are  even more serious, or they simply do not take the actual  situation into account and cannot be implemented.    I will not make unsubstantiated statements. I will cite a  few  examples. One of the program's key features is the proposal on  price controls. Meanwhile, it is being implemented. Prices for  energy and energy resources are partly controlled, and the  tariffs in transportation and municipal services are partly  controlled. The document gives particular emphasis to the need  to freeze prices for energy resources.    I should say the following in this connection. The process  of  shaping a market economy is now taking place independently,  without regard for the wishes of the government, the Academy of  Sciences, or anyone else. It is linked with the establishment of  new relative prices and new price ratios. And they are being  shaped in spite of all types of obstacles stemming from the  structure of our economy. The analysis which we conducted last  autumn states: where there is no interference from price  controls, the process of moving them closer to world prices is  under way.    On the whole, a very positive process. Unfortunately,  however, it it has its unfavorable aspects, because enterprises  are beginning to feel that while they had a comfortable life  last year and all the price correlations, outlays for production  and technologies, and so forth were balanced, they are now being  upset. However, if these upsets had not taken place, there would  have been no incentives for restructuring, either!    Practically all our enterprises felt the need to reduce  costs  for the first time at the end of 1993. And not because someone  from the top ordered them to reduce production cost. This has  now become a vitally necessary task for them. They must reduce  costs or run to the government and ask it to increase excise  taxes, particularly because foreign competition is becoming  stronger.    The prices for energy and energy resources are the most  urgent problem. Because the entire Russian economy has been  adjusted to technologies which waste energy, those which consume  vast amounts of energy. The gap between domestic prices and  world prices for it in the starting period was greater than ever  before. Our cost was 7 percent of the world cost of oil.    Now the ratios have changed. But we still have to come up to  real price correlations, all the same. I can agree with what was  stated in the report: this goal cannot be reached too quickly,  instantly. However, liberalization of prices for energy  resources is inevitable, and they should be controlled by  domestic supply and demand. And so that there is some balance  with world prices, we should introduce an energy tax or export  duties and nothing else.    Of course, the proposal to freeze the prices for energy  resources eases the situation for the processing industry,  enabling it to remain in this uncertain position for some time:  it may survive, but it cannot reach normalcy. At the same time,  the fuel and power complex is in a very difficult situation. It  is not receiving the appropriate incomes or the appropriate  funds for investment. In the meantime, whether anyone likes it  or not, it has a key role in the struggle for Russia's position  in the world markets and to restore Russia's economy and  competitiveness. It is precisely from the fuel and power complex  that we can obtain specific funds to invest in other sectors and  to support them, inasmuch as they will not be able to get up to  the world level by themselves. Even the best sectors of our  processing industry and the science-intensive sectors of the VPK  [military industrial complex] require major support from the  state for 3 to 5 years in order to come up to world standards  and compete in world markets as an equal.    Where are we to obtain these funds? Our raw material,  petroleum, and gas are the only competitive products. Clearly,  we have to invest funds in this sector to obtain the resources  needed. I share the view of the Academy of Sciences economists  who say that we should take more from the fuel and power  complex, because this is the only complex where a positive  value-added is really being created in world prices. All the  other sectors are producing a negative value-added.    In theory this is absolutely correct, but in practice the  situation today is such that the extraction of raw material is  falling and oil production is falling, and huge investments are  needed; in addition to this, prices in the world market are  dropping disastrously. Our price for a metric ton of oil is now  41,000 rubles [R], but the world price was R120,000 not long  ago. Think of it, we had 30 percent of the world value at one  point. Now it has dropped to 80,000! For this reason, it is  vitally important for us that the TEK [fuel and power complex]  stand on its own feet. This is why I believe that freezing  prices for energy resources is essentially a conservative idea.  I do not think we can follow this path. Some control is  possible, but not so that it interferes with the process of  shaping the new relative prices.    The program states that the process under way is making the  structure of the Russian economy heavier, while structural  reorganization is moving in exactly the opposite direction. Can  we avoid this or not? Let us assume we were now undertaking, in  conformity with the canons and our way of thinking in the  1970's, to restructure the production structure this way: by  giving more to the consumer sector, less to the extractive  industry, and more to machinebuilding, as in the years of  acceleration. Is this correct? I have serious doubts about this.    The consumer sector. In itself it is not needed, but it has  been called upon to provide the public with inexpensive,  high-quality commodities. But very often the imported products  turn out to be better than the domestic ones and more preferable  for the consumer. I do not know what kind of sector will survive  in the consumer sector, but there is simply no sense in  protecting everything in succession. For this reason, the thesis  about making the economy heavier, as a reproach and indication  that some problem is increasing, is really unconvincing. It  seems to me this reflects the ideology of the 1970's, when we  assumed that perestroyka would take place within a closed  Russian economy.    But now we do not even know exactly those strong aspects  which will make their appearance, and how the structure of the  Russian economy will take shape. Moreover, very positive  structural shifts in the country are clearly apparent. Trade and  the banking and monetary sectors are developing rapidly.    Not everyone likes this. In this case we say that everything  is going into middleman operations, but we need real production.  From the viewpoint of Marxist theory, this is correct, perhaps.  However, trade and banking also produce a gross domestic  product, generally speaking. And if capital has been channeled  here now, it means it is more profitable to put it here.  <H5>  [11 Feb p 7] </H5>   [Text] Let us remember what the Russian economy suffers  from the most and what it needs to increase its effectiveness.  Trade and banking. This is precisely where the mechanism to  regulate market relationships is being shaped, where we will be  prompted to direct our money, how prices will be formed, and so  forth. For this reason, simply to condemn intermediary  operations means to ignore the very progressive structural  shifts which are taking place in Russia, regardless of what we  wish to happen. They are taking place precisely because its  economy has turned out to be liberalized and open to a  substantial degree.    Let us turn to another thesis in the program, which states  that we should control prices and why we cannot make the  transition to a market economy like all the other countries. The  reason is indicated: the excessive monopolism of the Russian  economy. It is really extensive. But in a closed economy it  looks simply colossal. Incidentally, I was one of the first to  study monopolism in Russia in the 1986-1987 period. And I am  very careful how I treat this opinion now.    I will explain why. Monopolism in the Russian economy has  undergone quite extensive transformations, to which few persons  devote any attention, for some reason. Many monopolies which  seemed to be particularly dangerous ceased to appear that way  with the opening of the economy. Moreover, they turned out to be  more vulnerable than other enterprises and other sectors.    Here is one of the examples. AvtoVAZ [Volga Automotive  Plant]  is obviously a monopolist enterprise. But today it is running to  the government, asking for higher tariffs on imported motor  vehicles. The ZIL [Automotive Plant imeni Likhachev] is doing  the same thing. Many of our other major plants have rushed to  the center: rescue us quickly. because our products are not  competitive and our costs are excessively high. In other words,  they felt the competition.    This is what the opening of an economy means. Meanwhile, the  economists argued: can it have a substantial effect on the  status of the domestic market of a vast country such as Russia,  with a low proportion of imports in domestic consumption, and  the like? In my view, it has now become clear that opening of  the economy is exerting a revolutionizing influence on the  condition of the domestic market, on competition, and so forth  which is much stronger than could have been expected.    Does this mean that monopolism is not a problem? Of course,  it is. But only now its solution requires not general  theoretical academic debates, but a more specific and active  analysis. The monopolism which exists in the rayon around a  dairy plant or a meat combine, or a trade and distribution  network, is much more important than the monopolism which we see  at the level of industrial giants. From this point of view I may  argue with A. Chubays, let us say, that all the statements  against financial-industrial groups or large holding companies  are not always well-grounded. If foreign competition is really a  factor, their influence does not turn out to be so strong.    But of course, these groups will enjoy greater influence  within the country than the foreign competitors. And there is  unquestionably a certain danger here. But in the document under  discussion, this matter is discussed in a very general way and  the following verdict is handed down: we have monopolism, and  for this reason we should control prices, although the latter  does not completely follow from the former. In fact, it is  important see where monopolism is particularly substantial now.  If we are referring to power companies which raise the rates for  electricity, let us say, there is monopolism here and we must  combat it. Because we cannot replace energy with a foreign  product. At the same time, the regional power commissions are  misusing their position: they set the rates lower for their  customers and higher for other regions. And it is necessary to  control prices for a period of time. The same thing applies to  railroad tariffs. We cannot overcome the monopoly here, and no  one in the foreign market will replace it.    It is another matter when we are talking about milk and  meat,  let us say. But don't we freeze bottling? We have to follow a  more difficult, but more reliable route, which consists of  establishing alternative ways to bring a product created on  sovkhozes and kolkhozes, let us say, to the consumer and giving  them the opportunity to build small processing plants, and so  forth. This is the kind of work which is being conducted at the  microlevel and does not require significant state intervention.  So it is necessary to control prices in the exceptional cases  when a monopolist becomes too bold, and so forth. There are laws  for this as well. But there should not be price controls on a  broad scale in any case.    There is one more thesis in the program--on support for  certain sectors of industry with state orders. When proposals of  this kind are made, the question arises right away: how do we do  this? I am not opposed to it. Let us assume that an enterprise  needs more time to accumulate investments and many other things  in order to adapt to a new situation. How can this be done, how  can the process be extended, and what opportunities exist for  this? In principle, can this problem be resolved?    Let us assume that we have resorted to the help of state  orders. Then whom do we give the obligatory orders to and at a  low price? After all, an enterprise may refuse to fulfill it,  since most of them are not state enterprises. Moreover, there is  a law in accordance with which making it obligatory for an  enterprise to accept such orders is prohibited. But even if it  agrees, it will say: give me inexpensive materials as well. And  then we return to the distribution system which we had before.  What for? To make the shift to the market easier? To restore the  planning system? This is more than astonishing.    There is another approach. Let us follow the market route.  And establishing state orders means they must be paid for at  market prices from the state budget. The newspapers are writing  here that the government is allocating R14 trillion to purchase  agricultural products. Let us assume that the agrarian lobby  shook out an order from the government without the hope that the  products purchased would be sold at the same prices at which the  state acquired them. But after all, there are other sectors of  the economy, the military industrial complex, for example.  Should it be given an order too? The program did not state which  sectors should be rescued with the help of state orders and  where the money is to be obtained.    I heard an unpleasant report the other day: our level of tax  collection is declining at a catastrophic rate, and the  proportion of taxes in the VVP [gross domestic product] as of  January this year decreased to almost one-third as much in a  year's time. I ask: Can academicians permit themselves to  approach the state budget so thoughtlessly, without the  appropriate accounting, without evaluations, without weighing  the actual opportunities seriously? After all, they must bear  responsibility for what is stated in the document.    In my opinion, if the state does not have the money, it  should reduce all kinds of purchases, namely those expenses  which are least efficient. I would prefer, in following the  recommendations of the program's authors, to spend more money on  investments, especially the ones that are most effective, and on  a reliable choice of projects. And this means it must be done  jointly with private companies, with private capital, with banks  and the like. The document says practically nothing about this.    Regrettably, I must come to the conclusion that this is a  very poorly grounded proposal which is unlikely to be applied in  practice. If the government considered it possible to adopt  these proposals as they advise, it ought to reject them very  quickly, because it does not have the opportunity to realize  them.    Now about the agreements on prices and incomes. This idea is  being championed by Yevgeniy Saburov. And I am also inclined to  support it. This is a very popular theme now, generally  speaking. And even Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, in speaking  about the application of nonmonetarist methods, seemed to refer  to the possibility that there there will be such agreements.    A positive case of a similar agreement may be cited: coal  miners in the Kuzbass and transport workers agreed that  transportation tariffs would be lowered for the coal being  exported, in exchange for which the coal miners would share  their foreign currency earnings with the transport workers. It  would be good if measures such as these are multiplied. But I  fear that on the whole, this is a completely unrealistic  proposal as a phenomenon on a wide scale.    First of all, we are referring to agreements between  producers and consumers, who naturally have different interests.  Moreover, both sides are poorly organized. They say that our  Russian economy is corporate in nature owing to the ministries  and horizontal integration. For this reason, they say, all the  enterprises know each other and can easily come to an agreement  with each other. They are not reaching agreement well at  present. But if we come to the level of a trilateral commission,  where negotiations are conducted on incomes, prices, and other  matters (I mean trade unions, businessmen, and the government),  it will turn out that these persons do not enjoy prestige among  those they have undertaken to represent. For this reason, the  decisions adopted at the level of this trilateral commission  will not be considered obligatory by anyone below it.    So we are not prepared to realize this idea yet. In our  domestic market, representatives are not inclined to consolidate  and uphold their interests together at the state level. There is  only competition among them at present. Each one is fighting for  his own piece, for himself. For this reason, I do not believe  that such agreements will become an effective tool of the market  soon.    But if this is true, the government has no other alternative  left to hold back inflation except a strict monetary policy.  They call it monetarism. But this is normal financial discipline  which is the norm in economic life, and until such discipline  exists, there can be no discussion about any kind of market  economy.    I would agree with authors of the report which state that  elimination of the budget deficit cannot become the meaning of  life and that domestic industry cannot be strangled for the sake  of it. I would agree with them if this deficit were not as  large: it is actually more than 10 percent. If we put together  all the proposals by ministries and departments on expenditures  now, the deficit would be over 16 percent. That is a catastrophe.    Who can proceed to do this, what kind of government, even if  it is the most protectionist one? Let the academicians speak  with the directors about what is impeding them the most. They  say: we are being impeded primarily by the high taxes. But when  you begin to touch upon the essence of the processes taking  place, it turns out that inflation interferes with them most of  all. Because while they have earned a certain amount of money,  it is quickly devalued. They have to invest in working capital  all the time. There is not enough money, and then the directors  begin saying: they collect the taxes, they say, and credit is  expensive... Correct, but the only means of doing away with all  these ailments is by beating inflation.    This is why I believe it is not at all correct to resort to  the false pathos of the slogan: down with monetarism as a  foreign invention which is harmful to the Russian soul. We are  referring not to monetarism, but elementary financial discipline  and realization that the printing press ccannot be the source of  the country's welfare. I believe the program's authors are well  aware of this.</p>

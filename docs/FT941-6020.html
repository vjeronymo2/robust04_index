			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: A new image to remove the stigma - ADT and its unconventional chairman ADT, the electronic security and car auctions group run by Mr Michael Ashcroft, once the City's bete noire, is 'a stock with a stigma'. Shares in the group, which retains its London quote despite being Bermuda-registered and having administrative headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida, continue to trade at a discount to markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Shareholders in Europe in particular have had rough ride - the shares collapsed from a peak of Pounds 21.15 in September 1989 to a low of 281p in December 1991 - and have only recently moved up to about 700p. On Wall Street, where more than 80 per cent the stock is held, the shares have recovered somewhat in recent months, but are still trading at a relatively low earnings multiple compared with the Standard &amp; Poors 500 average. Mr Jack Blackstock, an analyst with CS First Boston in New York, said, 'a pall hangs over investors' perceptions of the company that emanates from the firm's often confusing and unenviable acquisition record'. More bluntly, many investors remain suspicious of Mr Ashcroft who, long before acquiring the US-based ADT commercial security group in 1988, enjoyed a reputation in London as an unpredictable corporate raider having built up 'strategic' stakes in a number of companies including BAA, Lep and Christies International. In the process he alienated most City institutions, analysts and investors with his secrecy, accounting techniques and inter-affiliate transactions. However, Mr Ashcroft, 48 tomorrow, appears keen to project a new image, though he accepts that he pushed the rules to the limit in the 1980s and says he understands why British institutions abandoned him. 'I was chairman of a public company at 31, I had never met a merchant banker or a stockbroker,' he says. 'I made all my mistakes in public - but we all move on'. He insists that 'perception is still far removed from reality in London,' but he is clearly concerned about how he is viewed in the UK where some 19,000 individual investors still hold ADT shares. 'While New York will continue to be our primary market, we recognise the importance of London both commercially and financially,' he says, 'and being British, I am naturally keen to maintain my links with London'. The partial recovery in ADT's share price over the past six months in both London and New York reflects a reduction in some of the uncertainties which have overshadowed ADT in recent years, and greater confidence that the group will, under pressure from its larger North American investors, stick to its core businesses. 'Three years ago everyone was betting against our survival,' says Mr Ashcroft referring to early 1991 when ADT was hit by a legal onslaught launched by Laidlaw, the Canadian waste management group and ADT's largest shareholder. The Laidlaw suit accused ADT of 'manufacturing an illusory profit stream' and sent ADT's already shaky share price plunging towards its nadir. The suit, fiercely contested by ADT, never went to court. Laidlaw withdrew its accusations after being given four seats on ADT's board. The company was never formally investigated but it was scrutinised by both the public and regulatory authorities. At the time it was proceeding through the listing process on the New York Stock Exchange where it is now traded. Even before the Laidlaw suit, Mr Ashcroft and Mr Steve Ruzika, ADT's finance director, were drawing up plans for an 'Americanisation' of ADT. Since 1991 ADT has adopted American accounting and corporate governance standards, including accepting a majority of outside directors - nine of the current 13-strong board are non-executives. The re-fashioning of corporate ADT was a necessary precursor to completing a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 890m) refinancing deal last August which averted a potential crisis triggered by mountains of maturing bank debt and put options on two series of convertible preferred stock. The refinancing deal included Dollars 156m of new equity, two public debt offerings and a new Dollars 500m credit facility which is being used to retire the preferred stock this year. As a result ADT's debt maturity schedule has been extended and the balance sheet cleaned up, although the group still has high gearing. Meanwhile, Laidlaw, which retains a 23.9 per cent stake in ADT, reduced the perceived share overhang in December by issuing an innovative 5-year debenture which can be redeemed for cash, Laidlaw shares or ADT shares, depending on the ADT share price. With the refinancing out of the way, Wall Street analysts who have begun to follow the shares are arguing that the market will be able to concentrate ADT's core security and car auction operations. Both ADT's core businesses hold leading market positions in high margin service industries, offer substantial operating leverage and are strong cash flow generators with growth opportunities. The security services business, which installs alarm systems and provides round-the-clock alarm monitoring services reported Dollars 141m of operating profits on revenues of Dollars 901m in 1992, and is the largest in the world with over 865,000 customers. The business is expanding rapidly, particularly in the US residential market where growth has been fuelled by mounting concern about crime. Last year 145,000 residential customers signed up, making a total of 477,000. Most sign 3-year contracts generating substantial recurring revenues. Meanwhile, its smaller automotive division handled 1.4m vehicles in 1992, generating revenues of Dollars 343m and operating profits of Dollars 68m. ADT runs 26 car auctions centres in the UK where it ranks number one, and 31 sites in the US where the group is second after Manheim, a subsidiary of Cox Communications. Like other highly geared companies ADT highlights the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of its core businesses which have increased from Dollars 271.3m in 1990 to Dollars 321.6m in 1992, outpacing revenues which grew from Dollars 1.14bn to Dollars 1.24bn. The group's 1993 full-year results are due out next week and are generally expected to show steady progress at the operating level, although earnings are likely to be flat, reflecting the dilutive effects of new equity, higher interest expenses following the refinancing and higher reported tax rate. The one remaining question mark is whether ADT's current management will stick with the strategy focusing on the two core businesses. Since 1991 the management has moved steadily to divest all non-core operations and the new strategy is written into the strict financial and operational bank debt covenants agreed as part of the refinancing which specifically prohibit any divergent acquisitions. Mr Ashcroft owns only a small ADT stake but his position is secure. Last year he agreed a five-year contract worth up to Dollars 5m a year together with a valuable share option package. It appears that even if he harbours any secret ambitions to enter new business areas, or misses the excitement of his earlier adventures, he would have to use his own funds and private companies outside ADT. However, UK institutional investors have long memories and until ADT and its management have a sustained track record of delivering solid earnings growth based on their new strategy the stigma will not be fully removed.</p>

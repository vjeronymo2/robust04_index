			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / People: Insurance moves Colin Honey, 50, has been appointed deputy managing director of Domestic &amp; General, the fast-growing insurance company which specialises in insuring domestic appliances. Honey is being groomed to take over as managing director next summer from Howard James who is planning to take life easier following a serious operation. James will remain on the board as a non-exec-utive director. James' planned retirement ends a 17-year partnership with Martin Copley, Domestic &amp; General's 52-year-old chairman. Domestic &amp; General was floated on the unlisted securities market in 1988 at 165p. Since then its shares have risen nearly six-fold. By concentrating on a specialist niche - it has more than 2m policyholders - it has managed to escape the downturn in the rest of the insurance industry. ***** Commercial Union, the most successful of the UK composite insurers, is continuing to make extensive use of the coterie of former city analysts who have joined the company in recent years. Peter Rice, who joined CU from County NatWest in 1988, is appointed a UK divisional director. Chris Pountain, who made his name at Morgan Stanley and other securities houses before joining CU earlier this year, succeeds Rice as group corporate finance and planning manager. Pountain, 39, and Rice, 42, are both qualified actuaries.</p>

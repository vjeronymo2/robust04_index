			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich -- A member of the Young Christian  Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] brought  charges against [Republikaner chairman] Schoenhuber on Wednesday  [30 March]. According to his own information, Fritz Eckl,  member of the Bavarian Land Executive Committee justified his  step toward the Public Prosecutor's Office at the Landshut Land  Court by "all sorts of legal aspects." The abuse of the free  expression of opinion by Schoenhuber is extremely disgraceful  from the legal point of view and it severely harms Germany's  "reputation in the world."</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Late paying still plagues businesses NEARLY A quarter of invoices are still unpaid a month after they are due in spite of campaigns by business organisations against late payment, according to Trade Indemnity, the credit insurance company. A survey by the company found that smaller businesses were particularly badly affected by late payment. It found that in the April-June quarter, companies received payments an average of 26 days after the due date. That was down one day from the previous quarter's figure but was still a cause for concern, said Mr Clive Brand, Trade Indemnity's senior economist. Payment terms are commonly 30 days. Of companies that exported regularly - 232 out of the 718 replying to the survey - getting payment from overseas customers appeared to be even more difficult than from domestic businesses. The average payment period stands at 28 days beyond the due date, a slight worsening since the last quarter. Mr Brand said that action was required throughout industry to encourage prompt payment of accounts. He added: 'Companies are being forced to delay payments to their suppliers due to delays in receipt of payments from their own customers. One late payment has repercussions throughout the entire length of the payments chain.' The Confederation of British Industry and small business organisations have been campaigning for a tightening up of the rules on late payments and bad debts. A CBI survey last year found that nearly 20 per cent of small businesses were at risk because of the problem. Steel stockholders and textile distributors are the sectors suffering from the highest proportions of late payments, according to Trade Indemnity's study - 34 per cent and 30 per cent respectively of their invoices were outstanding for more than 30 days beyond the due date. Overall, 10 per cent of companies had more than half of invoices unpaid for at least 30 days. Companies with a turnover of less than Pounds 1m typically had 27 per cent of their invoices outstanding after 30 days. That compared with an average of 13 per cent for companies of Pounds 50m-plus turnover. A quarter of companies have been updating their overdue accounts procedures, 21 per cent are taking extra steps to verify creditworthiness, while 17 per cent have changed their debt collection methods.

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / End to antiquated rules welcomed VISITORS TO Britain will no longer be quite so bewildered by the country's antiquated licensing laws if the proposals put forward yesterday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, are introduced. The planned reforms were welcomed by brewers, pub companies and tourist authorities. Reaction was summed up by Camra, the Campaign for Real Ale, which said there was no question of wanting to change the law on when children could drink alcohol 'but making the kids drink squash in the pub car park is one of the bizarre British rituals that really ought to be scrapped'. Mr Clarke, who once objected to being called a political lager-lout because he prefers real ale, said: 'It is time to relax some of the laws which have made most pubs no-go areas for families.' The Brewers' Society strongly welcomed the move to provide children's certificates for suitable pubs to allow youngsters under the age of 14 to be admitted up to 8pm when accompanied by an adult. Mr Robin Simpson, the Brewers' Society's director, said: 'It is sheer common sense to allow pubs to apply for these certificates and it reflects the fact that pubs are now a modern leisure unit which should be available for use by all the family. It is also the best way to get over a sensible drinking message to the kids.' Pubmaster, the UK's largest independent pub retailer with more than 2,000 pubs, said the relaxations would bring Britain more into line with the rest of Europe. It would also create more potential business for the licensed trade. This was welcome, as the chancellor had again hit beer in the Budget. Whitbread, the brewing group, thought the proposals would help to remove the mystique which surrounded eating and drinking in pubs for many children, and ultimately should lead to more sensible eating and drinking. Mr Mark Bennett of Alcohol Concern said he would give the proposals a cautious welcome if they made pubs safer and more sociable rather than heavy-drinking shops. 'But there are caveats. We want to know what the criteria will be for giving children's certificates, and we will be pressing for better training for bar staff and for a period of monitoring after the changes have been introduced,' he said. The English Tourist Board said it had been pressing for the relaxation of licensing laws and the idea of children's certificates would make life easier and more pleasant for families. The certificates are already in use in Scotland.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Swedish and Finnish PMs set for battles on the home front Comparing Sweden's accession agreement to its nail-biting capture of the Olympic ice hockey gold medal on Sunday may have been stretching a point for most hockey-mad Swedes. But Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, was unabashed in celebrating the country's 'most important international agreement of the century'. The 44-year-old leader of the conservative Moderate party has made getting traditionally neutral, aloof Sweden into the EU a central platform of his right-centre coalition since it came to power in 1991, alongside his aim of liberalising the huge state sector economy. Agreement on membership terms is also an important political victory for Mr Esko Aho, 39-year-old Finnish prime minister from the Centre party and leader of a similarly-comprised coalition. But both men know there remains a long way to go to secure approval in referendums promised in both countries that will decide if they can join the EU on January 1 next year as scheduled. First the young prime ministers will be hoping their Nordic fellow applicant, Norway, will also come on board, as a Norwegian decision to stay out would undoubtedly stiffen the already strong Swedish and Finnish anti-EU camps. Then, both Mr Bildt and Mr Aho have to decide when to schedule referendums. Mr Aho, whose own rurally-based party is split on the issue, favours the autumn to give time to win over doubters. Like Mr Aho, Mr Bildt has vital support from the opposition Social Democratic party, which originally lodged Sweden's EU application. But he and Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the SD leader, are set to tangle over the referendum date. With the latest Swedish opinion polls showing previously strong No support shrinking to 42 per cent, and the Yes vote rising sharply to 35 per cent, Mr Bildt is keen to hold the vote in June or on general election day in September. The Social Democrats, however, want to wait until the autumn believing they need more time to win over strong opposition to membership from within party ranks. This poses a real dilemma for Mr Bildt. Conventional wisdom dictates that a Yes majority is impossible without a powerful SD Yes campaign. The best conditions for a Yes vote may come if the Social Democrats, currently leading in the polls, win power in September and hold the referendum in October or November. But that is hardly an appealing scenario for Mr Bildt.</p>

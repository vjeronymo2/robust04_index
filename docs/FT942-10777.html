			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: IBM IBM's revamp of its 40,000 salesforce has a laudable enough objective: to present 'one face' to each customer. Too often the computer giant has confused its customers by sending in a different representative for each product. One IBM-er could be peddling mainframes, another data communications gear and a third personal computers - all to the same customer and sometimes in competition with each other. The structure also meant few sales people had a deep knowledge of their customers' businesses. Under the reorganisation, 14 new divisions responsible for selling a full range of kit to specific industry sectors such as travel, oil and health will be created. Though hardly an original idea - Hewlett Packard and Digital Equipment already operate in this way - the aim of getting closer to customers has its merits. The snag is that IBM chief executive Mr Lou Gerstner has not felt able to go the whole hog. The new industry structure will co-exist with the old geographical and product structures. IBM's regional chiefdoms will remain, while part of the salesforce will still be organised on product lines. The result could be a tangled management matrix. One only has to look at the snarl-up caused by a similar matrix at Digital to see the risks IBM faces. Mr Gerstner presumably concluded that a bolder shake-up would have ruffled too many feathers. While that may have been the right judgment, it serves to underline how hard it is to turn the IBM juggernaut around.</p>

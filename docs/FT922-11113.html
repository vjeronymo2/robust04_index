			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Kingfisher eyes office products warehouse deal KINGFISHER, the retailing conglomerate which includes Woolworths and B&amp;Q, is investigating whether to open discount warehouses for office products in the UK in partnership with Staples, a US speciality retailer. The two companies are currently conducting a market feasibility study which may lead to a joint venture agreement to open stores by the year-end. Such a move would have a significant impact on the UK office products market although the discussions are believed to be at a preliminary stage. Staples, based in Massachusetts, runs 125 stores in the US selling a wide range of deeply discounted office products and furniture in rudimentary supermarket-style outlets. Its stores are typically 18,000 sq ft making them bigger than traditional stationery stores in the UK. Each Staples store stocks about 5,000 brand-name office supplies spanning computers, snacks and cleaning equipment. The large volume of sales and cheap locations gives the company considerable economies of scale enabling it to offer low prices. Staples, which was founded in 1985, has acquired a reputation for aggressive organic expansion. It also owns a 16 per cent stake in Business Depot which operates three office product stores in Canada. It is not yet clear whether the two parties would simply try to replicate the Staples format in the UK. But Kingfisher possesses a deep knowledge of suitable out-of-town retailing locations through its operation of the B&amp;Q DIY chain. Last month, Kingfisher announced a 3 per cent improvement in profits before tax and exceptional items to Pounds 222m and said it was researching further opportunities for growth. Its attempts to expand by acquisition appear to have stalled in the absence of suitable targets and the company has put its emphasis on exploring more aggressive forms of organic expansion. The UK office equipment market has seen other new entrants in recent months. Last November, the privately-owned PC World opened a computer superstore in Croydon, south London. And this March Business Superstores opened a big office equipment store in west London with plans to open another in Colindale.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                              Although welcoming President Clinton's decision renewing China's  most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status and delinking the annual  MFN review from the human rights issue, Beijing has been reserved  in assessing the prospects for Sino-U.S. ties, suggesting that  the U.S. decision to retain sanctions and Washington's stance on  human rights remain obstacles to better ties.  While Beijing has  indicated its willingness to work to improve bilateral relations,  it has given no indication of flexibility in meeting U.S.  concerns on human rights and other issues.                                       END SUMMARY     Following the pattern set during last year's MFN debate, Beijing  reacted to the President's 26 May decision by issuing an  authoritative Foreign Ministry statement as well as a lower-level  statement by a spokesman from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation.  Although predictably "welcoming" the  President's decision, the 27 May statements--which were virtually  identical in content--suggested that the decision would not lead  to an immediate improvement in Sino-U.S. relations (Xinhua, 27  May).  Reflecting this reserved appraisal of the prospects for  bilateral ties, the Foreign Ministry statement said only that the  decision would create "favorable conditions" for the "further  strengthening and expansion" of trade and economic ties and for  the "overall growth" of the relationship.  The statement went on  to suggest that obstacles remain to improved Sino-U.S. relations,  describing the President's decision to retain Washington's  "existing sanctions" against China and what it claimed were  "unwarranted charges" by the "U.S. side" concerning China's human  rights situation as "detrimental" to the development of bilateral  ties.     The statement also reaffirmed the Chinese position, frequently  voiced in PRC media before the MFN renewal decision, that while  China desires better ties with the United States, the burden for  improving bilateral relations rests with Washington.  Pointing  out that a "historic opportunity" now exists to "enhance" Sino-  U.S. relations, the statement said that Beijing will "continue to  make major efforts" to achieve this goal and "hopes" that the  U.S. Government will adopt a "realistic and forward-looking  stand" and "take concerted action to show its sincerity for  enhancing relations."  In particular, the statement said the  relationship will enjoy "smooth and healthy progress" if both  sides follow China's longstanding prescription for better  relations and "strictly abide" by the "guidelines and principles"  of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, "enhance mutual trust,  reduce troubles, develop cooperation, and refrain from  confrontation."     Sparse Leadership Comment     Perhaps reflecting some uncertainty over how to respond to the  shift in the administration's China policy, Chinese leaders,  unlike last year, have generally refrained from commenting on the  decision.  For example, meeting with the president of a U.S.  securities corporation on 2 June, Premier Li Peng, according to a  Xinhua account of the meeting, made no mention of the decision,  even though the U.S. visitor reportedly said that his corporation  was "very pleased" with the renewal of China's MFN status (2  June).  Vice President Rong Yiren was also restrained in his  comments on the decision at a meeting with the visitor on 2 June.  He reportedly said that the decision was "wise" and "in line with  the fundamental interests" of the two peoples and "beneficial to  promoting Sino-U.S. trade and improving and developing" bilateral  relations (Xinhua, 2 June).     In keeping with this circumspect approach to the MFN decision,  PRC central media have given scant attention to the President's  decision.  On 26 May Xinhua carried a report on the President's  announcement that day which took note of the U.S. decision to ban  the import of Chinese weapons and ammunition, the sanctions to be  retained, as well as the administration's intention to step up  "economic, cultural, and educational contacts."  In the days  immediately following the announcement, Xinhua reported  subsequent remarks by the President explaining his decision and  as well as accounts of remarks by Asian leaders and U.S.  businessmen praising the decision.  A 28 May commentary carried  by Beijing radio's international English-language service to  Western North America merely reported the President's  announcement and replayed the PRC Foreign Ministry statement.     Vocal Hong Kong Media     PRC-owned Hong Kong media, however, have been vocal in portraying  the decision as a vindication of Chinese foreign policy.  A 27  May Hsin Wan Pao article, for example, suggested that China's  "open and above-board approach" as well as its "opposition to  U.S. pressures" had "forced the 'turn around'" in the  administration's China policy and "finally solved" the "problem  concerning trade" between the two countries.  Similarly, a  "special article" carried by Zhongguo Tongxun She, a PRC-  affiliated Hong Kong-based press agency, said that the decision  showed that Washington's previous policy of "using human rights  to put pressure" on China had "failed," while "China's policy,  'with good reason, advantages, and restraint,' has gotten the  upper hand in the present Sino-U.S. diplomatic dispute."     The two PRC-owned Hong Kong dailies, Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao,  took a slightly different tack and discussed the potential impact  of the decision on Sino-U.S. ties.  A 28 May editorial in Wen Wei  Po also suggested that the decision represented a vindication of  China's foreign policy and noted that the President's decision to  "change his hegemonist policy" and "adopt a long-range view" is  an action "worth welcoming," predicting that a "comparatively  pleasing trend is likely to surface in Sino-U.S. relations in the  second half of the year."  By contrast, Ta Kung Pao, while  welcoming the decision, suggested that obstacles remain to better  bilateral ties.  For example, well-placed commentator Shih Chun-  yu said in his 28 May column that only if the human rights issue,  which he called a "hindrance to relations," is removed will the  "development of Sino-U.S. relations embark on a new and easy  path."  A day later, veteran Ta Kung Pao commentator Kung Yao-wen  took an even more pessimistic view of Sino-U.S. relations in the  wake of the decision, asserting that because of continuing  problems over human rights, trade, Tibet, and Taiwan, it is  "unlikely that the United States will rapidly improve its ties  with China."     Outlook     While viewing the President's decision renewing China's MFN  status and delinking the annual MFN review from human rights as a  positive step toward improving bilateral relations, Beijing has  made it clear that China's position of opposition to U.S. efforts  to aggressively address China's human rights situation remains  unchanged.  Moreover, because of continuing concerns about  domestic stability, Beijing, buoyed by what it sees as the  success of its hardline foreign policy, may be less likely to  take a flexible line in addressing other issues of concern to the  United States in order to improve bilateral ties.

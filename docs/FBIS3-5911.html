Earlier, on the 4th of March, the traitor showed up at "the  graduation ceremony of the military academy of the Navy" and  incited war fever.    It is ill-boding that Kim Yong-sam accompanied by brasshats  incited the consciousness of confrontation and war fever at the  military academies at a time when working-level contacts for the  exchange of special envoys were underway.    This shows that the puppets are little interested in the  improvement of the inter-Korean relations, but persistently  seek only division and confrontation.    With the traitor Kim Yong-sam remaining in power, neither  the  successful promotion of North-South dialogue nor peace of the  Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification is thinkable.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Agriculture's shrinking wage-packet - UK farming incomes have been nearly halved in the past ten years FARMERS' INCOMES in the UK fell by 6 per cent last year. But when the value of their own and their families' labour are allowed for their businesses earned 14 per cent less than in 1990. It was the continuation of a trend that, indexing 1985 as 100, saw farming incomes slide in real terms from 170 in the early 1980s to 87 in 1991. These stark facts were revealed in Farm Incomes in the UK; 1992, published by the Ministry of Agriculture last week. The document also showed that while agriculture accounted for 2.1 per cent of UK employment, as it had for the previous three years (having employed 2.6 per cent of the country's workforce in the early 1980s), the industry's share of the gross domestic product had declined to 1.3 per cent from 2.1 ten years ago. Behind those depressing averages, however, the report indicated that although the incomes of dairy and intensive livestock farmers fell last year those of cereal and cropping farms increased although not, it was conceded, in real terms. So it would be reasonable to suppose that farmers in the area with the greatest concentration of cereals and other crops, East Anglia, would be feeling relatively buoyant, given their 'rising' incomes. After all, as Farm Incomes in the UK points out, agriculture contributes more to the local economy (4.6 per cent of East Anglias's GDP) than it does in any other region of the UK, including Northern Ireland. Little sign of buoyancy was revealed, however, by survey of East Anglian farmers conducted recently by land agents Bidwells and the co-operative Eastern Counties Farmers. The purpose of the survey, say its organisers, was to establish the level of confidence among farmers; to explore their concerns about the future and the options they face. Encompassing 140,000 hectares (340,000 acres) and 738 farmers the survey is claimed to have been the biggest of its kind ever conducted in East Anglia. The fundamental question on farmers' hopes for the next few years resulted in more than two-thirds of respondents saying that they saw no immediate signs of improvement in their businesses. Asked to compare this opinion with how they felt a year ago almost three-quarters said they were less optimistic about 1992 than they had been about 1991. Interestingly Bidwells conducted a similar survey at the same time among commercial property occupiers. The response in that sector was that 60 per cent were more optimistic than they had been a year previously. Questioned on what they thought of profitability prospects for the next five years more than two-thirds of the East Anglian farmers believed that 1993 would be worse than 1992. Some apparently thought that there might be some improvement after that but most predicted 'a plateau of agony' for the foreseeable future. In response to such a prospect almost half of those questioned said they planned significant changes in their businesses during the coming year. Neary a quarter said they would reduce manpower; most said they had done so already. Nearly a third proposed some form of diversification away from straight farming and food production and said that they hoped to generate additional non-farming income. One in 20 planned to seek paid employment away from the farm. Only one in nine of the farmers surveyed said they planned to purchase any machinery this year. Moreover some respondents expressed their concern for machinery dealers and the agricultural supply trade in general which is, if anything, suffering more than agriculture itself as farmers are forced to cut back on much-needed purchases. One farmer is quoted as commenting: 'Things may be bad on the farming side but will there be any of the supply industry left to support it in five years' time?' In the face of such adverse trading conditions very large numbers of farmers said they contemplated retirement within five years. No less than 56 per cent of those over 65 said they meant to get out of the industry soon. That may not seem too surprising to non-farmers but in an industry where people have normally carried on until they dropped it represents a significant change. Even more significant was the fact that 33 per cent of the farmers between the ages of 51 and 65 were also thinking of retiring within five years while 3 per cent between 35 and 50 and 3.4 per cent of those under 35 were considering getting out of farming. However, amid all the pessimism 18.5 per cent of the farmers surveyed said they were more optimistic than they had been a year ago, and one in six said that they hoped to increase the acreage they farmed during the coming year. Clearly these are the people who regard other farmers' problems as their opportunity to expand. They presumably mean to run any additional land they can get with their existing manpower and machinery thereby reducing unit costs. That way they believe they can improve efficiency and stay ahead of the commodity price cuts forecast as part of CAP reform. Furthermore nearly half of those wishing to acquire more land said they would prefer to purchase it rather than take it on any form of partnership, contract, or tenancy agreement. Farmers sitting on land with no encumberances (such as a mortgage) which has been in their family for a few generations can still consider such purchases and the average cost of the land they farm can still look cheap - if they do not compare the returns from recent purchases with those from other investments. But farmers have never been good at that and the sharp decline in the price of land over the last few years gives them the chance to expand at prices lower than they could have believed possible 10 years ago. For there is one other highly significant set of statistics which beggar all attempts to make accurate summaries of the overall state of British agriculture. It too appears among the tables in Farm Incomes in the UK and it is this: 1 per cent of all UK farmers have no external liabilities at all and 32 per cent do not have an overdraft. How the viability of such people can ever sensibly be compared with that of many of the others whose borrowing and interest charges dominate their accounts is beyond me. But at least it explains why some answer opinion polls differently to others.</p>

Yeltsin for the Russian Federation and by  J.-L. Dehaene for the Kingdom of Belgium]    [Text] The Russian Federation and the Kingdom of Belgium  henceforth referred to as the contracting parties,    relying on the bond of friendship and cooperation between  their peoples, the mutual trust and adherence to the common  values of freedom, democracy, justice and solidarity,    assuming that the Russian Federation is the successor state  of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,    believing that the historical changes taking place in Europe  have opened prospects for creation of a fair and strong order on  the European continent, based on a respect for international  law, the United Nations Organization Charter, human rights and  basic freedoms in accordance with the Helsinki Concluding Act,  the Paris Charter for a New Europe, the Helsinki document of  1992, "Challenge of the Time of Change," and other documents of  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE),    emphasizing the need for ensuring security and stability in  building a new Europe and striving to aid in this effort,    have come to agreement on the following:  <H6>  Article 1 </H6>   The contracting parties have decided to give their bilateral  relations a new quality of accord and partnership.    The contracting parties shall develop their relations as  friendly states on the basis of equal rights, respect for  sovereignty and political independence of both states, mutual  adherence to the principles of freedom, democracy, supremacy of  law and human rights, as well as the adherence to the letter and  the spirit of the Paris Charter for a New Europe, the Helsinki  document of 1992, "Challenge of the Time of Change," and other  CSCE documents.    This new quality of accord and partnership, based on the  decisiveness of the contracting parties to overcome the  consequences of the division of Europe into opposing blocks,  will find its expression in all spheres of bilateral relations.  <H6>  Article 2 </H6>   The contracting parties shall use all the means at their  disposal to promote a strengthening of the authority, role and  effectiveness of the United Nations organization, as well as the  full respect of the UN Charter by all member states.    The contracting parties affirm their unconditional adherence  to the principles of peaceful regulation of disputes contained  in the UN Charter.    The contracting parties shall actively aid in the  realization  of effective actions in the sphere of preventive diplomacy.  <H6>  Article 3 </H6>   The contracting parties affirm the decisive role which the  CSCE may play in the cause of strengthening stability and  security in Europe, and emphasize the principle importance of  the statutes of the Helsinki Concluding Act, the Paris Charter  for a New Europe, the Helsinki document of 1992, "Challenge of  the Time of Change," as well as other CSCE documents.    The contracting parties shall facilitate the strengthening  of  the CSCE for purposes of ensuring the guarantees of human  rights, democracy and the legal state, and preventing and  regulating disputes by peaceful means.    The contracting parties ascribe particular importance to  strengthening the capacity of the CSCE for actions in the  spheres of preventive diplomacy and regulation of conflicts.  <H6>  Article 4 </H6>   The contracting parties concur in the fact that security and  stability must be based on dialogue, partnership and  cooperation, as well as on the practical realization of the  principle of defense adequacy. They believe that a peaceful  order in Europe presupposes, on the basis of adherence to the  concluded treaties, a full implementation of the Treaty on OVSE  [Conventional Armed Forces in Europe], a continuation of efforts  toward reduction and control of arms and armed forces, a  development of measures of trust aimed at guaranteeing security  and stability on the continent, as well as the nonproliferation  of mass destruction weapons.    The contracting parties affirm their adherence to the 1968  Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the directives  coordinated by the group of countries who are suppliers of  nuclear materials, and the 1993 Convention on Banning the  Development, Production, Stockpiling and Application of Chemical  Weapons and Their Destruction, and will take necessary measures  toward excluding the transfer of materials, technologies or  equipment of nuclear weapons or other types of mass destruction  weapons in these countries to other countries.  <H6>  Article 5 </H6>   The contracting parties acknowledge the important role of  the  European Union, as well as the significant contribution of  international economic and financial organizations in the  balanced development of the world economy and in the political  and economic development of Europe.    The contracting parties believe that the success of reforms,  the transition to a market economy and the integration of Russia  into the world economy are facilitated by its rapprochement with  the European Union, specifically by means of conclusion of the  appropriate treaties between them, such as the treaty on  partnership and cooperation.    The contracting parties support efforts on cooperation  within  the framework of the Council of Europe. They acknowledge, in  particular, the importance of programs aimed at the development  of law and the strengthening of democratic institutions.  <H6>  Article 6 </H6>   The contracting parties are stepping up bilateral meetings  at  the appropriate level--political as well as  expert-technical--along with regular contacts in the course of  various meetings on a multilateral level and within the  framework of the European Union. All the questions which are of  mutual interest will be discussed at these meetings.    The contracting parties shall promote the implementation of  regular consultations on current questions at the level of the  Ministries of Foreign Affairs.  <H6>  Article 7 </H6>   The contracting parties believe it is important to develop  contacts and exchanges of information in the military sphere. In  this context, they provide for visits of military delegations at  various levels and exchanges of opinions.    For this purpose, they are compiling bilateral programs of  military contacts.  <H6>  Article 8 </H6>   The contracting parties shall cooperate in the humanitarian  sphere, giving first priority importance to maintaining  generally accepted standards of democracy and human rights,  specifically for the purpose of promoting the activity of  charitable organizations. If necessary, they will reach  administrative agreements with local authorities in order to  facilitate actions in extraordinary circumstances.    The contracting parties shall cooperate in clarifying the  fates of their citizens who, in connection with various  circumstances, find themselves on the territory of the other  contracting party, or who are missing there. Within this  framework, they conclude agreements for the purpose of allowing  the investigators of the other party access to archives which  might contain information on the above-mentioned citizens.    The contracting parties shall cooperate in the sphere of  return of archives.  <H6>  Article 9 </H6>   The contracting parties believe that such fields as culture,  education, professional training, public health and scientific  research are one of the important spheres of their cooperation.    With these spheres, which are within the competency of the  Communities and Regions of the Kingdom of Belgium, the Russian  Federation is ready to conclude the appropriate treaties and  agreements with the above-mentioned communities and regions,  according to the constitutional and legislative directives which  are in effect in both countries.  <H6>  Article 10 </H6>   The contracting parties stress the importance of better  mutual familiarization with each other's legal systems.    The contracting parties shall promote cooperation between  the  institutions of justice and the law enforcement agencies of both  states, including mutual legal assistance in civil and criminal  cases and cooperation in the struggle against crime, unlawful  circulation of narcotics and psychotropic substances, terrorist  acts of an international character and contraband, including the  unlawful transport of cultural valuables over the border.    The Belgian side will have a favorable attitude toward the  Russian Federation and will render it assistance in joining in  treaties on cooperation in the sphere of the struggle against  crime concluded by the Council of Europe member states.  <H6>  Article 11 </H6>   Without infringing upon the competencies of the subjects of  the Russian Federation and the Communities and Regions of the  Kingdom of Belgium in the sphere of international cooperation,  the contracting parties shall facilitate the enhancement of  mutual cooperation in the sphere of economics, energetics,  transport, communications, finance and agriculture, ascribing  particular importance to development of programs for advanced  training of workers at enterprises and financial organizations.    As necessary, the competent authorities of the contracting  parties shall develop new programs of cooperation, primarily in  such spheres as the agroindustrial complex, privatization,  financial services and banking, the trade network,  communications, informatics, transport, energetics, application  of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, and specifically nuclear  safety and the processing of military fissionable materials for  their application for civilian purposes.    In this context, the contracting parties believe that the  activity of the Mixed Commission on Economic Cooperation Between  Russia and the Belgium-Luxemburg Economic Union (BLEU) must be  adapted to the new situation which is being formed in connection  with the transition of the Russian Federation to the market  economy.    The contracting parties shall aid in the creation of  favorable conditions for establishing direct relations and  activity of enterprises and other legal persons, encouraging and  protecting capital investments, and developing exchanges of  economic information.    They shall renew the existing legal documents, increase  their  effectiveness and develop new ones which will be adapted to the  new economic and juridical situation in the Russian Federation.  <H6>  Article 12 </H6>   The competent authorities of the contracting parties shall  aid in expanding and enhancing cooperation in the spheres of  science, technology, space research and environmental protection  for the purposes of using the achievements of modern science and  technologies for peaceful purposes. They encourage scientific  exchanges and the implementation of joint projects.  <H6>  Article 13 </H6>   The contracting parties promise to hold consultations on  disputed questions, which may be raised by each of the  contracting parties in regard to the financial and material  aspects of the property and interests of individuals and legal  persons of both countries.  <H6>  Article 14 </H6>   The contracting parties shall ensure, on the basis of  reciprocity, conditions for the normal activity of diplomatic  and consular institutions, as well as other official  representations of the other party.    For purposes of specifying responsibilities within the  framework of the CSCE regarding the freedom of movement and  transit for all citizens of the contracting parties on their  territories, they will take into consideration these obligations  for concluding the necessary bilateral agreements in accordance  with international treaties already concluded by each of the  parties in this sphere.  <H6>  Article 15 </H6>   The present treaty in no way alters the obligations which  bind the contracting parties in accordance with other treaties  in which they are participants. They in no way affect the  obligations of the contracting parties in regard to third  countries and are not directed against any of them.  <H6>  Article 16 </H6>   Each of the contracting parties shall notify the other party  upon completion of procedures provided by its legislation for  implementation of the present treaty. The present treaty shall  become effective 30 days after receipt of such notification.    The present treaty is concluded for a term of 5 years. Upon  tacit approval, its effect shall be extended for each subsequent  period of two years, provided neither of the parties gives  written notification to the other 6 months prior to expiration  of the appropriate term of effectiveness, stating its decision  to denounce the treaty.

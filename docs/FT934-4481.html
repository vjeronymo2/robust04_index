			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Royal Bank One way of looking at Royal Bank of Scotland's 25 per cent dividend increase on cover of only 1.6 times is that the bank expects only modest loan growth. Without mortgage lending its UK advances would not have grown at all last year. So Royal may be anxious to avoid building up surplus capital. Its move could thus be a signal that other banks will raise their payouts to avoid excess profit retention as provisions come down. Royal's dividend, though, is also a striking gesture of confidence that another year of bumper profits lies ahead. It is not just Direct Line. Last year fee income, treasury revenues and profits from its US subsidiary Citizens all showed rapid growth, some of which at least should continue. Royal can thus rightfully claim that diversification has reduced the volatility of its revenues while putting them on a fast upward track. The question is whether this happy combination can last. At Direct Line, which the previous management stumbled across and the new one has cannily locked into the group, prospects look good. Mortgage lending may be less lucrative as base rates fall and competition increases. At some point the market will doubtless perceive a limit to growth, but after yesterday's dividend increase the shares have probably further to rise on yield considerations alone.</p>

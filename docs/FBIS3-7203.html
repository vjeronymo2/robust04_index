The king, who has recently been released from Beijing  hospital where he received medical treatment for his tumour near  prostrate area, is scheduled to return to Phnom Penh on April 8  after his brief visit to North Korea. The following day he will  officiate at a 90th anniversary memory ceremony for his late  mother, Queen Kossamak Nearirat, and then meet envoys who have  been accredited to Cambodia during his absence.    In his massage to his compatriots dated on March 23 and  received by AKP today, the king said he would hear "five very  serious problems or difficulties" in his first people's  audiences. He, however, did not identify those five serious  problems.    The people's audiences to hear grievances of the people date  back to the 1950s and 1960s when the royal palace was open to  hear and judge complaints.    "I know," the king said, "your problems are much more  numerous than five, but we must make a choice."    Selections will be made by the high privy council of the  king  who will meet next week in the royal palace to examine any  submitted problems.    The king has said previously he will only listen to the  grievances and leave implementation of solutions to government  officials.</p>

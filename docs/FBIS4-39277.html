			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Crimea"]    [Text] The officers and warrant officers of the naval base  at Donuzlava have sent an open letter to Admiral Feliks Gromov,  commander of the Russian Navy. It says in part: "The hopes  placed on the delegations of Russia and Ukraine on the question  of the Black Sea Fleet division have not come true. The news of  the supposed transfer of the Crimean naval base to Ukraine  causes a well-founded anxiety and an uncertainty for the future.  Should the Donuzlava base be turned over to the Ukrainian Navy,  the naval base along with the settlement would fall into decay.  The daily life of most people in the Donuzlava garrison is  connected with work in military units. None of us can even  admit the thought that the Crimean naval base will be turned  over to Ukraine. Should this happen, the more than 7,000  officers and warrant officers and members of their families  would be left without subsistence. Comrade Admiral, we have  faith in you, and in the common sense of the politicians who are  not going to allow the transfer of the Crimean naval base to the  Ukrainian Navy."</p>

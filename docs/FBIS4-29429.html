			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 17 (YONHAP) -- Since the inauguration of  Kim Yong-sam, the Presidential Secretariat and the Presidential  Security Service managed to cut expenses by more than 1 billion  won apiece last year, it was revealed Friday.    They have achieved such savings by reducing the number and  scope of official banquets and curtailing or symplifying the  presidential security service, the Board of Audit and Inspection  (BAI) said Friday.    The presidential secretariat managed to save 1,792 million  won and the presidential security service, 1,299 million won,  the BAI said.    It said the secretariat sliced the number of dinner parties  catered by hotels to 54 down from 210 times in 1992 when No  Tae-u was president. It also reduced the amount spent per  person at luncheons and dinner parties to 22,000 won each from  42,000 won and 65,000 won, respectively.    BAI officials said the secretariat spent 154.9 million won  for luncheons and dinners, down 585.4 million won from 743.9  million won the previous year. It managed the savings by  serving such humble dishes as noodle soup, they said.    The BAI, however, issued five warnings and handed two  official notices to the secretariat and the security service  after noting they had wasted money by asking for service without  concluding contracts beforehand.    As for souvenirs, Chongwadae managed to halve the cost of  wristwatches carrying the presidential insignia while reducing  the number of souvenirs to 15 kinds from 112 under the previous  administration.    Chongwadae thus slashed souvenir expenses to 383 million won  in 1993, down from 742 million won the previous year, the BAI  said.    The presidential security service, meanwhile, registered  savings totalling 1,299 million won by cutting back on manpower  and reducing information-gathering activities and travel, the  BAI said.    The board pointed out that the secretariat failed to follow  the rules on budget spending and accounting when it designated  suppliers before drawing up contracts to buy such equipment as  computers (41.7 million won), work on facilities (74.6 million  won) and publication of pictorial magazines and opinion polls  (64.7 million won).</p>

In this connection, the deputy commander in chief of  the Russian troops in Transcaucasia, General Vasiliy Terchenko  has stated the following.    It is totally groundless to talk about this. Russian army  units are not intended for this purpose. Moreover, I firmly  believe that the Georgian Interior Ministry has enough forces to  solve this problem on its own.    On the issue of Russian army units' possible peacekeeping  role in the conflict settlement in Abkhazia and the  participation of troops under his authority in this operation,  the general said the following.    Let us not overtake the events. However, I think that this  is how this issue will be decided and our units will be among  other Russian troops taking part in it. Therefore, the number  of our units in Georgia will increase accordingly. This and the  issue of bringing Russian troops [currently] in Abkhazia under  our authority must be solved at a governmental level. It will  probably be decided during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's  visit to Georgia.</p>

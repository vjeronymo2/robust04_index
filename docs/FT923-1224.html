			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Lafarge Coppee returns to modest profit growth LAFARGE Coppee, the French company which is the world's largest construction materials group, returned to profits growth in the first half of this year with a modest increase in net profits of 1 per cent from FFr688m to FFr695m (Dollars 136m). Last year,Lafarge suffered a fall in profits, the first decline for eight years, with net profits sliding from FFr2.19bn in 1990 to FFr1.23bn in 1991, mainly because of the downturn in the group's US interests. Lafarge managed to hold profits in the first six months of this year, despite a decline in cement sales in France, where the construction industry has been hit by the economic slowdown. The group had earlier announced that its interim turnover was 1 per cent down at FFr15.06bn. Earnings per share fell by 2 per cent from FFr13.7 in the first half of last year to FFr13.4 in the same period this year. Mr Bernard Collomb, chairman, recently announced that the group, which has expanded aggressively by acquisition in recent years, would be reining in its investments this year in order to try to restrain its net debt. Salomon, the French ski and sports equipment maker, expects to see a rise in profits, a 7 per cent increase in sales and a reduction in debt in 1992-93, Reuter reports from Paris. Salomon made a net profit of FFr66.3m in the year ended March 1992 on sales of FFr3.01bn. The company said capital spending should be stable in the 1992-93 after FFr131m the year before.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 27 TASS -- "During the discussion of the  president's decree on the protection of the population from  organised crime and the drive against bandits it became clear  that the majority of society regards the decree as the necessary  measure to curb crime in Russia," said Presidential Chief of  Staff Sergey Filatov, commenting on the president's decree which  took effect on Monday.    As for the opinion of a commissioner for human rights,  Sergey  Kovalev, who suggested that the president should recall his  decree, Filatov said that "his position, strengthened by his  experience as a human rights advocator, deserves respect."    Nevertheless, Filatov said "we believe that we shall manage  to avoid abuse as regards the rights of an individual when  applying the president's anti-crime decree." Filatov's opinion  is shared by the general prosecutor's office which shall  exercise control over its implementation. "Any incident when a  suspect is detained should be registered in a protocol and its  legitimacy is subject to control. An investigation is already  under way into 17 incidents of detention without sufficient  grounds, which is also a guarantee of the protection of the  rights of an individual. Besides, the decree applies only to  the most violent crimes," Filatov said.    "We do not live in totalitarian society. Such a powerful  weapon as the freedom of speech will be a counterbalance to any  encroachments on citizens' rights," Filatov said.    Filatov pointed out that his worst apprehensions were caused  by the blending of the criminal world and the world of  officials. "This "knot" might become a means of settling scores  with "unwanted" people, which cannot be allowed. The decree on  the fight against bandits puts a barrier to this dangerous  process," Filatov said in conclusion.</p>

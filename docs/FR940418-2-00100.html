The Department has set aside approximately $500,000 for this procurement. As a result of this solicitation, multiple awards will be made. All information required to submit a proposal is contained in this announcement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for grant awards will be accepted commencing April 18, 1994.

DOL's strategy for accomplishing this mission involves the building of new relationships with state and local partners and investing federal dollars to strengthen the effectiveness of local labor markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This solicitation represents an attempt to build such a new relationship through learning consortia, networks of otherwise unrelated for-profit organizations, particularly small businesses, forged to develop interfirm learning and information-sharing systems focused on workforce development and the changing workplace. Through each consortium, DOL hopes (1) to share human resource development tools or information about new work systems implementation, and (2) establish a cooperative learning system like a learning center or teaching factory. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Forming a learning consortium makes sense from the individual small companies' standpoint because a network of small organizations are better positioned to facilitate cost-effective, high quality workforce and workplace development programs than a small business acting alone. A consortium enables small businesses to more accurately identify common training needs, to locate and coordinate the services of assistance providers that can effectively address those needs, and to share training programs and other resources among member organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

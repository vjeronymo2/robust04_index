			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>   [Text] United Nations February 16 TASS -- The United  Nations Security Council completed here on Tuesday its open  debate on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition  to 15 members of the Security Council, the floor was also taken  by representatives of 57 other countries.    As on the previous day, the deliberations focused on the  NATO  Council's decision to deal air strikes in Bosnia. Algerian  delegate Ramtane Lamanra urged the United Nations "to pursue a  tough policy" in Bosnia, while Jordanian representative Fu'ad  Batayinah reiterated the Western thesis that the "NATO decision  to deal air strikes is in full accordance with resolutions of  the Security Council".    Contrary to this, Ukrainian delegate Volodymyr Handohiy said  that NATO air strikes in Bosnia were fraught with unpredictable  military and political consequences for all the world, that such  decisions should be adopted by the U.N. Security Council and not  by individual states.    "Ukraine is deeply disturbed by the fact that U.N. forces  could become targets of reply blows from radical Serbian field  commanders if air strikes are launched even on a limited scale,"  Handohiy stressed. "Taking this into account, the United Nations  may find itself deeply involved in a military confrontation with  unpredictable military and political consequences not only for  the region, but for the world as a whole," he added.    The Ukrainian representatative stressed that he did not rule  out the use of all the available means, including armed forces,  in reply to hostile actions in areas where U.N. forces are  deployed, and also when there is no other way to stop the  killing of innocent people. "However, such actions should be  taken only when there is a clearly expressed decision of the  Security Council," Handohiy stated.    "NATO air strikes in Bosnia will not help achieve a lasting  political settlement of the Bosnian problem. They will merely  cross out everything that has already been achieved during the  peace talks," permanent delegate of the United Republic of  Yugoslavia on the United Nations Dragomir Dzekic stated. "The  United Republic of Yugoslavia bluntly objects to this decision,"  he stressed. "It will make the prospects for overcoming the  crisis even more uncertain. Any attempt to deal air strikes will  signify direct involvement in a civil war in behalf of one of  the sides involved in it. Those who advocate this, will bear  responsibility for the inevitable consequences and for the  possible escalation of the conflict."    After the open debate, Chairman of the Security Council  Roble  Olhaye (Djibouti) told journalists that no decision would be  passed on the results of the discussion. "We simply gave  everybody a chance to express their view on the problem," Olhaye  noted.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Banks call Efim loans into default SOME 150 international banks yesterday called into default their loans to Efim, the Italian state holding company, marking a further deterioration in relations between the Italian state and the international financial markets. The banks had been angered by the Italian government's move last month to put the holding company into liquidation, and its announcement on Thursday that banks would receive substantially below market interest rates until their loans are repaid. The Italian Treasury expressed surprise at the action. It said banks should have been well aware of the group's poor financial health, given the 'particularly high' interest rates that were paid on its debt. Bankers, however, said they regarded Efim as virtually an arm of the Italian Treasury. One foreign banker, head of a syndicate which lent money to an Efim subsidiary, said: 'I can't think of the last time a G7 country was in default on its quasi-state debt. The implications for the republic in the international financial markets must be severe.' The default followed a meeting in London on Thursday of banks which lead Efim's main banking syndicates. They agreed to co-operate, and chose the US banks Citicorp, Chase, Chemical and Bankers Trust and Mitsubishi Bank of Japan to co-ordinate their actions. The formal announcement of default was in part a technical step to protect the position of the banks. However, its timing, a day after the decree which set the interest rate on bonds to be issued to creditors, was intended to signal what one called 'extreme displeasure'. One member of the co-ordinating group suggested that the move was a warning that any Italian state holding company could be called into default. They are already technically in default, having been transformed from state entities into joint stock companies, although banks have not taken any steps on this move. Mr Piero Barucci, the Treasury minister and an ex-banker, noted that, under the plan to issue bonds to creditors, foreign and Italian banks would receive equal treatment. 'I hope all creditors will see the Efim problem as part of the big effort the Italian government is making to reassure creditors and prepare for all eventualities,' he said.

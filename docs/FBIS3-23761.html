			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Arkhipov, reporting from St. Petersburg: </F> "The Mayor Was Annoyed and Issued a Manifesto"]    [Text] St. Petersburg promises to break the new  custom of not paying attention to elections to local governing  bodies. The provincial modesty for which even elections to the  Moscow Duma were noted apparently does not suit the city on the  Neva.    The campaign for 50 seats on the City Assembly, which  operates on a "volunteer basis," meets once a week and is only  entrusted with the functions of a representatives' club, has  produced an unexpected burst of political activity. Every party,  movement and ideology will be represented in the election -- no  one has decided not to participate or to declare a boycott.    This activity was mainly inspired by the city  administration,  which laid down playing rules that are acceptable to a majority  of political organizations. The "sound and fury" of Mayor  Anatoliy Sobchak, despondent over the Russian Democratic Reform  Movement's poor showing in the December election, and the  audacity with which jurist Sobchak handles constitutional  standards, have really gotten the city's political circles  excited. For example, the Election Statute approved by the mayor  denies the right to vote to St. Petersburg's 100,000 students,  cadets, military personnel and citizens who have not met the  "residency requirement" (something not envisioned by the  Constitution), and candidates must be at least 21 years old  instead of 18! An amendment to the Election Statute that was  released on 22 January finally convinced everyone that the mayor  is capable of "extrapolating" constitutional law ad  infinitum. Now suddenly one finds the caveat that deputies  from both the State Duma and the Federation Council may not be  elected to serve in the City Assembly!    It is no secret that this latest innovation is personally  directed at Aleksandr Belyayev, the former city soviet chairman  and currently a deputy from St. Petersburg to the upper chamber  of the Federal Assembly. Especially since Aleksandr Belyayev is  head of "Democratic Unity of St. Petersburg" -- the bloc with  the best chance of winning in the city -- and is regarded as the  most likely candidate for City Assembly chairman. Expecting  nothing good to come of that, the mayor has little by little  been creating problems for "senator" Belyayev: on Thursday he  was excluded from the special communications system, on Friday  his official car was taken away, and on Saturday he was denied  the right to participate in city elections.    The administration's legal escapades have resulted in  essentially every organization, from the communists to  Democratic Russia, now rejecting this "hip pocket" version of  the City Assembly as decreed by Sobchak, and coming out in favor  of expanded rights for the legislative branch. Incidentally,  they also reject the previous St. Petersburg City Soviet model  just as unanimously. One of the principal shortcomings  programmed into it was deputies' inclination to constantly  extrapolate their position to the Russia-wide political level.  The mentality of the "second capital," a city whose voice is  heeded in any situation, constantly prompted the deputies to  undertake messianic initiatives, such as the struggle against  the central USSR government, participation in the  "constitutional process," and so on. Now the universal image is  of deputies who deal primarily with city issues and are familiar  with the structure of the city economy and the interests of the  various social and professional groups in the population.    The political configuration of campaign associations (a  total  of 34 organizations and blocs have been authorized to collect  signatures!) is highly specific. Naturally city leaders will  inevitably exploit the symbolic potential of their party "stars"  from Moscow. But the correlation of forces in the city is by no  means an exact copy of the Russia-wide political landscape. Here  we see the effects of special connections which formed in the  past between politicians and various organizations.    One shining example of this is "Democratic Unity of  Petersburg," which unites 29 organizations, many of which  participated in the December election independently or else as  part of other blocs. These include Democratic Russia, Memorial,  PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Consensus], PES [Economic  Freedom Party] and social democrats and republics attached to  Yabloko.    Among the candidates from this bloc, which is headed by  Aleksandr Belyayev, are many former deputies of the St.  Petersburg City Soviet and businesspeople. It also includes  well-known jeweler Andrey Ananov. Among the bloc's campaign  slogans are demands for a new mayoral election, because under  Sobchak "city hall's actions have been shrouded in deepest  secrecy; it has assumed all the functions of the KGB." Belyayev  has filed suit against the mayor and together with a group of  St. Petersburg politicians went to Moscow to raise the issue of  Sobchak's activities.    Aleksandr Belyayev's bloc is in competition with the "All of  St. Petersburg" association. It was established by  businesspeople, bankers from the three largest banks and public  officials involved in privatization. Its leader is Sergey  Belyayev, chairman of the Federal Administration for Enterprise  Bankruptcies under the Russian Federation State Committee for  State Property Management. Many of the organizers of "All of St.  Petersburg" were formerly members of the "Russia's Choice"  movement. However, now those who represent big business have  decided to defend their interests separately, rejecting a  temporary alliance with the "experienced" but penniless veterans  of the democratic movement.    Despite the fact that these blocs are backed by various  business circles and financial groups, there is still a chance  that they will conclude a "non-aggression pact" among  themselves. For example, on a list of "untouchable" candidates.  However, it is already becoming clear that they will not be able  to transform their associations into "civilized" parties.  Despite original intentions to create a professional political  elite, "Democratic Unity" has been transformed into a temporary  alliance between various political organizations. And "All of  St. Petersburg," which has not been able to form a broad  political coalition, remains a closed, elitist club for those  who "have already become established in their fields," a society  that is counting on the current elite, not the formation of a  new one, and therefore supports the principle of a  "non-professional" City Assembly.    The extreme "implacable" opposition is divided into two  mutually hostile factions. The ultra-communists (the BKPB, the  RKRP [Russian Communist Workers Party], the RKP [Communist Party  of Russian] and "Laboring Leningrad") have joined together with  the nationalist radicals ("Ours" and the "Union of Officers") to  form the "Motherland" bloc. They reject all contacts with both  the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and with Zyuganov's KPRF  [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], which they regard  as provocateurs. In addition, "patriots" independent of the  communist groups have established a "purely nationalist" bloc  called "Great Russia" (comprised of ROS [Russian National  Union], the Russian Party and the Russian National Assembly).    Finally, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has not  deviated from its rules and will campaign separately. With  approximately 400 people in its organization, it hopes to win 15  City Assembly seats. It is noteworthy that its slogans are  largely in line with the ideas of the "radical democrats"  --merger of city and oblast, a new mayoral election, expanded  rights for the legislative branch, an end to restrictions on  voting rights, etc.    Of course, the whole campaign still lies ahead, but even now  there is reason to expect that the future City Assembly will  involve a tactical coalition comprised of two-thirds of the  deputies and directed against the current administration chief.  And, come what may, that outcome will inevitably result in a  redistribution of political roles within St. Petersburg's ruling  class.</p>

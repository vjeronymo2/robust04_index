			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / G7 'would back aid with force': Western leaders condemn warring factions in former Yugoslavia WESTERN leaders warned the warring sides in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday that they would be prepared to use military force to ensure humanitarian aid reached Sarajevo, the republic's capital, if the international airlift is endangered. In one of the most outspoken statements on the crisis in the former Yugoslavia by any international forum, the leaders of the Group of Seven industrialised nations condemned those responsible for the violence. They said the Serbian leadership and the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army bore the greatest responsibility. The declaration came as shooting, including tank rounds, broke out in Sarajevo in the worst fighting since a partial ceasefire was agreed last month. After appealing to all parties in Bosnia not to imperil the humanitarian effort or endanger the lives of those engaged in the relief operation, the G7 leaders said: 'Should these efforts fail due to an unwillingness of those concerned to fully co-operate with the United Nations, we believe the Security Council will have to consider other measures, not excluding military means, to achieve its humanitarian objectives.' The special declaration on Yugoslavia made clear the Sarajevo airlift could only be the beginning of a larger humanitarian effort and the transport of aid by road to Sarajevo, and other needy parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina, must also be guaranteed. Although all subscribed to the declaration, the G7 members differ in their willingness to contemplate the use of force. France is in the forefront of those believing a military effort will eventually be required, and President Francois Mitterrand has been putting forward various ideas on how it could be organised. One is that a combined force of troops from the UN and the nine-nation Western European Union should ensure the safety of aid convoys, operating under a new mandate of the UN Security Council. An ad hoc group of WEU officials has been considering contingency plans for operations in the former Yugoslavia and a special meeting of WEU foreign ministers is due to discuss the situation in the margin of the summit of the Conference on Security and Co-operation starting in Helsinki tomorrow. The US has been much more circumspect. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, said it was obvious that humanitarian supplies had to go in by land as well as air, but stressed it was 'unlikely' the US would send in ground forces to provide protection for trucks. While the US has made clear it is prepared to use military aircraft and naval ships to ensure the safety of the aid airlift and any future land convoys, it would leave the provision of ground forces to 'other countries', according to General Brent Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security adviser. Britain has been 'at the cautious end of the spectrum', in the words of Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. But even Mr Hurd, while ruling out the use of British ground troops, was forced to admit that the humanitarian aid airlift was a 'risky and dangerous' operation. However, British officials, like their American counterparts, consider there are enough other countries which would volunteer to provide ground forces. The declaration raised the prospect of transforming the European Community's peace conference chaired by Lord Carrington into a wider international conference under joint EC-UN auspices. Lord Carrington will fly to New York this week in line with the G7's desire that there should be consultations between the EC conference, the UN and the other parties concerned with the Yugoslav crisis. Mr Hurd, in his role as president of the EC Council of Ministers, will visit Sarajevo, Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Tirana the Albanian capital, and Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, next week. Judy Dempsey in Helsinki adds: Russia is continuing to oppose moves to exclude the new rump state of Yugoslavia - consisting just of Serbia and Montenegro - from the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. As leaders of CSCE states start arriving in Helsinki today for a meeting, they are likely to find themselves in a serious dispute about how to treat Yugoslavia. While Russia wants the Serb-dominated Yugoslavia to remain in the CSCE, several western countries are insisting that it be banned.

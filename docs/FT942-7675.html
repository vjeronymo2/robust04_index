			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean plan angers workers Workers at Codelco, Chile's state copper company, have reacted angrily to a Bill sent to parliament last week that aims to break the company up into separate divisions. The powerful Federation of Copper Workers (FTC) said it had not been consulted over modernisation plans, which it claimed represented a step towards privatisation. The Bill threatened the constitution, which was amended in 1971 to guarantee that Codelco remained in state hands, it said. Workers were particularly concerned at the future status of non-core divisions - the Tocopilla power plant and workshops at Rancagua - which, under the Bill, would be allowed to raise private capital. 'We are going to begin a great national movement to defend our inheritance,' said Mr Raimundo Espinoza, president of the FTC. The union is forming a commission to analyse the government's proposals and to formulate a response. The Bill came in response to declining profits at Codelco - largely because of its inability to develop new projects - and to a futures trading scandal that raised questions about the company's structure. Mr Villarzu, Codelco's president, plans to create a holding company which will oversee the operation of the group's six divisions, including its four mines. Autonomous management teams will be expected to run the divisions as if they were private companies, a strategy designed to cut down on cross-subsidies between separate branches and to raise efficiency. The bill also seeks to strengthen the role of the board of directors, much criticised for its lack of vigilance over last year's metals futures trading fiasco that led to losses of more than Dollars 200m. Mr Villarzu said the overall aim was to reach annual production of 1.4m tonnes of fine copper by the year 2000 - compared with about 1.1m tonnes in recent years - through increased productivity and the development of new deposits. He denied that modernisation implied a reduction in the number of Codelco's workforce of more than 20,000. Criticism of the Bill is not confined to Codelco workers. Chile's right wing opposition argues that plans do not go far enough in facilitating the use of private capital, for example in the development of new projects. Mr Sebastian Pinera, a prominent opposition senator, said the government's plan amounted to a dose of 'aspirin which will not cure the sickness'. Some on Chile's right have called for the outright privatisation of Codelco, an option entirely ruled out by the government of President Eduardo Frei.</p>

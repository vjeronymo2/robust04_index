			<p>BFN     [Text] The chief of general staff [CGS], Lieutenant General  Oladipo Diya, has again explained that the entry of the military  into government is not to perpetuate military rule but to save  the country from disintegration. Gen. Diya stated this  yesterday in Abuja when he received a special message from Pope  John Paul II on behalf of the head of state. He stated that the  present administration would not relent in its efforts to return  the country to democratic rule. The CGS told the envoy that the  democratization process had already commenced with the peaceful  elections to the Constitutional Conference. He commended the  role of the church in the current efforts to shape the political  future of the country.    Earlier, the envoy of the pope and ambassador of the Holy  See  in Nigeria, Dr. (Carlo Maria Gigano), had briefed the CGS on  activities to mark the forthcoming International Year of the  Family and the International Conference on Development and  Population.</p>

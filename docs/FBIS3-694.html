This position, adopted by the Cameroonian Government, was  clearly made known to the Nigerian delegation which visited  Yaounde. As Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono put it, Cameroon  expects Nigeria to make a goodwill gesture. His Nigerian  counterpart, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe, replied that there are  various other goodwill gestures apart from troop withdrawal.  President Paul Biya, clearly irritated by Nigeria's attitude,  refused to meet Alhaji Kingibe during his visit to Yaounde. It  is difficult, under these circumstances, to speak of any meeting  whatsoever between the two heads of state. The conditions laid  down by President Paul Biya for such a meeting is the complete  and unconditional withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the Bakassi  Peninsula. This is what Augustin Kouomegni, the Cameroonian  minister in charge of communication told Raphael Mbadinga.    [Begin recording] [Kouomegni] The Cameroonian head of state  has said that he is prepared to meet the Nigerian head of state  in Maiduguri, Nigeria, if Nigeria makes a goodwill gesture by  withdrawing its troops from the Bakassi Peninsula. If the  Nigerians do not comply with this prerequisite, he is still  prepared to meet the Nigerian leader in a neutral country. The  head of state and the Cameroonian diplomacy think Cameroonians  would find it hard to understand that the president would visit  Nigeria as if it were canossa [a place of submission] when  Nigerian troops have occupied Cameroon.    [Mbadinga] If Nigerians withdrew from Cameroonian territory  now, what point would there be for President Biya and General  Sani Abacha to hold a meeting?    [Kouomegni] The meeting would enable them to tackle all the  border problems between Nigeria and Cameroon because we share  borders of about 1,600 km. There are problems and disagreements  here and there. The two heads of state could, therefore, use  the opportunity to find lasting solutions to these border  problems, which run from the Atlantic Ocean to Lake Chad. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Observer: The Midas touch So much for the idea that Swiss bankers are conservative sorts. The latest letter to shareholders from Union Bank of Switzerland, flagship of the country's banking community, is filled with superlatives which would make any self-respecting public relations flack cringe. Anyone can see that an 89 per cent jump in UBS's first-half net income is jolly good without having to be reminded that 'UBS even managed to outshine its dazzling performance in the fourth quarter of 1992'. UBS's Gertrud Erismann admitted the language might be thought a bit over the top, but 'we feel that the result is so positive that it would not be honest not to be positive'. But despite the 'outstanding financial results', UBS did have a few problems. 'It is hard to understand,' says the letter from the board of directors, 'how an employee of our Chiasso branch . . . could embezzle roughly 1.3 tons of gold over an extended period of time.' Easy, the bosses were too busy making record profits.</p>

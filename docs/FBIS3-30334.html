			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Transcript of "exclusive" interview with Vladimir </F> Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, by  Srdjan Djuric, editor of the Belgrade-based Independent  Television Studio B: "Brothers, The Russians Are With You";  place and date not given]    [Text] All armies, including NATO, should be withdrawn  from the territory of the former Yugoslavia. The existing  situation needs to be strengthened, and the Yugoslav peoples  themselves need to decide about their future. Territories  populated by Serbs or Croats must stay under the control of  Serbs or Croats, while the Muslim issue is an artificial one.  You do not have any Muslims, said Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader  of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, in an exclusive  interview to Srdjan Djuric, editor of the Eye of the World  program of Independent Television Studio B.    The blockade must be lifted, continued Zhirinovskiy, and  then  everything will take a normal course. There will be Slovenia,  Croatia, and Greater Serbia. And that is it.  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, it is all Serbia. Nothing else  will be necessary. Let there be three states -- Slovenia as one  entity, then division with Croats -- if they are such great  Catholics -- and the rest will all be Greater Serbia. Borders  with Bulgarians, Romania, and Hungary. You have access to the  Adriatic; it is all normal.    [Djuric] Your idea of a confederacy of Orthodox countries  has been given a lot of publicity in Serbia. How do you  envisage this? Which countries would comprise it? What would be  its purpose?    [Zhirinovskiy] We need to think about the fact that in this  world, which has fallen apart, there are no longer two blocs,  there is no bilateral balance, and no fanatical ideology lasts  forever. All this has gone down the drain. Essentially, this  was violence. However, if we were to try uniting into some kind  of alliance of states, as Orthodox Slavs, this would make us  stronger, firmer. We would then have a single society, a common  language with you. We are one tribe. You remained in the  Balkans, the Poles proceeded to the northwest, the Russians to  the northeast; our civilization started there [as published].  The Russians went on their way, the Poles on theirs, and you  stayed here. Then they hacked you to pieces, gave some to the  Italians, Austrians, Germans, and Turks. They are all  barbarians. They came from here [as published] 500 years ago,  they conquered the Byzantine Empire, and kept you in blood and  torture for 500 years. Until Alexander II liberated all of you.  That is why we could now form a Slav alliance of Slav states.  The Balkans, Czech, Slovakia, Poland, Russia -- these would  make a very good foundation, because we share a common language  and culture. The Serbs, the Ukrainians, and the Russians are  all Orthodox. It would be easier for all of us, it would be  better. It would all be one expanse of territory, because this  is a single territory, one territory, a huge territory. If you  were in New Zealand, and someone else were in Argentina, how  could you unite? Whereas in this case, everyone is here. You.  The Bulgarians. Only the Hungarians and the Romanians are in  the way. A clear border with the Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.  We could save a lot on transportation. For example, from your  ports on the Adriatic across all of Russia from Vud to Japan.  There you are. Poland and Germany as well. Hamburg, Warsaw,  Moscow, Vladivostok. A Eurasian transit trade route and  everything will be fine. The language -- Russian. You will be  pleased to speak Russian more often than English. You even use  the same alphabet as we do. We favor doing something, we are  trying to accomplish something. However, the Slavs have always  been weak. The Germans constrained you from the west, the  northeast, and the northwest. If a new Russia emerges, we will  not allow them to go on constraining you. If you desire closer  relations with Russia, so be it. If you do not, you are welcome  -- everything depends on you, on your wishes. If the Russians  rule over the territory of the former Soviet Union, the  situation in Serbia and Yugoslavia will be stable. If the Serbs  are at war, the Croats, and Bosnia, it will be an endless war.  The same applies to our case. If you remove the Russian front,  we too will have an endless war, just like Afghanistan.    [Djuric] What is your opinion of the presidents of Serbia,  Croatia, and Bosnia?    [Zhirinovskiy] I do not know them very well personally.  Principally speaking, they are all former communists. I am not  a communist. And that is why it is obvious that there is no  agreement on ideology. I am ready to support them if they take  up a patriotic position, that is, where there are Serbs, that is  Serbia. [If they support] let us say normal relations with  neighboring states, so that noone would attack the Serbs, and  that they try to minimize any danger threatening Serbia, we can  reach an agreement. However, if they betray the Serbian people  and start betraying Serbian interests to the advantage of the  Muslims and Croats, then I cannot support them, because I  believe that an agreement is not possible. Where the Serbs  live, that is Serbia. All of it. Concessions should not be  made to anyone. The Muslims need to be removed, all the armies  withdrawn, and the war ended. You can live on tourism alone.  Tourism can make you the richest country in the world, you need  nothing else. Such sea, such beaches, so many beautiful  resorts. And now there is a war there, and everything is being  destroyed.    [Djuric] Finally, a short question. Do you know the  president of Yugoslavia and do you have a candidate for that  post?    [Zhirinovskiy] Who is the current president of Yugoslavia?  I know that Milosevic is the president of Serbia, and I did not  think that Yugoslavia had a president.    [Djuric] It does, his name is Lilic.    [Zhirinovskiy] Who? Lilic? Who is he? We know of  Milosevic from Serbia, and the Muslims have Izetbegovic. Who is  this Izetbegovic? What makes him a Muslim? And I know Tudjman  -- the Croat. There, we have heard of them; Tudjman, Milosevic,  Izetbegovic. While the president of the united Serbia and  Montenegro is not widely known, this is very unclear. However,  the alliance [as published]. We knew only of Tito, Josip Broz  Tito! That was all we knew -- Tito -- and nothing else.  Nowadays, you elect them and change them every year. For  example, that American -- where did he run off to?    [Djuric] You mean Panic?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, Panic. That was his fate. He came for  a while, he was here, and then he went back to where the greasy  sandwiches are. Why should he be in a place where everything is  bleeding? That is not a fatherland. That is a market. He  tried to be president of Yugoslavia and then he went back. I  know of Milosevic, but he is a communist. And that is his flaw.  Which is his party?    [Djuric] The Socialist [Party of Serbia].    [Zhirinovskiy] The Socialist -- of course, I raise my hat to  him. I told the communists here that they should change their  name, I told Zyuganov that he should rename the party the  Workers' Party. Everyone is tired of the word communist. And in  the same way that there is an Agricultural Party, he could  change the name of the party to the Workers' Party. It is a  good name. The Russian Workers' Party of Russia, the president  -- Zyuganov. Otherwise, they have no perspective.  <H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5> <H5>  Democracy </H5>   [Djuric] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, are you a monarchist or a  republican?    [Zhirinovskiy] I am a republican. I respect the  monarchists. However, I am a republican. I also respect  religious parties, but I favor a secular republic. That is  that. Here we have the Liberal Democratic Party -- law and  freedom. Freedom within the framework of the law; that is the  whole ideology. For me democracy is when the majority finds the  solutions, but takes into account the minorities -- as in  Yugoslavia. The Serbs make decisions, taking into account that  there are also the Slovenes and Croats and other categories.  However, it is the Serbs' duty to make the decisions. Looking  back into history, there used to be a great Serbia, and there  was order and silence. Yet now we will have 12 states, and  there will be war, bloodshed, and violence. Nothing good will  happen. We choose the lesser of two evils. The lesser evil is  Serbia's rule in the Balkans, the greater evil is 15 small  states swallowing and killing each other every day.  <H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5> <H5>  The Hobby </H5>   [Djuric] According to the election results, a great number  of soldiers and officers voted for you. Is that because the  army believes that you are the man who can restore its position  and reputation in Russian society?    [Zhirinovskiy] The significance of the army! Yes? The army  always displayed its sympathy, both at the previous and these  elections. I always say: I love the army, the KGB, and the  secret political police. That is my flaw. I love them. Other  people, they go fishing or have other hobbies, while my hobby  within the framework of politics are my sympathies towards the  structure of power. I used to be in the army. I love a strong  Russian Army, a strong KGB, and the political police, that is,  the entire structure of power, and that is why they voted for  me. Eighty percent of the officers, the army, the KGB, and the  police voted for me. However, since the voting was secret, this  cannot be proven. It can only be proven in the military  constituencies, which were closed to everyone else. There it  was obvious.</p>

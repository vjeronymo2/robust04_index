			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Italy lacks at least three million jobs. This is a  "structural" disadvantage compared to other European countries  which, together with a low level of education, makes the Italian  situation especially difficult. This was said by Labor Minister  Giugni at the presentation of a study of medium-term prospects  for the labor market.    Giugni said that in October employment fell by 550,000 units  compared with October 1992 and numbers unemployed increased by  350,000 units, while the unemployment rate went up from 9.7  percent to 11.3 percent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/6/1994 -- During the Tuesday,  21 June, debates in the plenum of the lower house [Chamber of  Deputies] the National Romanian Unity Party [PUNR] took the side  of the opposition when voting for an amendment that stipulates  that the state budget must apportion at least 4 percent of the  gross domestic product (GDP) to education.    Finance Minister Florin Georgescu in agreement with Dan  Martian, the leader of the ruling Social Democracy Party of  Romania [PDSR] parliamentary group, objected to the stipulation  by law of the percentage allotted to education and sustained  instead the amendment proposed by Dan Martian, which only spells  that the real growth of the GDP ratio apportioned to education  is compulsory, without specifying it. The 1994 state budget law  earmarked 2.7 percent of the GDP to education.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank maintains provisions below budget Deutsche Bank's budget for provisioning requirements against bad and doubtful debts will not have to be increased this year, according to chairman Mr Hilmar Kopper. He stressed that provision for problem cases such as Jurgen Schneider, the collapsed property company, and Balsam, the sport-floorings manufacturer, had come in under budget, as of the end of May. Mr Kopper said this was in spite of having to set aside DM500m (Dollars 314.5m) for the Schneider case, 40 per cent of the bank's total DM1.2bn exposure to the property group. He said he hoped to maintain the provisions at below budget throughout the rest of the year. Mr Kopper said the bank - the biggest credit institution in Germany - was still 'well ahead' on its own-account securities trading activities this year. This was in spite of the need for increased write-offs because of poor conditions in the bund market this year. Mr Kopper refused to give any more details pending publication of the bank's half-year figures. In May, he told shareholders at the bank's annual meeting in Dusseldorf that provisions would fall during 1994, from the DM3.3bn set aside last year, in spite of Schneider. The fall would reflect the German economic recovery. The provision charge last year was more than doubled, from DM1.4bn in 1992. Mr Kopper said the bank's total operating profits were down by more than 10 per cent in the first four months of the year, and he cautioned that the record profits made by the bank in 1993 would not be matched in the current year. He pointed to pressure on the interest margin on mainstream lending business, and poor market conditions for own-account trading activities.</p>

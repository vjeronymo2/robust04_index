Weekes plans to sell his 18.6%  stake in the Santa Ana company to a Connecticut investor, spurning the  recommendation of Newport's board to accept a buyout proposal from a Silicon  Valley firm.  </P> <P> Newport Electronics said Tuesday that Weekes informed the company he will  tender his 214,722 shares to High Technology Holding Corp., a company headed by  Milton B. Hollander, who has offered to pay $11 per share for 35% of Newport's  stock.  </P> <P> Newport's board recently rejected Hollander's offer in favor of a tender offer  and merger proposal from Sensor Control Corp., a Sunnyvale firm. Sensor has  offered to buy 43% of Newport's stock for $9.75 per share, and to buy the  remaining shares for $9 each in a merger.  </P> <P> Separately, Norman Gray, a company director, said that he and his wife will  also tender their 69,356 shares, or 6% stake, to Hollander's firm.

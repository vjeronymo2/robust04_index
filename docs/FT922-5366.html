			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Bush denies rift in White House PRESIDENT George Bush has denied rumours that he is considering turning to Mr James Baker, secretary of state, to bring order to the White House and direction to his re-election campaign. While campaigning in California he denied a report that Mr Robert Mosbacher, his campaign chairman, had urged him last week to fire Mr Samuel Skinner, the White House chief of staff, and replace him with Mr Baker. A State Department spokeswoman also said there had been no discussions between Mr Bush and Mr Baker, who are old friends, about a job change. Mr Baker ran Mr Bush's unsuccessful campaign for the Republican nomination in 1980 and in his position as White House chief of staff was a key figure in the Reagan re-election campaign of 1984. Mr Mosbacher was more equivocal. Mr Baker, he told the Washington Post newspaper, 'can be part of the solution to any problem'. But he refused to say whether he had urged the president to move him back to his old job. Criticism in Washington of Mr Skinner's record has been growing since the former secretary of transport was brought in to replace Mr John Sununu in the White House late last year. The president's lacklustre and frequently unfocused performance in recent months has been ascribed to the lack of political direction he has been receiving from his chief of staff. On the political front, there have been complaints about lack of co-operation between the White House and local Republican election efforts. The White House has also seemed slow to react to the growing threat of the independent candidacy of Mr Ross Perot, concentrating instead on traditional attacks on the profligate tendencies of the Democratic party. There has been uncertainty over how best to respond to the Los Angeles riots and, most recently, confusion over the degree of support Mr Bush should lend Vice-President Dan Quayle in his assault on the effects popular television has on traditional family values. According to the polls, the president is also not getting much credit for recovery in the economy. Although Mr Mosbacher may have reflected these concerns, the former commerce secretary is not an influential campaign chairman. His reputation was damaged by his role as architect of the president's trip to Japan in January, a disastrous excursion which is now seen as the beginning of the steady decline in Mr Bush's popularity.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUT ASTROLOGY IN ITS PLACE  </P> <P> Congratulations. You have finally found the right place for the astrological  forecasts -- next to the comics. I admit I occasionally read them, for  something to laugh at.  </P> <P> Even among the strange people who take them seriously, there are those who find  grave faults with them. The few that may some day be taken seriously are those  who base their expectations on the astrological arrangements in the sky at the  precise moment of birth.  </P> <P> ROBERT HARDING, Northridge  </P></p>

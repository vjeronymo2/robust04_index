			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (23): Devaluation helps Swedes and Finns - Recession continued to dog the region but stock markets rose sharply as interest rates fell and signs of recovery began to show / Country Analyses - Nordic Region After a dismal, recession-driven slump in the rankings in 1992, Nordic companies have rebounded significantly this year. Ten new Nordic entries - or re-entries - outweighed five departures (two of which were due to takeovers), compared with a net loss last year of 11. The turnaround took the total of Swedish, Danish, Finnish and Norwegian companies in the list to 45. Nordic companies also made their presence felt among the more eye-catching performers. Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, vaulted back from a loss-driven share collapse to re-enter the top 500 at number 199. Its rival Svenska Handelsbanken topped the list of big risers among established FT500 companies by surging from 465th place to 223rd. Astra, the Swedish pharmaceutical group, held its 1992 ranking of 32, the highest of any Nordic company. It also ranked as Europe's seventh most profitable company, with a 49.8 per cent return on capital. Another prominent Nordic re-entry to the FT500 was Nokia, the Finnish telecommunications group, which is riding a tide of growth in its mobile telephone division. It came in at number 301. Meanwhile, Norsk Hydro, the petroleum and fertiliser group that is Norway's biggest stock-listed company, registered Europe's biggest increase in profits, showing a rise of no less than 7,715 per cent. Recession continued to dog the Nordic region in 1993 - especially in Sweden and Finland. But stock markets in the four countries rose sharply as interest rates fell and signs of recovery began to show in the latter part of the year. In Sweden and Finland, companies also benefited greatly from the big devaluations in the Swedish krona and Finnish markka over the year, which boosted profitability. Finland's representation in the FT500 was quadrupled to eight from 1992, reflecting a near doubling of values on the Helsinki stock exchange over the year. The top Finnish company, forestry and engineering group Repola, improved from 387th place to 255th. Finnish newcomers, apart from Nokia, were forestry groups Enso-Gutzeit and Metsa-Serla, respectively at 387 and 471; Outokumpu, the mining company, at 482; and the banks Unitas and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki. Unitas came in at 440, while KOP edges in at 500. Six of Denmark's 10 FT500 companies also improved their positions. The main reverse was Carlsberg, the brewer, which was toppled from Danish top spot as it slid from 158th place overall to 229th. It was overtaken by AP Moller, the shipping group, whose joint parent companies, D/S Svendborg and D/S af 1912, moved up to 148 and 149 on the overall list respectively. Closer inspection of the rankings, however, reveals that stock market performance tended to be well ahead of bottom-line performance. Eleven of the 25 European companies showing the biggest swings from profit to loss were Swedish, Finnish or Danish. Prominent among these were banks and insurance companies. Most of the region's financial stocks rebounded strongly in 1993, as banks and insurance groups took the first steps back to health after crippling loan losses in 1992. But they are still carrying the burden of those losses: Unitas suffered Europe's 12th biggest swing to loss from profit  - Dollars 445.5m. Others in the list of crashing profits were Swedish insurers Trygg-Hansa SPP and Skandia, S-E Banken, Den Danske Bank and Unidanmark. Traditional Swedish industrial powerhouses also put up a mixed showing, at best. Three Swedish industrial departures from the FT500 - Trelleborg, the troubled mining and metals group; Industrivarden, a mixed investment group; and Korsnas, a pulp and paper company taken over by Kinnevik - balanced new financial sector entries S-E Banken, Skandia and Trygg-Hansa SPP, to leave Sweden's total representation at 21. Of these, only seven improved their rankings. Volvo's tumultuous year - which swung from heavy losses and an agreement to merge with France's Renault, to resurgent profits and the controversial breaking of the merger deal - left it down slightly in the rankings, from 129th place to 136th.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Leading Nordic countries by market capitalisation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                        FT500    Company                         Cntry  Dollars m     Rank   Sector  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1 Astra                           Swe      12595.0       32      433  2 Ericsson LM                     Swe      11831.6       37      533  3 Procordia                       Swe       6797.5       82      433  4 Norsk Hydro                     Nor       5691.2      104      214  5 Asea                            Swe       5595.7       47      541  6 Volvo                           Swe       4190.0      136      401  7 Sandvik                         Swe       3958.9      145      562  8 A/S D/S Svendborg               Den       3911.5      148      303  9 D/S af 1912                     Den       3884.8      149      303 10 Den Danske Bank                 Den       3068.2      186      112 11 Svenska Cellulosa               Swe       3028.1      188      651 12 Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken   Swe       2884.3      199      112 13 Novo Nordisk                    Den       2806.6      203      433 14 Stora                           Swe       2579.9      221      651 15 Svenska Handelsbanken           Swe       2558.7      223      112 16 AGA                             Swe       2518.1      225      621 17 Carlsberg                       Den       2438.5      229      421 18 Sydkraft                        Swe       2366.5      238      221 19 Skanska                         Swe       2231.6      252      613 20 Electrolux                      Swe       2227.9      253      402 21 Investor                        Swe       2212.9      254      131 22 Repola                          Fin       2200.4      255      591 23 Incentive                       Swe       1893.5      285      541 24 Hafslund Nycomed                Nor       1808.3      300      591 25 Nokia                           Fin       1806.7      301      533 26 Berendsen (Sophus)              Den       1723.0      314      481  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

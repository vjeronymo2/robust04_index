			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lourdes Mijan, director of the Havana City </F> Province waterworks directorate, by correspondents Heidi  Gonzalez Cabrera and Cesar Arredondo in Havana; from the  "Exclusive" program -- live]    [Text] [Gonzalez] An important meeting just ended at the  offices of the provincial waterworks directorate. The meeting  was chaired by Director Lourdes Mijan and included many  municipal representatives. One of the topics, among others of  great interest, was preparations for the tariff and metering  system that will go into effect on 1 October. I was hoping you  could tell us more about this.    [Mijan] We are currently preparing for the preparatory work  needed before 1 October, when we are supposed to start charging  for water with the tariffed service. The metering system will  remain in effect in Havana -- that is, those who have meters  will be charged according to the meter. We will incorporate  those who have broken meters or those who do not have metered  service into a fixed rate system.    People with metered service have the advantage that if they  conserve water, they may not have to pay anything because the  limit is 100 liters per person per day -- that is, those who  have working meters will only have to pay for sewage service,  which is 30 cents per person in cases where they are connected  to the sewage service. In case they do not have this service,  then they will only be charged for metered water consumption  when it exceeds 100 liters. As for the rest of the population,  they will be charged a fixed rate at one peso per person plus 30  cents for sewage where they are receiving that service.    [Gonzalez] I do not have time to cover everything our  listeners would like to know, but I think it would be important  if you spoke about those zones that are traditionally without  water, such as some areas of Habana Vieja, Centro Habana...    [Arredondo, interrupting] We can continue this topic  tomorrow  if you feel it is necessary. It is fine if you can finish  today, but we can extend the report until tomorrow if you need  more time.    [Gonzalez] It would be a pleasure, but that is something  that  Lourdes must decide. We will talk about this at the end. Many  people are waiting for this information. What more can you tell  us?    [Mijan] We are currently having difficulties with the water  service, difficulties caused by this situation because of the  period of the year. We are just entering spring.    Rainfall in Havana City was very bad last year. We only had  79 percent of our standard average rainfall. We are entering  spring, when there are always many difficulties with the water  supplies.    [Gonzalez] Excuse me, but there is some confusion among the  population. They believe that when it rains, there should not  be a water shortage.    [Mijan] The problem is that the water supplies do not  recover  that fast. It will take one month before we feel the effects of  the spring rains and our water supplies will recover.    Right now, we are having the greatest difficulties in Centro  Habana and Habana Vieja because we have a deficit of 90,456  cubic meters per day for the area of Centro Habana compared to  last year's figures. This great deficit is also caused by other  water sources that supply water to the capital, which at the  moment have low water levels.    We have made adjustments to the water supply operations in  the municipalities that have the greatest water supply problems.  We have begun working on a schedule in some places -- such as  Vedado, Plaza de la Revolucion, and Diez de Octubre -- in an  attempt to conserve water for the two municipalities with the  greatest problems. As far as this goes, we believe our sources  should recover in the next 15 to 20 days and that the situation  will be, more or less, normal.    [Gonzalez] I have been following the meeting that just  ended.  We know of the efforts, the achievements, and the solutions that  are about to be implemented. Can you be with us tomorrow?    [Mijan] I will have to make an extra effort because I had  other things planned for tomorrow. Nevertheless, I will try to  be here tomorrow to give you more information on the metered  service and the water supply.    [Gonzalez] Friends, that is all for today. We will continue  tomorrow.</p>

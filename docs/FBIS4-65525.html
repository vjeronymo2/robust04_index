Scalfaro made no direct reference to the rally -- which  spurred Interior Minister Roberto Maroni to ban repetitions and  suspend the local police chief and prefect (top government  representative) -- in a speech at Italy's oldest charity  organisation, the Misericordia of Florence. But he did say,  addressing the present members of the 750-year-old voluntary  work organisation, that "you are a response to all this".    Referring to present-day extremists' balaclavas and to the  early members of the Misericordia's practice of wearing cowls to  be able to do their good works anonymously, Scalfaro said "there  has been a leap, over 750 years, from covering one's face so  that no one might know who is doing good, to covering one's face  in order to be able to do ill".    In later remarks, Scalfaro referred to racist manifestations  as "an expression of that terrible evil which is to think of  oneself only, from which stem also wars, violence and the search  for spasmodic wealth". The response to "all this evil", he  said, is to solve "the fundamental crisis of today's world, a  crisis of love".    At the end of the ceremony at the Misericordia, Scalfaro  walked to the Florence Prefecture for a luncheon with Queen  Margrethe II of Denmark, with whom he will inaugurate the show  Royal Treasures of Denmark at Palazzo Pitti this afternoon.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Observer: Eeny, meeny, Dini, mo Antonio Martino, economic adviser to Silvio Berlusconi and presented throughout the recent Italian election campaign as the future treasury minister, appears to have stumbled at the 11th hour. The son of a former foreign minister, Martino is a Chicago-trained economist and one of the few Italian members of the Bruges Group. But it seems he lacks international prestige, as well as government experience, in the eyes of his growing number of detractors. Hence the ascendancy of Lamberto Dini's star. The treasury portfolio would certainly help placate the Bank of Italy's second in command, who has been less than happy since being passed over for the top slot when Carlo Azeglio Ciampi became prime minister last year. Dini is viewed as a good technician and has extensive international experience with the International Monetary Fund; indeed, he is in Washington at the moment, leading the Italian delegation at the spring meeting. His principal obstacle resides in the form of Berlusconi's partner, Umberto Bossi. The populist Northern League leader seems to think the central banker would be too closely identified with the old Christian Democrat party and the likes of former premier Giulio Andreotti. The prospect of having a hand in choosing Dini's successor might just prompt the League to change its tune. Then again, the latter guards its independence jealously. So Dini at Treasury may be only the beginning of the wranglings.</p>

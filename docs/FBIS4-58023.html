			<p>BFN     [Text] The U.S. House of Representatives has decided to  seize the Iraqi assets which have been frozen in the United  States since the Gulf war, valued at $1.2 billion. The JANA  economic affairs editor commented on this, saying:    The decision of the U.S. House of Representatives to seize  Iraqi assets deposited in American banks was a clear and direct  robbery which is punishable by the international law that  organizes relations between states. It is also considered as an  open violation and blatant aggression against all financial and  banking organizations in which dealing between states is  achieved and also under the protection and encouragement of  which, many states that produce raw materials have deposited  their funds in American and European banks.    This measure gives a negative and even a very dangerous sign  to Arab states that deposit funds and about the fate of the Arab  people in the West's banks. Under the pretext of investing funds  or protecting them from wastage and robbery, this measure  confirms with irrefutable proof that the Arab funds in Western  private and governmental banks are not immune, protected, or  invested and there is no interest in their existence.    The measure which must be taken immediately and without  official endorsement [as heard] is to withdraw these funds and  bonds, and redeposit and reuse them in the Arab region, which is  in most need of these funds in order to achieve its development,  civilizational change, and the prosperity of its sons who are  the ones entitled to their wealth.</p>

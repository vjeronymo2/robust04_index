			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Video and quiz games hit by tax extension - Amusement machine licence duty There will be a few long faces at today's annual general meeting of the British Amusement Catering Trades Association (Bacta) - the trade association for the coin-operated and amusement machine industry - in Birmingham after the chancellor's decision to extend the scope of the gaming machine licence duty to video and quiz machines. Mr Alan Willis, general secretary of Bacta, said: 'This will be a severe blow to a lot of small and family-run operators.' Mr Clarke proposes that from November 1 1995 the operators of these machines will have to pay a licence fee of Pounds 250 a year per machine. He increased licence duty on gaming machines already taxed, such as jackpot machines. The chancellor hopes that the renamed Amusement Machine Licence Duty (AMLD) will raise an extra Pounds 60m a year, in addition to the Pounds 100m that gaming duty already raises. The newly covered machines include the 75,000 video arcade games and the 20,000 trivia and quiz machines in Britain. Mr Clarke added: 'I am sure that this measure will be welcomed by parents, although maybe not by children.' Revenue from the newly covered machines is expected to be Pounds 10m in 1995-96 and Pounds 30m in a full year. The chancellor did not extend the tax to the 75,000 pool tables, 35,000 juke boxes, 30,000 pin-ball machines and 25,000 children's rides. The licence duty on small-prize gaming machines, which have a maximum payout per play of Pounds 3 cash, is to be increased by 19 per cent to Pounds 535 a year per machine from Pounds 450. The duty per machine on jackpot machines, which have a money prize of up to Pounds 200, will rise to Pounds 13,075 a year from Pounds 11,050, up 18 per cent. These increases will come into effect on December 1. The duty was last increased in the March 1993 Budget by 20 per cent. The chancellor argues that this increase restores the duty to the same value in real terms as in 1987. Mr Russell Smith, chief executive of Kunick, one of the three biggest amusement machine operators along with Rank Organisation and Bass, said: 'Although the new duties are of a relatively small amount, they could have a big repercussion for a lot of manufacturers and smaller operators. 'A lot of pubs are struggling and many small pubs are teetering on the edge. This will be another blow for them.' He added that only 10 per cent of Kunick's amusement machine business would be affected by the new tax.</p>

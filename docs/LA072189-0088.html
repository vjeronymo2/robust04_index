			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE PERMITS EASTERN TO TAP ITS ESCROW FUND  </P> <P> A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday approved the release of $75 million from  an escrow fund to help strikebound Eastern Airlines with its financial needs in  coming months.  </P> <P> Eastern initially had asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland for the  release of $100 million from creditors, while a committee representing  Eastern's major creditors asked for only $40 million to be released.  </P> <P> However, the parties agreed to the $75-million figure and the judge approved  it, with the understanding Eastern could request additional money from the  escrow fund, which contains money from asset sales.  </P> <P> Miami-based Eastern said it expected to file its reorganization plan today,  centering on emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and rebuilding as a  smaller carrier.  </P></p>

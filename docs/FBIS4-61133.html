			<p>BFN     [Text] Armenian Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan sent a  letter to Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in February  this year asking him to support the Armenian Government's  request for financial assistance from the EU to reopen the  Armenian nuclear plant.    In his reply, the Greek prime minister gave assurances that  he will spare no effort in supporting the request of the  Armenian Government, but at the same time he expressed the  following view: Considering that most of the EU countries are  concerned about safety in connection with the Armenian nuclear  plant, Armenia needs to completely convince the international  community that the opening of the nuclear plant will in no way  pose a danger.    I want to reiterate the Greek Government's determination to  actively contribute to your country's economic reforms and  democratic processes to which you and the friendly Armenian  people remain dedicated, wrote Greek Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou at the end of his letter.</p>

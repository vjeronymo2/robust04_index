			<p>BFN     [Text] Veracruz, 13 May (Notimex) -- President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari said here today that the debate among the  country's three leading political forces "is a big step forward  in Mexico's democratic life." "We have experienced a genuine  shift toward plurality. This shift, which is worth  consolidating, is the result of electoral reforms that the  country's various political forces have effected through  dialogue," he said.    After closing in this Gulf of Mexico port the Second Forum  on  Financing and Investment Opportunities for the Southeast,  Salinas said the confrontation "reveals our country's new  political culture."    Presidential candidates Ernesto Zedillo of the Institutional  Revolutionary Party [PRI], Cuauthemoc Cardenas of the Democratic  Revolutionary Party [PRD], and Diego Fernandez of the National  Action Party [PAN] presented their political platforms on  Thursday night.    Of this debate, which was held in Mexico for the first time,  Salinas said: "We can declare that the electoral process in  Mexico is not discriminating. Quite the contrary, it is  all-embracing." He added: "There is room for everyone in the  country's legal framework." Salinas said the candidates spoke  freely and voiced without restriction their opinions and  proposals so they can be considered and assessed by the Mexican  people. "From now on, everyone should obey the law and the  Mexican people's electoral will," he finally said.</p>

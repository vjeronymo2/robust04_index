			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / EU urged to accept Norway's oil rights Mr Abel Matutes, outgoing European commissioner for energy, said yesterday he supported Norway's request for a protocol attachment to the country's EU accession agreement that would clearly state Norway could continue to have sovereign rights over its oil and gas reserves, should it become a member of the Union. Following two days of energy negotiations in Oslo with Mr Jens Stoltenberg, Norway's industry and energy minister, Mr Matutes said he would recommend Norway's request be approved by the European Council of Ministers. Norway, western Europe's biggest oil producer and one of its largest suppliers, is concerned that a draft energy agreement, due to be adopted at a meeting of EU energy ministers on December 10, would force it to relinquish sovereignty over petroleum resources. 'On energy we have made a lot of progress and I have agreed to seek to add a protocol to Norway's membership application which will recognise Norway's full sovereign rights over (oil and gas) resources,' Mr Matutes said, adding that he would recommend the protocol be accepted by Mr Hans Van den Broek, EU commissioner in charge of accession negotiations. One other leading issue discussed by the two energy officials included that of Statoil's future role and status should Norway become an EU member and the management by Statoil of the state's direct financial interests in oil and gas licences. 'We discussed different models combining Norwegian interests in having strong, effective control but at the same time taking care of equal treatment of all oil companies,' Mr Stoltenberg said. Norway fears that once the EU's energy directive is adapted, and it becomes an EC member, it would have to change Statoil's structure and the way it is currently managed. Statoil is automatically given a certain percentage in all oil and gas licences and the state also takes a direct shareholding, which Statoil manages on its behalf. Usually the combined shareholding can reach 50 per cent and often exceeds that amount. Both men said important progress on energy issues had been made during their talks, but that technical details needed to be agreed before these issues could be resolved. 'We have discussed ways to find technical solutions to political problems,' Mr Stoltenberg said.</p>

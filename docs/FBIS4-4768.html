			<p>BFN     [Text] Bacolod City -- Reports about the emergence of a  third faction in the rebel movement have yet to be confirmed  because there are no concrete indications that another breakaway  group is existing.    But Lt. Col. Marcos Ibanez, civil military operations  officer  of the Negros Island Command, said that "if it is true, then it  is an indication that the rebel movement continues to weaken."    Ibanez said the emergence of another faction will be  advantageous to the government.    It will also be good for the peace talks initiated by the  government.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / People: Founder leaves Markheath Paul Bobroff has stepped down as managing director of Mark-heath, the loss-making property company 60 per cent owned by the Australian Adelaide Steamship Group. The resignation of Bobroff, 40, who founded the group in the early 1970s, was 'mutually agreed' with the rest of the board. His departure marks a change in direction for the company, which is returning to its core business of property investment and development. In recent years, Bobroff had tried to diversify by taking a stake in Camford Engineering, a motor components company which has since been sold, and in Frogmore, a property investment company. However, the plan to create a diversified group was interrupted by the property recession and the retrenchment of the parent company, which underwent a debt restructuring. In a statement to the stock exchange, the company explained Bobroff's resignation as: 'In the present circumstances of the UK property market, there is restricted opportunity for someone whose main interests are in creating and executing corporate transactions.' Instead of appointing a new managing director, the board will report to Michael Rendle, the chairman, who is a former managing director of British Petroleum, and Richard Westcott, a non-executive director. ***** Peter Popper has been appointed md of the design and management service company of HIGGS AND HILL. ***** John Springate has been appointed md of MAUNSELL PB, jointly owned by Maunsell and Parsons Brinckerhoff International. Most recently a director of Kennedy Henderson,he was seconded to TML while with Balfour Beatty. ***** Richard Goatcher has been appointed director of specialised works at MANSELL; he moves from Mark Fitzpatrick. ***** James Gandy and Philip Pawley have been appointed to the board of GROSVENOR SQUARE PROPERTIES. ***** Young he may be, at 43, but Neil Johnson will bring a lot of long-term insight into the UK industrial scene when he takes up the post of ENGINEERING EMPLOYERS' FEDERATION director-general in July. The Cardiff and Sandhurst-educated Johnson has been witness to nearly 20 years of transformation in UK engineering, from what at times has been one of its most changeable and uncomfortable vantage points: Rover Group, nee British Leyland, nee BLMC, nee British Motor Corporation. After serving as a graduate trainee with Lex Service, Johnson joined BLMC in 1974. In the course of seven years, in a variety of capacities, he watched at close quarters as appalling labour relations, productivity and other problems took Britain's biggest car-maker to the brink; and as one of Sir Michael Edwardes' corporate strategists helped tentatively pull it back again. He acquired another perspective from helping to package Jaguar for privatisation after joining it as sales and marketing director in 1981. Post-Jaguar's privatisation, 'soldiering on' for Johnson assumed literal meaning - he took a three-year secondment to the Ministry of Defence, commanding the 4th Battalion, Royal Green Jackets, before returning to Rover as sales and service director for Land Rover Worldwide. Currently he is Rover Group's director of European Operations. An affable father of three, as full-time EEF chief executive, Johnson will be expected to lead from the front in further developing the federation's representational ties, both with the UK government and, increasingly, EC institutions. ***** Richard Maudsley, md of NEI Parsons since 1985, has been appointed md of NORTHERN ENGINEERING INDUSTRIES, part of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group. An engineering graduate, he began his career with NEI Peebles in Edinburgh in 1969. ***** Elizabeth Forsyth has been appointed as director and company secretary of Pearson Sterling Finance on the promotion of Anette Lawless to become company secretary of PEARSON, on the retirement of Gerald Collett. Anette Lawless remains a director of Pearson Sterling Finance. ***** Nicki Hill, advertisement director of The Observer, has been appointed sales director of SOUTHERN RADIO. ***** John Cooling has been appointed director with responsibility for corporate development of GOODHEAD GROUP. ***** David Bremner, a director of B&amp;Q, has been appointed group md of WATSON &amp; PHILIP.</p>

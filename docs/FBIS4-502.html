			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town April 9 SAPA -- The Police Prisons and  Civil Rights Union [Popcru] has threatened to embark on mass  action if its dismissed and suspended members are not  reinstated, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio  news reported on Saturday [9 April]. This follows the alleged  failure of the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) and the  Department of Correctional Services and Justice to address the  union's grievances. Speaking in Cape Town, the union's regional  chairman, Mr Nathan Ramalane, condemned the TEC for not acceding  to Popcru's demands.</p>

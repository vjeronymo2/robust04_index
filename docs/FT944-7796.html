			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Important support for small and medium-sized enterprises Sir, As chairman of the independent Assessment Panel appointed by ministers to vet local applications to become a Business Link, I welcome your editorial, 'Small business management' (November 9). Independent market research was a key element in the rationale for supporting the establishment of a national network of Business Links. All proposals for individual Business Links must he backed up by separate market research into their target market companies, and they are required to undertake regular customer surveys which evaluate effectiveness of services provided. The target is that at least 85 per cent of Business Link customers should be satisfied or very satisfied with the services they use. A key innovation of the Business Links is the personal business adviser who will develop a long-term relationship with a portfolio of small firms, analogous to the account manager in an advertising agency. I believe that these personal business advisers are an important guard against your fear that Business Links 'may be keener to meet their targets . . . than they are to evaluate the benefits their customers derive'. Your overall message is, however, well-taken. In an increasingly competitive and fast-changing global marketplace, we need up-to-date information on the most effective ways of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises. We could usefully start by ensuring government-funded research into the small and medium-sized enterprise sector is better focused to give the programme implications back to policymakers and business support agencies. David R Grayson, chairman, national assessment panel, Business Links, 8 Stratton Street, London WIX 5FD</p>

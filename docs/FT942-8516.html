			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / World Trade News: UK minister prepares Cuba mission The first visit by a British government minister to Cuba since at least the 1970s is being planned for later this year, reflecting a warming of relations between the UK and the government of President Fidel Castro. The visit by Mr Patrick McLoughlin, parliamentary under-secretary of state for trade and technology, is likely to go ahead in September. It is a reflection of growing interest among British companies over investment prospects in Cuba, a small market but one from which US companies are excluded by the US embargo. It also indicates a Foreign Office perception that the Castro government is not about to collapse, despite the deep economic problems which the country has faced since the fall of the Soviet Union. A group of deputies from Cuba's National Assembly is also to visit the UK next week. They are led by Mr Ricardo Alarcon, president of the assembly and often described as Mr Castro's deputy, who will meet foreign office minister David Heathcoat-Amory. Mr McLoughlin, who may be accompanied by British businessmen, will aim, says the Department of Trade and Industry, 'to develop trade and investment opportunities' and may also sign an investment promotion and protection agreement currently under negotiation. The US government has been informed of the visit. A number of unofficial British trade missions have already visited Cuba under the auspices of the Caribbean Trade Advisory Group. Mr David Jessop, Caritag director, said that 'a number of agreements are in the last stages of negotiation' between British companies and the Cuban government. He declined to be specific, although at least one investment ran into tens of millions of pounds sterling. Some companies were trying to incorporate debt owed to them by Cuba into their agreements, and there was a possibility of debt-equity swaps being used.</p>

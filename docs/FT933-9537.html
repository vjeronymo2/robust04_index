			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Recovery seen emerging for Russia in 1996 THE crisis of the Russian economy will continue well into next year, but economic recovery can be expected in 1996, according to the government's latest blueprint for market reform. This medium-term programme, approved on Friday, also claims to have digested the lessons of last year, including the need for more social cushioning, more action against inflation, and selective rather than across-the-board support for industry. It lists unchanged strategic aims, such as land reform, and sets out essential institutional changes, such as the creation of an effective secondary share market. The latter has failed to materialise so far, despite the issuing of millions of shares as part of an ambitious mass privatisation programme. It also provides some details of a long-promised industrial policy. This includes, for instance, a need to convert military aircraft factories to the production of civilian aeroplanes - a process already under way. But, on a bloated sector such as metallurgy, it remains vague, talking of the need to reduce pollution and improve its raw materials base. The programme expects the economy to begin stabilising in the second half of 1994, saying that the completion of mass privatisation by then will have improved company performance and financial discipline. It hopes for inflation to fall to 5-7 per cent a month next year, compared to 19 per cent last month. It sees the budget deficit hovering beneath the target of 10 per cent of GDP target as early as last year. By the end of 1995 it expects the equivalent of 35 per cent of gross domestic product to be in state hands. It also expects an unspecified growth in living standards by then. In 1996, along with a halt in the slide of Russian energy production, and stabilisation of agricultural output, it predicts the beginnings of a resumption of economic growth. Finalised after last month's botched monetary reform, the report says, 'there are no serious reasons to predict catastophe unless we ourselves bring them into being'. The European Commission announced at the weekend a temporary solution to a row with Russia over aluminium imports, by announcing it would restrict imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States to 60,000 tonnes between now and November. This quota would include unsold stocks on the London Metals Exchange. The Commission, under pressure from EC producers to limit imports which have hit prices, said an investigation had found unfair damage had been caused to EC producers.</p>

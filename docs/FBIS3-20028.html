			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Socialist Party Secretary General </F> Antonio Guterres by unidentified TVI correspondent on 14 March:  "Referendum for Belem Palace"]    [Excerpts] Distraining the Antas Stadium was a reversal of  priorities in a country where "tax evasion is widespread." This  was how [Socialist Party (PSP) Secretary General] Antonio  Guterres commented on the affair of the moment on TVI, in an  interview in which he accepted the possibility of holding an  internal referendum in order to select the PSP candidate for the  presidential election. [passage omitted]  <H5>  "Primaries" To Select Candidate for Belem Palace </H5>   In yesterday evening's interview with journalists Artur  Albarran (TVI), Jaime Antunes (editor of SEMANARIO ECONOMICO),  and Luis Delgado (assistant editor of DIARIO DE NOTICIAS),  Antonio Guterres accepted the possibility of holding an internal  referendum in order to select the party's candidate for the next  presidential election.    "If necessary," Guterres stressed, "the Socialists could  hold  a kind of presidential `primary,' especially if it transpires  that there are several would-be candidates within the party."    For the present, the Socialist leader asserted that he will  not be "distracted by the issue" of the presidential election,  because his main aim is the legislative elections.    With respect to those elections, Guterres reaffirmed that  the  PSP will run alone, planning to win an overall majority.    What if, while winning the election, it does not achieve  that  majority? That was the unavoidable question. Will it make  alliances? With the PCP [Portuguese Communist Party] or with  the Social Democratic Center Party?    Guterres accepted the possibility in that event of trying to  "find the essential forms of cooperation within the  parliamentary framework." One thing is certain: "I will not be  stubborn; I will not go home, as the prime minister would do."    Before the election, he gave his assurance, there will be no  alliance with the PCP, partly because "the PSP and the PCP will  get more votes if they run separately than if they run together."    "Left-wingers will realize that the best way to defeat the  Social Democratic Party will be to vote for the PSP," he  asserted.    With respect to the PCP, he said that "if it evolves, it  could become a credible party." And evolution, in Guterres'  opinion, means introducing the secret ballot in its internal  life, accepting the rationale of the market, and changing its  pessimistic view of Europe.    The elections to the European Parliament were another  unavoidable topic for this interview, at a time when the PSP is  the only one of the major parties that still has no list leader.  <H5>  European List Leader After Weekend </H5>   But Antonio Guterres had no news to give on TVI: "The  selection of candidates for the European Parliament will not be  made before next weekend's National Convention," he repeated.    Nor did Mario Soares' alleged criticisms of his conduct as  party leader draw many words from Guterres.    "The country has problems too grave to waste even a minute  on  intrigues," the Socialist leader said: "What concerns the  Portuguese people most is employment, pay, and their children's  education, and those are the issues which concern the PSP."    With respect to the next revision of the Constitution,  Antonio Guterres showed himself, like Cavaco Silva, in favor of  retaining the post of minister of the Republic for the  autonomous regions and opposed to revising the powers of the  president of the Republic. What is essential, he said, is to set  up municipal police forces.</p>

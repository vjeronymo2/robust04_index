			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Israel arrests 22 Hamas militants ISRAEL, tightening its crackdown on Islamic fundamentalists in the occupied territories, said yesterday it had arrested 22 members of an armed guerrilla group and warned that a United Nations envoy due in Jerusalem today would not achieve the return of 415 Palestinians expelled to Lebanon last month. The army said the detained suspects belonged to the Qassam military wing of the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement and were responsible for at least three attacks last year on troops in the town of Hebron in which one soldier was killed. It said two more members of the group had been among those expelled and presented the arrests as a significant breakthrough against Qassam, whose mounting record of armed attacks on the security forces precipitated the expulsions on December 17. But the army admitted it had not yet caught those responsible for six fatal shootings in December - including the man it described as the commander of Qassam. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, meanwhile held out little prospect of success for Mr Chinmaya Gharekhan, a senior envoy of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, who will today attempt to find a resolution to the expulsion issue which threatens Middle East peace negotiations. 'Boutros Ghali asked to send an envoy. I agreed. It does not change even one bit my decisive position that the 415 temporarily expelled will not return to Israel before the end of their term,' Mr Rabin said. Mr Rabin's office said yesterday that no talks had been held outside the Washington Middle East peace framework, after the Jerusalem Post reported that Israel and Syria had held secret talks in Europe within the past two weeks, but that an Israeli attempt to find a breakthrough in negotiations over the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights had come to nothing.</p>

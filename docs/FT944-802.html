			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Northern Electric hits out at bid Northern Electric is strongly urging shareholders to ignore this week's Pounds 1.25bn takeover bid by Trafalgar House, writes David Lascelles. In a letter to shareholders, the board of the Newcastle-based company says the bid is 'wholly inadequate and unacceptable'. It fundamentally undervalues Northern Electric, and offers no advantages to shareholders. The letter continues: 'Northern Electric has demonstrated its ability to deliver value to shareholders and customers, and has a clear strategy to continue to do so as an independent company.' Some analysts believed the letter was meant to imply that Northern would entertain a higher bid, though many regulatory obstacles would have to be removed before a true contest could develop.

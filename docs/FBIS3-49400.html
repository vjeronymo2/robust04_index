			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evgenia Drumeva] </F>   [Excerpts] Sofia, January 7 (BTA) -- Today's press  allegations that President Zhelyu Zhelev intended to assume  direct command of the Bulgarian Army provoked a chain of  reactions.    Speaking to a National Radio reporter, President Zhelev  strongly denied the allegations and described them as  "insinuations serving dubious political interests." Zhan  Videnov, leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), did not  deny he had prior information of the scandal which broke out in  today's press and told a radio interviewer the issue had been  addressed indirectly at his meeting with Filip Dimitrov, leader  of the Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS), two days ago. In a  radio statement Edvin Sugarev, MP of the SDS and leader of one  of the SDS-affiliated parties, said the president should be  asked to tender his resignation.    A front-page story in TRUD claims that President Zhelev  intended to issue a decree by which he would assume direct  command of the Bulgarian Army. The daily runs in full a  November 1993 letter from President Zhelev to the defense  minister and the chief of General Staff, according to which the  advisers at the president's military office would get ranks from  second-in-command of the armed services up to deputy chiefs of  the General Staff. The daily quotes anonymous Constitutional  Law experts as describing the act as "a flagrant violation of  the Constitution." The Socialists' daily DUMA, says that Army  General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the General Staff, declined to  comment on the president's letter yesterday. 24 CHASA quotes an  anonymous MP as saying that Prime Minister Lyuben Berov learned  about the letter later (after it had been sent) but did not step  in to defuse the scandal and his relations with the president  had been tense ever since. The MP told 24 CHASA that advisers  to the president had been building structures parallel to key  units of the cabinet, which was one of the major reasons for the  meeting between the SDS and BSP leaders.    We had fears over suggestions to give the president greater  prerogatives than the ones outlined in the Constitution, Zhan  Videnov said in a radio interview. According to him, these  ideas originated with "intellectual, journalistic and social  circles close to the office of the president" rather than with  the office itself. "I must say we were informed in advance of  the press scandal over the prerogatives of the president's  military office which flared up today. We see it as an alarming  symptom and though indirectly, this subject was part of our  discussion," Zhan Videnov said about his meeting with SDS leader  Filip Dimitrov. In a statement quoted on National Radio Dr.  Zhelev commented, among other things, on the meeting between the  SDS and BSP leaders, describing it as "a result of the grave  crisis in both political forces, which arouses fear of the  democratic institutions." The president disapproved the idea of  a parliament-appointed caretaker government, as well as of the  idea that parliament should work in the run-up to the elections.    Edvin Sugarev described today's press allegations as "a huge  scandal... for which President Zhelev's resignation should be  demanded."    The president's spokesman Valentin Stoyanov made an official  statement on the press allegations late this afternoon.  [passage omitted]. The statement was broadcast on national  radio and television. In its main evening newscast television  said three Socialist MP's have made an official request today  for copies of the president's letter to the Defense Ministry and  of the decree.

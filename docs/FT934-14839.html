			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Turnround at First Chicago FIRST Chicago reported a record profit of Dollars 284m for the third quarter yesterday as the company rebounded strongly from the Dollars 372m loss incurred in the same period last year. The mid-western banking group, the 13th-largest in the US, fell deep into the red in 1992 after it took a Dollars 625m special provision to cover credit losses related to the disposal of problem property assets. With the bulk of the asset disposal programme over, First Chicago attributed its latest improvement to strong contributions from all its main business lines, particularly proprietary trading and venture capital. The bank reported earnings of Dollars 117m from its venture capital business, from virtually nothing in the same quarter a year ago. Earnings from the trading of primarily interest rate options, swaps and foreign exchange totalled Dollars 77m, the second best quarterly trading performance in the bank's history. Non-interest income was also boosted by continued growth in First Chicago's credit card business, where fee revenues rose to Dollars 186.7m, up from Dollars 138.6m a year ago, as total managed receivables grew by 23 per cent to Dollars 9.6bn. Net interest income was Dollars 341m in the quarter, up from Dollars 294m in the same period of 1992 as the bank's loan assets shrank 10 per cent to Dollars 21.6bn. The bank's shares rose Dollars  5/8 to close at Dollars 50 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.</p>

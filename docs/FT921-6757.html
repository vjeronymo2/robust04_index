			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Change in anti-trust policy seen THE US Justice Department is expected to institute a change in anti-trust enforcement policy to allow action against Japanese and other foreign cartels, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington. The US trade representative and State Department are wary about the policy, but Mr William Barr, US attorney-general, has said he expects to see the change accepted. The US has long claimed jurisdiction over anti-competitive activity outside the US. This must have a direct impact on US commerce and the parties have some US presence. Mr John Cregan, president of the Business and Industrial Council, said Japan's car and car parts industries operating in the US should be candidates for action.</p>

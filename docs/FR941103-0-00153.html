			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty species of waterfowl have been recorded using the islands and associated riverine habitats of the Ohio River. The majority of these waterfowl are migratory, using the river and island habitats as feeding and resting areas. More than 5,800 individual waterfowl were observed using the islands during the 165 island visits from February 1992 to September 1993. The take of migratory game birds will include waterfowl, coots, gallinules, rails, snipe, woodcock and mourning dove. Seasons on the refuge will coincide with the appropriate State seasons. The take of all other migratory birds will be prohibited. The migratory game bird hunting program will currently encompass 7 islands and 429 acres. Aside from woodcock hunting, all migratory game bird hunting will, in reality, occur only on the shoreline perimeter of the islands, which constitutes approximately 80 acres (15% of the current refuge acreage).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cottontail rabbits and fox squirrels are present on the Ohio River islands, with current numbers variable depending on specific islands and their habitats. Much of the island habitats have succeeded beyond the early to late oldfield habitats preferred by cottontail rabbits, and food available for fox squirrels is limited mostly to soft mast. However, it is felt that these species are present in huntable populations. The refuge season for these species will coincide with the appropriate State seasons. Method of take will be restricted to shotgun only for safety reasons. The take of all other upland game, including turkey, grouse, pheasant, and quail, will be prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> White-tailed deer are found in varying numbers on the Ohio River Islands. The size and habitat conditions on each island are different and deer utilization reflects this. Deer move freely from the mainland to the islands, depending on surrounding public use pressures, season, etc., tying island deer densities to surrounding deer populations. Deer hunting on the refuge will follow applicable State regulation. Method of take will be restricted to archery only for safety reasons and season lengths will correspond to State archery deer seasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A separate compatibility determination was made for the hunt program, and the program was found to be compatible. The hunt program must be monitored and adjusted as necessary to reduce or eliminate adverse impacts to the refuge resources and refuge operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Section 7 evaluation pursuant to the Endangered Species Act was conducted for the hunts. The listed species considered in this evaluation are pink mucket pearly mussel, fanshell mussel, bald eagle and peregrine falcon. The pink mucket pearly mussel and fanshell mussel occur on sand and gravel substrate found on the river bottom. Hunting on the island terrestrial habitats and from boats around the island perimeters will not impact these mussels or freshwater mussel habitat. Areas having concentrated eagle use will be zoned to prohibit hunting. The peregrine falcon is a rare visitor to the Ohio River Valley, and hunting activity is not expected to have any impact on this species. Accordingly, it was concluded that the hunts are not likely to adversely affect any Federally listed or proposed for listing threatened or endangered species or their critical habitats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An environmental assessment was developed pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) was made with respect to the hunts. During the planning stages of developing the hunt proposal, the refuge was in direct contact with a variety of government agencies, conservation organizations, landowners, and interested members of the public. Alternatives were developed that highlighted all concerns and the alternative for safe management of a hunting program was deemed appropriate. In December 1993, the refuge announced the availability of the environmental assessment to the general public. Public comment was solicited through news releases, radio interviews, writing to area conservation organizations, and contacting individuals who had expressed an interest in the hunting program. The conclusion of the environmental assessment stated that hunting pressure is expected to be low and wildlife disturbance should be minimal. Hunting conditions will be monitored, however, and appropriate actions taken if necessary to protect the biological resources of the refuge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to staff expenses, estimated at $4,616, the refuge will incur costs for signs, vehicle maintenance, leaflet printing, and miscellaneous supplies at an estimated annual cost of $1,500. These cost estimates bring the total cost for the hunt program to approximately $6,000. Therefore, it is determined that funds are available for the development, operation and maintenance of this hunt program pursuant to the Refuge Recreation Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements for part 32 are found in 50 CFR part 25 and have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1018&hyph;0014.

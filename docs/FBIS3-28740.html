Of these, the three largest radio stations were the  Voice of America, VOA, which, headquartered in Washington, was  under USIS, the U.S. Information Service; Radio "Free Europe"  which, headquartered in Munich in the Federal Republic of  Germany, was targeted at the East European countries; and Radio  "Freedom," which was targeted at the former Soviet Union.    When the Cold War was over, a number of people suggested  dissolving Radio "Free Europe" and Radio "Freedom" because the  main goal of these two stations had been achieved: communist  rule over European countries no longer existed. But U.S.  President Clinton holds a different view. He wants to maintain  Radio "Free Europe" and Radio "Freedom." He is also calling for  the setting up of Radio "Democratic Asia" [Chaau As Daan Chur],  arguing that, just like Europe, Asia is a continent with an  important role and a strategic position. In the current  situation, the role and strategic position of Asia are all the  more important. With a large population, Asia now has some 170  million English-speaking people. The United States must have a  sense of responsibility toward Asia, especially at a time when  there is a "new-type Cold War," that is, a peaceful evolution  strategy, the purpose of which is Asian domination. More  importantly, this strategy is also aimed at eradicating  communist nations, including Vietnam.    That is the reason for the coming into life of Radio  "Democratic Asia." This radio, headquartered in a borrowed  place in Asia, has constantly beamed distorting broadcasts  against socioeconomic reforms and social progress in various  Asian countries. It has also carried news about various  activities on the U.S. mainland and about the exemplary role  played by the United States overseas.    Looking back over the years, we will see that Washington has  been very keen on using radio to spread propaganda in Asia.  Since August 1986, Washington has used the airwaves of a radio,  which is also called Radio "Freedom" (located in Thailand and  operating with U.S. technological and financial assistance) to  regularly beam broadcasts in English, French, Vietnamese, and  Thai. From late 1992 to early 1993, Mrs. Helen D.Bentley, a  Republican member of the House of Representatives, put forth a  proposal calling for the establishment of Radio "Free Asia."  Then on 15 June 1993, President Clinton came up with a proposal  to set up Radio Democratic Asia and to organize an ad-hoc  committee with its members appointed by the president himself to  manage the operations of various radio stations such as the  Voice of America, VOA; Radio "Free Europe"; and Radio "Freedom."  More specifically, this new committee will replace the old Board  of International Broadcasting and will be responsible for  establishing Radio "Democratic Asia," whose broadcasts are to be  directed at those countries which, according to Clinton, lack  democracy, such as Vietnam, China, Myanmar [Burma], North Korea,  and so forth.    The U.S. Government has set aside $30 million from its  budget  for the running of Radio "Democratic Asia." When talking about  his proposal at the White House, Clinton stated: "The purposes  for the maintenance of Radio "Free Europe" and Radio "Freedom"  and for the establishment of Radio "Democratic Asia" are to help  consolidate democratic institutions in various areas, both in  Europe and Asia, where there is an absence of democracy. People  in undemocratic countries still need genuine information which  should be free from being doctored or distorted by the local  administration." (!)    President Clinton's new proposal has won strong support from  many congressmen, including Senators Russell Feingold and Joseph  R. Biden -- two very powerful figures at the U.S. Senate in this  matter.    On learning of the decision on the setting up of Radio  "Democratic Asia," a number of reactionary political  organizations among the exiled Vietnamese in foreign countries  appear to have been delighted. They regarded this as a  long-awaited victorious step in the "democratic construction  strategy" for Asia in general and for Vietnam in particular.    But "anything rational will remain, while anything  irrational  will go bust." They might have forget this age-old axiom. That  is why they have displayed their ecstacy too soon.</p>

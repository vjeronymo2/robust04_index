			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Commissions soar IF YOU bought a 25-year endowment policy from a tied agent last year, at premiums of Pounds 50 a month, the chances are that you will end up paying Pounds 570 in commission. A year previously, an exactly similar policy would probably have cost Pounds 534 in commission. This was one of the more startling conclusions from a survey of commissions published last week by Lautro, the life industry's regulator. It showed that commissions took a greater share of premiums last year, and that tied agents tended to get more than independent advisers. The old maximum commission agreement (MCA), which put caps on the commissions paid on different life products, ended in December 1989, although most companies still base their commissions on it. Competition for distribution outlets then forced the life offices to offer bigger initial commissions. These increases continued last year although renewal commissions have remained broadly unchanged, at around 2.5 per cent. But there are big variations in the levels of commission being paid. For example, using the same assumptions as above for a Pounds 50-a-month, 25-year endowment, tied agents might have been paid as little as Pounds 435.60 (10 per cent above the old ceiling), or as much as Pounds 641.52 (a thumping 62 per cent increase). Insurers have been less generous in their payments to independent advisers. Thus, if you had bought a similar policy from an IFA, it would on average have cost Pounds 498 in commission (up from Pounds 486 the previous year). Total variation is from Pounds 419.76 to Pounds 578.16. The difference between IFAs and tied agents is more marked on pensions. IFAs on average received 123 per cent of the MCA level for selling 10-year pensions last year - exactly the same as in 1990. On 25-year policies, there was a slight increase from 124 per cent to 126 per cent. But tied agents received on average 144 per cent of the old rate for 10-year policies (up from 131 per cent), and 140 per cent (up from 133 per cent) for 25-year pensions. The upward pressure on commissions is much higher for products which include an element of life assurance. Put Pounds 1,000 in a unit-linked single premium bond and you would probably pay Pounds 58 to an appointed agent and Pounds 52 to an IFA. The old maximum was Pounds 36. If you had put your Pounds 1,000 into a unit trust, you would probably have paid a tied agent an average of Pounds 32 (down from Pounds 33 the previous year), while IFAs would have received Pounds 31. Under the MCA, you would have paid Pounds 30.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEW LEAR  </P> <P> Does Norman Lear believe he can absolve his guilt for producing "All in the  Family," which was the beginning of the sleaze on TV, by his new show that  could be called "Look Who's Coming to Sunday Dinner"?  </P> <P> It isn't possible that bigoted (lovable?) Archie Bunker ever caused anyone to  look at their prejudices. It only excused their own hatreds.  </P> <P> Perhaps that also is the reason Carroll O'Connor is doing "In the Heat of the  Night" -- guilt. Why Jean Stapleton allowed her character to be subjected to  such ridicule is not understandable.  </P> <P> MARGARET G. ROLLINS  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bandung, KOMPAS -- Indonesia needs to embark on  numerous domestic economic restructuring in an effort to compete  with the other Asia-Pacific countries. The restructuring should  be carried out not only through the issuance of deregulation  packages but through the compatibility of the economic structure  aimed at upgrading its competitiveness and providing a resilient  national economy.    Speaking at the symposium on Reforms in the Asia-Pacific and  Indonesia's Study on the Asia-Pacific at the Merdeka building in  Bandung on 4 June, Finance Minister Mari'e Muhammed said, "We  should absorb what is good." The other speakers were the head  of the International Relations from CSIS, Drs. Bantarto Bandoro  MA [Master of Arts], Drs. Bob Sugeng Hadiwinata MA and an  economic observer, Dr. Shahrir.    According to Mari'e, all matters pertaining to the national  economy should be carried out with a view to fortifying  Indonesia's competitiveness at the international level. This  needs to be carried out because countries which are competitive  are becoming stronger than Indonesia, such as the PRC, Vietnam  and India -- all of them recently embarked on extensive  economic restructuring.    Mari'e said Indonesia should take full advantage of the  opportunities which the Asia-Pacific region has to offer,  particularly in trade activities, investments and exports. The  glamorous economic era of the Atlantic countries has begun to  decline and more countries are turning toward the Asia-Pacific  region.    Mari'e clarified that with the agreement reached at the  Uruguay Round at the end of 1993, major changes and trends had  occurred in the volume of international trade. This will bring  about far-reaching implications and complications in connection  with investments and international relations.    The Asia-Pacific region is a dynamic region and its  development is rapidly expanding. It has become the locomotive  for global economic development. Mari'e added that currently  the population of the Asia-Pacific region amounts to 40 percent  of the total world population. The region's Gross Domestic  Product, GDP, has reached 50 percent.    According to Mari'e, the economic growth of the Asia-Pacific  regional countries was recorded at an annual average of seven  percent over the five consecutive years. This is a performance  which had never been achieved by any region, including Europe.    Touching on APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation], the  finance minister said the grouping discussed the substance in  greater depth. APEC would direct itself toward transforming the  Asia-Pacific region into a region free from obstacles, paving  the way for international trade and investment capital flows.    Mari'e said the 17-member APEC forum was established in 1989  by the former Australian prime minister Bob Hawke. He said,  "Even though the United States is currently experiencing an  economic setback, APEC's development depends on the American  interest."    Meanwhile, Bob Sugeng Hadiwinata called for lesser  dependency  on on any cooperation forum which only makes rhetoric calls, and  Indonesia should learn a lesson from the U.S.-Japan conflict and  the collapse of the G-15 summit in New Delhi.    Bob Sugeng also clarified that, in facing the problem of  conflicting interests within APEC members, Indonesia is becoming  more dependent on the global market. As such, it would be better  for Indonesia to externalize its national economy by eliminating  any sentimental or emotional rhetoric.    Indonesia should avoid being too involved in any cooperation  group which practises emotional solidarity. It should take a  pragmatic approach by increasing its bargaining power at  international forums. Probably, Indonesia should embark upon  such a pragmatic approach in cooperation forums such as the APEC.    Another economic observer, Shahrir, considered that by the  year 2005, there would be a new world with free trade in which  the Asia-Pacific region would be the nucleus for global trade.  This depends on the APEC members capability of providing  employment for their populace while maintaining a high economic  growth rate.</p>

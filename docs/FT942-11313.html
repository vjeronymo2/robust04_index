			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Historic Labour victory in Croydon Labour campaigners in Croydon were ecstatic last night after the party took control of the council from the Conservatives for the first time in the borough's 120-year history. In one of the most devastating results for the Tories in the local elections, Labour won six marginal wards in the south London borough and looks set to have a 10-seat majority on the council. Shortly after midnight Sir Peter Bowness, who has led Croydon council for the past 18 years, acknowledged defeat. 'Our vote did not collapse,' he said, but he added: 'It's a bad result for the Conservative party and does give a sense of loss and foreboding.' Ms Mary Walker, a former union official who is set to become council leader, said it was a historic achievement for the Labour party and a referendum on Mr John Major's government. 'I just didn't think we would do this well,' she said, against a background of cheering crowds. 'Stealing Croydon from the Tories confirms Labour's supremacy in the leafy boroughs of south London.' Labour campaigners said last night that their victory had all the hallmarks of a remarkable blow for the government. The borough, with a population of 350,000, is the largest in London. Sir Peter's administration has remained popular throughout the campaign, underlining that Mr Major's difficulties had played a large part in the Tory defeat. In the early part of the evening Labour had been cautious of its prospects. But at 12.20am a succession of Labour candidates walked on to the platform at Croydon's Fairfield Hall waving their fists in jubilation. 'I simply can't believe it,' said an exhausted Mr Jeff Dixon, who has masterminded Labour's campaign. 'We have won every target we went for.' However, Ms Walker, who will now take charge of a Pounds 235m annual budget, seemed to take victory in her stride. 'I'm not particularly daunted about the job,' she said, running through a series of meetings that she has already planned to hold this weekend.</p>

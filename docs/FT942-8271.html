			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Clinton seeks to dismiss sex charge President Bill Clinton's lawyers are expected to file a motion in court soon asking for the dismissal of sexual harassment charges laid against him earlier this month by a former Arkansas state employee. Mr Robert Bennett, who is acting as Mr Clinton's lawyer in the case, is expected to argue for the suit to be dismissed because of a broad presidential immunity to civil charges. Ms Paula Jones charged in her suit that Mr Clinton pressed her for sex in a hotel room three years ago, when he was still governor of Arkansas. The Justice Department's office of legal counsel has been researching the institutional implications of the case for the executive branch and the presidency in general, but officials said yesterday that the department had not yet 'formulated a decision or an opinion'. Officials added that no one was yet working on a brief, but that it was likely that the judge in the case would ask for the department's views on whether the president can be sued. In a case brought in 1982 against President Richard Nixon, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5-4 margin that the president had absolute immunity from personal liability for his actions while in office. Although the suit did not address actions undertaken before becoming president, the Court's reasoning, in an opinion written by Justice Lewis Powell, would appear still to apply in such cases. Justice Powell argued 'because of the singular importance of the President's duties, diversion of his energies by private lawsuits would raise unique risks to effective functioning of government.'</p>

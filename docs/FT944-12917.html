			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Read the menu in cyber space If your souffle will not rise, someone in cyberspace can help. The Internet, the global computer network, lets you link up with people of the same interests, via mailing lists or news groups. You send a message to sign up and receive the news and opinions of other members of the group. 'Foodwine' is one of the two main lists for gourmets. 'The purpose is for serious, but not pedantic, discussion of food, beverages and related concerns,' say Elliott Parker and Musa Knickerbocker who run the list from Central Michigan University. 'Consider the list as a discussion around a very large table among people who like to discuss food: the talk may become passionate and even off-topic sometimes, but always returns to the topic.'

Rachel Karan in Alaska was having problems with her chicken soup which was too salty. Suggestions poured in: add canned broth, giblets and so on. Lars Larsen from Sonderberg, Denmark offered 2,000 words on chutney recipes and then 7,000 on cranberry dishes. In cyberspace you never really know whether the advice is from an expert or a well-meaning neophyte. So on 'rec. food. restaurants' a posting of 'I'm off to Greedy Gulch next week. Where can I get some decent food?' will elicit replies from opinionated locals with whom you cannot remonstrate if their recommendation turns out to be a greasy spoon. The list tends to be US-dominated. Asked to recommend somewhere in Soho, London, Glen Poorman from Michigan suggested Wong Kei, a Chinese restaurant better known for shovelling customers in and out quickly than for its chow mein. 'Packed house, incredibly rude waiters and low prices,' enthused Glen, 'but awesome food]'</p>

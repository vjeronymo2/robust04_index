			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Joint news conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa </F> and Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei Kono with  unidentified correspondents at the Diet building -- live]    [Text] [Correspondent] [first sentence indistinct] Prime  Minister Hosokawa, can you tell us how the coalition parties --  particularly, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] --  will respond to this agreement? [sentence indistinct] Party  President Kono, how do you think the group of political reform  moderates within your party will react to it? Do you think you  can persuade them to accept it?    [Hosokawa] I will answer first. I think there are strong  voices calling on people, not only in the SDPJ but in all other  groups, to restrain their own views and accommodate other views  as much as possible. I am fully aware of that. Meanwhile, Mr.  Murayama, chairman of the SDPJ, has kept me well informed of the  views of the people in his party. I had to ask him to entrust  me with the power to make a final decision, and he said that was  unacceptable. However, he eventually agreed to give me the  power to make a final decision to resolve the issues -- on my  own judgment.    For me it was a very difficult decision to make.  Nevertheless, corporate donations to political funds will be  abolished after five years. At least the system will be better  than the current one in that it will be more transparent. The  agreement clearly states that the donations will abolished in  five years. As such, it represents progress compared to the  existing system. I agree with you that it has gone backward,  somewhat, from the original draft bills, but I would like  everyone's understanding on that point.    [Kono] All the Diet members of my party share the need to  implement political reform. But as far as the question of how  it should be done, there have been various views, and  consequently there have been many discussions. But with the  current special session of the Diet coming to an end, there were  also feelings that we must conclude the matter somehow so that  we can go on to tackle so many other pending important matters.  Though I was also fully aware, on the other hand, of the views  of those who think we should be more cautious about political  reform. I came to this meeting, which began yesterday evening,  bearing all this in mind.    To answer your question, I must say I think the prime  minister underwent much torment -- or hardships -- in making his  decision.    I once again pointed out to him the points my party has so  long insisted on, and asked him to understand them. After all,  agreement would have been impossible unless both sides were  willing to make some concessions. I know the views of my  party's people because I have talked to so many of them. I am  confident the people in my party will accept the agreement.    [Correspondent] Mr. Kono, the meeting of the top leaders was  held under the mediation of House of Representatives Speaker  Doi. What conditions were presented to you in agreeing the  meeting? [sentence indistinct]    [Kono] House of Representatives Speaker Doi told me she was  worried about the state of the Diet -- about whether the Diet,  now coming to an end of its session, was meeting expectations of  the people. The two of us were called in separately. Speaker  Doi noted that the matter needed to be resolved, and presented  several alternatives, proposing that we reach agreement along  the lines of one of these proposals. It seems Prime Minister  Hosokawa received some proposals from Speaker Doi as well.  After we had received the speaker's suggestions we decided to  meet and discuss them.    I think the prime minister should speak as he, too, met the  speaker.    [Hosokawa] I don't know which of us was called in first, and  I did not ask about it. But we were separately called into the  speaker's office and given the proposals as I explained earlier.  One was on the matter of when the bills should become effective,  another was a suggestion to set up a negotiating body to deal  with the contents of the bills. Her proposal was on these two  points. It was valuable advice which came at a time when things  were becoming very urgent. At the time I expressed the hope  that, given the situation, she would impress on Mr. Kono the  desirability of holding a meeting of top leaders. The meeting  subsequently took place. At the meeting, much time was devoted  to discussing the question of setting up a negotiating body, as  proposed by the speaker.    But our discussions were unable to make headway on this, and  it turned out that we could accept -- or make good use of --  only the proposal concerning the date the bills become  effective. As far as the contents of the agreement were  concerned, however, both sides were able to narrow their views  in the course of discussions. I reported this to the speaker.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] ...please let me ask a  question of both Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. President. [Words  indistinct] ...could you describe how your latest decision will  affect the future of the ties among coalition parties as well as  coalition-opposition relations?    [Hosokawa] That is a difficult question. To be honest with  you, I cannot make a prediction.    [Kono] I think that is a very good question. I cannot yet  make a prediction on how effective the political reform bills  will be. But as the prime minister said earlier, there are a  mountain of difficult issues pending, such as the Japan-U.S.  economic talks and the economic stimulus measures, which have a  bearing on the lives of the people, and which are still waiting  to be resolved. I think, when it comes to defending the quality  of life of the people, it will be possible for the LDP to make  proposals to the prime minister. We have long experience in  running government and, as such, have the capability.    [Hosokawa] I spoke of it a little earlier, but when you  realize the seriousness of the situation facing the nation now,  it is necessary to call a truce in the political war and tackle  the economic and other pending issues. As for your question  about the future of the coalition government, I agree it is a  good question. But, as I said earlier, it is very difficult to  make a prediction at this stage.    [Correspondent] Mr. Kono, please let me reconfirm some  points from my previous question. How does your agreement  define the date the bills take effect?    [Kono] That is on the paper.    [Correspondent] Do you mean the bills are frozen for the  time being?    [Kono] Please refer to the last two lines of the preface.    [Correspondent] I suppose revision of the bills will be  discussed during the next ordinary Diet session. How soon,  then, before the Diet is ready for that session?    [Kono] That is on the paper. Please read what the paper  says. The paper says the revision of the bills should be  discussed before deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget.  Please read it carefully.    [Correspondent] My question is for Mr. Prime Minister.  Compared to the bills provided by the government, the final  agreement is very different from the original plan. I thought  the government worked out the original proposal to pursue its  ideals and philosophy. Did you forget about your ideals and  philosophy when you accepted the drastic revision?    [Hosokawa] There may be criticism of my decision. However,  as I repeatedly noted earlier, the enactment of political reform  bills has been the biggest pending issue of the last six years.  Taking into account how the issue affects our economic and  foreign policies, I had to change the basic framework of  politics taking into account wide-ranging viewpoints. I made my  final decision from such viewpoints.</p>

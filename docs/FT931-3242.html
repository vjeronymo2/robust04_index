			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: OSE anticipates Y240m loss for year THE Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) expects to report a Y240m (Dollars 2m) loss for the year ending March, after a Y1m profit a year earlier, Reuter reports from Osaka. It will be the exchange's first loss in 10 years. The OSE blamed slow stock futures trading following restrictions and the overall decline in stock markets. Members' fees, including commissions to the OSE, is expected to fall to Y3.2bn in the six months ending March, from Y4.6bn in the first half of the year. Revenue from members' fees for the coming year is projected to decline 18.7 per cent to Y6.35bn. The exchange is also having to face the cost of developing a new trade-weighted average stock futures contract, scheduled to replace the average Nikkei 225 next year. The development cost for the first year is Y1.33bn in the budget for the next year, which begins on April 1, the OSE said.</p>

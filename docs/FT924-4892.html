			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Costs and benefits of the currency conundrum: FT writers examine the impact of European exchange rate upheavals on the competitive position of the continent's exporters Industrialists throughout Europe are still recovering their breath after an autumn of European currency upheaval. With the effects on competitiveness varying according to whether they sell from a hard or soft-currency country, exporters around the continent have different stories to tell. Following three realignments in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), combined with the floating of the Swedish krona and Finnish markka, there is unease that more devaluations may be on the way. And one overriding worry is that competitive devaluation could exacerbate the problems faced by Germany, Europe's strongest economy - adding to recessionary pressures around the continent. Countries where currencies have appreciated are feeling the pinch. The D-Mark and the French franc have risen sharply against leading European currencies since sterling and the lira left the ERM on September 16. The trend continued after the fresh ERM realignment on November 22, in which the peseta and escudo were devalued by 5 per cent. The disadvantages caused by foreign devaluations for exporters in Germany and France have been partly offset by the rise of the dollar since September - which has cheapened European exports compared with those priced in dollars. But, since intra-European trade far outweighs European countries' exports to the dollar zone, it is the ERM shifts which have had the larger consequences for competitiveness. Commenting on the September devaluation, Mr Robert Hudry, finance director of Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel group, complains: 'In the space of one week, we lost four years' effort in improving our productivity. It's a heavy handicap.' Since France's labour costs are now rising much more slowly than Germany's, the Paris government reckons competitive problems are tolerable. Mr Bruno Durieux, the junior trade minister, estimates that the weakness of sterling, the lira and the peseta will set back the French trade balance by FFr5bn (Pounds 610m) in a full year, compared with the forecast trade surplus of FFr25bn this year. However, The Patronat, the French employers' association, expects French exporters to lose market share in cars, steel and telecommunications unless companies cut margins. Patronat officials say their real worry is whether the ERM will hold together if strains revive. Mr Noel Goutard, chairman of Valeo, the car components maker, says: 'My worst nightmare is that the Bundesbank will not cut interest rates by the end of the year and that France will approach its legislative election next March facing 3m unemployed in a political panic. The political right will then be tempted to devalue, perhaps by 10-15 per cent, when the government could have got away with only a 3-4 per cent devaluation a few weeks ago.' The country showing most pessimism about the currency changes is Germany. Labour costs are rising faster than in many competitor countries, and the economy slowed sharply in the third quarter this year. Companies' worries that they may be pricing themselves out of export markets have cast a fresh pall over economic prospects. Mr Manfred Schneider, chief executive of Bayer, the chemicals group, says D-Mark appreciation has damaged the competitiveness of the entire, export-oriented chemicals sector - and warns that profits this year will fall sharply. Similar warnings have been broadcast by a range of other top companies, including Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen, Metallgesellschaft and Mannesmann. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), during the past three years Germany has been losing export markets for manufactured goods faster than any other industrialised country. Taking into account the September ERM changes, the OECD estimates Germany's share of manufactured goods markets will fall 4.8 per cent this year and 1.5 per cent in 1993, after a drop of 6 per cent in 1991. In the countries in which currencies have devalued, industrialists have welcomed the fillip to exports. Mr Robin Mowday, commercial director of Bridgeport, the export-dependent UK machine tool-maker, says sales to the US and western Europe have improved. 'We are looking to export our way out of trouble, so September 16 was a big help.' Mr Richard Freeman, corporate chief economist at ICI, the UK chemicals group, says sterling's fall will give a 'very big impact' to exports. But exporters from weak currency countries also fear that gains could be eroded by higher import prices. Mr Filip Marazzi, chairman of Ceramica Marazzi, one of Italy's biggest tile groups, says: 'We pay for a lot of raw materials in dollars, D-Marks or schillings. The expected rise in production costs will eliminate the benefit of devaluation.' In Spain, industrialists say the peseta's double devaluation has brought the previously overvalued exchange rate back to reality. But Mr Claudio Aranzadi, Spain's industry minister, last week said Spain would only stay within its new ERM limits if workers agreed lower wage rises. In Sweden, the forestry industry - competing above all with North American and Finnish producers - will be the single largest beneficiary of the abandonment of the krona's links with the Ecu. MoDo, one of Sweden's three leading forest companies, estimates its annual turnover will increase by more than SKr200m as a result of the appreciation of foreign currencies. Both Volvo and Saab Automobile, with large export markets in the UK and US, are obvious beneficiaries. But many industry executives believe Sweden may repeat the mistakes of the 1982 devaluation, when rising wage costs and inflation eventually eroded competitive benefits. Economists believe the changes will do little to reverse the long-term trend of declining European competitiveness vis-a-vis the rest of the world. EC countries' share of world export markets for manufactured goods has fallen by a cumulative 6.3 per cent during 1990-92, according to OECD estimates. The EC's trade deficit with the rest of the world rose to Dollars 71bn last year from only Dollars 11bn in 1988. The shortfall was Dollars 40bn in the first eight months of this year, in spite of faltering EC growth, which would normally be expected to reduce imports. A further round of devaluations during the run-up to next spring's French elections could divert attention from the search for solutions to the decline in the international performance of European industry. Mr Douglas McWilliams, economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, says: 'European labour is the highest paid in the world. We work the shortest hours and have the longest holidays. You have to be very productive to get over that.'</p>

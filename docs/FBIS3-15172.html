But no. Passions not inferior to the most  somber "witch hunt" models have flared up in Washington -- from  the White House and the Department of State to the CIA  headquarters. What has been the cause of such hysteria?    On 22 February Vladimir Chkhikvishvili, Russian charge  d'affaires ad interim in the United States, was invited to the  State Department, where he was told of the arrest of Aldrich  Hazen Ames, a high-ranking CIA staffer, and his wife Maria Ames  on a charge of working for Soviet and then also Russian  intelligence. In this connection a protest was made to the  diplomat. The next day Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador in  Moscow, made a similar demarche when he met with Sergey Lavrov,  Russian Federation deputy minister of foreign affairs.    Not that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was inclined to  dramatize the situation. In particular, Grigoriy Karasin,  director of the Information and Press Department, believes that,  according to the information on the "Ames case" provided by the  State Department, Moscow has questions which it would be most  convenient to clear up by means of direct contacts between the  special services. But Washington's reasoning was different:  The next day Aleksandr Lysenko, the official representative of  the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] at the  Russian Embassy in the United States, was declared persona non  grata and ordered to leave U.S. territory within a week.  According to the information received at the Foreign Ministry,  Aleksandr Lysenko could not have had contacts with the Ames: He  arrived in the United States only last summer, and the  investigation into their case has already been going on for more  than 10 months. Lysenko has been named merely because some time  ago the Russian and U.S. special services each agreed to  disclose one of their own representatives working under cover of  a diplomatic passport. This was done to coordinate actions in  the struggle against international terrorism and the drug  business.    On talking recently with Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the  Duma  International Affairs Committee and in the recent past the  Russian Federation's ambassador to the United States, I asked a  question also about the prospects of the "Ames case." "Foreign  intelligence is commonplace in international practice," Vladimir  Petrovich explained. "Today they have disclosed a spy in the  United States, tomorrow they will find one in Russia, but I  believe that our president will not make a tragedy out of this.  Moreover, the guilt of the Ames has not yet been proved, and  for this there must be a trial."    The prognosis was confirmed. A week after the State  Department's protest Russia made a counterstrike, so to speak,  "on a mutual basis." On Monday the Russian Federation Foreign  Ministry made a representation to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in  connection with the expulsion of the FIS official representative  from Washington. "In this situation," the Foreign Ministry note  states, "we are forced on the basis of reciprocity to declare  the CIA's representative in Moscow persona non grata and to  demand his departure from the Russian Federation." According to  information received from the Foreign Ministry, Embassy  Counsellor James L. Morris must leave within seven days.    Our attempt to secure a comment from the Lubyanka was not  successful. FIS Director Yevgeniy Primakov gave a brief reply  to an analogous request from an ITAR-TASS correspondent: "No  comment." To all appearances, CIA Director Woolsey is also  behaving with delicacy -- which obviously attests to a  reluctance to fuel passions. Particularly as last year, so  Germany's DIE WELT reported recently, 20 people were arrested in  Russia for spying for Western countries. Unlike the United  States, however, Moscow did not try to blow up any scandal, the  newspaper emphasizes.    What is more, recent data published by FIS experts indicate  that the claims by Neil Gerardo, president of the U.S. Gerardo  International Corporation, that Aldrich Ames could have passed  to Moscow production secrets of the company's new invention --  the so-called MRX defense technology -- were an overt  fabrication. Information about Ames' involvement in the drugs  trade is also no more than disinformation.    Against the background of these facts there can be just one  conclusion: There are influential forces in the United States  which would like, if not to return Russian-U.S. relations to the  "Cold War" epoch, then at least to cast a shadow of mutual  mistrust over our leaders and to halt the movement which has  begun toward a Russian-U.S. partnership.</p>

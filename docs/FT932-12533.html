			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Councils to change COUNTY councillors elected on May 6 will find the councils they run changing rapidly with the growth in compulsory competitive tendering, John Willman writes. Since 1988, services such as grounds maintenance and catering services have been subject to tendering. By the time of the next elections, white-collar services in information technology, finance, personnel, construction and corporate services will also have been put out to tender. The majority of contracts have been won by council workforces. But contracting-out forces councils to put operations on a more businesslike footing and make a 5 per cent rate of return on capital. Labour remains opposed to tendering in principle, although it appears to be relaxing its opposition following last year's election defeat. Labour councils have found the threat of contracting-out helpful in persuading employees to increase the effic-iency and quality of services. Some councils, including Berkshire, have decided to go further than required in contracting out all but core activities. None has yet reached the state envisioned by the late Lord Ridley who foresaw local authorities meeting once a year to hand out contracts for the whole range of council services. But the 'enabling council', which sees its role as buying services and ensuring high standards, is here to stay.</p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Dedicated setter of industrial fashion: Michael Cassell meets a man with a mission to rebuild the manufacturing base DAVID TURNBULL claims that he was a lonely voice in demanding a national industrial strategy to rebuild the UK's manufacturing base. Now he has to struggle to be heard above the clamour. 'All of a sudden, the message is fashionable. The Confederation of British Industry, the Engineering Employers' Confederation, the Department of Trade and Industry and assorted ministers - they're all agreed. 'But have you noticed, despite all the lip service, how little is actually being done about it? They are playing with words. We cannot afford to sit back and wait. We must embarrass the government into acting,' he says. Mr Turnbull is an accountant with his own practice in Aldershot, Hampshire and runs two professional accountancy bodies, between them representing more than 200 firms. Although he readily admits he 'couldn't make anything to save my life', he is also director-general of the UK Industrial Group, set up a year ago to restore the reputation and economic contribution of the manufacturing sector. More than 70 companies - with a combined annual turnover of Pounds 1.5bn - have joined the group, which is demanding an end to the decline in the nation's manufacturing base and the creation of a sustained balance of trade surplus. The Body Shop is the most notable recruit so far. But while frustration at the lack of political urgency may be understandable, is the formation of yet another lobby group, versed in the art of special pleading, really going to help? The DTI, whose refocused efforts to help industry are given only a partial endorsement by Mr Turnbull, wants fewer interest groups to deal with, not more. Mr Turnbull says: 'Organisations like the CBI are only interested in protecting cosy relationships with government. You can be terribly subtle and get nowhere or you can confront people with the cold, harsh facts and demand radical policy changes.' Many of the group's core proposals, contained in its recently released 'Manufacture or Die' policy statement, reek of interventionism and the type of corporatist language which is anathema to the government and the leaders of big business. Some may prove too heady for the architects of Labour's more 'hands-on' approach to industry. Few people now dare talk of 'picking winners', promoting 'national champions' or, like Mr Turnbull, of rebuilding a revamped Industrial Reorganisation Corporation. But Mr Turnbull is untroubled. He claims he is not interested in playing politics and just wants to see in place a strategy with the fixed objective of raising UK industrial output by Pounds 40bn a year. 'Our approach will take root and win support because the problem is acute and it is daily becoming clear that there is no alternative.' At the heart of the group's manifesto lies a plan to establish a national investment fund, manned by industrialists and financiers and given an initial five-year injection of Pounds 10bn a year. The Treasury - 'subordinated to serving the interests of the DTI' - would be excluded, although the industry department would get a seat at the table. The money, he says, would either come from government alone or from the City and industry as well. With an eye on boosting exports and import substitution, funds would be directed at developing best practice and world-beating products. 'We are drawing up a shopping list to identify the products no longer made in the UK and those for which there is strong demand but insufficient UK capacity. The list would lead to specific new manufacturing initiatives to meet domestic and overseas demand.' The group is now planning its own investment fund to test the water. People will buy industrial investment bonds, along the lines floated by Labour in its most recent industry policy document. There is, says Mr Turnbull, a 'genuine and growing willingness' among industrialists to get a fund under way. 'A new approach to funding is desperately needed. Just look at our national record or under-investment and short-termism. No-one can claim the old system has worked. Critics might sneer but governments in other countries get fully behind their productive resources instead of making encouraging noises from the sidelines,' Mr Turnbull says. The UK Industrial Group has other ideas unlikely to find widespread favour. Alarmed at the acquisition of UK productive capacity by overseas investors, it wants a 49 per cent ceiling placed on any foreign stake in listed British companies. New inward investment is welcomed, however. He stresses: 'We must not lose control of the destiny of indigenous companies and of associated technological development. There is no way a company like British Aerospace should be able to sell a business like Rover into foreign hands.' The group favours government-imposed dividend re-straint, limiting payments to an unspecified percentage of current-year profits and making illegal payments in excess of profits or following losses. Manufacturing, engineering and processing companies would, however, be earmarked for beneficial fiscal treatment at Budget time. The corollary would be higher taxes for 'unproductive' investments such as commercial property. Mr Turnbull also has his eye on the national lottery. 'The surplus should, in its entirety, go towards funding new manufacturing enterprises or expanding and developing existing ones. To spend it on the arts or sport demonstrates totally wrong priorities.' The group will soon start a programme to promote its agenda to local business organisations. Mr Turnbull believes the extent of the crisis facing manufacturing will secure extensive support for the views of his organisation. He adds: 'If our policies are adopted, we could expect to see a significant and sustained turnround in Britain's balance of trade within four years. 'It is no good politicians relying on another economic recovery to mask our structural problems. If they fail to tackle them, we will all pay a very heavy price.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Letter From Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Hoping the </F> `Tang-Chiao Talks' Will Be Fruitful"]    [Text] Brother:    This year's spring festival will arrive soon. On this  traditional festival of the Chinese nation for reunion, Chiao  Jen-ho, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] vice chairman  and concurrently its secretary-general, and his entourage have  arrived in Beijing; their arrival has added a propitious  atmosphere for national reunion in the capital.    The current meeting is the first between high-ranking  responsible persons of the nongovernment organizations  separately authorized by Taiwan and the mainland since Chiao  Jen-ho was transferred from being Taiwan "Mainland Affairs  Council deputy director" to the office of SEF vice chairman and  concurrently its secretary-general, and since the Wang-Koo talks  held in Singapore in late April last year. Some ups and downs  took place before the current meeting, which is finally to be  held, which is most comforting.    According to the "Accord on Institutions of Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS]-SEF Contacts and  Talks" reached during the Wang-Koo talks, "the ARATS acting vice  chairman and SEF deputy vice chairman, or the two organizations'  secretaries-general will conduct talks on routine affairs every  six months in principle, on each shore on a rotating basis, or  in a negotiated third place." To implement this accord, the  mainland has exerted unremitting efforts. With the reshuffling  of SEF high-ranking personnel, ARATS acting vice chairman Tang  Shubei and its secretary-general Zou Zhekai sent a  congratulatory cable to Chiao Jen-ho, who had just taken up the  office of SEF vice chairman and concurrently its  secretary-general, and invited him to visit Beijing to negotiate  routine affairs of the two organizations.    In early December last year, when Chiao Jen-ho first took  office as SEF vice chairman and concurrently its  secretary-general, he stated that "the tenure of  secretary-general is three years, and I hope that some  achievements will be scored." According to the spirit of the  accord of the Wang-Koo talks on regular reciprocal visits  between the two organizations, Chiao Jen-ho decided to set  Taipei as the place for the third ARATS-SEF work negotiations;  at the same time, he twice invited ARATS Acting Vice Chairman  Tang Shubei to visit Taiwan. Although no accord was reached  during the Taipei ARATS-SEF talks, results of a certain stage  were scored, and laid a foundation for work negotiations from  now on. Regrettably, a precondition of Chiao Jen-ho's  invitation to Tang Shubei to visit Taiwan was that an accord  should be reached in the Taipei talks; consequently, the purpose  of the trip was not fulfilled. Even so, when Chiao Jen-ho  expressed the hope that he would visit Beijing to meet ARATS  Acting Vice Chairman Tang Shubei when the Taipei talks had just  concluded, the mainland side expressed its consent, taking into  consideration the overall situation of cross-strait relations.    Just when the ARATS and the SEF had officially settled that  the "Tang-Chiao talks" were to be held in Beijing in late  January, the Taiwan "Mainland Affairs Council" raised unexpected  trouble, saying that the signing of a joint communique by China  and France in which France pledged that it would no longer sell  weapons to Taiwan, and China's restoring diplomatic relations  with Lesotho were "various unfriendly actions" by the mainland  toward Taiwan," and stated that it would "reassess" the  "Tang-Chiao talks." For a while, there was an uproar in Taiwan  public opinion. Under pressure from the people, the Taiwan  "Mainland Affairs Council" made another decision to authorize  Chiao Yen-ho to go to Beijing to talk with Tang Shubei, and thus  the storm was pacified.    The ups and downs of the "Tang-Chiao talks" gave people much  food for thought. To my mind, mutual trust is today still not  on the horizon in cross-strait relations; and one of the  important causes is that there have been insufficient ties  between them, especially comparatively high-ranking exchanges.  In the "Accord on Institutions for ARATS-SEF Contacts and  Talks," meetings of ARATS and SEF responsible persons of various  levels are stipulated. However, it is not very easy to implement  the accord, which more often than not is subjected to  interference from artificial factors.    At the press conference held at the conclusion of the third  session of the first council of the association for cross-strait  relations last 13 January, a reporter asked ARATS Chairman Wang  Daohan what his deepest experience had been during his two years  in office as ARATS chairman. He answered: Taiwan and the  mainland should augment ties and exchanges; constant contacts  and ties between high-ranking responsible persons would be  helpful to removing misunderstanding while deepening  understanding, expanding common understanding, and pushing  forward the sound mutual development of cross-strait relations.  Wang Daohan's experience reflected the universal aspirations of  people on the two shores as well as his expectations on  augmenting the contacts and ties between the ARATS and the SEF,  these two authorized nongovernment organizations.    At present, the regular, institutionalized ARATS-SEF ties  and  contacts are just a beginning. A good beginning means something  is half done. It is expected that during the new year, the  cooperation between the ARATS and the SEF, these two authorized  nongovernment organizations, will take on a new atmosphere, with  still greater progress in the comprehensive implementation of  the accord of the Wang-Koo talks, especially in augmenting  cross-strait economic exchanges and economic and trade  cooperation. We sincerely hope that the "Tang-Chiao talks," the  first round of talks between responsible persons since the  Wang-Koo talks, will score positive results.    Best regards,    [Signed] Bao Xin    [Dated] 25 January</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tagir Agliullin: "What Is Going On Behind the </F> Walls of the Kazan Kremlin?"]    [Text] Kazan--It has already become customary for political  scientists to put the leadership of two republics--Chechnya and  Tatarstan--on the same footing. Both the recent Russian  elections and the referendum conducted on 12 December throughout  the Russian Federation, with the exception of these two  republics, once again clearly demonstrated the reality of this  generalization.    But a different, no less "sweetheart couple" has emerged in  Tatarstan itself--a firm bloc of the ruling nomenklatura and  "opposition" nationalists has arisen. The former oblast party  committee apparatchiks have found for themselves in the national  radicals new and, as it seems to them, firm social support. And  the nationals are making adroit use of the forces and  connections of the nomenklatura and the Communist Party of  Tatarstan, hoping subsequently "to strangle them in their  embrace" or to paint their red foundation green--the color of  Islam--and the colors of Tatar nationalism. This "red-green"  national-nomenklatura bloc took shape at the time of the  discussion and adoption of the separatist constitution and the  discriminatory Language Act. On 12 December this alliance  strengthened even more and became an "indestructible bloc of  party and nonparty people."    Despite the fact that less than 24 percent of the electorate  voted at the elections in the republic, certain conclusions may  be drawn from their results. Official, but unlawful, calls for a  boycott of the Russian ballot, the corresponding "set of  instructions" to bureaucrats on the part of the authorities, the  daily campaign in the Tatarstan newspapers and on radio and  television, the refusal to send out notices and an explanation  of the procedure of the ballot--this is a far from full list of  its particular features. I would add here the silent transfer of  the locations of many polling stations, at not one of which were  there even Russian flags, moreover, and the unchecked tallying  of the results by working groups. They were formed for some  reason or other under the auspices of the administration heads  for the collection of information from the stations and their  presentation to the district election commissions.    The threats of extremists and their blockade of a number of  stations in Menzelinsk, Bugulm, and Kazan went unpunished. All  this reduced the percentage turnout, but, what is most  important, did not strengthen but, however paradoxical it may  seem, weakened the sovereignty of the republic. After all, the  fervent supporters of Zhirinovskiy voted for him, all the same.  And hundreds of thousands of his opponents did not go to the  polls. So those who are expatiating only on the fault of the  democrats for the success of the latter are greatly deluded.  Having stymied the elections, the ruling circles of Tatarstan  may with every right consider themselves the cofounders of the  LDPR parliamentary faction. They contributed to the revival of  the extreme polarization of Russia, from which the components of  the Federation gain nothing.    The inhabitants of the Kazan Kremlin are once again hoping,  possibly, to make capital out of the showdowns between the  authorities in Moscow, as they did in 1990-1991 and in  1992-1993. But this is short-sighted: Zhirinovskiy has a more  radical program, and under pressure thereof Yeltsin would be  forced to adopt decisive measures to restore the single legal  space of the Federation. As can be seen from poll results, it  was this for which, in fact, many Russians, Russian-speaking  Tatars, and Jews were hoping in voting for the LDPR.    One further outcome of the elections was the clear defeat  for  the "Tatarstan Party," the people of this republic, and its  leaders. After all, all seven seats for Tatarstan in the Federal  Assembly remain vacant, and there will be no one to pursue and  defend the interests of its population in the Russian  Parliament. This is obvious. In the last three years the ruling  elite has thwarted practically all Russian elections and  referenda. But you cannot step on one and the same anti-Russian  rake ad infinitum. On this occasion its error is of an  unforgivable nature, the leaders of the local Equality and  Legality bloc believe. Everyone knows that it is Russian money  that is used to pay the pensions, grants, and allowances, and  also wages and credit in the military-industrial complex and  subsidies.    Less obvious is the new fissure in interethnic relations  that  has formed since the elections. However much the power-invested  persons assert that the 12 December elections showed the  people's political wisdom and their maturity, term "civicism"  the action of many Russians, Tatars, Chuvash, and Ukrainians who  did not discharge their civic duty, and give assurances  concerning a "strengthening of interethnic unity," in practice  everything is just the opposite. The true act of civic courage  was performed by those who went to the polls in defiance of the  plain instructions of the administration heads. The same applies  to the "strengthening" of national unity.    The proposition concerning the "strengthening of interethnic  unity" also may be evaluated with the same reverse precision.  Let us take the ballot data for the mixed 24th Moskovskiy  District. It has urban and rural, Russian and Tatar rayons. In a  group of four small rural Tatar rayons, only 0.6 percent of the  electorate voted, while 8.2 percent of inhabitants went to the  polls in the four large multinational rayons. At the same time,  on the other hand, 27.3 percent of the electorate took part in  the elections in the predominantly Russian areas of the  northwest of the republic, in the city of Zelenodolsk and  Vekhneuslonskiy Rayon particularly, which was more even than in  polyethnic Kazan. What conclusion follows from this? We are  talking about a manifest delineation with an ethnic basis. And  this came as no surprise to the analysts.    A highly transparent conclusion, although "blurred" by the  republic's ruling elite: Any attempt to fence off the republic  from the Federation will signify a division of society in  Tatarstan itself. A division with, we repeat, an ethnic basis.  This playing with the patriotic feelings of the citizens of the  Russian Federation who live in the republic is very dangerous.  It is "preparation" for all interethnic conflicts. And the  conditions for this are being created by the "boycottists" of  the elections to, as they believe, a "foreign" parliament  themselves.    And, the final point: As the analysts foresaw, what we see  is  the success of the bloc of all federalist forces opposed to the  disintegration of Russia such as Equality and Legality (RiZ) and  its constituent Concord pacifist multinational movement of  Tatarstan. It was their candidates who won a relative victory at  the elections: The leader of the RiZ bloc, Ivan Grachev, former  deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan, was  elected to the Duma on the slate of the Yavlinskiy Bloc.  Although not elected in his 27th Privolzhskiy District ("only" a  25.3 percent turnout), Valentin Mikhaylov, a RiZ activist, who  was also formerly a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of Tatarstan,  amassed over 40 percent of the vote--almost three times as much  as his closest rival. Over 47 percent of the votes cast were for  Vladimir Belyayev, leader of Concord--almost twice the number of  those cast for Yuriy Voronin, his most serious rival. It is  obvious that while the showdowns of the supporters of "radical"  reforms and reforms "in the interests of the people" continue in  Moscow, Kazan is setting a convincing example of the benefit of  the unity of all reform forces--both centrists and radicals. And  any incitement of national egotism in the interests of  sovereignty is having a directly opposite effect.</p>

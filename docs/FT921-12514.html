			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Labour awards 'wooden spoons' to authorities LABOUR AWARDED 'wooden spoons' yesterday to three Tory councils for 'lack of achievement' to highlight the quality of services provided by local authorities. The move was intended to pre-empt the government's renewal of emphasis next week on the Citizen's Charter proposals. Seeking to upstage Monday's launch by Mr John Major of the 'chartermark' as a symbol of excellence in public services, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, published a Labour report contrasting the performances of the best and worst local authorities in terms of providing services. The launch will mark the start of Tory campaigning on the Citizen's Charter proposals. Charters for specific areas will deal with matters such as how staff treat the public, rather than in changes to the work organisations. Mr Gould said that Labour-controlled councils had been implementing their own plans for quality audits well before Mr Major produced the Citizen's Charter.</p>

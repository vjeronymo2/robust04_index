			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Earth Day brings criticism of progress on environment laws MILLIONS of Americans celebrated Earth Day yesterday amid concern about political stalemate over environmental legislation. Two controversial laws are due for renewal this year: the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the federal law governing disposal and management of hazardous wastes, and the Clean Air Act. Environmentalists say the outlook for both is dim, thanks to lack of leadership by the White House and in Congress. Mr Jim Middaugh, spokesman for the Environmental Defence Fund, said bills to renew and strengthen both acts were plagued more by regional disagreement than by partisan differences. In the case of the waste disposal legislation, those states with large tracts of surplus land were concerned about becoming dumping sites for those with little free land and high populations. No consensus has emerged about incineration methods. 'Do you incinerate or do you prevent production?' Mr Middaugh said. 'Some want recycling, some want wastes burned as fuels, some want that prohibited. Environmentalists generally want to see a reduction in the process of materials that create hazardous wastes.' On the Clean Water Act, there are disputes between those who want to develop stricter standards and those municipalities desperately in needs of federal funds to meet current standards. Growth plans of some cities are being limited by disputes over sewage treatment. Little progress is also expected on energy conservation measures, despite a study published by the National Academy of Sciences this month demanding action to combat the 'greenhouse effect'. The academy's recommendations included: tax incentives or regulation to achieve a 30 per cent increase in car fuel efficiency; use of new fluorescent bulbs to reduce the power used in lighting by 50 per cent; more efficient motors to reduce industrial energy demand; tougher standards for appliances; and a restructuring of energy prices to reflect their costs to the environment. The administration responded by restating its opposition to energy taxes and to more stringent federal efficiency standards.</p>

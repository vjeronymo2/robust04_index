			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Foschini at R169m pre-tax for 15 months FOSCHINI, the South African clothing, jewellery and accessories retailer, yesterday reported taxable profits of R168.9m (Dollars 46.9m) for the 15 months to March on turnover of R1.15bn. This compares with pre-tax profits of R148.9m on turnover of R822m for the previous 12 months. Annualised figures for the 15 months are not strictly comparable because they include two calendar first quarters, traditionally periods of low profit. Net income for the 15 months came to R92.9m against R73.4m for the 12 months. The figure includes a first-time dividend and attributable retained income from Foschini's 35.3 per cent holding in Oceana Investment Corporation of South Africa. Oceana holds 34.4 per cent of Etam, the UK fashion retailer which it failed to take over last August. Earnings per share were 216.2 cents for the 15 months, compared with 181.2 cents for the previous year. A scrip dividend of one new share for every 83 held has been declared. Mr Stanley Lewis, chairman, said profits, which compare favourably with its main competitors, reflected Foschini's strategy of catering to the broad middle market where disposable income was increasing. The current year had started satisfactorily and he was confident progress would be maintained.</p>

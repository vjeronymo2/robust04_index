			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: MUSIC CENTER BEGINS NEW FUND-RAISING ROUND  </P> <P> The amazements of charity fund-raising never cease. The Music Center raises $14  million in one year, and it begins all over. No wonder William A. Carter,  amidst all his accolades from Music Center chairman of the board and first  Interstate Bancorp chairman Joseph Pinola for Carter's leadership success in  this year's triumph, was kidding Maurice DeWald, who must raise $15 million as  Campaign '90 chairman. "We are woefully behind," joked Carter.  </P> <P> But if Carter, a Southland resident of only three years (he's vice chairman of  Ernst &amp; Young), can do it, so can DeWald, managing partner of Peat Marwick  Main &amp; Co. and formerly of Chicago and Orange County. And, as DeWald says,  "Most of the chairs are in place."  </P> <P> They and their wives -- Carolyn Carter, Dorie Pinola and Carolyn DeWald -- were  definitely the centerpieces of the thank-you party Esther Wachtell, president  of the Music Center, and the troops hosted the other evening -- dinner in the  Grand Hall of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and "Phantom of the Opera" at the  Ahmanson.  </P> <P> The crowd of about 200 couldn't wait for the show. "This is the fourth time  we've seen 'Phantom' -- London, New York and opening night," said John  Grundhofer (vice chairman, Wells Fargo Bank), grabbing brownies with wife  Beverly for the walk across the Plaza to the theater. He'll become a vice  chairman of the campaign with James Thomas (of Maguire, Thomas), taking over  from John E. Bryson (executive vice president, Southern California Edison) and  Roger A. Kozberg (vice president, Johnson &amp; Higgins).  </P> <P> Everyone dined heartily on Chinese pork dumplings and roast beef sandwiches,  stamina for the emotions of "Phantom." It was a happy crowd: Latham Williams  and his mother Joan, Kenneth and Linda Docter, Robert and Debra Egelston,  Stuart and Carrie Ketchum, Nancy and Alan Livingston, Frances Muir, Sydney and  Jackie Rosenberg, Marlene Billington and Deborah and Tom Tellefsen.  </P> <P> TRAVEL WINDS: Quite a group of Diadames accepted Nancy and Corwin Denny's  invitation to visit their Teton Pines resort at Jackson, Wyo. Art and Lois  Linkletter were among those on the Snake River float trip, admiring the moose  and eagles; Mary Davis and Margaret Spillane opted for the white-water trip.  Louise and John Goode and Midge and Bob Clark trekked to Yellowstone. Diane and  Robert Anderson, Julie and Bill Bergin, Joni and Clark Smith, Emily and Andrew  Westham, Mary and Stuart Davis, Donald and Mary Lou Hicks, Kay and Tom McKay,  Mary and Charles Skouras, Sue and Tom Somermeier, Marcia Adams and John Hessel  hit the golf course, tennis courts and Jackson Hole art galleries . . .  </P> <P> The French Consul for Cultural Affairs Alexandre Tolstoi, great grand nephew of  Count Leo Tolstoi, is off on a new assignment to Istanbul, Turkey, with his  wife Nicole and daughters Natacha and Tania...  </P> <P> Stacy and Piero Salvaggio and Leonard Pennario were in the crowd for the Del  Mar Race Track's opening week.  </P> <P> GET ENERGIZED: Take a deep breath. You'll need it for fall. September will be  especially heavy. The Palos Verdes Peninsula people -- Jean Juell, president of  the Peninsula Committee of Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, and Marion  Scharffenberger, Joan Hanley, Jody Murdock and Robin Serfass -- clued us in  over a luncheon at the California Club on the 32nd annual Portuguese Bend  National Horse Show to be held Sept. 8-10 at the Empty Saddle Club in Rolling  Hills Estates. They're talking about "jumping hurdles for children," a catchy  phrase to promote their top-rated equestrian event. Funds will endow a  pediatric cardiology chair at the hospital.  </P> <P> Right now, organizers are recruiting everyone from their kids to elders to  staff booths, drive tractors, park cars, sell ads, recruit patrons, design  brochures, paint fences and scrub portapotties. Show chairwoman Ann Cullen  expects that by the finale, they will have logged 14,000 volunteer hours.  </P> <P> CIRCLE RED: The trustees of the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. have set the  zoorifically casual Beastly Ball for Sept. 9 . . .  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center Foundation's big fund-raiser will be  at Filmland Nov. 5 (top donors got recognition at a dinner at the Bel-Air home  of John and Chantal Kilroy). Lucie Arnaz will entertain and developers Don and  Ray Watt, foundation directors, hope for a $100,000 net . . .  </P> <P> The Volunteer League of the San Fernando Valley fall benefit, "An Evening Under  the Stars," at the Universal Amphitheatre with the Pointer Sisters and alfresco  dining for community service projects is planned for Sept. 9. . .  </P> <P> The Holy Cross Medical Center "Celebration '89" dinner dance will be held at  San Fernando Mission Sept. 16.  </P> <P> KUDOS: To Goldie Hawn, who's said yes to be the honoree for the Big Sisters  Guild third annual comedy gala "Alive with Second City" Dec. 9 at the Hollywood  Palladium. A special merit award will be given to the Krok Sisters -- Arlene,  Sharon Krok Feuer and Loren -- whose company, EPI Products, has donated  $100,000 to underwrite the show.  </P> <P> DEBS: Gretchen Schlegel, Patricia Hadfield and Rosemary LaLonde chaired the  mother-daughter debutante announcement luncheon hosted by the Coronet Debutante  Ball Board at the Bel Air Country Club. Pink was the color of the day -- pink  dresses, pink tablecloths, pink carnations, pink coronets. The ball is Nov. 25.  </P></p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: The bubble reputation credibility. It operates in rather an odd way. If we can establish sufficient credibility for our commitment to the ERM, we are told, we could cut interest rates; and indeed, the further sterling might temporarily sink below its central ERM rate, the further we could cut them, because of the unshakeable belief that it would appreciate to its central rate on the way to EMU. But first, we have to get round an awkward corner: in order to establish credibility in the first place we have had to raise rates. We and the French decided this in effect, as Dr Mervyn King explained in Rome, when we decided that a German revaluation, which they wanted, would so damage the credibility of the franc and the pound that we would rather stick to a tight German policy. In time, the market would understand that because the problems were German, we could ease domestic policy. If you think this strategy of reculer pour mieux sauter itself strains credibility, then read the whole text of King's speech. The logic is clear enough, and the French experience with the franc fort, not to mention our own rate cuts since joining the ERM, go a good deal of the way to proving that it can work. It would work a good deal more readily, as an IMF staff paper argued many years ago, if we pitched our ERM commitment not in terms of a spot rate, but of a forward rate - say, three months forward; for arbitrage ensures that a cut in interest rates drives up the forward rate relative to the spot rate. It is theoretically possible then, to combine an unbreakable exchange rate commitment with some independence in monetary policy. However, there is a missing term in the argument: it begs the question of what is a credible exchange rate in the first place. The official side seems to believe that it depends purely on the tightness with which ministers clench their teeth. Many market traders, however, continue to demand other evidence, notable a sound current account balance. These people continue to believe, in defiance of the current phase in official doctrine, that a country which depends on large injections of foreign capital simply to prevent a bad slump getting even worse is not in a sustainable position. The longer the slump lasts, and the current account remains weak (and they will guess at the balance even when the official figures disappear for a spell), the more they will believe that something has to give. That conventional point of view still commands its own credibility, and even traders who disagree with it must take it into account as an influence in the market. Indeed, even the Treasury is in the practice of taking it into account: the Whitehall panic over public spending must make perfect sense to Lord Healey, who had similar problems when the balance of payments was weak in the mid-1970s. It does not, however, square with the official doctrine that large deficits are a natural and even desirable reflection of a deep recession - which also makes perfectly good sense. There is one hopeful side to the Healey parallel. The UK current deficit in the mid-1970s reflected a huge burst of foreign investment in the North Sea, whose results in due course pushed the current account into large surplus; and it can be argued that the rapid growth of Japanese car-making capacity is having the same result, with the same promise for the future. The trouble is that this is not the kind of analysis which normally impresses traders responding to bad figures. And now we have the Danes, who have dented the credibility not only of Maastricht, but of the whole ERM-EMU project which has made our own exchange rate commitment more credible. Small wonder Mr John Major is so strongly commited to sustaining what he can of Maastricht. He may succeed, just as Mr Michael Portillo may get the government's part of our national deficit under control; but it is all much harder than clenching your teeth. Fingernails will be worn short in Great George Street this year.</p>

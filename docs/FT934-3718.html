			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Elections in Russia: Inflation fall is boost for Yeltsin men The Russian government yesterday announced a significant fall in the inflation rate, giving a boost to Russia's Choice, the electoral alliance set up by radical ministers, in the run-up to Sunday's parliamentary elections. Inflation, the main gauge of success of unpopular financial austerity measures, was reported to be down to 11.3 per cent in November from 20 per cent in October. Mr Sergei Vasiliev, head of the government's economic reform centre, said it was a triumph for a much-criticised tightening of fiscal and monetary policy over the past six months. Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, who says his campaigning for Russia's Choice consists of keeping a close watch on the country's financial health, promised that 1994 would be 'a year of investment and restructuring'. In the charged week before the elections, any economic developments are being exploited to the full by Russian politicians. By the same token, the deputy prime minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin, who is responsible for foreign economic relations but running for a different party, confirmed that President Boris Yeltsin would fly to Brussels today to sign a political declaration with European Union leaders. The political declaration, which puts Russia on the same footing as the US and Japan as a political partner for the EU, also sets out the principles of a more concrete partnership agreement to be signed next year. Denying that the trip would serve as a public relations boost for Mr Yeltsin before the elections, Mr Shokhin said that 'on the contrary it would help strengthen the image of Europe' which had taken a long time to recognise the progress made by Russia towards a market economy. But he admitted that Russia and the EU were still at loggerheads over restrictions imposed by President Yeltsin on western banks to win support for Russia's Choice from powerful Russian banks. Meanwhile, Mr Yeltsin's drive for a yes vote in the referendum on the draft constitution received support from an unexpected quarter yesterday when he prevailed upon leaders in the ethnically divided North Caucasus to endorse the constitution publicly.</p>

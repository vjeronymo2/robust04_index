			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 800 GATHER IN PROTEST OF YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL PLAN  </P> <P> More than 800 people filled the auditorium of Birmingham High School in Van  Nuys Thursday night in the largest parent protest to date against proposals for  sweeping changes in the school calendar and class sizes, including a 12-month  school year.  </P> <P> The meeting was called by West Valley school board member Julie Korenstein, who  for more than two hours fielded questions from parents worried about hot summer  classrooms and disruption of family vacations.  </P> <P> Ken Warner, who said he has seven children in public schools, accused the Los  Angeles Unified School District of failing to plan properly for the soaring  enrollment that prompted the problem.  </P> <P> Korenstein replied that the district had a similar plan two years ago to  convert all schools to year-round schedules. But, she said, "People spoke  against it, I listened to what they had to say, and I voted against  year-round."  </P> <P> But the classroom shortage has grown worse since then, giving the board fewer  options beside the conversion to year-round schedules, she said.  </P> <P> Bobbi Fiedler, former congresswoman and ex-school board member, disagreed. She  told the audience that the district has about as many students as it did in the  late 1970s when she was first elected to the board.  </P> <P> "We managed with existing facilities" then without converting to a 12-month  school year, she said.  </P> <P> Parents applauded Lyle Spiegel, who said the Los Angeles district had grown too  large to operate efficiently. "Divide it up and we can have our own Valley  district," said Spiegel, who said he has two children at Welby Way Elementary  School in Canoga Park.  </P> <P> It was at least the third meeting for parents in the west San Fernando Valley  that has turned into a rally against the year-round plan. Opposition to the  plan is centered in the Valley and the Westside.  </P> <P> Los Angeles school officials have said the district -- the nation's second  largest -- will run out of elementary classroom seats by summer because of  enrollment growth that is expected to continue through the 1990s. Seats at the  district's junior high schools will be filled by 1993, district officials said.  </P> <P> A plan to increase the number of available seats at elementary schools by 23%  was presented to the seven-member school board in December.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, schools would have to choose either larger class sizes or  year-round and double-session schedules. District officials hope the plan would  make room for an additional 60,000 students expected to enroll by fall, 1992.  </P> <P> The school board is expected to decide on the proposal at its Feb. 5 meeting.  </P> <P> Beginning this summer, 108 elementary schools that have reached capacity or  receive students from filled schools would be required to change from the  traditional school year calendar under the district's proposal. Forty-five of  those schools are in the San Fernando Valley, which now has 15 schools on a  year-round calendar.  </P> <P> This fall, enrollment in the Los Angeles school district went up by 15,000  students, pushing the district's total enrollment past 610,000. Even larger  increases are expected in coming years, officials said.  </P> <P> The reopening of the district's closed schools, which would provide about 8,000  seats, and new school construction, which is expected to add another 2,800  seats by 1991, are not enough to accommodate the district's growing enrollment,  district officials said.  </P> <P> Most of the district's recent growth has been in the Valley, district officials  said. In addition to soaring enrollment by Valley residents, another 23,000  students are bused from filled schools in other parts of the city. That number  is expected to triple by 1993, officials said.  </P> <P> Parents with children in Valley schools who oppose the changes say that the  district should first install air-conditioning in all of its classrooms before  converting schools to year-round schedules. District officials estimate that it  costs about $27,000 to air-condition each classroom.  </P> <P> Some parents from Dearborn Street Elementary School began circulating petitions  this week that pledge signers to keep their children home if they are required  to attend school if forecasts call for temperatures of more than 90 degrees or  if the air is judged unhealthful by the South Coast Air Quality Management  District.  </P> <P> The petitions will be presented to the school board next week, Dearborn parent  Rita Morrow said.  </P> <P> Other parents from Sherman Oaks Elementary School say they are planning a  demonstration at their campus on Wednesday to protest the possible change to  year-round schedules.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Related story on: B1  </P></p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: A pagan voice for Christmas MANY OF the records I have enjoyed this year have been choral music of various kinds. The new issue of Delius's Sea Drift (Argo 430 206-2) by the WNO chorus and orchestra under Sir Charles Mackerras is a winner. Mackerras gives Delius a keen edge and firm propulsion - no drowsiness. The ocean swell is wonderfully caught and the Welsh chorus tone has the tang of salt spray. Thomas Hanson's baritone solo is first-rate. For once the vocal line does not sound as if it had been stuck on afterwards. Every word (Whitman in anthropomorphic mood) tells. The fill-up is the Florida Suite. Sir Charles Groves takes a less lean and athletic view of Delius but his 1972 Mass of Life (with the LPO and their Choir) comes up rousingly on transfer to EMI CMS 7 64218 2 (two CDs). The companion pieces are the Songs of sunset and Arabesque, with the Royal Liverpool PO and Choir and eminent soloists - Harper, Baker, Watts, Tear, Luxon, Shirley-Quirk. Luxon's singing of the important baritone solos in the Mass is notable. The way Baker combines intensity with simplicity in the fourth of the Sunset songs is extraordinary. The pagan Delius might have reacted sarcastically to his music being recommended for Christmas. If this worries you, go carolling with Richard Hickox, the LSO and Chorus and the St Paul's Cathedral choristers, in two seasonable works by Vaughan Williams (EMI CDC 7 54128). The Fantasia on Christmas Carols (1912) is an interweaving of traditional tunes. The anthology-cantata Hodie ('This Day' - 1954) is longer and stranger: choruses, solos with beautiful word setting, gospel narrations not spoken but sung, mostly by the boys, rich orchestration, words from many poets including Milton, George Herbert and Hardy. Is it the inclusion, in a central position, of Hardy's The Oxen, that introduces a gentle element of questioning? Christmas music with a difference, well worth trying. Or, as a perfect antidote to late-Romanticism, listen to the Pilgrim songs and dances from the Libre vermell (Red Book) of Montserrat, persuasively brought to life by Philip Pickett and the New London Consort (Oiseau-Lyre 433 186-2). Many travellers to Barcelona will have visited the famous monastery up in the mountains, half-hidden in a cluster of monstrous rocks like swollen organ pipes. The Red Book, completed in 1399, one of the Montserrat's library treasures, contains ten pieces for voices and instruments for use by pilgrims. They were warned to do them 'with respect and moderation' and to avoid lewdness and lasciviousness. The Consort players have the easy conviction which now marks the best early music playing. Gone (almost) are the days of squeak and scratch. A new CD which should not be overlooked is EMI's Musique vocale francaise (CDC 7 54452 2) by the Groupe vocal de France under their its expert English conductor John Alldis. Debussy's Three poems by Charles d'Orleans for unaccompanied chorus are among his choicest small works. Ravel's Trois chansons are here too, with Milhaud's outwardly simple, but deeply felt Six sonnets on 'secret' poems written during the Occupation by Jean Cassou. A distinguished collection, completed with works by Schmitt and Sauguet. Alas, words not included. A pleasant surprise during the year has been the number of recordings for Milhaud's centenary. To those I reviewed some weeks ago can be added two more in the series of live performances from Prague, where links with Milhaud go back to the 1920s. One 'volume' has works connected with Provence (PR 250 013) with the choral Cantique du Rhone, the Eighth Symphony ('Rhodanian') and the idyllic 'Chenimee du Roi Rene for wind quintet. The other is centred on the Czech capital (PR 250 012), with the bracing, combative Music for Prague, and the Concertino d'hiver (trombone and strings). Enthusiasts for the unique Spanish mezzo Conchita Supervia will fall upon Pearl's anthology The unknown Supervia (GEMM CD 9969). They will be well rewarded in spite of variable sound quality. Operatic arias, zarzuela excerpts and a host of mainly Spanish and Catalan songs but including John Alden Carpenter's 'When I bring to you coloured toys'. Best of all, Bizet's 'Les adieux de l'hotesse arabe'. With Supervia's inimitable command of vocal colour and verbal inflection, this song is transformed into a miniature drama.</p>

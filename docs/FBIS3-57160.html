Shokhin believes that the Economics Ministry should not only  calculate the effects of economic decisions, but also "thrust  quite explicit variants of economic policy on the government."    Following the changes in the government's structure and  personal composition, the ministry should take up coordinating  the policies towards both domestic and foreign investments,  Shokhin said. Therefore, the functions of the Russian Agency for  International Cooperation and Development which earlier  attracted foreign investments must be transferred to the  Economics Ministry.    In addition, the ministry will focus on the maintenance of  financial proportions in the economy and access to the world  market, according to Shokhin.    Commenting on Boris Fedorov's resignation, Shokhin noted:  "Boris Grigoryevich put himself in quite an uncomfortable  position by making a number of wittingly uncompromising demands  formulated in quite an indelicate manner."    Fedorov made the resignation of Vice Prime Minister  Aleksandr  Zaveryukha and Central Bank Chairman Viktor Geraschenko a  condition to his work in the reorganized government.    "It seems to me that the main thing Boris Fedorov could  demand from the president and the prime minister was pursuing a  certain course of financial policy and make this a condition to  his stay in the government only," the minister said.    "If Boris Fedorov sincerely believed that Geraschenko and  Zaveryukha hampered the reforms, the need for Fedorov's presence  in the government as a counterbalance to these people must be  even stronger," Shokhin is convinced.    "I do not think that the life of the present government may  shorten due to the absence of Gaydar and Fedorov," Shokhin  pointed out adding that "everything will depend on the line the  cabinet will be pursuing."</p>

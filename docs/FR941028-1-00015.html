			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Duration and Scope of Exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;36.1(a), the Commission proposes to implement the exemption under a three-year pilot program. The pilot program is designed to give the exchanges and the Commission a trial period to test the operation of the exemption. More importantly, it affords the Commission an opportunity to determine the effect of section 4(c) contract market transactions on the integrity of the marketplace as a whole and whether continued trading under the exemption would be in the public interest. The trial nature of the program reflects the Commission's belief that the exemption constitutes a significant departure from the regulatory scheme under which futures and option contracts have been trading for over 70 years. The Commission believes that the pilot program will enable the Commission to obtain sufficient data on which to base a permanent program. In this regard, at the conclusion of the pilot program, the Commission intends to evaluate section 4(c) contract market transactions exempted by this Part in order to determine whether to extend the exemptive relief granted herein, and whether it would be appropriate to alter the requirements of this Part or expand the exemptive relief provided to other transactions or markets. The Commission requests comment specifically addressed to whether a pilot program is feasible and appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;36.1(b) sets forth the scope of the exemption. It states that each board of trade on which section 4(c) contract market transactions are traded is deemed to be a contract market and must comply with all provisions of the Act and Commission regulations, including the requirement of a clearing facility subject to Commission oversight, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  except for those provisions which are ``specifically inconsistent'' with Part 36. Moreover, new markets that seek to use this exemption must submit all rules relative to governance, disciplinary proceedings, financial requirements,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et cetera, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  under the current provisions of Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 7a(12). Therefore, the Commission intends that section 4(c) contract market transactions trade pursuant to the following provisions: 36.3 (trading rules), 36.4 (listing of transactions), 36.5 (reporting requirements), 36.6 (registration requirements), 36.7 (risk disclosure), and 36.9 (fraud and manipulation). Except where specifically indicated in Part 36, the provisions of Part 36 govern in lieu of the provisions of the Act and Commission regulations that would otherwise apply to futures and option transactions. Thus, these provisions of Part 36, explained in detail below, constitute the scope of the exemption for section 4(c) contract market transactions; all other provisions of the Act and Commission rules, including, among other things, segregation, net capital, supervision, bankruptcy, exchange emergency actions, availability of reparations, and private rights of action, would continue to apply. In any submission under proposed Part 36, a contract market should specify those provisions of the Act and Commission rules which the contract market deems to be specifically inconsistent with the contract market rules being submitted. The Commission requests comments concerning the scope of the exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1.41(a)(3), 17 CFR 1.41(a)(3) (1994). The term ``contract market'' includes a clearing organization that clears trades for the contract market. The Commission does not intend to alter this aspect of the markets it regulates by virtue of this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In proposed &sect;36.1(b), the Commission does not intend to limit contract markets in section 4(c) contract market transactions to current contract markets or exchanges. In order to qualify, such an entity would be treated similarly to a board of trade seeking an initial designation as a contract market. In addition, under the structure of the Act, the Commission's regulations, and this exemption, any entity wishing to offer a facility for trading section 4(c) contract market transactions would be required to become a contract market in these transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Appropriate Persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In considering the persons that may enter into section 4(c) contract market transactions, that is, ``eligible participants,'' the Commission is proposing to use a list of ``appropriate persons'' modeled on the list set forth in Section 4(c)(3) (A) through (J) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(3) (A) through (J), with revisions tailored to this particular market and reflecting the Commission's experience in applying similar concepts in other exemptions. In this regard, the Commission is requesting comment whether these proposed requirements should be applied to the Commission's previously-granted exemptions as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of note is that under proposed &sect;36.1(c)(1), all eligible participants may enter into section 4(c) contract market transactions for their own accounts; in addition, futures commission merchants (``FCMs'') and floor brokers may trade section 4(c) contract market transactions on behalf of other eligible participants. In addition, under proposed &sect;36.1(c)(2)(vii), the Commission is intending to limit eligible employee benefit plans to those with total assets exceeding $5 million  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (rather than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``or'' provided in Section 4(c)(3)(G) of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6(c)(3)(G))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whose investment decisions are made by a bank, trust company, insurance company, investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or a commodity trading advisor under the CEA. In this regard, the Commission specifically seeks comment concerning whether there is an asset level for such employee benefit plans which should qualify them as an eligible participant irrespective of whether their investment decisions are made by a bank, trust company, insurance company, investment adviser or commodity trading advisor. In addition, in the context of proposed &sect;36.1(c)(2)(viii), the Commission seeks comment on whether municipalities should be included as ``eligible participants,'' and, if so, what, if any, limitations would be appropriate in this context. Finally, the Commission is interested in comments addressing whether the list of appropriate persons as proposed would exclude any individuals, entities, collective investment vehicles or others who should be considered suitable to engage in section 4(c) contract market transactions, and in particular whether Part 36 should be conformed to Part 35 in this regard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

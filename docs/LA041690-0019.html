			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRIC MEASURES  </P> <P> Regarding "U.S. Inching Toward Metric System" (Part Am April 7): Maybe slowly,  but the meter is still running.  </P> <P> Have you used any inch-and-three-eighths film lately: You'd probably answer  more quickly if I asked "any 35-millimeter film." That's metric.  </P> <P> We use the metric system a lot more than we realize. Our cars are marked with  little metric measurements -- 1.9, 3.6 or whatever. Most packaged or canned  foods, frozen dinners, bottled goods show metric measures. Vodka? Champagne?  Even the bottles have changed to metric sizes. Even the labels seem to be  saying "Take me to your liter!"  </P> <P> IRVIN BORDERS  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

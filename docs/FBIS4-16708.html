			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Gorodetskaya under the "Caucasus" rubric: </F> "Ingushetia Urges Introduction of Federal Rule in State of  Emergency Zone"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Ingushetia's parliament  yesterday discussed the situation in the state of emergency zone  and passed a decree "On the Situation in the Zone Affected by  the State of Emergency on North Ossetia and Ingushetia  Territories and Measures to Uphold Citizens' Rights." The  decree says that while Russian Federation laws do not work in  the state of emergency zone, the rights of Russian citizens are  being trampled, and the Provisional Administration has shown  that it is completely incapable of stabilizing the situation.  Ingushetia's parliament sees the suspension of local bodies of  power of North Ossetia in Prigorodnyy Rayon and the introduction  of direct federal rule on this territory as the only way out of  the crisis. Ingushetia's parliament has forwarded to the  Russian Federation president a special statement to this effect.  [passage omitted]</p>

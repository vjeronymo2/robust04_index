			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Women lose out over 'networking' MEN ARE seven times more likely than women to get a job by using personal contacts, says a survey of redundant executives. InterExec, the employment consultancy which carried out the survey, said women had fewer female contemporaries at senior levels in business and find it difficult to approach men to gain information about job opportunities. The consultancy found that over the past 12 months, out of 500 redundant executives who had been earning more than Pounds 30,000 a year, 70 per cent of men obtained jobs by 'networking', while only 10 per cent of women got jobs using the technique. Mr Nick Hawkins, InterExec's chairman, said senior women were more reliant on job advertisements and professional help than men. Women were losing out because 63 per cent of top jobs were not advertised. The Industrial Society said the results might indicate that women faced discrimination when they attempted to network, and not that they were failing to usecontacts. Ms Jo Gardiner, Industrial Society national campaigns leader, said she thought it unlikely that women were reluctant to contact men about job opportunities because of a possible misunderstanding. 'The senior women I know take a professional approach and have the courage of their convictions  -that's how they've got where they are.' She said women lacked the 'old boy' contacts that men had, and that was why concerted efforts had been made by women in, for example, the City, law and advertising, to set up networks. The Industrial Society's own network for junior- and middle-level women in all sectors - the Pepperell network - was launched in October and has about 1,000 members.</p>

Of the possible agreements between the IMF and the different  countries, the government decided to quit the "enhanced  surveillance" [two preceding words in English] agreement which  follows the "stand by" [two preceding words in English] on  strictness regarding IMF loans and a quarterly control of the  established goals. "Enhanced monitoring" [two preceding words  in English] will be conducted instead.    Official sources told BUSQUEDA that the new agreement will  be  established in March.    The "staff" [preceding word in English] of experts headed by  Western Hemisphere Director Steri Beza will study details of the  program submitted by Uruguay with the adjustments made last  week. For 1994 there is a predicted inflation rate of 35  percent, a fiscal deficit of 0.5 percent of the GDP, a  devaluation of 2 percent per month, and a salary increase of 32  percent for public employees "consistent" with the devaluation  percentage.    It was stated that the choice of a more slack agreement with  eventual measures for the correction of incorrect fiscal  spending this year "leave doubts among IMF experts about their  real fulfillment."    The approval of the IMF executive board (which is reserved  for the "stand by") is not required for "enhanced surveillance"  but it supposes explicit acceptance by the IMF of the country's  economic program.    It was explained that "enhanced monitoring" also has  quarterly goals but it allows "greater margins for deviation  from them," and the IMF controls are more "global."</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / MoD scraps plans to move unit north PLANS to relocate the Ministry of Defence quality assurance unit from south London to Stockton-on-Tees in Cleveland, bringing 1,600 jobs to Teesside, have been abandoned. Mr Kenneth Carlisle, the junior defence procurement minister, said the MoD had decided instead to disperse the unit's staff among a number of Defence Research Agency sites in southern England. The announcement came in a Commons written answer to Mr Tim Devlin, Conservative MP for Stockton South. Later Mr Michael Portillo, the local government minister, announced that a section of the 90-acre Preston Farm site in Stockton no longer required by the MoD is to house a Pounds 7m factory development for Livera Foods, a manufacturer of gateaux and cheesecakes, eventually creating up to 700 jobs. He added that the Teesside Development Corporation, which is responsible for the site, had received a number of other inquiries. The Pounds 100m relocation of the quality assurance unit's Woolwich and Bromley laboratories and test houses was announced by the government in March 1989. Although seen at that time as cost-effective, it was subsequently put on hold. Last August the MoD said its Options for Change defence spending cuts had made it necessary to review the plan. Mr Carlisle said yesterday the 'most economical and operationally effective way ahead' for the quality assurance technical support division was for it to be dispersed and consolidated into the Defence Research Agency. Quality assurance staffing will be reduced to 1,200 jobs. The news was greeted with anger by the leaders of Cleveland county and Stockton borough council, who have lobbied the government persistently not to renege on its plan. The relocation had been seen as a means of diversifying the area's economic base by an injection of high-quality jobs. The county council said: 'No way can you compare 700 jobs at a cake factory with the sort of high-quality, technical, scientific and training opportunities which the MoD would have brought.'</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / International Company News: Alpine may have already been sold, bidders told ALPINE (Double Glazing) may already have been sold according to parties who have tried to make offers for one of the oldest names in the UK double glazing industry. Creditors are not due to meet until June 15, to vote on whether to liquidate the company. The meeting was called on the order of directors on May 28. Some bidders have been told the assets and business of Alpine have already been sold. However, calls remain unanswered from Mr Graham Wilson, the insolvency practitioner who has arranged the creditors meeting to discuss liquidation, and who is also representing Mr Clive Smith in his bid to avoid bankruptcy today. It also emerged yesterday that almost three weeks before Alpine stopped trading regional sales directors were verbally instructed to send all customer payments by special delivery to the company's head office in London, and not deposit them in the local banks as previously. In a memo dated May 11 sales staff were told to have customers make cheques payable to Alpine (Double Glazing), 'omitting the Co Ltd'.</p>

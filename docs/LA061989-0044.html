			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POSTSCRIPT: CLASSMATES KEEP SLAIN STUDENT'S NAME ALIVE WITH AWARD  </P> <P> When the names of the eighth-grade students at Hewes Intermediate School in  North Tustin are called during graduation ceremonies this evening, one will be  missing.  </P> <P> But students have made sure that the name of their former classmate, Greg  Anderson, is not forgotten.  </P> <P> Greg had almost completed the seventh grade when he was stabbed to death by an  intruder one afternoon last June, just after riding his bike home from school.  </P> <P> Students at Hewes wanted some kind of memorial to the 12-year-old. Earlier this  year, they agreed on the idea of creating an annual award to be presented to  the outstanding writer in the seventh grade.  </P> <P> "Greg was a good writer," Hewes principal Julie Hume said. "There was a quality  to the way he expressed himself for someone so young. We have memorial benches,  trees, gardens for other students who left us, but this was the thing they  seemed to want to do for Greg."  </P> <P> The memorial award will be presented for the first time Monday during the  Hewes' annual award ceremonies, at which the school's top students in various  subjects are honored.  </P> <P> This year, two students will receive the Greg Anderson writing award:  seventh-grader Jane Park and eighth-grader Lisa Blaydes. The award is going to  an eighth-grader this year because that would have been Greg's class, Hume  said.  </P> <P> Each student will receive an engraved medal, and their names will go on a  plaque kept in the school library. The students raised the money for the award  themselves by putting change in a pickle jar at the school's supply shop.  </P> <P> Greg's father, Andy Anderson, said he was moved by the students'  thoughtfulness, especially because Greg had gone to school with them for just a  year. The Andersons moved to East Tustin the September before Greg was killed.  </P> <P> "It just meant so much to us as a family," Anderson said. "It came from the  kids, and I think it's a marvelous token."  </P> <P> Greg's stepmother, Carol Anderson, may attend the awards ceremony this year,  but Andy Anderson said he will probably not go.  </P> <P> "I thought maybe I could," he said, "but I didn't feel like I personally could  go without having some problems. I didn't want the kids to be upset."  </P> <P> Investigators have interviewed hundreds of people but have made no arrests in  Greg's slaying, which occurred on a sunny Thursday afternoon a little more than  a year ago.  </P> <P> Greg usually rode his motocross bike home from school about 2:30 p.m., his  stepmother told police. She was normally at home when he arrived, but on the  day that Greg was killed she had left the house shortly after 2 p.m.  </P> <P> Greg's sister, now 16, arrived home about 3 p.m. and found him lying face down  in a pool of blood. A knife was found near his body.  </P> <P> Anderson said he still hopes that investigators will solve the crime.  </P> <P> "I don't have any thoughts that they've shoved it on the back burner or  something," he said, his voice filling with sadness. "It's just one of those  situations. . . . I haven't asked about what evidence they have, what they  don't have. It's too painful for me to even get into that part of it."  </P> <P> Greg's father cheered up a bit, though, at the thought of today's award  ceremony. "It restores my faith in our young kids when they come up with  something like this," he said.  </P></p>

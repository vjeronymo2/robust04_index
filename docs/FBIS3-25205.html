			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The quarrel between Nigeria and Cameroon over a  disputed border area shows no signs of being resolved. Late  last year, there were claims that Cameroon gendarmes were  raiding villages in Nigerian territory. Then, Nigerian troops  moved onto islands on the peninsula, ostensibly to protect  Nigerian nationals living there. Now, the NIGERIAN NEWS AGENCY  [NAN] says some 18,000 Nigerians have fled the area after raids  by Cameroon gendarmes. And it seems a visit to Cameroon by  Nigerian Foreign Minister Babagana Kingibe has not achieved very  much. On the line to Yaounde, Raggi Omar asked Cameroon's  minister of external affairs delegate, Francis Nkwain, if  gendarmes had raided the disputed region.    [Begin recording] [Nkwain] First of all, the content of the  news is absolutely wrong. We are not pursuing anybody and if we  were in a war situation, then it should be the military. The  gendarmes are not the people who go to war on behalf of our  nation. So, that must be somebody who is writing who doesn't  even know what is happening in Cameroon. Secondly, the  peninsula has always been controversial on the part of Nigeria,  but the peninsula is Cameroon. We didn't fight a war with  Nigeria to gain any land, no. We got the land from history.  When the colonial power left, we took over. And the maps are  there, there is no question about it.    [Omar] So, you are completely refuting these reports on the  NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA that thousands of Nigerians in this area  are fleeing?    [Nkwain] We refute them because it is impossible even for  that to be the news.    [Omar] But are people on the move in that region, can you  confirm that?    [Nkwain] We can confirm that the island--I mean, the  peninsula--has been occupied by Nigerian troops since 30  December 1993 to 4 January 1994 and that the foreign minister of  Nigeria came on the heels of our complaints and was received  here by our head of state; and that our head of state sent the  minister of external relations of Cameroon, who went to see  President Abacha on the same issue; and that we all agreed that  we were going to go down to the place to see whether or not the  Nigerians had occupied the place or not; and we met today  according to plan, and the foreign minister of Nigeria wouldn't  let us go there.    [Omar] So, let me get this straight: You met the Nigerian  foreign minister, Babagana Kingibe, today to go and see this  area but he refused to go?    [Ekwain] The minister of external relations of Cameroon, Mr.  Oyono, was in Bouya, has been in Bouya since yesterday, where  they met. And they were meeting there to proceed to the area to  prove whether the place.... [pauses] The question was whether it  was occupied or not. We are also aware that the Nigerian press  has totally come out with funny stories in order to rationalize  their action. That, we think, is their effort to prove to the  world.... [pauses] That also proves to us that maybe they know  they did something wrong. We are a small nation, you know.  Nigeria is a big nation.    [Omar] Have your meetings with the Nigerian foreign  minister, Babagana Kingibe, achieved anything at all?    [Ekwain] I say we have not because we were to meet to join  forces and go down on to the territory, but he wouldn't let us  go there now, so I am waiting for the minister to come back and  then we will know the details of what happened thereafter. Now,  if in the meanwhile, they mount another campaign through their  media, it is not our problem to say horrible things about  Cameroon. [end recording]</p>

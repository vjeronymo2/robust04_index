			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian tea output recovers IN SPITE of Assam, India's largest tea growing state, suffering a setback in production in June and July, the country's tea output during the first seven months of this year rose by 29.45m kg to 355m kg. Excessive rains and a sudden spell of cold weather affected plucking of tea leaves in Assam, industry officials said. At 51.44m kg Assam's July tea production was down by 2.13m kg from the corresponding month of 1992. The shortfall in production in the previous month amounted to 1.07m kg. However, total Assam production of 173.17m kg up to July was 2.85m kg more than in the same period last year. The quality of Assam tea this season is generally satisfactory. Despite floods, West Bengal recorded a production improvement of more than 12m kg at 78.39m kg over the first seven months of 1993. Darjeeling's increase of nearly 1m kg to 6.04m kg was regarded as particularly remarkable. South India's contribution to the production increase in the period was 14.44m kg, Tamil Nadu's 62.74m kg, Kerala's 36.55m kg and Karnataka's 2.44m kg. Industry officials said the trend of plucking up to the end of October would decide whether India returned to the 1991 production level of 742m kg. Last year the country's tea production suffered a major setback to 704m kg, largely because of severe drought in South India.</p>

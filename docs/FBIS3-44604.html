			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 1210 GMT on 24 December broadcasts the  twelfth and final part of the documentary entitled: "Mao  Zedong." The final part, which lasts for 50 minutes, is  entitled: "Later Years," and focuses on Mao's role in the  Cultural Revolution and Deng Xiaoping's rehabilitation.    After video shows an on-screen prologue read by an  unidentified narrator: "Mao Zedong said: The youth of today and  tomorrow will appraise the revolution according to their own  criterion of values...." the documentary begins with video of an  interview with Nobel laureate Lee Tsung-dao recalling his 1974  meeting with Mao, during which Mao regretted he had not  continued the pursuit of natural sciences. In fact, the  narrator says, due to Mao's failing health, from the early  seventies on he did not even study his favorite subject --  social sciences. Then, as video shows historical footage of Mao  attending the 10th CPC National Congress in 1973, his former  head nurse Wu Xujun recalls the ailing Mao being unable to stand  up from his chair on the rostrum to receive a standing ovation  from congress delegates.    The narrator says: According to the accounts of Mao's  doctors, he was stricken with one ailment after another in his  later years, which put "the old man with ceaseless aspirations"  in the face of "new contradictions." As the video shows  historical footage of Mao's funeral, as well as shots of the Mao  memorial hall in Tiananmen Square, the narrator explains: Mao  always viewed the issue of life and death in a lighthearted and  humorous way. In a conversation with Edgar Snow in 1965, he  said he had no way of knowing what the youth of today and  tomorrow would aspire to, but he added that future generations  would appraise the revolution according to their own criterion  of values. This view conforms with the objective law on social  development. However, in his later years, Mao failed to match  his theory with practice. A year after the conversation with  Snow, he began the Cultural Revolution.    While the video shows historical footage of Red Guards  shouting slogans and cheering Mao in Tiananmen Square, the  narrator says: "Mao Zedong should bear chief responsibility for  the decade-long calamity brought about by the Cultural  Revolution in China. Of course, Mao's purpose in initiating the  mighty mass movement was not to destroy the socialist state he  himself founded. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping has pointed out: As  far as Chairman Mao's intentions are concerned, he initiated the  Cultural Revolution out of consideration for avoiding the  restoration of capitalism. However, he misapprehended the  realities in China and consequently led the country into  large-scale turmoil, which was far beyond his expectations and  control." The narrator continues: In 1967, Mao contemplated  ending the Cultural Revolution within three years, but it did  not proceed as he envisaged. "Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, and others  successively set up two counterrevolutionary cliques and schemed  to seize supreme power. They exploited Mao's errors and  committed a host of activities behind his back to the detriment  of the country and people's interests, causing immeasurable harm  and damage to the party and state."    While the video shows historical footage of the masses  adulating Mao as "the great teacher, great leader, great  commander, and great helmsman," the narrator points out: "Mao  did not entirely reject the people's worship. Nevertheless, he  began to be wary of this man." Video at this point shows a  close-up shot of Lin Biao reading the little red book of Mao's  quotations. Many photographs taken during the Cultural  Revolution show a stone-faced Mao while Lin Biao shouted "Long  live Chairman Mao." The narrator continues: During a CCTV news  documentary made on 1 June 1971 Mao was never seen with Lin  Biao. The occasion was Mao's 45th and last appearance atop the  Tiananmen rostrum.    As Mao's head nurse Wu Xujun gives an account of Lin Biao's  failed attempt to blow up the train carrying Mao back to Beijing  from an inspection tour in the summer of 1971, video shows color  photographs of several charred corpses and plane wreckage in  Mongolia, with an on-screen caption reading: "The Lin Biao  treasonous clique plunging to death on a flight to a foreign  country on 13 September 1971." The narrator adds: In the wake  of the incident, Mao decided to reexamine the mass movement and  pondered several issues.    While the video then goes onto show historical footage of  Marshal Chen Yi's funeral in January 1972, his son Chen Haosu  recalls how Mao showed up unexpectedly at the funeral in  defiance of the Gang of Four's orders, and he says that Mao's  decision to attend was based, to some extent, on the political  situation at that time. Chen adds that though subjectively Mao  was unwilling to call off the Cultural Revolution, objectively,  in view of the leadership vacuum caused by the disappearance of  Lin Biao, he had to consider the rehabilitation of veteran  comrades who had been purged. The narrator then adds: "It was  at the funeral that out of the blue, Mao mentioned Deng  Xiaoping, who was then toiling in a shabby workshop in the  suburbs of Nanchang, Jiangxi."    Then, as the video shows historical footage of Deng's  reappearance on the political scene on various occasions, the  narrator comments: "On the evening of 12 April 1973 the late  Premier Zhou Enlai hosted a banquet for Prince Sihanouk of  Cambodia at the Great Hall of the People. At the banquet,  people saw a familiar face who had not been seen in public for a  long time. Deng Xiaoping sat quietly as the curious eyes of  several hundreds people focused on him. Before the banquet was  over, reporters rushed to the post office to dispatch the news:  Deng Xiaoping has been rehabilitated. At the 10th CPC National  Congress in August 1973, Deng Xiaoping was included in the  Central Committee. In December the same year at a Political  Bureau meeting, Mao proposed Deng be made a Political Bureau  member and chief of the general staff of the Chinese People's  Liberation Army (PLA). In a speech at a Political Bureau  meeting, Mao said earnestly: `It was wrong that I took Lin  Biao's biased views on several occasions; I should conduct self-  criticism in front of comrades.' In October 1974 Mao again  proposed Deng take up the post of first vice premier of the  State Council. In January 1975, Deng was appointed vice chairman  of the CPC Central Committee's Military Commission and  concurrently chief of the general staff of the PLA; he was also  elected vice chairman of the CPC Central Committee in charge of  its day-to-day work. Mao placed high expectations on Deng, and  praised him as a rare talent with a strong political  orientation."    While the video shows more historical footage of Mao and  Deng, the narrator continues: "Mao praised Deng time and again.  As early as 1957, when Mao was visiting the Soviet Union, he  told Khrushchev: `Did you see that short guy over there? He is  extremely smart and has great potential for growth.' Mao added:  `This man observes principle and at the same time has  flexibility; he is a rare talent.' At a Political Bureau  meeting in December 1973, again Mao said: `Deng handles affairs  in a decisive manner. He is firm but gentle, like a needle  hidden inside cotton. Outwardly he is amiable, but inwardly his  mind is as strong as steel.'"    The narrator continues: "While appraising Deng positively,  Mao always paid keen attention to the domestic economy. On the  eve of the Fourth National People's Congress session in 1974,  Mao repeatedly emphasized: `The Cultural Revolution has been  going on for eight years; it is better to have stability now.'  He also pointed out the need to push the national economy  forward. In line with Mao's guidelines, Deng, exerting great  efforts to open up a new situation in economic construction,  launched a comprehensive drive to overhaul work in industry,  agriculture, communications, science and technology, military  affairs, literature and art, education, and public health."    As the video shows more historical footage of Mao and Deng  on  various occasions, the narrator continues: "Mao rendered support  for Deng's work, and repeatedly criticized the interference of  the Gang of Four. At a Central Political Bureau meeting on 17  July 1974, Mao used the term four-member faction for the first  time, and declared: `Jiang Qing does not represent me, but  herself.' During a talk with Deng in Changsha in October 1974,  Mao gave explicit support for Deng's fight against the  unreasonable troublemaking of Jiang Qing and her clique, and at  a Central Political Bureau meeting said: `It is good that you  have set up a steel company; I back you up.' Soon afterward,  Mao more incisively pointed out: `Jiang Qing has ambitions; she  wishes to make Wang Hongwen the chairman of the National  People's Congress Standing Committee and herself party  chairman.' By and large, however, Mao wanted to uphold the  theory and practice of the Cultural Revolution and, therefore,  could not understand and solve the problem of the Gang of Four  once and for all. Neither could he tolerate the drive to  overhaul work on all fronts launched by Deng in 1975, which  inevitably developed into a systematic repudiation of the  Cultural Revolution's left-leaning mistakes. In November 1975,  Mao made an erroneous decision to criticize Deng and  counterattack the right-leaning tendency to reverse the verdict."    As the video cuts to show historical footage of Mao holding  Hua Guofeng's hands, the narrator continues: "On 15 June 1976,  when Mao was gravely ill, he told Hua Guofeng and others about  his life. He said: `I did two things in my life: One was the  decades-long fight against Chiang Kai-shek, which resulted in  his exile to the islands; and the other was the Cultural  Revolution, which was supported by a few but opposed by many  people.' In 1976 -- the year of the dragon -- at a crucial  moment in China's future destiny, on his sickbed Mao did not  hand over power to the Gang of Four. China owes what it is  today to Mao's important decision at the time."    Then, highlighting Mao's efforts to preserve his image  abroad  as a jovial man with a sense of humor, video shows historical  footage of Mao's meetings with Kissinger and Nixon, and Kaunda  of Zambia, as well as interviews with them reminiscing about  their encounters with Mao. Video then shows an interview with  famed ophthalmologist Tang Youzhi recounting an operation he  performed on Mao in 1975 to remove a cataract, and with an  attendant describing Mao's final hours on his sickbed.    After the video shows footage of Mao laying in state and  grief- stricken people congregating in Beijing on the day he  died, the documentary concludes at 1300 GMT with an on-screen  postscript reading: "Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and  a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theorist. It  is true that he made gross mistakes during the `Cultural  Revolution,' but, if we judge his activities as a whole, his  contributions to the Chinese Revolution far outweigh his  mistakes. His merits are primary.... -- Excerpted from the  `Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party  Since the Founding of the PRC.'"</p>

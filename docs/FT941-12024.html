			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmers' Viewpoint): Subsidised salmon puts Scots on the rocks - Efficient sea loch producers cannot compete with cut-price Norwegian supplies Flying conditions were near perfect. A few high cumulus clouds skittered across a blue sky, occasionally obscuring the sun. While stags and hinds grazing on tufts of ground vegetation protruding above snow-covered high moors glanced incuriously up at the helicopter as we passed over. White mountain hares, almost invisible in their pure white environment, frolicked beneath us. Flocks of sheep dotted the lower hills as they searched for sustenance among the heather. It would have been all too easy just to sit back and enjoy the view. But this was strictly business. I was flying to western Scotland on my way to look at the Atlantic salmon farming industry; controlled mainly by a small number of big businesses but which employs, directly or indirectly, some 6,000 people. As the helicopter came into land beside a sea loch on the east coast of the Isle of Skye I saw a bank of steel cages moored a hundred or so metres from the shore. Each 16m-square cage, I was told, contained 14,000 salmon and as I watched some of the ten men who worked at the salmon farm scattered pellets of high protein feed across the water. As each scoopful hit the surface the water boiled briefly as the shiny, hungry fish took as many pellets as possible before they sank towards the bottom. Few if any pellets are wasted, I was assured. Indeed the salmon have an incredible conversion rate, of feed into meat, which can be better than one to one - a ratio which is, of course, helped by the fact that the fish also ingest water. There could be little doubt that this was an efficient industry conducted among some of the most spectacular scenery in Britain. But it was not happy one. For although the 90 or so Atlantic salmon farmers in Scotland, operating between them some 250 sites, claim to have a significant lead over their competitors in terms of production efficiency and costs, they cannot, they say, compete with the dumping of salmon at prices well below the cost of anybody's production. The guilty party is Norway, where the 600 or so salmon farming companies have virtually doubled their production to about 220,000 tonnes a year since 1989, without any regard to the level of demand. Scottish production over the same period has also increased, but by a more modest 25 per cent to about 50,000 tonnes. Norway's expansion, the Scottish farmers allege, has been subsidised by the Norwegian government and by the writing off of bank debt to the tune of some Pounds 150m. Meanwhile, and this is the real problem, excessive supplies have caused the price of salmon on European wholesale markets virtually to halve over four years and are now causing the UK salmon farming industry to lose about Pounds 1m of revenue a week. Needless to say the Scottish Salmon Farmers' Organisation has made representations to the European Union and the British government. These resulted last November in the introduction of a minimum import price for salmon coming into the EU. But at only Pounds 2.64 a kilogram it was, Scottish salmon farmers say, still well below the cost of production. Furthermore, by setting such a low minimum import price the EU dragged down the price in France, previously a lucrative market, to that level. There have been recent debates on the crisis in both UK houses of parliament, so far without much effect. Salmon farmers are beginning to wonder if government reluctance to help has anything to do with the fact that there are few Conservative MPs in Scotland and none in the areas where salmon farms are situated. Meanwhile the salmon industry itself has come up with a proposal to try to deal with the overproduction - a proposal which, it is claimed, has the blessing of the European Commission. If approved by all parties, it would operate through the recently-formed European Salmon Industry Forum, which would appointed consultants to advise on the appropriate number of young salmon (smolts) that should be 'put to sea' - that is, into the loch cages for feeding and finishing each year. Each producing country would form a producers' organisation whose job it would be to ensure that its members followed the ruling to expand or contract production and to police the scheme by appointing and funding inspectors. Even if an individual salmon farmer did not join he could still be subject to the ruling through an EC-approved device entitled 'extension of discipline'. Clearly it would be vital that all Atlantic-farmed salmon producing countries participated and informed opinion suggests that Norway would join the scheme. For the moment, however, the UK government seems reluctant to give the go ahead for something that would cost it nothing but could bring some stability to a high risk industry and save the jobs of thousands of people who have few other employment opportunities. Scottish salmon farmers cannot understand the reason why.</p>

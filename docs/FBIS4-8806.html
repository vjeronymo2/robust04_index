			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 16 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic has proposed on the basis of today's  consultations that top-ranking Bosnian Serb Republic officials,  as well as representatives of the United Nations and of those  nations that are expected to help, should meet and discuss ways  to define the security zone around Gorazde.    Milosevic said in a statement for the press following a two  and a half-hour talk with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, who unexpectedly arrived in Belgrade this evening, that  the meeting on Gorazde would be held tomorrow morning and that  the boundaries of the security zone would be determined in  accordance with conclusions reached by a mixed commission  composed of the representatives of the Bosnian Serbs, the  Muslims, and the UN.    Milosevic assessed this evening's talks with Kozyrev as very  open. According to him, the talks were devoted to key issues  pertaining to the crisis in the region, with special emphasis on  the events in Bosnia.    "I am pleased that we have very close, I would say  identical,  views on many aspects of this question," the Serbian president  stressed.    Speaking about the situation in Bosnia, Milosevic said: "The  peace process in Bosnia is at a critical point, from where it  could very easily escalate into war, but it could also very  easily shift towards a final peace."    "We believe that solutions involving small steps and the  extinguishing of small fires is not a solution for Bosnia",  Milosevic said, and added: "If things are tackled in this way we  will constantly have a crisis in which only the geographical  name would change, and the war would in this case be difficult  to stop."    According to Milosevic, the best solution for the Bosnian  conflict would be to reach a comprehensive agreement on the  cessation of all hostilities on the entire territory of Bosnia-  Herzegovina as soon as possible, without prejudging a political  solution, and then to negotiate a final settlement in conditions  of peace.    "I am very pleased to note that Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev shares our view that the issue of sanctions is  directly linked to the establishment of peace in Bosnia and that  Russia has a very objective and constructive approach in this  regard," Milosevic said.    Speaking about Gorazde, Milosevic said that the problem of  that city should be resolved in conformity with the same  principles that govern the global implementation of the project.    "The Muslim side has avoided defining the border of the  security zone and has from this area launched a big -- as they  called it -- spring offensive. Later a very complicated  situation came about after the collapse of this offensive and  the successful counterattack by Serb forces, but also after the  unfortunate intervention from the air. This has undoubtedly put  back the peace process and to a certain extent compromised the  behavior of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]."    Milosevic said that defining the borders of the safe zone  of Gorazde would create the conditions for things to cool off  there, and that this would be the "extinguishing of a very  difficult and tragic hot spot, but in the context of a general  agreement on a cease-fire throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina."    "We will invest all our political influence to see that this  is achieved and we hope that we will are successful in this,"  Milosevic said.    Kozyrev agreed with Milosevic that the talks were very  constructive and said he was leaving Belgrade "much more  convinced that we shall achieve progress in the peace process."    Kozyrev underlined in a talk with reporters that President  Milosevic was involved in the efforts to revive the peace talks  and added: "I am an optimist in this respect."    Speaking about ways to resolve the Bosnian conflict, Kozyrev  said that the European Union's plan remains on the table and  that the United States, Russia, and the European Union were  endeavoring to achieve peace on the basis of it.    The Russian foreign minister confirmed that there had also  been discussion this evening of the sanctions and said: "We  considered the question of sanctions, and Ambassador Churkin  prior to this set out the Russian Federation's standpoint on  this. If we are partners in the peace process with the European  Union and the United States, this partnership must be in the  determining of the borders, as well as in relation to the  question of the suspension of sanctions. The Russian standpoint  must be considered both in the European Union and in the United  States. The road to peace is the road to the lifting of  sanctions".    At the end, Kozyrev advocated that UNPROFOR representatives  be sent to Gorazde and that the blockade of the Blue Helmets  should be lifted "wherever and however they are being held."  Thus, he said, the intervention from the air has proved to be  ineffectual.    During this evening's talks, it was assessed that the NATO  air strikes against Serb positions on 10 and 11 April caused an  exacerbation of the situation and brought into question the  efforts to establish a full cessation of hostilities in this  area. In this context, note was made in particular of the  danger of such acts undermining the peace efforts directed  towards the normalization of the situation and the creation of  the necessary conditions for the resumption of the negotiating  process. In this, Russia was directly and actively involved  and, in the assessment of President Milosevic, participated in a  constructive way.    Taking into account that the peace process has found itself  at a point where an escalation of the war and the establishment  of peace were equally possible, Milosevic and Kozyrev agreed  that forces should be joined in order to achive peace. It was  noted that peace was undoubtedly in everybody's interest and  that the only road to the establishment of a final peace in  these regions led through the cessation of all hostilities.    Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic expressed his  conviction  that Russia's peace initiative and the efforts made to implement  an overall cessation of hostilities would prevail over the war  option, and that the United Nations bore the responsibility to  exercise an unbiased approach to all the sides in the conflict.    This evening's talks were also attended by Russian  Ambassador  in Belgrade Gennadiy Shikin.</p>

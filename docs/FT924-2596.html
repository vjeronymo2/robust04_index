			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Fuller Smith hit by recessionary trends - Three drinks companies report varying levels of profits growth FULLER SMITH &amp; Turner, the USM-quoted brewer, yesterday said that its profits had been 'severely affected by the ongoing recession.' On turnover ahead 7 per cent to Pounds 40.9m, pre-tax profits for the six months to September 26 improved just 4 per cent, from Pounds 3.61m to Pounds 3.76m. Once again, a strong performance in the free trade - draught ale volume increased by 39 per cent - was offset by reduced sales in its own estate and lower profits from the hotels and wine sides. Overall beer volumes increased by 8 per cent representing a 'significant increase in market share' according to Mr Anthony Fuller, chairman. Of the company's three cask-conditioned ales, London Pride increased volumes by 23 per cent, while Chiswick Bitter rose 12 per cent and the premium ESB by 8.5 per cent. Exports jumped 38 per cent with the US proving particularly successful. The Chiswick brewery was currently operating at record levels. Mr Michael Turner, managing director, said the installation of new mash tuns, due to be completed next summer, would increase capacity to 160,000 barrels a year. The hotels operation suffered from increased competition in the Heathrow area which depressed the average room rate. Profits in the expanding wine side dipped 13 per cent. Earnings declined to 10.13p (11.62p) reflecting the return to a normal tax charge after a one-off credit last time. The interim dividend is 2.4p (2.25p).</p>

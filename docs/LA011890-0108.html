			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO P.V. COUNCIL OUSTS CHIEF OF THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION  </P> <P> In yet another example of the bitter infighting among Rancho Palos Verdes  council members, the council Tuesday ousted Planning Commissioner Luella Wike  from her post. Wike's second four-year term on the commission would have  expired in 1991.  </P> <P> The three council members who opposed Wike did not elaborate on why they wanted  her off the commission. Before the meeting, Mayor Mel Hughes said only that he  believed Wike's performance was not "in the best interests of the city." During  the meeting, Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach accused Wike of being a "little bit  overzealous" as a commissioner.  </P> <P> Councilman John McTaggart, however, called Wike's ouster "another example of  power politics in Rancho Palos Verdes" by the council majority.  </P> <P> Wike, who was chairwoman of the commission, did not attend the meeting and  could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> Commissioners serve at the pleasure of the City Council. They decide  development and zoning matters, but their decisions can be overturned by the  council.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the council needed to fill three vacancies on the five-member  Planning Commission. It first voted to force Wike and the commission's only  other incumbent, Peter Von Hagen, to resign so the council could cast new  ballots for all five commission members. McTaggart cast the only vote against  the motion.  </P> <P> After the motion passed, Wike failed to receive enough votes to regain her seat  when the council majority, made up of Hughes, Bacharach and Doug Hinchliffe,  did not cast ballots for her.  </P> <P> Von Hagen regained his seat, although council allies McTaggart and Bob Ryan did  not cast their ballots for him.  </P> <P> McTaggart and Ryan are frequently at odds with the council majority over  development issues, which have come to dominate local political debate. The  fate of at least five major building proposals, including two large hotels, is  expected to be decided this year by planning commissioners and council members.  </P> <P> In past months, Ryan has accused Von Hagen, a developer, of attempting to  influence city officials on a residential project. Von Hagen acted as the  landowner's agent for the project.  </P> <P> Von Hagen, who abstained from voting on the project, has denied any wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Besides Von Hagen, the council voted to appoint Susan Brooks and Charles  Hotchkiss to regular four-year terms on the commission. Both have been serving  in an interim capacity for the last six months.  </P> <P> The council also reappointed Robert McNulty, whose second term on the  commission expired in December, and appointed new member Robert Katherman.  </P></p>

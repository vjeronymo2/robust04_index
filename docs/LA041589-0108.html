			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPANY FINED OVER WASTE WATER CHARGE  </P> <P> The Arrowhead Industrial Water company was fined $500,000 Friday after pleading  no contest to illegally discharging hazardous levels of acidic waste water into  the Los Angeles sewer system.  </P> <P> The company's operations manager, Ray Lamoureux, also pleaded no contest to the  charge and was sentenced by Superior Court Judge David Horowitz to one year of  probation and fined $5,000.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office said the case against Arrowhead -- which treats  waste water from other industries at a plant south of downtown Los Angeles --  arose from an investigation that began in April, 1988, when the city's  Sanitation Bureau received information that led to monitoring of the company's  sewer discharges. A short time later, the city Board of Public Works found the  company in violation of its permit and sealed the firm's sewer connections for  60 days.  </P> <P> Arrowhead later instituted around-the-clock monitoring of its waste-water  discharge and also made a substantial investment to prevent future violations,  prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Arrowhead Industrial Water also paid a $500,000 fine after it was convicted of  illegally disposing of hazardous waste in city sewers in 1985.  </P></p>

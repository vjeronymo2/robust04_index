			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Equity scheme balances interests in insolvencies Sir, The recent consultative document published by the Department of Trade and Industry's insolvency service has raised the general question of how best to rescue financially distressed companies. While we welcome the idea of improving the rules governing administration and company voluntary arrangements, we think there is a fundamental problem with current procedures that no amount of tinkering will solve. Current procedures mix the decision of what should happen to an insolvent company with the decision of who should get what. This creates conflicts of interest. Senior/ secured creditors typically favour early liquidation, since they bear most of the costs from trying to reorganise the company, but enjoy few of the gains. Conversely, junior creditors typically push for reorganisation as they get little from liquidation. This conflict of interest makes it difficult to agree on a rescue plan. As a result, good companies can be needlessly shut down and some bad companies may be allowed to struggle on for too long. There is a way to avoid conflict among creditors. In an appendix of the DTI document, we propose a scheme whereby debt claims are converted into equity. The decision about whether to reorganise or liquidate is then put to a vote. The merit of our scheme is that all claimants, now that they are shareholders, have a common interest in voting for the efficient outcome. We urge the government and interested parties to think more adventurously about the reform of insolvency law. We believe our scheme is practical, cheap, and strikes the right balance between rescuing good firms and weeding out bad ones.

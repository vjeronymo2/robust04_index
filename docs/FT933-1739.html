			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: IBM on offensive against Intel INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday launched the initial volley in an offensive to crack Intel's grip on the market for microprocessors used in personal computers, writes Frank McGurty. IBM has introduced a line of computers equipped with a new generation of microprocessor, known as the PowerPC, developed over the past two years in collaboration with Motorola and Apple Computer. The company hopes that the PowerPC, which adapts IBM's existing RS/6000 technology for use in 'a desktop personal computing environment', will eventually displace Intel's microprocessors as the industry standard. In what may prove a more important step towards that goal, IBM has begun shipping the new chip to outside computer manufacturers, including Groupe Bull of France.</p>

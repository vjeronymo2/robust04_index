			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Beckett may not bridge gender gap the Conservatives' commanding nine-point lead over Labour among women voters  -will not be narrowed instantly by Mrs Margaret Beckett's election to the deputy leadership, an opinion poll showed yesterday. The figures put Mrs Beckett well behind her rivals Mr Bryan Gould and Mr John Prescott when a sample of 1,052 voters was questioned on which politicians were an asset to the Labour party. In the deputy leadership election, Mrs Beckett won the post on the first ballot with a convincing 57 per cent of the votes, in spite of what was widely seen as a lacklustre campaign resting heavily on her gender appeal. Mr Prescott trailed with 28 per cent and Mr Gould scored just 14.6 per cent. In the survey by Harris in The Observer newspaper, however, that order was reversed, with Mr Gould - on 26 points - rated a top asset, followed by Mr Prescott on 25 and with Mrs Beckett well behind on 17. The role to be given to the new deputy leader once the shadow cabinet elections are completed on Thursday is one of the few issues still apparently unresolved in Mr John Smith's camp. Mr Gordon Brown is thought certain to win the shadow chancellorship and Mr Tony Blair is predicted to become home affairs spokesman. Mr Jack Cunningham, provided he wins a high enough vote, is expected to replace the outgoing Mr Gerald Kaufman as shadow foreign secretary. Mr Robin Cook, campaign manager for Mr Smith, is marked down to shadow Mr Michael Heseltine at trade and industry, though he has also been mentioned as a possible foreign affairs spokesman. Mrs Beckett is most often mentioned as either shadow leader of the house, with additional party organisation and campaigning responsibilities, or as shadow education secretary. She is seen as highly competent for a departmental brief, making the latter post the more probable. Mr Bryan Gould, defeated candidate in both leadership contests, is reported to want the foreign affairs job but is more likely to be given a lesser post, possibly shadowing Mr William Waldegrave's Citizen's Charter activities. All the appointments, expected to be announced on Friday, are dependent upon performance in the highly unpredictable shadow cabinet ballot, in which the 270 Labour MPs are voting for a record field of 51 candidates chasing 18 places. Those thought most vulnerable among the present team include Ms Jo Richardson, the voice on women's rights, Mr Barry Jones, Welsh affairs, and Mr Jack Straw at education. Those candidates widely tipped to win places are Ms Harriet Harman, Ms Mo Mowlam, Ms Hilary Armstrong and Mr David Blunkett.</p>

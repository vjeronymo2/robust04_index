			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / GPA must raise Dollars 250m in a week GPA GROUP, the troubled aircraft leasing company, needs to raise Dollars 250m (Pounds 162m) within a week before its rescue deal with GE Capital can go ahead. While the company's core lenders yesterday welcomed the last-minute agreement with General Electric's financial services arm, they said GPA needed to overcome a number of hurdles. GPA yesterday told its bondholders, in a meeting in New York, that its board would decide by Monday whether it would be able to close the deal with GE Capital, enabling it to finance bond payments due over May and June. GE Capital has yet to agree what price it will pay for its option to take a 65 per cent stake in the group, which could rise to 80 per cent by the end of March 1997. However, it may insist that the banks write off at least 20 per cent of their Dollars 3bn borrowings as part of any deal to take a controlling stake. In the next few days the group's key lenders will be asked to provide Dollars 100m as a bridging loan to help finance the bond payments. Some existing shareholders will also be asked to provide a further Dollars 150m. The total of Dollars 250m must be found before May 17, when the first Dollars 50m of bond payments are due. GPA's 138 banks will also have to provide further waivers of breaches on its banking covenants until the end of June. While most lenders are expected to agree, the group is not taking any bank for granted given that four have still not agreed to the restructuring of GPA's Dollars 5.5bn of borrowings. The group also requires a waiver over the same period from the holders of a Japanese club loan, worth Dollars 150m, with further extentions needed later in the year. Harris Investment Management, a subsidiary of the Chicago-based Harris Banking Corp, must waive its Dollars 45m put option. GPA has warned its banks that the combined cost of restructuring, lost deposits from aircraft manufacturers and falling aircraft values will lead to provisions which could be Dollars 500m. GE Capital has agreed in principle to buy Dollars 1.35bn worth of aircraft from GPA. The group's bondholders are being advised by Blackstone Group, the US investment bank which specialises in company restructuring, and lawyers Wachtell, Lipton. Lazard Freres stepped down from advising bondholders because it was trading the bonds. The refinancing, Page 20</p>

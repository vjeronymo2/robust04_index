			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Working Party recommends guidelines for formatting of interim accounts THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board should establish guidelines for the format of companies' interim accounts, a working party led by accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand has recommended. In an analysis of existing practice, the working party of accountants and senior business executives concluded that the wide variation in existing practices needs to be narrowed. The details, in a report published yesterday, come when the Cadbury committee on corporate governance is increasingly demanding greater interim information. The study shows that while all FTSE-100 companies include a chairman's report in their interims, only half include balance sheet information and a fifth show cashflow details. Just 17 per cent of these statements include accounting policy information. From a sample of 168 smaller companies, only a quarter provide a balance sheet and just 2 per cent a cashflow statement. Only about 77 per cent - against 81 per cent for FTSE-100 companies - produce any notes to the financial statements. The working party says the time permitted between the end of the company's half-year and publication of the results should be cut from four months to two. It also argues for limited balance sheet and cashflow information, saying that it would save costs and be quicker to produce. Reporting by Companies on Interim Results. 0800 289520. Pounds 25.</p>

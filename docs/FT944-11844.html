			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Singapore ministers to get big pay rises Singapore's parliament agreed yesterday that ministers and civil servants, already among the world's highest paid, will get hefty pay rises to make their salaries more competitive with the private sector, Reuter reports from Singapore. Parliament backed government proposals by 61-6 for salary rises starting in mid-1995 aimed at keeping and attracting the island state's top talent. The government was setting out to change the perception of a job in civil administration to one of the top earning professions, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong told parliament. But Mr Goh, who earns nearly SDollars 96,000 (Pounds 40,00) a month, said he would exempt his own salary from the pay rise, giving him 'the moral authority to make a case for the civil service and future ministers'. His pay would be reviewed by an independent panel. Under the changes, a minister's pay will be set at two-thirds the average earnings of the four highest earners in six top-paying private professions. Senior civil servants' pay will also be based on earnings in the six professions. At present ministers earn SDollars 48,900 a month while the average salary of a senior civil servant is SDollars 13,000 a month.</p>

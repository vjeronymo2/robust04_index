			<p>BFN     [Text] Abdirahman Ahmed Ali, the chairman of the Somali  National Movement, SNM, has issued in Addis Ababa a press  statement in which SNM has clarified its readiness to  participate in future conferences held by Somali organizations.  Mr. Abdirahman said that the SNM delegation, led by himself,  and the Somali National Alliance [SNA] delegation, led by  Chairman Mohamed Farah Aidid, met in Addis Ababa between 25-29  April this year, and discussed various issues -- including  current efforts to reconcile the Somalis, the settlement of any  unresolved problems, and the search for a solution that is  satisfactory to all parties, which will bring the crisis to an  end and prevent the further destruction of the Somali people.    In conclusion, the SNM chairman and his delegation thanked  the chairman and the SNA delegation for their tireless efforts,  the value that Mr. Aidid places on the role of the SNM, and his  constant invitations to talks concerning the reconciliation of  Somali people. The SNM has issued the following clarifications  in connection with the present situation in Somalia.    1. The experience gained during the last three years clearly  shows that the path followed by the Somali people, whether in  the north or south of the country, toward settling the  differences which emerged from the struggle against the  dictatorial regime of Siad Barre, have so far not achieved the  goal of stability or created a government that is better than  the former one for Somali people.    2. In looking at these issues, we should have realized that  the Somali people cannot continue along a path that leads to  national suicide or to a failure to create a reliable government  or mini- states.    3. The international community has tried to help the Somali  people in every way and assist them toward finding a way out of  the current intolerable situation, but so far nothing has  succeeded, and the international community has acknowledged that  it should leave the Somali people to choose either a resolution  of their differences or a reversion back to a primitive era,  where they are unable to maintain sovereignty or government.    4. It is therefore indispensible that Somali organizations  meet soon and realisticaly work together toward finding a middle  ground for compromise, so as to save the Somali nation and  people from ruin.    5. In considering the Somaliland situation in the north, Mr.  Abdirahman said the time had come when people should realize  that the international community does not accept the path so far  pursued by Somaliland toward recognition. The international  community has clarified that it is up to Somalis to decide  whether they will remain as one country or disintegrate into  smaller different countries. Mr. Abdirahman Ahmed Ali said that  Somali people living in the north and south of the country  should sit down together and settle (?differences) through the  wishes and rights of the people of the north and decide whether  they will secede or will strengthen the unity and brotherhood of  Somali people.    6. At the time the Siad Barre regime was toppled in 1991,  the  SNM had succeeded in creating peace and reconciliation among  those communities belonging to the SNM as well as with others in  the north. During the last several months the SNM has  established contact and understanding between the SNM and other  political organizations in the north. He said the SNM is now  ready to make official contacts.    7. It is important that these issues be dealt with directly  and that further talks take place among the various Somali  groups, so as to arrive at a tangible solution to the  differences and misunderstandings that have so far deprived the  Somali people of a stable, tangible government. He said that  the SNM will participate in all future Somali reconciliation  conferences, as it has done before.    8. The SNM will adopt a position of neutrality concerning  differences among the various groups, and will strive to narrow  these differences in the best way, while eliminating mistrust.    9. After the SNM carries out its internal consultations and  after it consults with communities outside the SNM and other  political organizations, it will present a proposal based on a  Federal Government, with every state having regional autonomy.</p>

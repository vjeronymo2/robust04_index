			<p>BFN     [Text] We have received a resolution on subjecting the  State Security Service to parliament, and Igor Giorgadze has  been confirmed head of the State Security Service. Here is an  interview with Igor Giorgadze:    [Begin Giorgadze recording] If we are talking about Georgian  traditions, then I must say that we have little tradition within  the security service. We used to have a security service that  was built on Soviet traditions. We shall retain the good  features of that tradition and, in fact, we have already done  so. The bad features that the society rejected will not be  implemented.    As for today's confirmation, of course the factor of trust  is  worth congratulating, but with this confirmation we have not  gained anything other than a burden. We must work for the  welfare of our motherland. The security service has major  problems to tackle. People are looking at this service with hope  and we must not shatter our peoples' hopes.

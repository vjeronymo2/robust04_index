			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yokohama, March 14 KYODO -- Health and Welfare  Minister Keigo Ouchi joined the campaign to promote foreign rice  on Monday [14 March] by declaring his satisfaction that  inspectors at a Yokohama quarantine center have found nothing  dangerous in imported rice.    At the end of a 30-minute tour of the center, Ouchi said he  had told the Diet there is no cause for concern over chemical  residue in imported rice, and that his own tour of the center  had satisfied him that he had seen "an internationally high  standard of surveillance."    Ouchi said he was relieved to be told at the center that  staff have "not yet found anything dangerous" in the rice they  have inspected.    Ouchi also said he is grateful to staff at the center for  working weekends to clear a backlog of imported rice.</p>

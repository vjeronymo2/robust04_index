			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2's foreign affairs series, Assignment (7.45), visits the US to see how some of the mis-applied principles of the 1960s generation (discrimination with the word 'positive' stuck on the front, etc) have resulted in resentment and accusations of censorship. The third episode of Channel 4's engrossing series about England's Civil War (8.00), concentrates on the actual fighting at such battles as Edgehill and Naseby. In the final episode of BBC1's series about a doubtful solicitor, Kinsey, (9.30) many ends are tied: the runaway partner, Haynes, is rushed to a Portuguese hospital, and Kinsey has to face up to his old emotional involvement with Haynes' wife, Beth. But for true accounts of sexual agonies, watch A Secret World Of Sex (9.50 BBC2) because today's episode in this documentary series about sexual mores in pre-Second World War England is the best of the lot. It tells of five women who had illegitimate babies between the first and second world wars. Sex is also the subject of First Tuesday (10.40 ITV) which deals with the abuse of young schoolboys. The boys and their parents speak in what is described as 'an unprecedented set of interviews'.</p>

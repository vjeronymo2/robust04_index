			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Tregubova report in the "Position" column: "PRES </F> Will Vote To Amnesty Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. Not Because They  Are Innocent, But for the Sake of National Concord"]    [Text] The Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES]  faction has decided to support a draft resolution on amnesty  which is to be discussed in today's session of the Duma. As  PRES leaders noted at a faction conference, this draft envisions  in particular amnesty for convicts and defendants under article  79 of the Penal Code -- "organization of mass disturbances," and  if it is adopted, the ringleaders of the October rebellion will  be set free. "But our faction will vote in favor, explaining  that this is not recognition of their innocence but an act of  national conciliation, and we say that after leaving prison, the  organizers of the October disorders must not start everything  all over again," Sergey Shakhray said. True, the PRES leader  admitted that there are no guarantees that when Rutskoy and  Khasbulatov are released, unrest will not begin again.  Moreover, Shakhray said that this course of events is "very,  very likely." His faction colleague Sergey Stankevich recalled  that convicted under Article 79 were also those who organized  riots in penal colonies or took hostages, outlining in this  connection the "nice" prospects for Russia in the event that  such "a humane action of total amnesty is undertaken."    Yet the doubts of Sergey Shakhray's comrades were dispelled  by his "right-hand man," Konstantin Zatulin, who said, "If we do  not support the draft, we shall be accused of being enemies of  the people, seeking to keep Khasbulatov and Rutskoy in prison  forever...." Furthermore Mr. Zatulin, saying that "part of the  blame" for the October riots lies on the executive branch,  assured that the ex-speaker and the ex-vice president "must not  be amnestied but completely rehabilitated in their rights, based  on investigation results." Therefore that part of the PRES  representing Konstantin Zatulin's followers will apparently  support the Communist Party, the Agrarian Party, the Liberal  Democratic Party, and the Yavlinskiy bloc, which are planning to  set up "a deputies commission to investigate the 3-4 October  events," which issue will also be discussed in the Duma today.    To "emphasize the faction's commitment to the principles of  national conciliation" the PRES members agreed on voting day to  circulate a corresponding "clarification document" in the Duma."  "Maybe Baburin and others will vote in favor simply because they  want to see Khasbulatov and Rutskoy at large, but we shall vote  for this for other motives," Sergey Stankevich summed up the  PRES' position.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nestle says Perrier fight may end in a few weeks NESTLE, the Swiss foods group, said its bitter takeover battle with Italy's Agnelli family for Source Perrier, the French mineral water and cheese group, could be resolved within the next few weeks. 'Now that the legal situation has been cleared and that some signals have come from the other side, I would not exclude that the resolution of this matter could well happen in the next few weeks,' a Nestle spokesman said yesterday. He was responding to a newspaper report quoting an Agnelli official as saying: 'We have seen where the political will lies in France, and there is not much point in fighting that.' The Nestle spokesman said this was one of many indications that the Agnelli camp was thinking that the time had come to change their approach. In late January, Nestle, the world's largest food group, bid FFr1,475 per share for Perrier, valuing the company at FFr13.42bn (Dollars 2.36bn). The bid countered an attempt by Agnelli companies to gain control of Perrier indirectly by buying companies that held large blocks of Perrier shares. Since then, Nestle has won court battles in France aimed at obstructing the Agnelli approach. Also, the French stock market authorities have ruled that the Agnelli group must make an offer to all Perrier shareholders, not just to a few. Meanwhile, Nestle reported yesterday that its consolidated net profit rose 8.7 per cent last year to SFr2.47bn on sales up 8.9 per cent to SFr50.5bn. The directors have recommended a dividend increase to SFr215 from SFr200 per share, and to SFr43 from SFr40 per bearer participation certificate. The group said that in spite of worsening economic conditions in many countries, sales volume grew by 4 per cent. The trading margin showed a slight improvement to 10.1 per cent. The results were close to analysts' expectations in most respects, but there was apparently disappointment that the group did not announce plans to split its shares. That, according to one Zurich analyst, was the reason the bearer shares jumped SFr100 on the statement to SFr9,620, but then settled back almost immediately to SFr9,550. Nestle said it intended to split its bearer and registered shares, 10 for one, as soon as possible. A Swiss law permitting such a change comes into effect on July 1, but the group was still clarifying the process it had to follow to comply with the law. No decision had been reached on converting the participation certificates into shares or on consolidating the capital into a single class of shares. The group said neither issue was urgent now that there was no difference in the rights attaching to its two classes of shares. Mr Ramon Masip, executive vice-president and head of the regional management for Europe, was promoted to president of the general management group in the food sector. However, Mr Helmut Maucher, remains chairman and chief executive officer. Mr Maucher, who is 64, has made clear that he has no plans to retire. Lex, Page 24</p>

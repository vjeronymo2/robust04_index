For details, we approached Petru Ianc, state secretary and  chief of the Metallurgical Industry Department.    [Maier] What are the social implications of your  department's restructuring policy?    [Ianc] More than 145,000 people are currently working in  metallurgy in various activities: Transportation, the actual  production process, repair and maintenance, and research and  design. In the West, in countries with market economies, when  people refer to metallurgy they actually mean the basic  structure: Raw material storage, iron and steel works, rolling  mills, and storage for finished products. Other, complementary  activities are organized in a separate system of services, which  are paid for. This delimitation between the basic activity and  complementary activities would mean to shift down from 145,000  employees to some 80,000. Thus, it would not mean a cut in  personnel, but simply a separation of activities. Obviously, it  is only natural that this process should continue in each of  these components combined with appropriate measures resulting  from correlating the volume of work with the number of  personnel. This, however, will not have a drastic effect, at  least not for the time being. Given the prospects for  modernizing the production flow, a labor cut from 80,000 to some  40,000 is expected over a period of 10 years. A major part of  this cutback will occur naturally. A further part of employees  will be absorbed by specific ecologically-motivated actions.  Obviously, a retraining program is also needed.    [Maier] As a representative of the ruling center-leftist  party, do you believe the Vacaroiu government will look  favorably on the program you propose?    [Ianc] I think it will be supported by the current  government. And I also think that this program should not only  be supported by a leftist government, but by any government in  power over these 10 years. That is what has happened in all  countries in the world, both in those with a leftist government  such as France and in countries with center or center-rightist  governments such as Britian. Social problems are the focus of  the current government and must be the focus of any government.</p>

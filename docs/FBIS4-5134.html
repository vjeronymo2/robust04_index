			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A New Political Trend"] </F>   [Text] Golkar [Functional Group], the government-backed  political entity, has been witnessing a number of tempests in  its teacup recently. Many Golkar functionaries in the provinces  have resorted to acts of defiance in the election of local  regents by rejecting the candidates backed by its central board  or the central government.    These acts within the Golkar rank and file in the provinces  which have come to be dubbed "undercurrents", have been so  frequent that many observers view them as positive phenomena in  the development of the country's political system.    Although in nearly all of the cases, Golkar's local  politicians lost the cause, the inspiring aspect of their  rejection of directives is that they now have the boldness to  say "no" in situations in which they would previously have  responded with total passivity. Every citizen here -- outside  and inside the ruling political organization -- is quite aware  that Golkar leaders are supposed to toe the government line.    Most observers would probably agree that although provincial  politicians might have been a bit extreme in expressing their  views, the central government has not been totally right in its  aggressive effort to make local legislators accept its  candidates. Minister of Home Affairs Yogi S. Memet withdrew his  gubernatorial candidate for Central Kalimantan after the latter  won local election but was subsequently widely opposed by the  local leaders.    However, President Suharto refuses to recognize the  existence  of a trend. The head of state, in his capacity as chief patron  of the Golkar, said in written message to the party leaders on  Monday that there was no such thing as "undercurrents". In his  view, the situation reflects no more than the fact that a few  people claimed to speak on behalf of the masses.    Suharto's notion could be viewed as a call for Golkar  leaders  to set the organization's house in order. It is their internal  problem.    But because the tendency is becoming more popular here now,  the question is whether all political engineering -- which  Suharto said cannot be separated from politics -- has a negative  connotation? To Suharto the tendency toward more vocal local  stances in the Golkar hierarchy might look like old-fashioned  politicking because it does not introduce any positive way of  thinking. But in other places, such as within the Indonesian  Democratic Party (PDI), this type of "political engineering" has  managed to channel the aspirations of the younger generation who  rejected any candidate for the party leadership with a clear  leaning toward the establishment. They believed that this kind  of person would not be able to make the PDI a viable party.    During its congress at the end of last year, many young  leaders of the PDI were of the opinion that the congress must be  able to elect a strong and popular leader who would be able to  put an end to the party's long history of internal squabbles  once and for all. And to achieve this, they should also lend  their ears to the young people, who had become more and more  expressive. The younger ones were making an effort to gain  wider participation within the party, a legal and normal crusade  within a democratic country, where leaders are expected to be  open and wise.    Whether or not President Suharto specifically meant the  recent extra high profile activities among Golkar leaders in the  provinces when he spoke about undercurrents, when looking at the  reasons behind the new tendency we believe that it is not  political engineering but political professionalism which has  begun to gain a foothold. And this can be expected to provide  Golkar with a more colorful political spectrum.</p>

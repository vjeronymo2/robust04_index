			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Strong close follows latest US consumer data - Market Report The London market's nervousness ahead of the announcement of the US consumer price statistics proved unfounded yesterday and share prices ended an uncertain session in good form. Supported by a turnround in bond prices, a premium on stock index futures, and a strong start on Wall Street, the FT-SE 100 Index ended the day 23.3 points up at 3,039.6. Equities opened slowly and were held back at first by weakness in UK gilts as European bond markets backed away ahead of the US consumer price data. The FT-SE 100 fell nearly 12 points in early trade but once again the Footsie 3,000 area brought in support. More significantly, the UK stock market separated itself from gilt-edged stocks, which were at that stage nearly half a point lower at the longer end of the range. Shares rallied quite quickly, and the Footsie loss was translated into a gain of 17 points, before the market settled back to await the US data which came in early afternoon. The London stock market was slow to respond to the improvement in sentiment in the US but extended its gains when transatlantic buyers appeared for British Petroleum. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index moved in direct contrast to the blue chip Index, falling 17.1 to 3,578.7 as a series of individually-structured option contracts in second line shares was believed to have expired yesterday afternoon. Non-Footsie business made up around 58 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total of 709.6m shares. Equity volume increased sharply from the previous session when a mere 483.7m shares traded through the Seaq electronic network and were worth only Pounds 948.5m at retail level. Daily retail volume has rarely dipped below Pounds 1bn ovber the past twelve months. The focus on oil shares reflected market belief that Opec may switch to a more aggressive pricing policy and also that the US ban on exports of oil from Alaska could be lifted soon. However, neither factor influenced Lasmo shares which refused to match the new offer from Enterprise Oil. US investment funds, which hold large stakes in Lasmo, showed no sign of selling stock yesterday after the Lasmo board rejected the latest terms from Enterprise. Traders said that the market had featured substantial technical switching in both bonds and equities, with perhaps as many as six equity trading programmes marching across the trading screens. Several very large overnight deals, when shares sold at the previous market close are rebought the following morning, were believed to be tax-related operations. The renewed volatility in UK securities markets, and in particular in the government bond sector, brought new reports of heavy losses among marketmaking firms, which have to stake their capital on the view taken of the market outlook. The market was bracing itself for the announcement today of important UK economic data. Investors are likely to focus on the average earnings statistics for April. The previous month showed an annualised gain of 4 per cent in average earnings, significantly larger than the markets anticipated. The latest retail price index, the principal measure of domestic inflation will be published at the market opening; and the trading session will close just before Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, delivers an important policy speech in the City of London.</p>

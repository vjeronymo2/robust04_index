			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME RUN BY ARMAS A WINNER  </P> <P> Because he owns the most hamstrung hamstring this side of the Laker backcourt,  36-year-old Tony Armas has spent more time this season as couch potato than as  Angel outfielder.  </P> <P> But, apparently, it was time well spent.  </P> <P> "I watched a lot of TV," Armas said. "I watched a lot of innings and I watched  a lot of pitchers. I tried to pick up the rotation of the ball."  </P> <P> Tuesday night, back on his feet, Armas put such new knowledge to practical use.  Turning on Kevin Brown's slider in the bottom of the ninth inning, Armas drove  it into the left-field seats for a three-run home run, giving the Angels a  dramatic 5-2 victory over the Texas Rangers before 62,390 at Anaheim Stadium,  the largest crowd in the major leagues this season.  </P> <P> Brown had been one of Armas' case studies during his two stints on the disabled  list. He knew Brown was a rookie, a new face on American League mounds, so  Armas figured it might be smart to brush up a bit on him.  </P> <P> "I watched him pitch against Oakland," Armas said. "He's a good pitcher who  throws pretty hard. He's got a good breaking ball, too."  </P> <P> Good enough to strike Armas out with it twice Tuesday evening . . . but not  thrice.  </P> <P> With two out and two runners on base in the ninth inning of a 2-2 tie, Brown  (7-5) started Armas off with another breaking ball, which Armas fouled off.  Then came another, a slider.  </P> <P> Armas drove it over the left-field wall for his sixth home run of the season --  in just 48 at-bats. He has appeared in only 15 games, but in his last seven, he  has hit four home runs and driven in eight runs.  </P> <P> "Tony's definitely a streak hitter," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "He has  been his whole career. But he's the type of hitter who can go on a power  streak. He won't just go one for two, one for three with a blooper.  </P> <P> "He'll make some hard contact and generate some runs for you."  </P> <P> Armas generated three important ones this time after Texas Manager Bobby  Valentine decided to buck recent trends and intentionally walk Chili Davis to  let Brown pitch to Armas. At the time, first base was open with Wally Joyner on  third base.  </P> <P> Valentine's thinking: To play the percentages, get rid of the  left-handed-hitting Davis and set up a confrontation between right-handers.  </P> <P> "There was no other choice," Valentine said. "Sometimes it works and sometimes  it doesn't."  </P> <P> Rader wouldn't comment on the decision -- "I shall remain forever diplomatic,"  he said -- but Armas did his part to absolve Valentine.  </P> <P> "He was supposed to do that," Armas said. "The winning run was on third base  and Chili was hitting left-handed. He'd rather face a right-hander there and I  was 0 for 3 . . . "  </P> <P> Armas also noted that Brown had broken his bat on a seventh-inning pop fly.  </P> <P> "He was throwing great, especially early in the game," Armas said.  </P> <P> But late in the game, the only thing Armas broke was the tie.  </P> <P> Armas' home run was the Angels' 73rd of the season, which leads the American  League. Earlier in the night, Jack Howell added another, his 10th, a two-run  home run in the third inning.  </P> <P> "The surprising thing is, we don't have a guy in the top 10 (in home runs),"  said Rader, who has six players with at least eight home runs and none with  more than 11.  </P> <P> "I think it's inconsequential that we're leading the league, except that it's  nice to know we're hitting some home runs," he added. "I can't fathom us  winning too many games if we don't."  </P> <P> All five of the Angels' runs Tuesday night were produced by home runs, which  particularly benefited Willie Fraser, the relief pitcher working in support of  starter Mike Witt. Fraser pitched the final three innings, allowing the Rangers  three hits but no runs, which put him position to collect his second victory in  six decisions.  </P> <P> Witt left after six innings, having squandered a 2-0 advantage. Texas' Steve  Buechele doubled in one run in the fifth inning and Julio Franco tied the game  in the sixth with a run-scoring single.  </P> <P> "He was running out of gas," Rader said of Witt. "He was about done. The  quality of his stuff was decreasing.  </P> <P> "I wanted to give him the chance to work out of (the sixth) inning and he did,  so we made the change there. What we were trying to do was protect both people  -- to give Mike the opportunity to stop the rally and to let Willie come in the  next inning without having to face a tough situation."  </P> <P> Fraser got the Angels to the ninth and in the bottom of the inning, Joyner hit  a two-out double and advanced to third base on a ground out, setting the stage  for Davis and Valentine -- and, eventually, Brown and Armas.  </P> <P> Armas' hit was a big one, to be sure, but it meant more for him to deliver it  before such a big audience.  </P> <P> "That was the best one this year," he said with a smile. "A lot of people saw  that I can still hit. I made a lot of people happy."  </P> <P> Including Armas. Never mind the streak-hitter label. This season, Armas has  been little more than a streak player.  </P> <P> It feels good to get up from the couch again.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Outfielder Claudell Washington was released from Inglewood's Centinela Hospital  Medical Center Tuesday and placed on antibiotics for the treatment of  cellulitis in his left shin. Angel trainers have optimistically targeted  Washington's return to the lineup by this weekend, but a more realistic  scenario has Washington sitting out until after the All-Star break. Doctors  will re-examine the shin Thursday. . . . Texas left fielder Pete Incaviglia was  forced out of Tuesday's game after being hit on the elbow by a Mike Witt pitch  in the sixth inning. Incaviglia, who was taken to St. Joseph Hospital in Orange  for precautionary X-rays, was replaced by rookie Sammy Sosa.  </P> <P> Tuesday's crowd of 62,390 marked the 20th time in club history that the Angels  have drawn more than 60,000 spectators to a home game. It was the largest  Anaheim Stadium crowd since July 4, 1987 (62,531) and the Angels' fifth-largest  regular-season crowd ever. . . . A week before the All-Star game, the Angels  are growing concerned over the apparent proliferation of counterfeit All-Star  merchandise being peddled in the area. The team has gone so far as to schedule  a news conference today to address the subject, inviting representatives from  the City of Anaheim and the Anaheim Police Dept. to discuss the problem.  </P></p>

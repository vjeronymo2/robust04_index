			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] On the instructions of President Boris Yeltsin  the official text of the draft agreement on civic peace in  Russia he signed was sent to the media on Tuesday evening.    According to a well-informed source in the presidential  administration, the document was simultaneously submitted to 25  potential sides to the agreement -- political parties and public  movements. The same source said a working group which drafted  the agreement is expected to hold a session on April 18-20  chaired by Yeltsin. It will discuss proposals and amendments  suggested by political groups and individuals to work out the  final version.

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / The war weary of Sarajevo Weary of war and broken promises, Sarajevans shrugged in resignation yesterday as word spread that not all Serb siege guns would be surrendered by midnight in accordance with the Nato ultimatum, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. 'I haven't had high hopes since day one of the ultimatum,' said Alen Becirbegovic, 22, a soldier in the Moslem-led Bosnian army. 'The Nato threat wasn't strong enough. The Serbs outwitted Nato and the United Nations.' 'What's left of these weapons should be bombed,' said 27-year-old Anis Mehic, a student. 'Ultimatums should be carried out in full measure. Otherwise we are just spinning in small circles.' The weather lifted in Sarajevo yesterday after several days of snow and the streets were crowded with people pulling sledges loaded with jerry cans of water, relief parcels and firewood scrounged from the city's supply of shell-blasted buildings. As residents trudged down snowy lanes, Nato jets roared overhead taking advantage of clearing skies for last-minute reconnaissance flights.</p>

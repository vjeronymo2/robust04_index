Commission on Human Rights  held in Geneva.    Noting with indignation that the present Japanese  authorities  are still unwilling to admit to the issue of "comfort women for  the army", he said such attitude of theirs proves that they too  are little different from their predecessors who had committed a  crime by contriving the system of "comfort women for the army".    Pointing out that the sexual slavery forced upon Korean and  other Asian women by the Japanese Army is a criminal act against  mankind and it showed that Japan could not evade its  responsibility for it either in view of the international law or  in view of morality, he continued:    The Japanese authorities must comprehensively and quickly  probe the truth behind the "comfort women for the army", such as  the total number of "comfort women", their composition of  nationalities and lists of victims and make public its results.  Japan must make adequate compensations to victims and their  families as the greatest token of its will to clearly liquidate  its past, its will not to repeat such crimes.    At the same time, it must be accompanied by criminal  punishment upon those who are responsible for it.</p>

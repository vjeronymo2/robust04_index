			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Naryshkin] </F>   [Text] Zagreb, 30 Mar -- The two-year military  confrontation between the Croats and the Serbs from Krajina has  come to an end. At 0430, following 17 hours of difficult talks  in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, an agreement was signed  envisaging a cease-fire and the withdrawal of weapons and troops  from the demarcation line in the areas of Croatia under UN  control. In accordance with the document, which comes into  effect on 0900 on 4 April, heavy weapons are to be withdrawn 20  km, light weapons 10 km, and troops 1,000 meters away from the  300-km long demarcation line.    In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Vitaliy  Churkin, representative of the Russian Federation president,  stressed the high degree of coordination of the actions of the  key members of the international community taking part in the  settlement of the Yugoslav crisis -- Russia, the United States,  the European Union, and the United Nations. At key moments in  the talks, representatives of these countries and organizations  acted from united positions, making it possible to nudge the  sides in the direction of accords. This was an extremely  important experience of Russo-American interaction in tackling  complex critical problems. It could be said that the preparation  of the Serb-Croat agreement would be a good model for continuing  work on other aspects of the Yugoslav settlement, Vitaliy  Churkin stressed.    The Zagreb agreement is of very great significance for the  normalization of Serb-Croat relations. We expect that in two  weeks' time there should follow a similar Serb-Croat meeting on  economic questions, connected with vital supplies for the  regions under UN control and adjacent territories. Then it will  be possible to gradually go over to tackling the most difficult  questions concerning their political status, Vitaliy Churkin  said.    The high-ranking Russian diplomat recalled that the UN  Security Council resolution extending the mandate of  peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia stipulates the  possibility of air support for the "blue helmets" in case of  attacks. Since the UN troops are stationed on territories  controlled by the Serbs, who have repeatedly been attacked by  the Croatian side, this provision serves as a certain guarantee  that incidents of this sort will be avoided in the future.  Russia has its own interests here, since its peacekeeping  battalion is deployed in one of these areas, and we want the  interests of its safety to be met, V. Churkin noted.    The Russian Federation president's special envoy did not  rule  out the possibility that the next round of Serb-Croat talks on  economic issues will also be held in the Russian Embassy in  Zagreb.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH GETS 22 YEARS IN HIGH DESERT GANG SLAYING  </P> <P> A 16-year-old gang member was sentenced Tuesday to the maximum term of 22 years  and four months in juvenile custody for fatally shooting a popular Antelope  Valley High School youth in what authorities described as that area's first  gang-related killing.  </P> <P> Under juvenile sentencing procedures, however, the youth will be released  before his 25th birthday, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> The youth pleaded guilty March 23 to second-degree murder in the Jan. 6 slaying  of Christopher Sanford, 18, of Lancaster, who was leaving a party in Lancaster  when he was shot, authorities said.  </P> <P> The youth also pleaded guilty to attempted murder in the wounding of Sheldon  Culver, 20, of Lancaster, who was shot in the neck but later recovered.  </P> <P> Authorities said the youth, a member of a Sylmar gang, shot at several youths  who were chasing him from a party that he attempted to crash, but missed and  struck Sanford, who died a short time later at a hospital.  </P> <P> "He happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time," said Los Angeles  County Deputy Dist. Atty. Chesley McKay, who prosecuted the case.  </P> <P> Investigators named the youth as a suspect after interviewing other party-goers  who witnessed the shooting, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman  said. The youth remained at large for several weeks but turned himself in to  authorities Feb. 12.  </P> <P> The shooting prompted an outpouring of grief by Sanford's schoolmates and  teachers, who remembered him as a likable youth and a star goalie for the high  school's soccer team.  </P> <P> Although gang activity has been on the rise in the Antelope Valley in past  years, sheriff's investigators said the shooting was the first gang-related  fatality in the area.  </P></p>

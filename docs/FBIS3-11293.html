			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After the tense atmosphere that prevailed last  weekend, calm returned to Chapare today after the government's  decision to release 62 people arrested during the violent clash  between coca leaf growers and antidrug forces on 25 February.  This information was disclosed by Cochabamba Mayor German Lema  Araoz.    As he announced the release of the arrested people, Minister  of Government German Quiroga, who applauded the fact that  "fortunately no significant casualties" were registered, warned  that the peasants will not be allowed to cause new disturbances.    In addition to Quiroga's warning were those made by Social  Defense Secretary Mario Soliz, who admitted shortly afterward  that the peasants who were released are being investigated by  the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) to determine possible  links to drug traffickers.    Soliz asserted that the plan to eradicate illegal coca  plantations will continue as scheduled in the Chapare area.    The coca growers, in turn, accepted the government's  invitation to a peaceful dialogue as of 2 March in La Paz, but  warned that the eradication of coca plantations will not be  discussed because, first of all, they have to discuss their  proposals to fight drug trafficking and coca leaf production.    Evo Morales, executive secretary of the Special Federation  of  Peasant Workers of the Tropics, asserted: "We are not going to  accept compulsory eradication." Morales warned that in view of  the "offensive" by antidrug forces, "we have no other  alternative but to strengthen our self-defense committees, the  peasant defense patrols, and, in some cases, the security  committees."    The General Trade Union of Bolivian Peasant Workers (CSUTCB)  also voiced support for the coca growers' demands through leader  Felix Santos, who pointed out the need to tackle this problem in  a comprehensive manner because "partial" solutions do not have  positive results.    Bolivian Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas condemned the  violence in Chapare and said he was against eradication by force  of surplus coca plantations.    Cardenas said: "Forced eradication only means violence,  which we reject," and suggested that the reduction of surplus  plantations be carried out based on agreements with the  producers and their grass-roots organizations.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Arbor wins second term in CBoT chair Mr Patrick Arbor won a second two-year term as chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade following a membership vote, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago. Mr Arbor, a veteran futures trader with a long history in exchange politics, sought re-election saying he wanted to supervise completion of the ambitious building project begun in his first term. The exchange is pursuing a Dollars 171m addition next year to its landmark LaSalle Street building to create a larger, state-of-the-art trading floor for its financial futures and options products, including futures on the US Treasury bond. In spite of its continued growth, the CBoT is under pressure to forge international alliances to preserve its status as the world's busiest futures exchange.</p>

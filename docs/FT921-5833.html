			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Money Markets and Foreign Exchanges: Attention on dollar ATTENTION is expected to focus on the dollar on the foreign exchange markets this week, although opinion is divided over which way it may move. Some dealers feel that, provided the economic indicators are good, the dollar will continue to push upwards 'Basically, the strategy is still to buy dollars,' said Mr Michael Feeny, a senior dealer at Sumitomo Bank. Mr Feeny said the dollar could test the DM1.66 and Y130 barriers, although intervention at the Y130 level would impose an upper limit on the US currency of around Y129.70. 7 Dr Mark Austin, economist at HongKong Bank, was more cautious. 'The dollar is not quite as strong as it has been, and there is a risk that we won't get such good economic news as we hope for. That could send the dollar a little lower.' The markets will be watching for the crucial US payroll figures on Friday, as well as the National Association of Purchasing Managers' report today and tomorrow's home sales figures. Traders will also be looking for any sign of moves to bring the dollar down following the G7 finance ministers' meeting on Friday and Saturday, although indications at the end of last week were that Japan would not win support if it pressed for a weaker dollar. In Europe, the movements of the peseta, and the effect that has on sterling, will be watched closely. Last week the peseta drifted down from its ERM ceiling following a 25 basis-point cut in the Bank of Spain's intervention rate on Tuesday. This allowed some leeway for sterling to fall against the D-mark, and rekindled faint hopes in some dealers that a pre-Budget cut in the UK base rate may not be out of the question. Others, however, feel the easing of the peseta is unlikely to produce a UK rate cut, as the associated risks are still too great.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Roads 'falling apart' as cash limits tighten More than 4,000 miles of Britain's A-roads need urgent structural repairs because of spending limits imposed on councils, the British Road Federation said yesterday. Councils face serious difficulties in maintaining and improving the 215,000 miles of roads for which they are responsible, and a Pounds 191m cut in local road funding in last week's Budget will further reduce spending, the federation warned. Spending on structural maintenance between 1987-88 and 1991-92 fell by 13 per cent in real terms in England, 25 per cent in Wales and nearly 30 per cent in the large cities, the federation added. 'Britain's local roads are falling apart,' said Mr Richard Diment, director. 'Nearly 20 per cent of local authority A-roads need major repair now. The potholes and ruts we will see in a few years' time will make today's seem insignificant unless urgent action is taken.' Traffic on council-run A-roads has risen 56 per cent during the past 10 years while local road traffic has risen by 34 per cent. Of the 571 local bypass schemes planned, 220 have fallen behind schedule. Councils sought government approval to spend Pounds 1.8bn on roads in 1993-94, but were allowed only Pounds 1.1bn. Local roads make up 95 per cent of Britain's total road network and carry 68 per cent of all road traffic. A failure to spend on local roads could limit the effectiveness of Britain's strategic road network and reduce the benefits of increased motorway and trunk-road spending, the federation warned. In the longer term, it said, reorganisation of local government would reduce the size of transport authorities and weaken their ability to promote important transport improvements. Over the past decade the length of road that has been strengthened or undergone significant repair has fallen by 27 per cent, from 1,139 miles in 1982 to 766 miles last year.</p>

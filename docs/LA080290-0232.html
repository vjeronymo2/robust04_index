			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOL AND QUICK SALADS FOR SUMMER;  </P> <P> DINING: MAKE-AHEAD SALADS ARE THE PERFECT WARM-WEATHER ENTREES.  </P> <P> When the weather is hot, the kitchen is hot, so use the cooler evening weather  to your advantage and do most of the preparation for dinner the night before.  </P> <P> Make-ahead salads are a perfect choice. They're delicious, crunchy and  tempting. Best of all, they are easy to prepare and so satisfying.  </P> <P> Take Chicken Salad Ring, for example. It's party-pretty and delicious enough to  put in the gourmet class. While some chicken salads are too pallid to be  interesting, this salad ring has a real zesty personality all its own, thanks  to crushed crackers, crushed pineapple and chopped pecans. It's a hearty  main-dish salad, perfect to serve for lunch or dinner during the warm summer  months. Just add rolls, iced tea or coffee and fruit and the meal is complete.  </P> <P> And, not only is this salad cool to eat, it's also cool to prepare if you make  it ahead and let the flavors mingle all day.  </P> <P> Some of the other suggestions that follow may seem a little intimidating, but  there's nothing quite like the elegance of an unmolded dish presented on a  gorgeous platter. Armed with a few tips, even the novice cook can prepare  molded salads with confidence and good results.  </P> <P> Molds are simply containers that have been specially designed to shape food.  They are often made of tin-lined copper, stainless steel, porcelain or  earthenware and may be ring-shaped, square, rectangular or shaped like an  animal (usually a fish or lobster) or a fruit (quite often a pineapple).  </P> <P> As a rule, food with considerable texture is prepared in a relatively plain  mold, while smoother-textured food is considered more appropriate for  decorative molds with ribs, swirls or detailed shapes.  </P> <P> A good molded recipe for hesitant cooks is Chicken Loaf Aspic, a layer of  flavorful congealed chicken crowned with another layer of spicy tomato aspic.  Although the two layers give it an impressive appearance, this recipe is  actually quite simple to prepare.  </P> <P> First, the aspic layer is made by sprinkling unflavored gelatin over vegetable  cocktail juice. As the mixture heats in a saucepan, the gelatin slowly  dissolves. Horseradish is added for flavoring and the tomato aspic is ready to  be poured into the mold. For easier unmolding later, brush the inside of the  mold with a bit of oil first.  </P> <P> While the aspic chills, the chicken layer is prepared. This time, the gelatin  is dissolved in canned chicken broth, then heated in a saucepan. The broth is  then chilled until slightly thick; a mixture of finely chopped chunk chicken,  sour cream, shredded carrot, chopped green onions and horseradish is folded  into the broth. The thickened chicken layer is spooned onto the aspic layer to  chill at least four hours.  </P> <P> To unmold when thoroughly chilled, remove from the refrigerator and run a knife  or metal spatula around the edges of the mold, then dip the bottom of the mold  into a shallow pan of hot water several times to loosen this area. Take a  chilled serving platter and place it over the open side of the mold. Hold  platter and mold tightly together and invert. When you lift the mold, the food  should remain on the platter. Some recommend returning the molded dish to the  refrigerator to firm up after this process.  </P> <P> Other simple molds are Pineapple-Cheese Chicken Mold and Molded Salad  Primavera.  </P> <P> CHICKEN SALAD RING  </P> <P> 2 cups diced cooked chicken  </P> <P> 22 rich flavor, rectangular-shaped crackers, finely rolled, about 1 cup crumbs  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) can crushed pineapple  </P> <P> 1 cup mayonnaise  </P> <P> 1/3 cup chopped pecans  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped celery  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped onion  </P> <P> 2 eggs, separated  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon parsley flakes  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon lemon juice  </P> <P> Combine chicken, cracker crumbs, pineapple and juice, mayonnaise, pecans,  celery, onion, egg yolks, parsley flakes and lemon juice.  </P> <P> Beat egg whites in medium bowl with electric mixer at medium speed, until  stiff, then fold into chicken mixture. Evenly spread into greased 6-cup ring  mold.  </P> <P> Set mold in large shallow baking pan and place in oven. Pour in hot water to  about 1/4-inches deep. Bake at 350 degrees 35 to 40 minutes or until wood pick,  inserted in center, comes out clean. Remove ring mold from baking pan to wire  rack and let cool 10 minutes.

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Business and the Law: Cement cartel court setback - Europan Law The European Court of First Instance has dismissed judicial review applications challenging the legality of the Commission's competition procedure against the EC cement industry. The CFI held the applications were inadmissible as being premature. The procedural challenges were brought by four cement producers or national associations at an unusually early stage in the formal procedure initiated by the Commission in November 1991. On the basis of documents obtained during investigations of business premises and following formal requests, the commission concluded that European cement producers and certain national and international trade associations were operating a cartel at national and international level to share out member country markets, keep them separate, and limit imports from within and outside the EC. A statement of objections was sent to all parties, accusing them of infringing EC competition rules. It dealt with allegations concerning conduct at international level separately from that at national level. Although it was a single document, the full text was not sent to all 76 parties. The factual and legal assessment chapters dealing with individual national markets were sent only to producers and associations in the member country concerned. All parties received the text dealing with allegations at international level plus a full table of contents and a list of documents on the file indicating those to which access was available. The two main grounds for challenge concerned the Commission's infringement of the parties' rights of defence, by refusing, first, to disclose all the chapters of the statement of objections and, second, to grant them access to all non-confidential documents in the Commission's file. The refusal of full access to the file concerned two types of documents: documents relating to national markets available only to those directly concerned; and those documents relating to objections notified to the parties which were, in the Commission's view, covered by the EC rules on professional secrecy since they were obtained in the exercise of the Commission's investigation powers and were not used against the producer or association to which the objections were addressed. The CFI restricted the case to the issue of admissibility. Following established principles, the Court said that when a procedural step concerned the rights of defence, it could only be overturned if it vitiated the final decision taken at the end of the administrative procedure. Only measures immediately and irreversibly affecting the legal situation of the parties concerned could justify the admissibility of an annulment action before completion of the administrative procedure. Even though they may constitute an infringement of the rights of defence, Commission measures refusing access to the file were merely preparatory steps the illegality of which could be raised in appeals against the commission's final decisions, while still providing sufficient protection of the rights of defence. Full access to the file More importantly, the Court clarified the scope of the right of access to the file as a matter of substantive law repeating its interpretation of the Commissions' policy on access to the file in its 1991 judgment in Case T-7/89 Hercules v Commission: 'the Commission has an obligation to make available to the undertakings involved in article 85(1) proceedings all documents, whether in their favour or otherwise, which it had obtained during the course of the investigation, save where the business secrets of other undertakings, the internal documents of the Commission and other confidential information are involved.' The Commission may wish to use the opportunities afforded by its administrative procedures to reconsider its approach to access to the file in the light of the CFI's views. Moreover its interpretation of the rules on professional secrecy as extending to all information obtained by the Commission pursuant to its powers, and not used against a party, raises a question of law which has not yet been decided by the Community judicature.

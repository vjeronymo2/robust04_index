			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Harsh medicine's tastegood factor: The Clintons' healthcare reform plan is controversial but crafted to have a broad appeal President Bill Clinton has crossed the Rubicon on healthcare. After his impassioned speech to Congress on Wednesday night, it is hard to doubt that the US will enact a comprehensive reform within the next year. Many of the details of Mr Clinton's plan will be changed in what is likely to be the most heavily lobbied legislation in US history. But America is now firmly on the path to fundamental reform. This is no small achievement. Since the early 1970s, when Richard Nixon unveiled abortive reform proposals, successive presidents have shied away from this most intractable of American social problems. Unlike his predecessors, Mr Clinton has always wanted to embrace the complexities of healthcare reform. He had to go through the grind of a deficit-cutting budget earlier this year. But healthcare is what he really cares about: it is the heart and soul of his presidency and he will be judged by the perceived success of his reforms. When Mr Clinton waved a credit-card sized prototype Health Security Card in front of Congress and pledged to provide care for all Americans 'that can never be taken away', it was clear that he regarded himself as the heir of a long tradition of Democratic social reformers. He referred obliquely to Franklin Roosevelt, who laid the foundations for the US welfare state in the 1930s with the introduction of social security (old age pensions) and unemployment benefits. Today, said Mr Clinton Americans could not conceive of a world without public-sector pensions; in 50 years (thanks to his reforms) they would be unable to imagine lacking access to healthcare. He stuck to six broad principles. Reform, he said, should offer 'security, simplicity, savings, choice, quality and responsibility'. The political advantage of not getting bogged down in complexities is that, even if congressional committees greatly alter the details of his plan, Mr Clinton can still claim credit for the final reform - or at least share it with his wife Hillary, who led the healthcare task force. Conscious that fundamental change cannot be wrought without Republican support, Mr Clinton also made a strong appeal for bipartisan backing. The plan is crafted to appeal to different constituencies. Mr Clinton wants to introduce a form of 'managed competition' - a concept invented by conservative-leaning economists such as Mr Alain Enthoven of Stanford University. The basic idea is that most people would be enrolled in large, regional purchasing co-operatives known as 'health alliances'. The theory is that alliances would use their market clout to obtain high-quality care at the lowest possible prices from competing groups of doctors and hospitals in the private sector. Companies with more than 5,000 employees would be able to set up their own 'corporate alliances'. Alliances would publish information about the price and range of benefits offered by the competing health plans in their areas, each of which would have to offer a federally certified package of standard benefits. Individuals would choose from among the plans. Employers would have to pay at least 80 per cent of the cost of the average premium of locally available plans. Government subsidies would ensure that health costs would not absorb more than 8 per cent of total payroll spending; for small companies with low-paid employees, the cap would be set at 3.5 per cent of payroll. The unemployed, the self-employed and other people on low incomes would receive direct subsidies to enable them to purchase care via an alliance. Since the employer contribution and/or the government subsidy would be based on the average cost of insurance premiums, individuals would have an incentive to select the cheaper plans. This tendency would be strongly reinforced by proposed rules on direct patient contributions. Individuals who enter pre-paid Health Maintenance Organisations (HMOs), which deploy 'gate- keepers' akin to British GPs and allow patients to consult only a limited number of specialists under contract with the plan, would pay a flat Dollars 10 a visit. But those who select unrestricted 'fee-for-service' plans, under which physicians charge separately for each item of service, would have to pay 20 per cent of each bill - in addition to their 20 per cent share of the insurance premium itself. The likely result would be to push all but the affluent into HMOs. This version of managed competition, however, is to be buttressed by a series of reforms calculated to appeal to left-leaning Democrats. The Clinton administration would set up a seven-member National Health Board with general powers to regulate the entire healthcare industry - one-seventh of the economy. It would oversee the creation and operation of the health alliances, which would be quasi-public bodies. It would have powers not only to limit spending on public schemes, such as Medicare (for the elderly), but also to limit the rate of growth of the premiums charged by private-sector health plans. Although the White House has rejected direct controls on the prices of drugs and other forms of healthcare, by setting caps on premiums it would thus impose budgetary controls on the private sector for the first time. Mr Clinton would also strive to improve the fairness of the healthcare system and redirect spending from high-tech medicine to primary and preventive care. Financial incentives, for example, would encourage medical students to become general practitioners, a comparative rarity in the US, and to practise in under-served inner cities and poor rural areas. Planned new benefits would include long-term domiciliary care for the elderly and chronically ill and an increased range of services for the mentally ill - a group dis-criminated against in the present system. Mr Clinton is wooing support from the nation's governors by offering individual states considerable flexibility. States that dislike the concept of managed competition can opt for a Canadian-style 'single payer' system under which the state government would purchase all care for citizens from competing groups of private-sector providers. He will also let states introduce the reforms as and when they are ready with a final deadline for creating alliances of January 1997. The president presented his plan as an evolutionary advance from the present system. In many ways this is an understatement: it involves big and controversial changes. Much attention is being focused on the fairness or otherwise of imposing a legal requirement on employers to pay at least 80 per cent of the average cost of health premiums. To the objection that this is unjustified coercion, Mr Clinton's reply is that many companies will be better off: under the present voluntary system, large companies often pay 100 per cent of health costs. Small businesses that already provide insurance will gain the most, because their costs will be capped well below current rates. It is only 'free riders' that will face a financial penalty. What the debate about the 'employer mandate' tends to mask is that the planned creation of huge regional purchasing co-operatives involves a much reduced role for employers. Under the present rules, they pay for employees' insurance but they also make the important decisions - for example, whether to put employees into an HMO. Under the Clintons' scheme, individual employees will choose from among the competing plans offered by the local health alliance. Employers enter the picture only as providers of resources: their 80 per cent contribution is effectively a payroll tax. Mr Clinton's decision to put individuals at the heart of his system should please conservatives. But if employers are to be used only as a source of revenue, the question arises: why pick on them? Payroll taxes are already high and the system of subsidies proposed for small business looks complex. In economic terms it would make more sense to finance healthcare through a consumption tax, for example a national value-added tax, which would not tend to reduce demand for labour. Mr Clinton's reply would be that such an upheaval is not politically feasible; he has to build on present arrangements which happen to put most of the financing burden on employers. In the longer run, however, finance could be sought from other sources. The proposed new limits on the permitted rate of growth of premiums for private health plans also represent a radical departure. It is one thing to put curbs on the permitted growth of tax-financed healthcare - every country does this. But Mr Clinton is trying to place controls on private-sector spending. Many conservatives will argue that this is wholly unacceptable: even Britain, with a nationalised health system, does not try to limit the growth of private-sector health premiums. The most damaging critique of the White House plan is perhaps that the numbers do not add up. Mr Clinton is proposing to extend insurance cover to 37m people (15 per cent of the population) and offer all families benefits as good as if not better than those provided by Fortune 500 companies. He is also proposing extensive subsidies for small business and low-income families. Yet he claims this can be financed without a substantial increase in income or consumption taxes (the only new levies planned are minor 'sin taxes' on cigarettes). Additional spending of Dollars 350bn (Pounds 230bn) between 1994 and 2000 is to be financed by halving the planned growth of existing federal schemes such as Medicare and Medicaid (the scheme for the poor). Indeed, the White House claims the scheme will actually produce net savings of Dollars 91bn which could be used to reduce the budget deficit. Scepticism is understandable: the costs of most previous social reforms has been grossly underestimated. Yet it is important to be clear about what Mr Clinton is actually proposing. On his own numbers he is planning to increase healthcare spending from 14 per cent of GDP today to nearly 17.5 per cent by end of the century. That ought to provide sufficient room to expand insurance coverage and improve benefits: the US would be spending roughly three times as much of GDP on healthcare as Britain. The talk of 'savings' is illusory (as usual) because they are measured relative to baseline projections that, on unchanged policies, show healthcare absorbing an exorbitant 19 per cent of GDP by the end of the century, rather than levelling off at 17.5 per cent. The big question is how much of the plan Mr Clinton can get through Congress. The omens are encouraging. The healthcare cost explosion has been accompanied by growing public anxiety about access to care. Those affected include not only the uninsured but millions of middle-income families who fear loss of insurance cover should a breadwinner lose a job or contract a serious illness. Many families have also been adversely affected by employers' decisions either to wind up company schemes or sharply cut benefits. The upshot is that opinion polls indicate a surprising degree of public support for radical reform. According to a New York Times/CBS poll, 90 per cent of the population (including 85 per cent of Republicans) say the healthcare system needs either complete rebuilding or fundamental change - though 70 per cent were happy with their own care. More than 50 per cent appear willing to accept reforms that would limit their access to doctors, a proposal once regarded as political suicide. This may reflect the revolution already under way in the private sector: as companies have sought to contain runaway costs, the proportion of people enrolled in HMOs and other forms of 'managed care' has already risen from 9m in 1980 to 41m today. As was evident on Wednesday night, the attitude toward reform on Capitol Hill is positive. After the frustrations of the Reagan/Bush years, when rivalry between a Republican White House and Democratic Congress caused legislative 'gridlock', senior politicians in both parties are keen to make progress. The risk, however, is that, as lobbyists step up their pressure on Congress, controversial elements of the Clinton plan - such as mandates on employers - will be dropped or watered down. There is little doubt that the US will enact the appealing elements of the plan, such as guaranteed health cover for all; the difficulty will be ensuring that the unpleasant medicine is also swallowed.</p>

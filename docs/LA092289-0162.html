			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIFE ON THE CIRCUIT: CAR AFICIONADO'S DREAM: AN EVENING IN A FERRARI DEALER'S  SHOWROOM, LOT  </P> <P> The Scene  </P> <P> Drinks and hors d'oeuvres for about 200 autophiles at Newport Imports on Coast  Highway in Newport Beach. Cruising the showroom and car lot after work on  Tuesday were patrons and exhibitors of the seventh annual Newport Beach  Concours d'Elegance, an antique and classic car show to be held at UC Irvine on  Oct. 1. Proceeds from the Concours help underwrite the Assessment and Treatment  Services Center, a private, nonprofit juvenile counseling program serving  Orange County. This year's Concours will be local Ferrari lovers' field of  dreams -- the daylong fete will include a "Friends of Ferrari" meeting and a  host of Ferrari models of various vintages. (One of the ruby-colored cars is  the show's poster prop.) Lee West, owner of Newport Imports, used Tuesday's  thank-you party -- hosted by ATSC -- to unveil a new model 1990 Ferrari. For  most of the two-hour get-together, the little red surprise was parked in the  middle of the showroom, draped with a cloth cover, the object of many a  sidelong glance.  </P> <P> The Buzz  </P> <P> Conspicuous consumption, with a smile. "We have Ferraris and Alfas," said Sandy  Zide, who carried her 3-month-old daughter in a shoulder sling. While Sandy  cooed at baby Amy, husband Sheldon, a doctor, clarified: three Ferraris, four  Alfa Romeos. "I collect them and I restore them," he said of his four-wheel  harem. Ed Awad, a chemical engineer, allowed as how he owned just two Ferraris,  but added quickly, "I'm about to buy another one." Jolene Engle -- who wore red  leather pants, spike-heel boots and a sequined jacket with race-car patches  buried in the shiny scales -- said she drives Jaguars and her husband, Dick,  drives Ferraris (that's plural, two apiece). "Ferraris are for driving fast,  and he does," she said with a giggle, glancing at her husband. "Hit the  freeway, up to 180 -- wheee!"  </P> <P> The Food  </P> <P> Generous portions, as hors d'oeuvres go, and they did -- quick as you could  hiss Testarossa, the servers' silver trays were plucked clean. Luckily for the  hungry after-work crowd, the trays were restocked almost as fast. Among the  tasty offerings supplied by The Upper Crust caterers were Gargantuan prawns,  veal piccata, spinach and feta cheese frittata, and filet mignon en baguette  with lemon caper sauce. Champagne and the usual assortment of nonalcoholic and  mixed drinks flowed at the hosted bars.  </P> <P> Dress Mode  </P> <P> The men looked bankerly, doctorly, lawyerly in power suits and  still-crisp-at-dusk shirts; the distaff side was all over the boards. Floral  cocktail dresses. Basic black ensembles. Leather. Sequins. Mink. What's the  dress code for cocktails at a car lot, anyway?  </P> <P> Who Was There  </P> <P> William and Willa Dean Lyon, who left their classic car collection at home in  their private museum, thank-you very much, and slid off Pacific Coast Highway  to the waiting arms of the valets in a midnight blue Cadillac. Retired race car  driver Dan Gurney, with his wife Evi. The Gurneys, who live in Newport Beach,  said they haven't been able to make it to the Concours any of the past six  years and won't make it this year either -- love to, Dan said, but he'll be on  the road with his race team. Television actor Barry Bostwick. Concours  chairwoman Lynda Shea, and her husband, Peter, who owns Entrepreneur magazine.  Sally and Norman Loats, who heads the board of the Assessment and Treatment  Services Center.  </P> <P> Overheard  </P> <P> "He's not the kind of person who babies a car. He drove his Testarossa  yesterday -- even in the rain!" PAMELA MARIN  </P></p>

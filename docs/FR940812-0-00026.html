The priorities described below will be used by the RDA to rate preapplications and applications. Points will be distributed as indicated in paragraph (a) of this section. Points will be distributed according to ranking as compared with other preapplications/applications on hand. A copy of the score sheet (available in any FmHA State Office) should be placed in the casefile for future reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The selection criteria are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Economic conditions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Preference will be given to proposed projects which will serve a rural area(s) that has few rural industries and agribusinesses; high levels of unemployment or underemployment; high rates of outmigration of people, businesses, and industries; and low levels of per capita income. RDA will consider data supporting these demographics from the United States Bureau of the Census or other reliable data from recognized local, regional, State or Federal sources or from surveys conducted by reliable, impartial sources. Outmigration of businesses and industries, for example, may be supported by county business patterns data available from the Bureau of the Census. Data to support all categories must be for the most current full calendar year for which the data is available and the 3 calendar years prior to that year. The competitive range for proposed projects is as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Number of rural industries and agribusinesses in comparison with the population of the area(s) to be served: 1 or less per 5,000 residents_25 points; 1 or less per 3,000 residents_15 points; or 1 or less per 1,000 residents_5 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Unemployment rate in the area(s) to be served: Exceeds the State rate by 25 percent or more_15 points; or exceeds the State rate by less than 25 percent but more than 5 percent_10 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Underemployment in the area(s) to be served exceeds the State rate of underemployment by 25 percent or more_20 points; exceeds the State rate by less than 25 percent_10 points; or is equal to or less than State rate_0 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

It is stated that it would enable Texas to make natural gas deliveries to GATX under Texas Eastern's blanket certificate issued on November 5, 1982 in Docket No. CP82&hyph;535&hyph;000, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to Section 157.211 of the Commission's regulations, Texas Eastern requests authorization to install a new delivery point in order to deliver natural gas under the agreement covering service for GATX under Rate Schedule IT&hyph;1 of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Volume No. 1, and that Texas Eastern's existing tariff does not prohibit the additional volumes. Texas Eastern states that the peak and average day deliveries at the point would be 5,000 Dth per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Eastern states that the installation of the delivery point will have no effect on Texas Eastern's peak day or annual deliveries. Texas Eastern submits that its proposal will be accomplished without detriment or disadvantage to Texas Eastern's other customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The delivery point to be installed by Texas Eastern includes the installation of two 2-inch taps on Texas Eastern's 12-inch Line Nos. 1&hyph;C and 1&hyph;R at M.P. 2.63 in Richmond County, New York. The approximate cost of such facilities is $551,500 and would be 100% reimbursable by GATX.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is further stated that GATX would cause to be installed a dual 2-inch meter station, including 50 feet of 4-inch pipeline between the proposed Texas Eastern taps to GATX's proposed meter station and electronic gas measurement equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> August 11, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Standard Paragraphs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F.

If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for applicant to appear or be represented at the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G.

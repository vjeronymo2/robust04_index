			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK needs a champion of superhighways cause Sir, The trade and industry select committee is right to warn of the dangers of the UK lagging behind the US and Japan in the development of interactive 'information superhighways' ('MPs urge early lifting of ban on BT video service', July 28). If information is the key to competitiveness in the next century, then an 'information superhighway' will be pivotal to the UK's economic success. However, many people have not yet come to terms with the profound social and economic implications which flow from the 'multi-media revolution'. A recent survey commissioned by 3Com of 200 large UK companies showed that more than two-thirds of Britain's managing directors do not understand the phrase 'information superhighway'. These findings contrast with a similar survey carried out by the American Electronics Association earlier this year indicating a much greater appreciation of the need for, and the benefits of, the superhighway among American business. British business is lagging behind, because the US federal government has clearly articulated the superhighways vision to a broad cross-section of the population. As soon as the Clinton administration took office it developed a technology policy, with its superhighways initiative - the National Information Infrastructure - as the symbol for economic growth, the expansion of jobs and a vital tool in promoting education and healthcare reform. It may be distorted, but today many Americans have absolutely no doubt that some kind of connection to the information superhighway exists in the future and they are going to have to become familiar with it. The UK needs an equivalent of Vice-President Al Gore, someone who will capture the imagination, champion the superhighways cause and spur industry into action. We decidedly do not need substantive government intervention but there should be active engagement. The differences between Britain and the US may be more rhetorical than real, but in America there is some real understanding of the scale of change under way and the potential which it creates. Unless the British government takes a more active role in setting out the vision to both business and the public, we may be consigned to the crawler lane of the information superhighway.

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: BNP doubles dividend as earnings advance 82% BANQUE Nationale de Paris, one of the largest French banks, yesterday announced it was doubling its dividend from FFr7.8 in 1990 to FFr15.75 in 1991 after increasing net profits by 82 per cent from FFr1.6bn to FFr2.9bn (Dollars 516m) last year. The BNP announcement comes towards the end of a very mixed set of annual results for the French banks. BNP, which saw its profits fall sharply in 1990 after it was forced to make hefty provisions on its loan losses, managed to muster a recovery last year although its net profits have not yet regained the FFr3.4bn achieved in 1989. This follows the same pattern as Societe Generale, another of the big state-controlled banks, which last week announced its return to profits growth after a steep increase in provisions for 1990. By contrast, other French banks had a tough time in 1991 when they were forced to make dramatic increases in provisions. Paribas, the investment banking group, recently announced its first ever loss of nearly FFr200m. Credit Lyonnais, together with BNP and Societe Generale, saw 1991 profits fall sharply after doubling provisions to FFr9.5bn. The decision to double BNP's dividend marks the improvement in the bank's performance in 1991 when it managed to raise its earnings per share from FFr23.63 to FFr41.51. BNP had previously announced a 7.7 per cent increase in net banking income from FFr35.2bn in 1990 to FFr37.9bn in 1991.</p>

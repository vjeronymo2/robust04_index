			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Reshuffle of management at Asda ASDA, the Leeds-based grocery chain which recently reported a severe slump in profitability, is reshuffling its senior management with the aim of producing a more focused retailing structure. Mr Archie Norman, who became group chief executive at the end of last year, will assume a more direct role in running the core retail business by taking on the additional post of chief executive of Asda Stores. This position was split between Mr Richard Harker and Mr Tony Campbell, who become retail director and trading director respectively. The company also expects to announce the appointment of a personnel director shortly. Mr Norman is faced with a host of strategic and operational dilemmas as he attempts to overhaul the grocery chain. But he stressed yesterday that he wanted to return to Asda's 'traditional strengths', which he defined as real value for money, a clear consumer image and tight cost control. Asda has hired McKinsey, the management consultancy, to assess its financial options and review its product offering. The company is researching several possible trading formulas and is especially concerned to develop a viable format for 49 of its older stores which have been significantly underperforming its competitors. Asda intends to launch a pilot store in June to experiment with a new approach. The company is also working with Andersen Consulting to maximise the effectiveness of information technology and introduce direct product profitability (DPP) techniques. Such systems are already common among Asda's competitors. Last month Mr Norman argued that Asda could generate healthy growth simply by squeezing more profits out of the company's under-exploited assets and making a decent return on its Pounds 4bn of sales.</p>

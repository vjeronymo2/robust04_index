			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENLIGHTENED ON CALIFORNIA CULTURE  </P> <P> Just as I concluded that common sense, creativity, and intelligence didn't get  printed much west of the Mississippi River, Itabari Njeri presents two great  articles of enlightenment in one Times View issue. Why? What? Is this  California culture -- without sand?  </P> <P>  On Oct. 19, "A City of Poets: L.A. Emerges as a Place of Verse, Diversity" on  the Los Angeles Poetry Festival and "The Compelling Stories of a Conquered  Nation," an overview of the life of UCLA professor, Paula Gunn Allen, appeared.  </P> <P> Alas! My East Coast snobbery and elitism can't be sustained if you continue to  print information on Western great minds.  </P> <P> Now I'll have to slip into those poetry events and sneak a peek in an Indian  anthology book.  </P> <P> I promise, that word of my insights, will be shared back in the original  colonies.  </P> <P> TOM L. COLEMAN SR.  </P> <P> San Bernardino  </P></p>

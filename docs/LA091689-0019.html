			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'FINE-TUNING' THE MEDICARE SURTAX  </P> <P> It's not enough to "fine-tune" the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, as The  Times suggested in its editorial defending this law ("All It Needs Is  Fine-Tuning," Sept. 11). This new program needs a major overhaul.  </P> <P> As a member of Congress who voted against this bill, I have argued from the  time its passage was imminent that we should scrap it and start over. Our  original goal was right: to protect older Americans from the financial  devastation that a major, long-term illness can cause. But we never achieved  that goal. Instead of providing help with long-term nursing home or home health  care -- the costs of which are feared the most by the elderly -- Congress  provided a number of less essential benefits. It was no surprise that  beneficiaries objected to paying very substantial fees for them.  </P> <P> The only truly catastrophic benefit of this new law is the unlimited  hospitalization. The other principal new benefits are help with physicians'  fees and prescription drug expenses. Large bills in both cases can cause  hardship, but rarely are the costs "catastrophic," $2,000 worth of doctors' or  pharmaceutical bills in a year is a modest expense compared to $30,000 for a  yearlong stay in a typical nursing home, which really is catastrophic for all  but the most affluent elderly.  </P> <P> Furthermore, many of the elderly have private insurance to pay for the  hospital, physician, and prescription drug expenses that Medicare does not  cover, but virtually none have insurance for long-term nursing home and home  health care.  </P> <P> The existence of this new Medicare program has made it all but impossible for  Congress to address the need for help with the costs of long-term care. Because  of the huge expenses involved in nursing home or home health care, Congress  cannot create a federal program to pay for them without asking beneficiaries to  bear part of the cost. But we will also be hard-pressed to ask recipients to  pay even higher health care fees after imposing such large premium increases  and a surtax on the elderly to pay for some of these other, less urgent  benefits.  </P> <P> Congress will soon be deciding whether to repeal or merely adjust the financing  of this new law -- possibly in a way that would be detrimental to low- and  middle-income elderly. Repeal is the right course: If we go back to square one  and provide, instead, long-term care benefits -- the true "catastrophic"  benefits that the elderly need and want the most (and probably thought they  were getting with this bill) -- we're certain to see a much greater willingness  on their part to help pay for them.  </P> <P> REP. ANTHONY C. BEILENSON  </P> <P> D-Los Angeles  </P></p>

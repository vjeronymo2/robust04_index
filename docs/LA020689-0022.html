			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Carbon monoxide fumes from propane heaters built up in an ice-fishing shanty on  a frozen lake near Manitowoc, Wis., and killed four teen-agers -- three boys  and a girl -- sheriff's officers said. The 7-foot-by-6 1/2-foot wooden shanty  was one of more than 50 such shelters on Harpt Lake. The victims were staying  overnight as they participated in an ice-fishing derby. A friend of the victims  who was going to join them fishing found the bodies at dawn. "The girl's father  was in the shack right next door. He tried mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation, said  Mary Lee Stueck, a contest organizer.  </P></p>

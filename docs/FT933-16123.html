			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Australian premiers told to cut spending AUSTRALIA'S Labor government, increasingly unpopular since its unexpected election victory in March, risked a further downturn yesterday when it told state premiers to tighten their belts, Reuter reports from Canberra. Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer (finance minister), facing a stagnant economy and a ballooning budget deficit, asked premiers to come up with an austerity plan to help save the government billions of dollars. Mr Dawkins told the six state premiers his government had to fill a gap of between ADollars 4bn and ADollars 10bn (Pounds 1.8bn and Pounds 4.5bn)to achieve a budget deficit target of 1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 1996-97. He told them to trim another ADollars 1.5bn to ADollars 3bn from their own budgets as part of a national strategy to turn around record low levels of national savings. Since its election win in March, the government has steadfastly repeated an aim to cut the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97. The actual 1992-93 deficit, announced on Sunday, was ADollars 14.5bn or 3.7 per cent of GDP, and the government has forecast an even higher deficit of around ADollars 16bn for 1993-94. Economists have said the 1 per cent target would require huge spending cuts, new taxes or the dropping of big income tax cuts planned for 1994 and 1996. An new opinion poll, published yesterday, showed Mr Keating's administration is as unpopular as it was before the election. The Saulwick/Sydney Morning Herald poll found Labor trailed the Liberal-National opposition by 39 per cent to 47 per cent. The poll was taken a week ago.</p>

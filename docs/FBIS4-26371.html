			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 21 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton met here today with presidents of Hungary and Slovakia  and congratulated their "genuine leadership ability."    After their meeting with Clinton, Hungarian President Arpad  Goncz and Slovakia President Michal Kovac will travel to New  York to receive an award from the Institute for East West  Studies for their contribution to international understanding.    The two Central European presidents issued a joint statement  that they would work closely to "effect an historic  reconciliation."    "Despite frictions and conflicts, our nations have lived  together, enriching each other materially and culturally, for  many centuries," the statement said.    "The differences which exist do not threaten and even  sometimes make more evident what we have in common. We are  committed to overcoming any psychological inhibitions that might  endanger cooperation," it added.</p>

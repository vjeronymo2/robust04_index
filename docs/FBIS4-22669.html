At least those who followed along with the  activities of the Latvia Committee of the Citizen's Congress  noticed him. That is why it is unusual to acknowledge that very  little is known about Janis Straume. The day that I understood  why that was so I decided to reveal it to him.    [Egle] You smile so rarely and often appear a bit angry. You  should not do that, otherwise journalists will be afraid to  address you.    [Straume] That is true. I have often been criticized for  being gloomy. Some people in the faction have said that a  politician must be more loose. But I am by nature rather closed  and truly smile only rarely. I do not like loud and bravura-like  conversations. Changing my nature now is difficult. It would be  a question of training.    [Egle] Synthesizing your open essence with the ideas you  started out with, one might guess about your past. You, of  course, have never been, for instance, a Komsomol member?    [Straume] I really have never been that.    [Egle] A dissident?    [Straume] No, a hooligan.    [Egle] That, too, might be interesting. Tell us about it!    [Straume] That was in 1978 in Sigulda, where we, three  like-minded fellows, established a nationally-oriented little  group, which occupied itself with preparing various  proclamations to inform the inhabitants of Sigulda about those  things that everyone today knows about.    [Egle] Who were your like-minded friends and what are they  doing now?    [Straume] One was my friend from childhood and Klavs  Elsbergs  prize winner, the poet Edvins Raups. I do not know anything  about the further course of the other, Juris Vaiders.    [Egle] How old were you then?    [Straume] Fifteen. For half a year we worked successfully,  not getting caught either with the "dictation" of school  administrators, for in those leaflets each one of us wrote one  letter and the Chekha could not make anything out from our  handwriting. Later we became careless and began writing out  leaflets in our own handwriting. Then there was another  dictation and within a week we all were taken in.    [Egle] But you said that you were a hooligan?    [Straume] With the leaflets we were able to educate people,  not draw attention to ourselves. That is why we rather  childishly occupied ourselves with breaking windows.    [Egle] What system determined which windows you chose?    [Straume] We were breaking those in the apartments of party  functionaries. And to a large degree that saved us. All three of  us were tried for hooliganism with a prison sentence of one  year, suspended. No political leaflets figured into this matter.    [Egle] Do you remember the name of the judge? How would you  proceed if you had to vote in the Saeima to confirm him?    [Straume] The judge was Voldemars Subrovskis, currently the  chairman of the judges' association. The Saeima has already  voted on him. I do not regard it as possible to vote to confirm  for life tenure any judge, with the current judicial system and  the associated legal disorder.    [Egle] How did you know the truth that needed to be told to  people when you were fifteen years old?    [Straume] It is in my genes. All of my closest relations,  mother, her brothers, grandmother and grandfather, were exiled  to Siberia. When I was three years old my father perished under  mysterious circumstances which are still unclear, while he was a  draftee in the Soviet army. I was often told that this regime is  unbreakable, that I should not resist. Those close to me wanted  to shield me, but that only gave rise to the opposite effect. At  night I read the real books and I knew what I had to fight for.    [Egle] Did holding consistant ideas cause difficulties after  finishing school?    [Straume] Thanks to school principal, Valdis Jekabsons, my  record did not include the fact that I was tried and after high  school I enrolled in the Riga Institute of Medicine. In my first  course, in the first semester I was the only non-Komsomolist and  the only honors student. And then certain problems did indeed  arise.    [Egle] What sort?    [Straume] Attempts to recruit me as a Chekha informer began.  I was summoned seemingly to see the Rector, then the responsible  official reminded me of my past and said that in my road to  advancement I was accepted to the institute and now I ought not  abuse the hospitality. That very night I called together my  group members, those closest friends at the institute, and told  them everything so that they would know, if anything happened to  me, if I was thrown out of school, why it was done. And with  that it all ended, for the information obviously was broadcast  back.    [Egle] So you graduated from the institute?    [Straume] Yes, and with a clear conscience. I have worked  for  ten years in medicine. When the Awakening began and I started to  look for contacts among people who were working in the  "Helsinki" group and the LNIM [Latvian National Independence  Movement], then I worked at Riga Municipal Clinical Hospital No.  3 as a functional diagnostic doctor and later at the Republic of  Latvia's Diagnostic Center I specialized as an endoscopic  doctor. Until the elections I worked in medicine and now I am  surprised that it is rather easy to survive the interruption of  medical practice.    [Egle] Was it easy to mix it with political activity  earlier?    [Straume] I would not want to connect my life with politics  completely and I hope to return to medicine. My political  biography begins with activity in the LNIM, when I was the  movement's Sigulda area chairman. To bring together people who  stood against Soviet power, both the "Helsinki-ists" and the the  LNIM, it was acknowledged: It was necessary to organize a  political party. Thus was born the Republican party of Latvia,  which in the Citizens Congress elections won quite a few  mandates, although it had only a small organization. The next  fact worthy of mention was connected to the establishment of the  18 November Union, which united part of the Republican party and  the radical wing of the PFL [Popular Front of Latvia], which  left the Front.    [Egle] Until the second congress you were the chairman of  the  18 November Union?    [Straume] Yes. Now we elected Maris Grinblats. Among other  things we and Maris are helped in the parliament by the  experience we gained in the Citizens Congress. That provided the  opportunity also to understand the parliamentary work style,  which was well organized in the Citizens Congress. It is  interesting that there in the beginning I was in the opposition,  as a member of the Republican party, but later I was in a  leadership post. Along with that it is clear that one must  function in one instance, as in the other and the process in the  parliament does not cause alarm.    [Egle] You do not make speeches in the Saeima very often,  but  when you do the speeches are well prepared. Is it true that they  are written by your assistant, Aigars Jirgens?    [Straume] That is a provocative question. We all write our  own speeches, but I would not want to deny that Aigars Jirgens  helps to prepare them, for the faction practices collective  work, that before any speeches are made, bills proposed to  [Saeima] commissions, etc, they are carefully prepared and  discussed, including my speeches. I must also remind you that  Maris Grinblats and Aigars Jirgens have had authority already  since the time of the Citizens Congress.    [Egle] Why did you decide to work in the Saeima's State  Administration and Local Government Commission?    [Straume] There are only six deputies in our faction and we  selected the six most important commissions.    [Egle] So, you do not have any experience in local  government  work?    [Straume] I have experience with the Citizens Congress  internal affairs commission. I must add that "For Fatherland and  Freedom" already had many proposed laws already drafted, with  which we arrived at the Saeima, and many of them must be  reviewed in the State Administration and Local Government  Commission, which is why it is good that someone from the  faction participates in its work.    [Egle] Was the commission also given the "Fatherlanders'"  project regarding limitations on appointments to posts?    [Straume] The State Administration and Local Government  Commission, it seems, was the only one that voted that this kind  of law limiting posts is necessary. The Saeima majority, as is  known, had other ideas. But we will return again to this  question, when the Saeima begins reviewing the proposed law on  State Civil Service on its second reading. If there are no such  limitations and a mechanism prepared for implementation, the  state administration reform, about which much is being said, is  also impossible.    [Egle] "For Fatherland and Freedom" is criticized for  getting  carried away with political "limitations" at a time when people  are concerned with economic and social questions.    [Straume] The basis of state development is, after all,  political issues. But our faction is also concerned with  economic problems. Recently Roberts Zile returned from an  assignment in Australia; he is a non-voting member of our  faction's Economic Commission. There is a work group that is  working also on the question of taxes. But we cannot come  forward with our ideas right now because we have already  experienced the governing coalition stealing the ideas of others  and offering them as their own.    [Egle] Could you tell us specifically what you have  accomplished in the legislative process?    [Straume] No one is permitted to loaf in our faction,  everyone must do something. I could mention that I submitted  about 20 proposals pertaining to the proposed law on city  council, district council and township council elections, many  of which were adopted. Thus, for example, the number of deputies  in the Riga council was increased from 45 (as found in the  proposed law) to 60.    [Egle] They say that your faction is almost the only one in  the Saeima that does not have internal discord. Do you really  not argue in your closed sessions?    [Straume] But that is why those are closed sessions, so that  we can argue it out and afterwords come forward with one  position. We truly strive to announce ourselves as a collective,  and, if that succeeds, then we will be able to thank mainly  Maris Grinblats, our faction chairman.    [Egle] You yourself feel good in the Saeima?    [Straume] Yes, and why not? But I hope that I never "get  glued" to this chair. I have adapted to the environment, but I  strive to mobilize myself, so that the routine does not become  too pleasant. In my free moments I think about what has happened  in the Saeima and I always remind myself why I came here.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: EGM agrees new financial flexibilty for Kalamazoo Kalamazoo Trust, the traditional majority holder of the equity in Kalamazoo, the computer services and printing systems company, yesterday agreed to the erosion of its control at an extraordinary meeting in Birmingham. Directors of the company, given new financial flexibility, are now likely to make acquisitions of computer services companies in continental Europe. One purchase will probably be completed shortly. The Trust, once known as the Kalamazoo Workers' Alliance, has held 51.5 per cent of the company's equity on behalf of the employees since 1971. It was set up in 1948 by the Morland and Impey families and endowed with 39 per cent of the equity. The original purpose was for the employees eventually to obtain outright control. The employees' equity is now likely to be diluted over the medium term to about 45 per cent, as a result of decisions taken at the EGM. Directors now have the power to issue shares up to the equivalent of 5 per cent of the share capital. This will enable them to use paper as well as cash to make acquisitions. The present board is anxious to take advantage of sluggish markets in Europe to broaden its continental base. The equity change comes against the background of a shift in emphasis at Kalamazoo from printing systems to computer services. This has produced a recovery in profits and encouraged the shares to rise this year from 26p to a high of 116p, where they closed unchanged yesterday. The EGM also agreed to a thrift plan allowing present and former employees to save for the purchase of shares, with the company awarding one share for every one bought. It approved share option schemes for senior managers. Company directors have been negotiating for a dilution of the trust's equity for at least three years, but latterly there has been some opposition.</p>

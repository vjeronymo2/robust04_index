			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 24 Mar (TANJUG) -- The deputies of the  People's Assembly of the Srpska republic today adopted a report  on the course of the Geneva talks and the Serb delegation's  stances on the negotiations.    The conclusions are that the platform on future talks  remains  the same and that any possibility of the Srpska republic joining  the Croat-Muslim federation is ruled out. However, the  possibility of forming links with the newly created entities  remains open, but only after the strategic interests of the Serb  nation are realized.    The session of the Srpska republic people's assembly resumed  work at 1800 with discussion of internal policy. This part of  the session is held behind closed doors.</p>

			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: UK property Having slid down the snakes during the recession, fund managers are now desperately trying to shin back up the ladders as recovery takes hold of the property market. Some estimates suggest up to Pounds 10bn of investment money is now looking for a home in bricks and mortar. Not surprisingly, yields on prime property have fallen sharply as a result. Demand has been particularly strong for central London offices where initial yields have dropped to 7 per cent. That represents only a small premium over the yield on long-dated gilts, suggesting that some fund managers' spectacles are steaming up about the outlook. Indeed, after taking account of the fact that many tenants are currently paying well above market rents, the implied yield may be as low as 5 per cent. Property yields may nudge still lower, especially if interest rates continue to fall. After all, returns available elsewhere may be particularly meagre in the brave new world of low inflation. But the trouble with investment by default is that it invariably results in faulty investment. The danger is that funds will repeat the errors of the 1980s, either paying too much for prime properties, with little prospect of income or capital growth, or settling for secondary locations, which may perform poorly over the long run once development activity begins again. If Friday's fall in the equity market were to continue, some of the pent-up demand could be released. At some point, asset allocation committees might be tempted to switch funds earmarked for property back into 'cheap' equities.</p>

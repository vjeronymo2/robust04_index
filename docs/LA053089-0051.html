			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JULIAN GUNFIGHT LEAVES TWO DEAD  </P> <P> Two people were shot and killed Monday night in a gunfight that sent sheriff's  homicide detectives to the east side of Julian. An unknown number of suspects  were still at large, and the motive for the shooting was unknown.  </P> <P> Sheriff's dispatcher Leslie Roeder said one of the victims was dead before  authorities reached the scene about 7 p.m., and the other was pronounced dead  by the Life Flight medical crew after it arrived.  </P> <P> Roeder said the shooting occurred along the highway about a quarter of a mile  west of the Banner Store in the 36300 block of Banner Grade Road, near the  bottom of the grade as California 78 winds eastward from Julian.  </P> <P> Roeder said further details were unknown because of poor radio communications  between detectives at the scene and sheriff's dispatchers.  </P></p>

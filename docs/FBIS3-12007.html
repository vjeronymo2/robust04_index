In August 1992 Peru temporarily relinquished -- first until  31 December 1993, and then until 30 April 1994 -- the economic  obligations it had under the external common tariffs agreement  and the Andean liberalization program.    Canale will apparently submit on 4 and 5 April in Caracas --  during the next meeting of the Commission, which is the Andean  Pact's top organ -- a proposal for a transition program with a  single 15 percent tariff that will be reduced gradually.    The Andean Group currently has four types of tariffs -- of  5,  10, 15, and 20 percent -- but they are not yet in force because  the tariff levels for some products have not yet been  established.    According to the Peruvian magazine, Peru cannot return to  the  Andean Pact all of a sudden, "because this might affect the  enterprises of the sectors in which distortions remain in the  other Andean Pact countries," which are Bolivia, Ecuador,  Colombia, and Venezuela.    Peruvian Exporters Association (ADEX) representative Eduardo  Irigoyen, a member of the Metal Mechanical Committee, has said  that it is essential to return to the Andean Group because his  sector and the chemical, lumber, and fishing sectors have great  comparative advantages with respect to the other Andean Group  nations.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Individual stocks stand out in Paris and Milan INDIVIDUAL stories helped Italian banks rise and French blue chips fall, while generalities produced a technical gain for German equities, writes Our Markets Staff. Madrid was closed for a public holiday. PARIS eased in thin trading which was dominated by Total, the oil group which is suffering from a succession of bad news items. The CAC-40 index fell 6.97 to 1,786.65 in low turnover of FFr1.67bn, of which FFr210m was generated by Total. Total, which last week disappointed investors with news of a FFr600m worth of restructuring and asset writedowns and a restriction on shareholder voting rights, fell as low as FFr228.10 on news of an explosion at its refinery in southern France. The refinery accounts for about a quarter of its domestic annual refining capacity. The stock later recovered to close FFr3.60 lower at FFr235.90. Bic, the manufacturer of disposable cigarette lighters, razors and pens, saw its shares fall to FFr865 on news that a US court had awarded Dollars 22m against it in damages. But the shares later closed down FFr11 at FFr896 in reasonably heavy volume of 60,000 shares. LVMH lost another FFr19 to FFr3,560 on continued fears about the impact of a trade war between Europe and the US. There were also concerns that analysts' forecasts for 1993 were still too high. MILAN continued to focus on privatisation stocks, especially state-controlled banks, following Friday's leak of a government document, and yesterday's announcement by Iri that it would sell its entire 67 per cent stake in Credito through an international competitive auction. Dealers said that the buying of bank stocks was predominantly domestic. The rest of the market was quietly easier as the Comit index stood 0.18 down at 432.59 in turnover estimated at slightly more than L150bn after Friday's L161.7bn. Credito Italiano led the gainers, as it rose L220 or 10 per cent to L2,430, reaching L2,560 in the afternoon in London. Banca di Roma added L120 or 6.6 per cent to L1,950 and Banca Commerciale Italiana gained L300 or L8.3 per cent to L3,925. Despite denials from Fiat that it planned to sell off Rinascente, the retailer's savings shares were delayed from trading because buyers outnumbered sellers. They finally settled at L3,140, up L140 or 4.7 per cent; Fiat fell L169 to L4,381. FRANKFURT combined fact with fantasy in a thin market as the dollar rose and dealers speculated about interest rates ahead of this week's Bundesbank meeting, causing export-oriented equities and the bond market to rise in tandem. Bond and stock futures rose, as the Bundesbank's average bond yield dropped 23 basis points to 7.25 per cent after rising 15 points last Friday. Short-covering drove exporters and other dollar-sensitive stocks up as the DAX index rose 21.64 to 1,508.80. Turnover rose from DM3.7bn to DM4.3bn. Among obvious dollar beneficiaries, in carmakers and engineering, Daimler rose DM14 to DM524.50 and Volkswagen DM9.50 to DM276, and MAN and Linde put on DM8.50 to DM256.50, and DM13 to DM672 respectively. Other dollar-sensitives included Degussa, which trades precious metals in one of its sectors, and Metallgesellschaft which is active in non-ferrous metals, registering gains of DM18 to DM316, and DM12 to DM322. STOCKHOLM gained 1.6 per cent on the firm dollar and expectations of positive nine-month earnings reports. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 11.3 to 735.5 as turnover jumped to SKr511m from SKr282m. Astra A shares rose SKr11 to SKr598 ahead of its results, due tomorrow. Market estimates for its nine-month pre-tax profit range from SKr3.4bn to SKr3.6bn after SKr2.58bn in the year-ago period. Electrolux B shares added SKr6 to SKr177 ahead of its results, due on November 19. BRUSSELS closed mixed as Delhaize continued to dominate trading. The Bel-20 Index lost just 0.87 to 1,133.60. The decline in Delhaize shares slowed after its heavy fall last week due to adverse publicity surrounding its US unit, Food Lion. It ended BFr16 lower at BFr1,470 and some bargain-hunting was evident. AMSTERDAM retreated from the day's high to close mixed. After a high of 104.1, the Tendency Index finished up 0.3 at 103.7. Unilever, ex-dividend, fell a net Fl 4.02 to Fl 184.60 on continued disappointment about its third-quarter results. The smaller food stock, Nutricia, gained Fl 5.50 to Fl 119.00 on a report that Germany's Altana was interested in buying it. DUBLIN saw more fall-out from the troubles of GPA, the aircraft leasing group, as the big domestic banks dropped and Irish Life - which fell 5.7 per cent last week on its exposure to GPA equity - lost another 8p to 140p. The ISEQ overall index closed 15.67 lower at 1,108.90, threatening a 1992 low of 1,094.88. Bank of Ireland fell 3p to 154p and Allied Irish Banks by 6p to 151p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- November 9                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30       11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1039.46    1041.68     1042.82    1043.06 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1108.42    1110.23     1110.85    1109.94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00       15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1044.38    1043.70     1042.86    1043.29 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1110.84    1110.29     1109.22    1108.00  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Nov 6     Nov 5     Nov 4     Nov 3     Nov 2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1038.28   1038.93   1037.06   1038.76   1032.82 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1111.70   1109.13   1105.82   1105.49   1095.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1044.52 ; 200 - 1111.95 Low/day: 100 - 1039.46  200 - 1108.00  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

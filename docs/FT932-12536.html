			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Civil servants call for code of ethics THE UNION representing Whitehall's top civil servants yesterday called for an independent commission of inquiry to examine the relationship between the Civil Service and ministers. The First Division Association told the cross-party Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee the commission should draft a code of ethics to strengthen the political neutrality of the ser-vice. Ms Elizabeth Symons, FDA general secretary, said public confidence in the Civil Service had been shaken by events such as the sale of arms to Iraq revealed in the Matrix-Churchill trial, sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism and the pit closure fiasco. A code would set out the rules governing relationships between civil servants and ministers, Ms Symons said. The conventions under which the Civil Service had operated since the last century needed updating following a decade of radical managerial reform in the Civil Service. An independent ombudsman was needed, she said, to whom civil servants could appeal when they believed they had been asked to work outside normal Civil Service rules. Ms Symons said the union regularly received complaints from members about things they had been asked to do. In most cases, members were unwilling to use the current appeal procedure which requires them to raise complaints with their managers. MPs also heard a call to introduce renewable, fixed-term contracts for top policymaking civil servants from Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Forum, a free-market think tank.</p>

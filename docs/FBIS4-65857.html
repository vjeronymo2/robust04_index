			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 24 (AFP) -- Russia intends to sign  NATO's partnership for peace (PFP) programme of military  cooperation with countries of the former Soviet bloc, Russian  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said here Tuesday [24 May].    Speaking after a meeting with NATO defence ministers, he  said  Russia would sign the programme "without setting forth any  conditions."    This contradicted a remark Grachev made on his arrival here  earlier in the day -- that Russia wanted the partnership accord  accompanied by a separate agreement with NATO on bilateral  political relations.    He told journalists after the meeting that the partnership's  framework agreement "does not fully set forth the principles and  themes of cooperation (as sought by Russia.)"    The framework accord lays out the basis of military  cooperation but it does not detail the specific levels of  activity which each country of the partnership will contribute  to the programme.    The Russian general said he would set forth the details of  Russia's proposed participation here Wednesday during a meeting  between NATO and its Eastern Bloc partners in the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council.    Reacting to persistent reports that Russia might not sign  the  partnership accord unless it gets a parallel political accord  with NATO, Grachev said: "President (Boris) Yeltsin has made it  clear that Russia will join the PFP."    He gave no date for the signing. But the general added that  the Russian military was "ready and willing" to cooperate in the  partnership with the military structures of NATO and the former  Eastern Bloc members of PFP.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Technology: Faster than a speeding chip - The race to build more powerful computers at cheaper prices A new generation of microprocessors that promises to improve the speed and performance of computers was unveiled in San Francisco this week. Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems each described 'superscalar' devices upon which they will base their future products. These super chips will be the engines of tomorrow's computers and will determine the fortunes of some of the world's leading computer companies. Used alone, they will power workstations that bring the performance of a supercomputer to the desktop. Banded into groups for 'multiprocessor' systems they will be used to create machines that will usurp traditional minicomputer, mainframe and supercomputer designs by reducing the cost of computer power. Traditionally, the announcement of new semiconductor designs has signalled the direction of computer products two or three years in advance. However, the new microprocessors unveiled this week will be incorporated in computers scheduled for shipment to customers later this year. The front runner in the superscalar speed race is Digital. Its 'Alpha' chip can achieve a theoretical peak performance of 400m instructions per second (mips). Typical performance in a computer system is expected to be 150 mips. The speed advantage of superscalar microprocessors comes from their ability to process more than one instruction simultaneously. Traditional microprocessors carry out one calculation at a time. The pace at which new instructions are fed to the microprocessor is also much higher. Digital's Alpha chip, for example, operates at a 200 MHz clock rate, several times faster than the microprocessors used in today's personal computers and workstations. For Digital, the Alpha chip represents the culmination of a four-year effort to create a computer architecture that will enable the company to reclaim technology leadership. 'Alpha is the core technology for the company's future,' says Peter Graham, project manager. Alpha will drive a new family of products ranging from workstations to mainframe computers which Digital plans to announce soon, with shipments to begin before the end of the year. Alpha systems will be about three times faster than equivalent systems in its Vax product line. Digital is engaged in talks with Microsoft about putting 'Windows NT' software on Alpha systems. Unlike other microprocessors, Alpha is designed to run any operating system, including new ones that may emerge towards the end of the decade, Digital says. With the launch of the Alpha chip Digital is also adopting new business strategies. In a break from past practice, the company will license the design to chip makers for sale to other computer companies. It will license Alpha software and if required provide support services to companies designing Alpha-based systems. Already, Cray Research, the leading supercomputer manufacturer, has said that it will use the Alpha chip to build a 'massively parallel' supercomputer - which will process thousands of instructions simultaneously. Next week, Digital is expected to announce another licensing arrangement with a computer company that will build Alpha computers. While Digital's Alpha chip is a new computer architecture, HP has applied superscalar techniques to accelerate the performance of the PA-Risc microprocessor design that it uses in workstations and multiprocessor minicomputers. The HP chip will boost computer system performance by more than 50 per cent, the company claims. HP has working prototypes of computers based upon the chip in its development facilities and plans to introduce them before the end of the year. HP's plans include a desktop workstation with a performance rating of more than 100mips. That is four to five times faster than current products from competitors. HP maintains that its superscalar version of PA-Risc will enable the company to maintain its lead in system performance, despite Digital's claims for its new Alpha chip. 'We deliver the powerful systems today that other companies are now just talking about building some time in the future,' says Willem Roelandts, vice president and general manager of HP's networked systems group. 'Producing a fast chip is only the first step'. For Sun Microsystems, however, applying superscalar technology to its existing Sparc microprocessor has proven to be a challenge. Unlike Digital and HP, Sun does not have in-house semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Sun has been working with Texas Instruments to implement the superscalar version of its Sparc Risc microprocessor. The SuperSparc represents a critical development for Sun, which is trailing competitors HP and IBM in terms of workstation performance. The performance of Sun's SuperSparc is expected to be about 85 mips, well below that of Digital's and HP's new devices. It may also, however, be cheaper to produce. Despite its slower speed, the new Sparc chip is ensured a leading role among this new generation of microprocessors. Sun, ICL and other Sun partners have announced plans to market computers based upon the SuperSparc chip this year. IBM is already one lap ahead in the microprocessor speed race with its 'Power' microprocessor architecture, used in the RS/6000 range of workstations. IBM is now believed to be developing several versions of the 'Power' chip including low-cost models for use in PCs and high-performance versions that will continue its challenge in the workstation market. Nor can Intel, the microprocessor market leader, be counted out of the race. The chip maker is preparing to launch a version of its 'x86' microprocessor family later this year based upon a superscalar design with performance of close to 100 mips. While the microprocessor chips described this week by US companies are destined to become the powerhorses of the computer industry, two of Japan's electronics giants, Hitachi and Fujitsu, provided a glimpse of the types of microprocessor chips that can be expected in the next century. Hitachi described an experimental microprocessor that is capable of processing 1,000 mips. Fujitsu unveiled what it calls a 'single chip supercomputer'. The Fujitsu device is designed to work next to a standard microprocessor acting as an accelerator to enable even a standard PC to achieve supercomputer processing speed. Add-on circuit boards containing the chip will be on the market by the end of the year, according to the company. The impact of this new generation of chips upon the cost of computer power will be striking. 'The trend is really frightening,' declares Roelandts. 'Before long you will be able to buy desktop supercomputers for Dollars 10,000.' Today, supercomputers sell for millions of dollars. The speed of superscalar microprocessors also raises the question of what computer users will do with so much computing power. 'These devices will bring speech processing, image processing and artificial intelligence applications within the reach of most computer users,' Roelandts predicts. He also suggests that with faster response times computers will raise office productivity by eliminating the delays that interrupt workers. While computer users will look forward to cheaper, more powerful machines, the price/performance trend threatens to undermine the economies of the industry which is struggling to find cheaper ways to deliver more powerful computers at decreasing profit margins. By the end of the decade only three or four microprocessor architectures are expected to survive as industry-standard devices. The rest may prove to be expensive losers.</p>

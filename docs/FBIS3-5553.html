			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chong Tong-u, international affairs desk </F> reporter: "The Two Faces of the U.S. Nuclear Policy" from the  "Reporter's Eye" column]    [Text] A foreign report said that on 6 March the United  States successfully test-fired a cruise missile for the first  time this year over northern Canada. That day, the two missiles  without warheads were fired from a base in the northern edge of  Beaufort Sea in the North Pole and reached Alberta and  Saskatchewan Provinces in west Canada, respectively, after  flying 2,500 kilometers. Concerning this, the U.S. military  authorities merely noted that a cruise missile test-firing was  conducted, and did not elaborate on the functions of the fired  missiles or any other details. It is not necessary for one to  mention again what these missiles are used for.    Almost at the same time, a train carrying 60 nuclear  warheads  arrived in Russia from Ukraine. The warheads, which were left in  Ukraine after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, were to  be moved to Russia and dismantled according to the agreement  signed by U.S. President Clinton, Russian President Yeltsin, and  Ukraine President Leonid Kravchuk last January. This agreement  stipulates that all of the 1,600-odd nuclear warheads and 176  long-range missiles in Ukraine will be destroyed. It is a fact  already known to the world that this agreement was realized  through strong and persistent U.S. diplomatic efforts.    How should we explain the inconsistency of the fact that the  very moment when nuclear weapons of one country were being  destroyed, another is test firing a nuclear delivery system?    The United States voluntarily assumed the role of world  police both in name and reality. This being the situation, the  United States is attempting to inquire into not only political  and military but also economic and even human rights issues of  the nations of the world, and asserts that it will punish them  for their wrongdoings. Strong measures against the North Korean  nuclear development are a practical example of the role of  global police from the military standpoint. Making an issue over  the ROK's National Security Law and interfering in the human  rights issue in China are the result of voluntary assuming the  role of police on human rights. It is true that the voluntary  assumption of the police role by the United States has positive  aspects, because a certain order and system should be maintained  in the international community, just as in relations between  individuals, and because the United States has become the only  superpower of the world, both in name and reality, after the  collapse of the U.S.-Soviet Union confrontation system. Thus, it  is not bad for the United States to assume the role of  maintaining military and diplomatic order.    However, whoever maintains order should be stern with itself  as much as it demands order from others so as to win their  trust. Since the United States demands that the international  community reduce its nuclear weapons and delivery system, it  should also refrain from acting to evoke suspicion from the  international community. Is the United States stern enough with  itself so as to be recognized as the police by the international  community?</p>

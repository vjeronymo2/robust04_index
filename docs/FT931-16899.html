			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Hospitals shrink from coming under the knife: Alan Pike studies arguments about the Tomlinson proposals for London healthcare A PLAQUE in the entrance to the Royal Brompton national heart and lung hospital in Chelsea, London, commemorates a visit by the Queen in February 1991 to open a Pounds 45m redevelopment. In recent weeks the wall displaying the plaque has carried posters reading: 'Don't Let Them Bulldoze the Brompton'. There is a real possibility that, within two years of the royal opening, the government will this month decide to close the Royal Brompton and its neighbour, the Royal Marsden cancer hospital, which has also just undergone an extensive rebuilding programme. Many London hospitals are in a state of uncertainly as they await the government decisions on the recommendations of the Tomlinson report, aimed at reducing hospital beds in the capital. But the fate of the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden has raised wider questions about the quality of National Health Service planning, the financial basis of the recommendations and the future shape of medical research in London. Near the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden looms the new Chelsea and Westminster hospital. It is, with 665 beds, the largest single hospital development in Britain. With its naturally ventilated atrium the size of Wembley stadium, containing trees, plants and specially commissioned works of art, it makes a striking flagship for the NHS. Yet during the Tomlinson inquiry some witnesses seriously suggested that the Chelsea and Westminster was never needed. It will open next month - but the Tomlinson report concedes that it will add to the vulnerability of Charing Cross teaching hospital, relatively nearby in Hammersmith. Tomlinson recommends moving the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden to the Charing Cross site to help form a 'major specialist centre' for treatment, teaching and research. Managers of the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden are opposed to the move. They believe one reason for the recommendation is to find a use for the 1970s Charing Cross building now that the Chelsea and Westminster will weaken its position in the NHS internal market. Ms Phyllis Cunningham, chief executive of the Royal Marsden, said: 'I do not think the Chelsea and Westminster was ever needed, and I am not only saying that with the judgment of hindsight.' Mr Ian Donnachie, chief executive of Riverside district health authority, which runs the Charing Cross and the Chelsea and Westminster, emphasised that the new hospital was planned before the government's health reforms. He added that since its construction was accompanied by the closure of other hospitals, the Chelsea and Westminster represented substantial rationalisation of capacity. 'The fact is that both hospitals exist and the Charing Cross was built to a very high standard. We believe the best policy is to house specialist and research services at the Charing Cross and local services at the Chelsea and Westminster, but with a strong overlap between the two centres,' he said. Even before Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, announces her decisions on the Tomlinson recommendations, however, the plan has run into difficulties. The Institute of Cancer Research and the Thrombosis Research Institute - which work closely with the Royal Marsden and Royal Brompton and are located near them - have decided that they would not follow the hospitals to the Charing Cross site. They favour instead a proposal to link the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden, the research institutes and nearby Imperial College - part of of London University - into a Chelsea health sciences centre on the style of a US medical and research campus. Mr Bill Bain, a health manager in the US and Canada before becoming chief executive of the Royal Brompton, believes the scheme could, at low cost, enhance the international standing of all the institutions involved. He said: 'US experience has shown that such centres do not have to be located on a single site. A move to Charing Cross to put us on one site would detach us from Imperial College and undermine academic links.' The Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden have presented a list of objections to the proposed move to the Charing Cross site. They fear disruption of services, and loss of identity and managerial freedom in the NHS internal market. Much of the Royal Marsden's redevelopment was financed by a Pounds 25m charitable appeal rather than NHS funds, raising legal and moral questions about any government decision to abandon the new facilities. While North West Thames regional health authority told the Tomlinson inquiry that moving the two hospitals would be more cost-effective than closing Charing Cross, a study commissioned by the Royal Brompton and Royal Marsden from Ernst &amp; Young, management consultants, drew the opposite conclusion. The Department of Health has commissioned more consultants, from Capita and Touche Ross, to review the position and 'identify any other feasible worthwhile options'. The work has to be completed by January 18. Whatever decision Mrs Bottomley then makes is likely to lead to the closure of some modern hospital buildings. In a buoyant economy, the cost of abandoning recently opened facilities might be recouped by land sales. But critics argue that there is little hope of that today.</p>

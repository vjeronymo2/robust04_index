			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMCAST CABLE RESPONDS TO LETTER ON REGULATING TV  </P> <P> In response to Mitchell Davis' letter regarding cable in Santa Ana ("Regulation  of Cable TV at Issue in Santa Ana" (March 12), it should be noted that he holds  an inaccurate perception of the facts concerning Comcast Cablevision's  settlement with Santa Ana. Specifically:  </P> <P> * Davis said, "Through aggressive lobbying and political campaign  contributions, Comcast successfully breached its contract with Santa Ana."  Comcast did not make any campaign contributions nor does it have a Political  Action Committee that makes contributions.  </P> <P> * Davis said Santa Ana gave up "control of local origination programming and  interconnects with other cities." Santa Ana did give up control of local  origination programming, but Comcast is guaranteeing more hours of programming  than was being done by the city.  </P> <P> * Davis said, "Santa Ana received nothing except items that Comcast was already  contractually obligated to provide." To the contrary, Comcast will give the  city $602,000 and will provide free use of a $2.5-million Institutional Network  (I-Net). Use of the I-Net will save the city several hundred thousand dollars.  The citizens of Santa Ana will receive credits totaling more than $1 million.  Comcast was not under contractual obligation for any of these items.  </P> <P> If the recommendations of Santa Ana's Cable TV Advisory Board were followed,  the cable company rates would need to be $4.45 per month above those in other  cities. Comcast has one of the lowest rates for basic cable service in Orange  County. Furthermore, Comcast continues to charge the lowest rate in the area  for premium service. These rates are achieved without sacrificing quality.  </P> <P> TOM KEZAR  </P> <P> General Manager  </P> <P> Comcast Cablevision  </P></p>

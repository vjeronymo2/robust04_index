			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: ABB loses battle for Polish boiler maker THE two-year struggle by Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-Swedish power and electrical engineering group, to buy control of Rafako, Poland's biggest power-boiler producer, has been thwarted by a worker and management buyout. The move is a setback for ABB's drive to build a dominant stake in the power-generating industries of eastern Europe. Over the last three years, ABB has concluded 26 joint ventures in eastern Europe, including several in Poland where its main company, ABB-Zamech, employs more than 50 per cent of the 16,000 people now working for the company's joint ventures in eastern Europe. ABB last week announced a joint venture in the Czech republic, where it purchased a 67 per cent stake in the boiler, turbine and power plant division of Prvni Brnenska Strojirna (PBS), one of the country's largest power-plant producers. Last year, it reported Dollars 13m profit on sales of Dollars 125m. The Rafako buyout announcement was followed by a similar development at the Szczecin shipyard on Poland's Baltic coast. The yard, the most modern in Poland, is to be handed over for a 'symbolic fee' to a consortium of domestic banks and companies, as well as management and employees, according to a letter of intent signed yesterday by Mr Janusz Lewandowski, privatisation minister. 'Wherever the terms of purchase offers are equal, plants should stay in Polish hands,' Mr Lewandowski said yesterday. Rafako was founded in 1949 and its boilers are installed in plants throughout the country, making it a key component of any energy industry modernisation programme. Last year, the debt-free company recorded sales of 501bn zlotys (Dollars 31.7m), around 20 per cent to export markets. A new company owned by the 2,500 employees will purchase 50 per cent of the equity for 72.8bn zlotys, while management will subscribe to a further 5 per cent share and workers will individually purchase another 20 per cent. The remaining 25 per cent will be sold through a public offer.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Petr Filippov, chief of the Russian </F> President Administration Analytical Center for Socioeconomic  Policy, by Vladimir Samoylov; place and date not given: "Do Not  Count on Privileges But Speed Up Your Reforms..."]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Samoylov] What is your  opinion on the unification of the Belarusian and Russian  monetary systems?    [Filippov] In my analytical report, I wrote that the  unification of the Russian and Belarusian monetary systems is  inadmissible in the form it is currently being envisioned.    [Samoylov] The saddest thing is that, in Belarus, nobody,  aside from a narrow circle of people, knows all details of the  upcoming agreement, despite numerous reports. Discussions on  this issue generally concern the very idea of unification and  its intentions.... As everybody knows, however, the road to  hell is paved with good intentions....    [Filippov] We knew about all the shortcomings of this  agreement. It would be an economic absurdity if banks that  issue money united, and the Central Bank of Russia became the  main bank, but their budgets and the bodies that draft them did  not unite.    [Samoylov] What threat is associated with this?    [Filippov] Russia would lose several trillion rubles.  Belarus would be threatened with upheavals connected with the  fact that its macroeconomic indexes, such as the level of wages,  are different. This would inevitably lead to tension. Certain  Belarusian products would not be competitive on the Russian  market.    [Samoylov] They are already uncompetitive. The government  claims that this is due to expensive energy resources and high  customs duties.    [Filippov] This could be resolved by signing a civilized  agreement on free trade and customs union. If we abolish  customs duties, internal and external prices will be equalized.    [Samoylov] Many Belarusians have the same opinion. We are  being told, however, that there is no sense in arguing, since  everything has already been arranged, and [Russian Prime  Minister] Chernomyrdin will soon arrive to sign the documents....    [Filippov] My opinion is one, Chernomyrdin's is another....    [Samoylov] What is the opinion of [Russian President]  Yeltsin? Can the president interfere once the agreement is  already signed?    [Filippov] Yes, he can. He stated in his annual address  that "any unifications and unions are possible, however, without  damaging Russia." I will repeat: If the monetary systems are  unified, this will become a millstone around Russia's neck.    [Samoylov] This is very likely to happen however. Certain  doubts are raised here. For example, your miners are not paid  for months, and entire regions are left without money. Is there  a threat that Belarus will end up in the same situation  following the unification of the two monetary systems?    [Filippov] The problem does not lie here. It does not  require much effort to ceaselessly print "zaychiks" [Belarusian  currency] -- as your government does -- to cover budget  shortages, which triggers inflation and price hikes.    The Russian Government endeavors to prevent the unnecessary  issuing of money. Sometimes this even leads to undesired  results. for instance, Finance Minister Fedorov did not print  additional money, and he did not pay peasants for grain ordered  by the state. He did not pay the defense industry for tanks and  missiles either. The defense industry was not able to pay the  metallurgical branch, which was not able to pay miners.  Nevertheless, the government can be blamed only partially for  this.    The delays in payments are also connected with the fact that  commercial structures do not pay one another either. They spent  their money, for example, on privatization, or simply  transferred the money abroad. The strike in Nadyma erupted when  the oil industry refused to exchange their hard currency for  rubles and pay construction workers.    Such phenomena are regulated by the law in the West. In  Russia, as well as in Belarus, there is a gap in the law.    Our principle is that money should be earned, and we will  stick to this.    [Samoylov] Many people here fear that the merger will be  followed by a rapid influx of Russian shadow capital, which will  "prikhvatize" [coined from the word "privatize" and the Russian  word for "appropriate" -- "prikhvatit"] our economy  immediately....    [Filippov] Russia's current commercial structures have some  $17 million in foreign bank accounts. Do you think that it is  impossible to transfer at least part of this money to your  republic right now, and eat Belarus up, lock, stock, and barrel?  Even Switzerland can be eaten up.    [Samoylov] I think that Switzerland is beyond your capacity.  It is a powerful state with clever laws....    [Filippov] Capital flows to those countries which have  better working conditions and legal guarantees. That is why it  comes from Russia. I am convinced that its outflow from  Belarus, rather than its influx to this country, will be even  greater.    [Samoylov] It is this that is happening. By hook or by  crook, all enterprises leave their profits in Russian or other  banks.    [Filippov] This is natural. Nevertheless, our reform has  gone much farther. Our inflation rate is lower. The key thing  is that there is the hope in Russia that reform will be  completed. While in your country.... It is enough to take the  draft law on fixed prices alone....    I suppose that the first country to fall into the abyss of  the terrible economic crisis will be Ukraine. Belarus will  follow suit, while Russia will pull out of the crisis....    [Samoylov] What would you advise us in this situation?    [Filippov] Not to count on privileges that the merger of the  currency systems is supposed to bring, but to speed up reform  and implement a tough financial policy.</p>

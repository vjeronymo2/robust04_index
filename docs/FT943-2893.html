			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Associated Newspapers buys Australian radio stake Associated Newspapers, the UK media group whose newspaper interests include the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, yesterday acquired a 10 per cent stake in Austereo, the Australian radio group which runs stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide and Brisbane. The stake was bought through a placement of 10m new shares at ADollars 1.15, costing Associated Newspapers ADollars 11.5m (Pounds 5.46m). The two companies said the investment followed discussions between them 'over recent months', and that they planned a 'long-term business relationship'. However, Associated's move comes at a time when bid speculation surrounds the Australian group. Melbourne-based Village Roadshow, which has radio interests alongside its larger cinema and theme park operations, has a 14 per cent holding in Austereo, and this week announced plans to raise ADollars 230m of new funds, ADollars 80m of which was conditional upon an unspecified 'strategic investment' going ahead. While Village - in which the UK's Anglia TV and Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network hold minority stakes - has declined to detail its plans, there has been speculation that Austereo could be the target. Earlier this week, Austereo, which only launched on the stockmarket in July, reported a loss of ADollars 8.3m for 1993/4. The figure was in line with prospectus projections, however, and the company has forecast a ADollars 13.9m after-tax profit for the current year. The managing director of Associated Newspapers' radio division in the UK is Mr Charlie Cox, an Australian.</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Constricting bonds The Federal Reserve's decision to tighten monetary policy is both good and bad news for European bond markets. While its determination to keep the lid on inflation should ultimately be positive for longer-dated bonds, uncertainty over interest rates may create nervousness at the shorter end of the market. In theory there ought to be no reason to prevent transatlantic interest rate trends diverging. The US economy has been recovering, albeit patchily, for some time, but continental Europe remains in recession. Even the UK recovery is not yet entrenched enough to raise worries about capacity bottlenecks. Yet much depends on how far the Fed tightening is reflected in a stronger dollar. The Bundesbank appears increasingly to take the exchange market into account when making interest rate decisions. It is less likely to cut rates if the D-mark is weak. Increased caution on this score would raise new difficulties for other continental countries such as France, which continue broadly to follow the German example on rates. The Bundesbank's concern reflects its awareness of the need to attract capital to finance Germany's large public sector deficit. That need exists for the UK too, despite the government's diminishing funding requirement. Bonds would look uncomfortable at a yield discount to their US equivalent if the dollar strengthens sharply. So would gilts at a premium of only around half a point.</p>

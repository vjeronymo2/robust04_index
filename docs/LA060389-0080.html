			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DONALD BALLMAN, FORMER DOW CHIEF, ARTS PATRON, DIES  </P> <P> Donald K. Ballman, a former Dow Chemical executive, arts patron and longtime La  Jolla resident, died Wednesday at his daughter's home in Hinsdale, Ill. He was  79.  </P> <P> Before his retirement from Dow Chemical Co. in 1973, Ballman's life had been  dedicated almost completely to the company.  </P> <P> "To be honest, his hobby was his business," said Robert L. Keyser III,  Ballman's son-in-law. "He was committed to Dow."  </P> <P> Ballman joined Dow Chemical as a sales trainee and rose to senior executive  vice president and the board of directors during his 36-year career with the  company.  </P> <P> He organized and managed the technical service and development departments, and  he established Dow's marketing research department, which introduced Saran  Wrap, the company's first consumer product, in 1953.  </P> <P> After he moved to La Jolla in 1973 from Midland, Mich., with his wife,  Elizabeth, he became a world traveler and a patron of the La Jolla Museum of  Contemporary Art. He was president and a trustee of the museum, treasurer and a  board member for the Scripps Clinic &amp; Research Foundation and a member of  the La Jolla Rotary Club.  </P> <P> "He was a born leader, but he also had a very artistic, sensitive side," said  Hugh Davies, director of the La Jolla museum.  </P> <P> Ed Marston, a friend of Ballman's for more than 15 years, said, "He was a smart  cookie. I think he was quite a financial man. He always followed the blue-chip  companies. He was never for this fly-by-night stuff."  </P> <P> Ballman was born in Indiana in 1910, and he received bachelor and master of  science degrees in chemistry from Indiana University, which he entered at age  15.  </P> <P> Ballman's wife died in February. He is survived by his daughter, Brenda Ballman  Keyser, and his grandchildren, Elise and Hanni Keyser. The family has asked  that any contributions be made in his memory to the Ballman Building Fund at  the museum.  </P></p>

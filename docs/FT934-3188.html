			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Poll shows election strength of Russian neo-fascists Russia's neo-fascist party could become the second-largest faction in the parliament which Russia will elect on Sunday, according to a survey by one of Russia's more authoritative pollsters. A poll by the All-Russian Centre for Public Opinion Research, which cannot be published inside Russia in the week before elections, gave Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic party 14 per cent support among voters who have decided how they will vote. Mr Zhirinovsky's party is anything but liberal-democratic, promising to conquer Russia's neighbours, including Turkey, to gain access to warm-water ports. Domestically, he is offering Russians who feel impoverished and humiliated an alternative to the Communists of the discredited past and to the various democratic parties which are promising ambitious market reforms with varying degrees of pain. The poll puts the extreme nationalist leader behind Russia's Choice, headed by deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar, with 22.3 per cent support. It coincided with warnings of 'a new round of struggle and new conflicts' from President Boris Yeltsin if Russians failed to support the constitution, which would give him sweeping powers, in a referendum, also on Sunday. However, Mr Sergei Yuzhenkov, deputy head of the federal information centre and an organiser of Russia's Choice, said even if Mr Zhirinovsky did well, Mr Yeltsin would be free to choose whatever government he pleased. He added that if the constitution - which empowers the president to dissolve parliament if it turns down his candidate for prime minister - was rejected, Mr Yeltsin would continue to rule by decree until the new basic law was pushed through parliament. Although Russian polls tend to be less reliable than those in the west, this survey indicates the effectiveness of Mr Zhirinovsky's homespun campaign in exploiting the weariness of Russian voters with their present rulers. Mr Gaidar said this week he feared the new State Duma would be as difficult as the old Supreme Soviet dissolved by Mr Yeltsin. Yesterday, he said such results would confirm his warnings of the dangers of the divisions among Russian democrats who put personal ambition ahead of the country's interests. The poll puts Mr Grigory Yavlinsky's reformist Yabloko bloc in third place with 13.6 per cent, followed by the conservative Democratic Party of Russia and the Communists with 7.8 per cent and 7.7 per cent respectively. Together, all democrats who favour similar market reforms would barely scrape together half of the seats in a new parliament, according to the poll. Apart from Mr Yavlinsky, the two other parties which would constitute natural allies for Russia's Choice are the Russian Party of Unity and Accord, headed by deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai, and the Democratic Reform Movement headed by the St Petersburg mayor Mr Anatoly Sobchak.

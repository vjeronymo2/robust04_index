			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Colleges claim victory in dispute Further education college employers yesterday claimed victory in their dispute with the Natfhe lecturers' union over new contracts, after the union announced it was abandoning national negotiations in favour of local bargaining, John Authers writes. About 100 Natfhe members who disobeyed union orders yesterday by holding unofficial strikes, also face possible damages and disciplinary action from college principals. The Court of Appeal last week ruled that Natfhe's national strike called for yesterday was unlawful because college principals had not been given names of all the union members balloted. Lecturers are in dispute with the Colleges' Employers' Forum over new contracts which would halve their annual holiday leave and add an hour to the working day.</p>

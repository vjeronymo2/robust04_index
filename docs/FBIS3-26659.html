			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, 9 Feb (XINHUA) -- Li Daoyu, Chinese  ambassador to the United States, said on 9 February that through  both sides' joint efforts, the Sino-U.S. relationship has  achieved positive progress [ji ji de jin zhan -- 4480 2817 4104  6651 1455] in the past year. In particular, the formal meeting  between President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton in Seattle  last November has brought about a new and excellent beginning  [yi ge xin de liang hao kai tuan -- 0001 0020 2450 de 4104 5328  1170 7030 4551] to the relationship between the two countries,  which is of important significance to improving and developing  their bilateral relationship.    Li Daoyu made the above remarks this evening in his Spring  Festival greetings message to Overseas Chinese and Chinese  Americans in the United States. He added: "It is our hope that  both sides will seize this turning point [qi ji -- 1148 2623],  maintain the emerging excellent momentum in the bilateral  relationship, and proceeding from the overall situation and  long-term interests and through carrying out a dialogue marked  by mutual respect and complete equality, further improve and  develop the bilateral relationship."    When touching on the concern of the broad mass of Chinese  Americans and overseas Chinese for the great cause of the  peaceful reunification of the motherland, he pointed out that  achieving the peaceful reunification of the motherland is the  common aspiration of all the Chinese in China and overseas.  Creating "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," and "one  country, two governments" runs counter to historical trends and  to the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation.    He continued: "We hope that the Taiwan authorities will  stress the great cause of the Chinese nation and will, under the  one-China principle, realize the direct contacts between the two  sides of the strait as soon as possible, so as to eventually  pave the way for peaceful reunification."    In the same greetings message, Li Daoyu briefed overseas  Chinese and Chinese Americans on China's achievements in reform,  opening up, and economic construction last year. He also  expressed sincere thanks for the valuable contributions that  overseas Chinese and Chinese Americans have made to China's  reform, opening up, and economic construction, to the great  cause of the reunification of the motherland, and to enhancing  understanding and friendship between the peoples of China and  the United States.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / International Company News: SME climbs to L42bn on increase in sales SME, the Italian public-sector foods group which is a leading privatisation candidate, raised net profits after minority interests to L41.8bn (Dollars 33.6) in the first half of this year from L33bn in the same period in 1991. Sales rose by 8.5 per cent to L2,961bn, with an increase of over 12 per cent in food production and catering. Turnover in food retailing, SME's biggest single activity, grew by 5.2 per cent to L1,295bn. The company warned that sales in the early months of the second half had indicated a downturn in consumption, implying that year-end earnings might not maintain the growth in the first half. Last year, SME's net profits rose by 4.8 per cent to L125.6bn. Turnover in food production had been swollen by acquisitions, notably in fresh milk, an activity into which SME intends to expand. Catering sales benefited by the opening of new outlets, while retailing suffered from greater competition and a slight fall in consumption towards the end of the first half. Parmalat, the private-sector milk and dairy products group, raised group sales by 24.3 per cent to L803.3bn in the first half of this year from L646.2bn. Net group profits after minority interests jumped by 47.6 per cent to L31bn from L21bn in the previous period, while operating profits rose by 18.8 per cent to L103.1bn from L86.8bn. Net group debt rose to L450bn from L428bn in the first half of last year, but fell as a proportion of group sales, while net financial charges fell by L600,000m to L33.1bn. Parmalat forecast operating earnings for the full year should maintain their current pace. At the net level, it warned higher interest rates and special taxes could have an impact currently difficult to foresee. Turnover was lifted by organic growth and acquisitions, which contributed around L50bn in new sales in the first half.</p>

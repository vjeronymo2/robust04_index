			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Arabs await UN response over Israel's Palestinian expulsions ARAB leaders continued their talks on the fate of the US-sponsored Middle East peace process yesterday as they awaited the reaction of the UN Security Council to Israel's expulsion order against 12 Palestinians living in the occupied territories. The three Arab delegations, which had been due to resume negotiations with Israel in Washington today, have put off their departure for the US in protest at the Israeli action. Mr Yassir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, arrived in Damascus yesterday for talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria following discussions in Cairo and Amman. One of the proposals under consideration is a mini-summit involving leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the PLO. The five permanent members of the Security Council have all individually condemned Israel's action against the 12 Palestinians and held informal consultations last night on the possible wording of a resolution. The US is thought likely to support a resolution denouncing the expulsions if it does not go beyond that issue. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, Israel's prime minister, did nothing to prompt a different US response yesterday as he defended both the expulsion of Palestinians and the extra funds which have been voted for building new Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. The US has repeatedly condemned construction of new settlements, describing the policy as an obstruction to the peace process. 'I know that expulsions must deter terrorist acts ..(and) peace talks have to bring an end to terror,' Mr Shamir said yesterday after addressing the parliamentary foreign affairs and defence committee. Mr Shamir also defended extra funding for Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, pledged to small right-wing parties to win their support for the 1992 state budget last week. 'I don't think it has anything to do with the peace talks and I don't see any contradiction between establishing some settlements and the continuation of the peace process,' he said. Asked how he would feel about a condemnation in the Security Council, even if backed by the US, Mr Shamir said, 'I'd have to say we'd be unhappy about it.'

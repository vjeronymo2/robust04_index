			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Anne Fulda: "Balladur Supports Baudis on His </F> Home Ground"]    [Excerpts] For his first meeting after the presentation of  the full RPR-UDF [Rally for the Republic-French Democratic  Union] majority list last Monday, Dominique Baudis assembled a  fine team in his home city of Toulouse yesterday evening.  Appearing as an American-style star was the prime minister, who  had hitherto observed an expedient silence, having his ministers  say that this European campaign is a "party matter," a  "Giscard-Chirac" list, in short.    Edouard Balladur, who had forbidden members of his  government  to be candidates in the European elections, was to make the  journey with four ministers from his "inner circle:" Philippe  Douste-Blazy, the Centrist responsible for health alongside  Simone Veil, but also Industry Minister Gerard Longuet, who had  made no secret of his preference for Jean-Francois Deniau to  head the UDF-RPR union list, and [Research Minister] Francois  Fillon and [Environment Minister] Michel Barnier.    Similarly, the arrival in Toulouse of 19 RPR fellow list  members was expected, including Helene Carrere d'Encausse,  number two on the list, and 23 UDF candidates.    This learned assembly's aim in this first big meeting was to  encourage the city's son, the "little one" as he is nicknamed in  Toulouse. He is a list leader who preferred to keep his mandate  as mayor of Toulouse but resign from the National Assembly to be  able to take his seat in the European Parliament and who, for  his part, was to uphold once again his concept of a "strong"  Europe which regains "its protective role."    As for the prime minister, he was speaking yesterday for the  first time in the European election campaign after saying very  little in the cantonal elections. [passage omitted]  <H5>  The Prime Minister's Statements </H5>   "The institutional reforms will change Europe's face. We  must prepare for that. The French Government and the French  European deputies will have to work in close cooperation on  these fundamental questions. Together, we will have to  strengthen France's role in Europe, defend France's interests,  and assert our concept of Europe, not a federal concept but a  new concept -- a union of states which pool some of their  abilities, must be unanimous in their most important decisions,  and also keep their sovereignty....    "Europe's situation has also changed since 1989.    "In the economic sphere, the main factor is the serious  crisis which all the member states have experienced, the most  serious in 20 years, which has resulted in the increase in  unemployment.    "Europe seems weakened: While America was returning to  growth, Europe was only recording mediocre results. The member  states are now suffering from high public deficits.    "The monetary crises have presented the threat of a  dismantling of the EMS [European Monetary System] and, in some  sectors, have produced distortions of competition.    "We must be aware that these problems have undermined the  European idea among the public. All too often, Europe has  become synonymous with impotence (against unemployment and in  the Bosnian tragedy) and bureaucracy, with inability to  guarantee peace, with ridiculous attacks on national identity by  Community regulations felt to be pointless and annoying.    "Does the European idea still have a future? Yes, more than  ever. We are here to bear witness to it....    "Expansion is inevitable. It is also desirable provided  preparations are made for it. Of course, this move will take  time. We must help the states of Central and East Europe by  clarifying the future for them....    "The European nations grouped within the Union, which have  become more numerous, will have to adopt a more democratic joint  way of functioning.    "Indeed, distrust of Europe is fueled by the feeling that  decisions are not made at the political level, in other words by  those who are elected and answerable to the people. We need a  more democratic Europe....    "It is necessary for the citizens of each country to feel  closer to the decisionmaking process. It is in this way that we  will popularize the European idea, and not in any other way.  The French no longer accept the fait accompli, and they are  right not to do so.    "In a way, it is a calling into question of 30-year old  methods. The problems are new, they require new solutions....    "A more democratic Europe will be able to develop its  ambitions and apply them to the spheres in which it can be  useful: security, control of immigration, and the fight against  organized crime, and drug trafficking. European cooperation  will be focused on better security for the citizens of every  country....    "We were behind a unique prevention effort, the Pact for  Stability, which will be launched at a conference in Paris in 10  days. Its aim is to encourage the Central and East European  countries to sign among themselves agreements on good neighborly  relations. It is a difficult and huge task, but it is our duty  and in our interest to do all we can to ensure that this effort  succeeds. It is also a "European" task. The Community was  built immediately after the war to overcome long-standing  divisions and hatreds. It succeeded and consolidated peace....    "Economically, France needs the European market, provided it  is organized. Its enterprises enjoy greater competitiveness.  They need a market of the dimension of the one which their  American or Japanese competitors enjoy....    "We must also more effectively defend ourselves against the  rest of the world. The GATT negotiations in 1993 showed that,  when it was united and determined, Europe could see its ideas  triumph. This is an example to be followed. Our deputies will,  I am sure, strive to remember this and guarantee a better  protection of Europe, a defense of its interests which is not  inferior to the defense of the interests of other areas in the  world....    "France's problems are serious, we know the concerns of all.  The French people would not forgive us for political divisions  which made us lose sight of what is essential: devoting all our  efforts to our country's recovery."</p>

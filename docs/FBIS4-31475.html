			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 10 Jun (MTI) -- The proportion of  parliamentary seats has changed by one mandate to the advantage  of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) -- at the expense of the  Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ). The National Election  Committee (NEC) checked the 342 invalid votes cast in the 6th  constituency (Gyor-Sopron County, W Hungary) in the run-off  elections on May 29, and found 68 to be valid. The revision was  initiated by MDF candidate Gyorgy Rasko, who finished ten votes  behind AFD candidate Gyula Varga in the run-off.    Of the 68 votes found valid, 31 went to Rasko, 21 to Gabor  Simon of the Hungarian Socialist Party, and 16 to Varga. Thus  Rasko took over the first place with 9416 valid votes from  Varga, who had 9406 votes.    On Thursday evening, the NEC also examined the approx.  27,000  valid ballots in the constituency, and the recounting affirmed  Rasko's victory. If the Supreme Court does not pass a different  judgement after revising the case at any possible request, then  Rasko will represent the 6th constituency in Parliament.    SZDSZ delegate to the NEC Ferenc Salamon has told MTI, "The  SZDSZ candidate is not likely to turn to the Supreme Court for  supervision. So the National Election Committee will surely  annouce the official final results of the May 29 second round of  the elections at its Monday session. Therefore, the MDF is  almost certain to have 38 seats in the 386-seat National  Assembly, while the SZDSZ will have 69."</p>

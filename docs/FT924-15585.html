			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Arts: Lure of the wanderlust movie - The jungle fever to which many directors are happy to succomb IT USED to be confined to mad dogs and Englishmen. But the 20th century has evolved and so has the art of baring oneself to the elements in far-off climes. Along with other follies once associated with Victorian exploration or safari tourism - shooting rapids, braving monsoons, eyeballing wild animals - going to distant places to seek inspiration or romantic agony has become a cinematic speciality. From the South America of Aguirre, Wrath Of God and The Mission to the Philippines-as-Vietnam of Apocalypse Now, film productions shot in inhospitable locales have grown their own mystical charisma: especially in an age when the march of civilisation has made such remote outposts of Nature rarer and rarer. When two practitioners of the wanderlust movie now squiring their work through London - Roland Joffe (City Of Joy) and Werner Herzog (Scream Of Stone) - were offered to me for FT interviews, I thought about it and then declined. Main reason: I have met both men before and know the crash-course verbal deliriums they supply when asked to rationalise the irrational. For there is an irrational beauty in the hostile-locale movie. The best such films succumb to the hallucinatory transports that afflict travellers lost in the desert, while even the worst provide moments of crazed beauty amid the banality. All the more reason not to trust the directors' PR arias. Doing so, you would believe that two key tendencies mark the wanderlust movie. It never fails to establish a miraculous, mutually improving rapport between the visitors and the place and its people. And it always ensures that no harm physical or cultural is done to the environment and its inhabitants, human or animal. This last tendency is a worthy but menacing one. Though the jungle is still the ideal locale for wanderlust movies, blending lyrical luxuriance with danger and deprivation, it has been tamed by political correctness in recent years. Where the spell of that greatest of all postwar wanderlust movies, Herzog's Aguirre (1973), lay in its surrender to an anarchic Arcadia - a pre-lapsarian Eden where good and evil flourished unclothed and unnamed - modern movies like The Emerald Forest, At Play In The Fields Of The Lord and Medicine Man parcel out Paradise into neat moral equations. Primitive native society is good; civilised white society is bad. And just as the film unit itself must be seen not to harm its virgin location, so we the audience must hiss at any character within the film who tries to deflower the earthly Paradise. Even Herzog in his latest movie Scream Of Stone, shot in a non-jungle South America, has succumbed to the modern labelling-and-lecturing habit. Though this mountaineering yarn often exposes itself thrillingly to its naked locales - mountain peak, glacier, icy crevasse - it is too glibly mapped out with moral markers whenever the characters swap action for dialogue. Note the opposition between the nasty media man played by Donald Sutherland, carrying the bacillus of white American civilisation, and the saintly-laconic native Indians or the Italian mountaineer (Vittorio Mezzogiorno) who lives hermit-like alone with Nature. The best wanderlust films surrender to a dramatic as well as a physical terra incognita; the worst ones take a place and its spirit and torture them to fit a modish or pre-designed thesis. Thus Roland Joffe's films, from The Killing Fields and The Mission to his new City Of Joy, shot on Calcutta streets that proved no less foreign and hostile than the deepest jungle, function more powerfully in their early disorienting scenes - when the viewer like the characters must pick his way through a yet-unmapped labyrinth of places, themes and emotions - than when the signposts come out, moral and geographical, and the director hoves into view offering roadside assistance. There are three main movie-making responses to wild places. Joffe, as City Of Joy demonstrates, is a message-monger foolish enough to try to bend wildernesses to his Western bromides about hope and humanism. Other film-makers like Herzog, at his best, are able to tune into the native wavelength and find inspiration rather than impose it in wild locales. For other film-makers still, a third and more perilous extreme beckons. Here 'going native' implies something grotesque and Conradian: as in the psychological jungle fever that overtook Coppola when filming Apocalypse Now, his updating of Heart Of Darkness. Out in the Philippines, Coppola's unit suffered everything from heart attacks (star Martin Sheen) to weather-destroyed sets (an entire mock-Vietnamese village) to the absurdist coup de grace of a guest star (Marlon Brando) at once too fat and too thinly-prepared for his crucial role. Impossible to believe that this chaos would have raged if the film had been shot in a studio on soundstages and backlots (as Orson Welles planned to shoot Heart Of Darkness back in 1941, before he was sidetracked by Citizen Kane). But equally, Apocalypse Now captures something of the terrible beauty of an uncharted war in an uncharted land, if only by succumbing to some uncharted madnesses all its own. But at best in the wanderlust genre, the spirit of place can be a force disciplining as well as terrifying, authenticating as well as disorienting. It may be Lillian Gish riding the ice-floes in Griffith's Way Down East; or the storm-torn landscapes sculpted by pioneer location director Robert Flaherty in his earliest docudramas (Nanook Of The North, Man Of Aran); or David Lean's epic frescoes of sand and light in Lawrence Of Arabia; or Klaus Kinski on his current-caught Amazonian raft, circling into madness in Herzog's Aguirre; or Herzog (again) conjuring dramatic as well as physical mirages from the deserts of Fata Morgana or Even Dwarfs Started Small. Most recently of all, Bruce Beresford in Black Robe accompanied his crew and actors into Canada's wintry wastes and returned with a film overpowering in its beauty and sense of authenticity. Just as Brian Moore's original novel presented a moral wilderness shot through with primitive, patternless shafts of fear and love and cruelty, so Beresford found in his literal wilderness the courage to step away from stereotypes and storyboarded emotions to confront the savage - noble and ignoble - in us all. The greatest challenge that the far-flung location issues to the film-maker is to throw away the old maps, dramatic as well as geographical, and to honour wild unknown worlds with new and bold dramatic patterns of his own.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>   [Excerpts] Senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers,  including General Staff major generals, two days ago leveled  criticism at the Finance Ministry's decision to allocate only  250 million shekels for the IDF withdrawal from the Gaza Strip  and Jericho and its redeployment.    On 28 January, a discussion was held at the bureau of  Yitzhaq  Rabin, prime minister and defense minister, with all the  officials dealing with the autonomy issue. The discussion was  attended by Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, the chief of staff;  Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, head of the Intelligence Branch; Maj. Gen.  Shalom Hagay, head of the Logistics Branch; the commanders of  the Southern and Central Commands; Israel Police officials; the  head of the Shin Bet; and others. The discussion mainly dealt  with the implications of the IDF redeployment, the autonomy, and  the evacuation of Gaza and Jericho.    At the discussion, it became apparent that the Finance  Ministry will give the IDF only 250 million shekels for the  evacuation and another 100 million for the protection of the  Jewish settlements, in addition to the IDF's annual budget.    According to a senior IDF source, the agreement was made  between the Finance Ministry and the defense establishment,  without the IDF's knowledge, and, according the agreement, the  defense establishment will not ask for additional funds.  [passage omitted]    It has been learned that the IDF claims that the overall  budget required for the evacuation of the IDF from the Gaza  Strip and Jericho and its subsequent redeployment is over 550  million shekels. [passage omitted]    It has further been learned that the IDF will insist on  receiving additional funds for the redeployment beyond the 250  million shekels allocated.    The prime minister said that he understands the situation  and  that he will try to handle the matter.    Speaking at a meeting over the weekend -- held at Bet  Hahayal  in Tel Aviv, and attended by Prime Minister Rabin, Chief of  Staff Baraq, and all the IDF reserves officers ranking from  brigadier general up to former chiefs of staff -- Gen. Uri Sagi,  head of the Intelligence Branch, said that an all-out war with  the Arab countries is not expected in 1994, and that he expects  the political process to continue.    Gen. Sagi also referred to the remarks made last week by  Maj.  Gen. 'Uzi Dayan, according to which a limited war is to be  expected if the talks collapse. Sagi said that there are two  evaluations. Dayan represented the Planning Branch's stand (an  operational evaluation) and, according to the Intelligence  Branch estimate, no war is expected in 1994.    This was the first time the IDF presented the senior  reserves  officers with its plans, debates, and political evaluation.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Property: Hints on French home buying TEN POINTS to remember when buying a home in France: 1 The system Title is recorded at the land registry (bureau des hypotheques). Plans of land areas are kept at the land survey office (cadastre). The town hall (mairie) oversees planning law, building regulations and local authority requirements. 2 The lawyer The notary (notaire) is an impartial law officer appointed by the Ministry of Justice whose role in the purchase is mainly concerned with correctly transferring and registering title to the property. 3 Differences from the UK In France there is no need for a buyer's lawyer to be involved before contracts are signed - meaning, no surveys, no searches and no inquiries before contract. 4 The contract No standard form. At least four variations, any of which may be offered by the agent or notary. All will commit the buyer to some degree. Treat the contract as a basis for negotiation. Do not sign blind. 5 Advice Ask the notary what kind of contract it is. What does it commit you to? What do you lose if you pull out? This could be the time to bring in your own lawyer. 6 Precautions Inspect the property. You buy as seen and approved, unless new. Check boundaries against the plan from the cadastre. Area is not guaranteed. Could rural tranquility be vulnerable to development schemes? Ask the town hall or regional planning authorities. 7 Buyer's costs a) Notary's fees. About 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent of purchase price. b) Old property: stamp duty at about 7.5 per cent on top of price. c) New property: no stamp duty but vat (TVA) at 18.6 per cent included in price. Ask who pays the agent and how much - 5 per cent is usual. 8 Finance Arrange early. The need, or not, for a mortgage will be a contract term. 9 Point of no return If all is satisfactory, pay deposit, customarily 10 per cent, to the notary. Sign and wait for him to tell you he is ready, eight weeks on average. 10 Completion In person or by proxy, before the notary, when he has conducted legal searches, cleared pre-emption rights, investigated title, calculated transfer duty. He holds completion monies. At completion he redeems any mortgages, re-registers titles and keeps title deeds. You insure. Pay local taxes and utilities.

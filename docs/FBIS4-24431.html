			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Yuan] </F>   [Text] Workers in a Hong Kong owned factory have won  higher pay rises after they went on strike protesting against  12-hour working days and wages below the minimum set by labour  regulations.    The three-day strike went ahead as official trade unionists  campaigned for better protection for employees of foreign  investors.    They said reports were increasing of industrial accidents  caused by mismanagement and maltreatment of Chinese workers by  overseas enterprises.    The workers, more than half of about 4,000 employed in a  computer disk factory in Zhuhai Special Economic Zone, went on  strike 10 days ago. Last April, they were offered a 13 per cent  pay rise, well below the inflation rate in the city. They said  that, in defiance of local labour regulations which set a  minimum rate of 325 yuan (HK$289) a month for the average  worker, and a maximum eight-hour day, the company had made them  work 12 hours every day for an average take-home monthly pay of  about 300 yuan. They said that despite the extra hours, they  had received no over-time pay nor had they been given free  accommodation, a condition most foreign-funded enterprises were  obliged to provide.    The dispute was resolved when the employer, with the  mediation of government officials, agreed to meet the workers'  demands.    An official of the Zhuhai foreign investment management  centre said some foreign funded enterprises imposed harsh  regulations on workers, defying labour laws. A labour mediating  centre was set up last year in Zhuhai to handle disputes at  joint-ventures enterprises in the zone.    Official unionists say joint ventures were caught up in more  than 100 strikes in the past year. In 90 per cent of such  cases, the workplace did not have a union or was only partly  unionised. They said a long-awaited labour law giving greater  protection for workers was under deliberation and was expected  to be put forward this year.    The vice-president of the All-China Federation of Trade  Unions, Li Qisheng, said Chinese law stipulates that workers  enjoy collective bargaining power so that, represented by  official trade unions, they could participate in the formulation  of worker-related company rules. However, international labour  unionists say Chinese workers often have difficulties  safeguarding their rights.    Although the federation claimed to represent most workers,  many had quit or given up on it because it failed to offer  practical assistance.    The Chinese Government has outlawed unofficial labour  unions.</p>

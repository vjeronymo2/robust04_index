			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by reporter Roberto Canela] </F>   [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez has  told the Pinar del Rio newspaper EL GUERRILLERO that the  nation-exile community conference scheduled for next April seeks  to return a normal communication process to relations between  Cuba and the exile community. He added that all countries  throughout the world have relations with their residents abroad,  and Cuba should be no exception.    Robaina explained that we must reestablish normal relations  with our community abroad, and that this relationship must  include all residents abroad, not just those in the United  States. He said it is impossible to speak of an opening to the  world without including the existence of our fellow citizens  globally. He added that it is not Cuba that excludes the  hostile, aggressive ones. They exclude themselves.    Robaina concluded by saying that our foreign policy is  integral to a people and a revolution accustomed to surprises  and to gaining power where it appears not to exist. If foreign  policy can do this, it is a reflection of the desires of the  people and the Revolution.</p>

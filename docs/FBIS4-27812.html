			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance  [MOF] revised its tax reform estimates Thursday [2 June] amid  criticism over its earlier ones, adding a sales tax hike to 4-6  percent and extending maturity of stopgap bonds to 20 years.    The report, submitted to the government's tax commission and  the ruling coalition, also adds miscellaneous increases and  decreases in government spending to dodge the criticism that the  ministry intentionally excluded specific items and limited  conditions for its estimates.    The ruling parties and the advisory tax panel to the prime  minister urged the ministry to make such additional estimates.    The earlier estimates presented last Friday only included a  consumption tax hike to 7-10 percent from the current 3 percent,  and limited the maturity for stopgap bonds to 10 years.    The stopgap bonds are to fund a three-year time lag on  conditions of continuing 6.2 trillion yen in tax cuts, including  5.5 trillion yen cuts in income and residents' taxes, and hiking  the consumption tax.    With the tax cuts now limited to the current fiscal year,  Japan vowed in its March market-opening package to decide by the  end of June on a full-fledged tax reform led by semipermanent  tax cuts.    Under the revised report, the ministry estimates a revenue  deficit of 6.4 trillion yen to 11.3 trillion yen in fiscal 2000  with a hike in the consumption tax to 4-6 percent to cover the  tax cuts, bond redemption, and expected increases in social  welfare spending.    For a hike to 7-9 percent, it estimates a deficit of 0.5  trillion yen to 5.3 trillion yen.    A increase to 10 percent is the only estimate with revenue  surplus, ranging from 0.7 trillion yen to 1.6 trillion yen.  [sentence as received]</p>

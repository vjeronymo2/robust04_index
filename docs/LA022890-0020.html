			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNCIL'S ETHICS BILL  </P> <P> In Michael Woo's Feb. 13 Op-Ed piece ("Can't Live With Money -- or Without") he  makes a statement we agree with: "Money is the root of the problem." Since Woo  represents Hollywood where we have lived for more than 30 years, we were  interested in his views on ethics.  </P> <P> Our "ethical" council member wrote a letter on behalf of one of his campaign  contributors to the city zoning administrators asking for "every consideration"  in support of this developer's application for a waiver and a variance for  commercial use in our residential neighborhood. Woo's "helpfulness" enabled his  campaign contributor to cut down a 100-year-old avocado tree and other trees  abutting a historic and architecturally unique area which has lent its charm to  scores of Hollywood films and TV productions. Our association now has to retain  expensive counsel to try to undo what Woo did.  </P> <P> It's ironic that a few years ago we were forced to hire a high-priced lobbyist  to gain access to Woo to stop another obnoxious intrusion into our  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Woo may run for mayor. His scheme for public financing would finance his  ambitions.  </P> <P> CORT QUICKEL  </P> <P> SUSANNE QUICKEL  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

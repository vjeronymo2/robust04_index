			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Local giant gambles all to win US telecoms war: A monopoly that wants to allow rivals to compete A MODEST-SIZED telephone service company in western New York state may be about to show the Dollars 90bn (Pounds 58.4bn) US local telecommunications industry the best route to prosperity in the next century. Or it could be heading for a bloody nose. Rochester Telephone has set the US telecommunications industry a-buzz with a plan, announced in February, voluntarily to abandon its local monopoly around Rochester and allow rival telecommunications businesses to compete against it. Rochester was the first of the monopolistic local US phone companies to propose such a course. And while a second company, the huge, Chicago-based Ameritech, has since weighed in with a competitive proposal of its own, the Rochester scheme is in several respects more radical. 'We're convinced we're looking at something which will be the model for how services are delivered in the industry in every company eventually,' says Mr John Purcell, Rochester's corporate vice-president for planning. At the very least Rochester has one of the most coherent strategies in an industry which often seems to be fumbling as it tries to come to terms with a fundamental change of environment. The monopolies enjoyed by the local industry - which comprises seven so-called 'Baby Bell' regional companies and a host of independents such as Rochester - are beginning to break down, thanks to the new technologies of high-capacity fibre optic cable and cellphones. New competitors are starting to eat into the phone companies' most lucrative existing businesses, and threaten to take a large slice of promising new ones, such as interactive video to the home. Rochester Telephone, which is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, has a history of innovation. In 1970 it was the first US telecommunications group to allow consumers to own, rather than lease, their own phones. And it was the first local telecommunications company to set up its own long-distance business in 1984, when this was made possible by the court-ordered break-up of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. The company realised that slow population growth in the Rochester area would not support its ambitious expansion plans. Hence its takeover of 37 local telephone companies in 15 states over the past six years. It now wants the New York state commission, which oversees its affairs, to give it permission to divide its Rochester area telecommunications operations into two separate businesses, each with their own boards and balance sheets. Above them would sit a new holding company, responsible for the 37 out-of-state phone companies and Rochester's cellular radio interests. One of the two, with the working name of R-Net, would take over the vast bulk of the Rochester area assets - the basic telecommunications transmission and switching network. It would become a wholesale seller of these services to other telecommunications companies, which would add value and retail the services on to the consumer. The second Rochester company, dubbed R-Com, would be one of these competing retailers. It would take on Rochester operations that involve marketing, customer relations, voice mail, inside wire maintenance and yellow pages. R-Net's prices would remain subject to regulation and it would have to sell its services to both R-Com and newcomers at the same price. The retail market, however, would be freed from price regulation. Why destroy your own monopoly? The main reason is that competition is coming anyway. The city already has a so-called 'competitive access provider' - a company that uses its own fibre optic circuits to cream off bulk business customers. The provider is partly owned by the local cable television company, Time Warner, which is itself building a fibre optic backbone into its network that could ultimately be used for telecommunications traffic. Rochester Telephone hopes that by taking the competitive initiative - and simultaneously getting rid of much of the regulatory restraints that accompany its monopoly position - it has a much greater chance of remaining in the driving seat of an industry which, says Mr Purcell, is changing at 'warp speed'. 'If we are right and we see the way the market is developing, and we get there first, we have a huge strategic advantage,' he adds. The precise form of restructuring proposed by Rochester could also work to its advantage. A stand-alone R-Net, offering one of the most advanced local networks in the US to all comers, might be able to deter potential rivals from building their own infrastructure. The main dangers will be to R-Com, which seems bound to lose some of its market share to new retail rivals. The key questions are how much, whether this will be offset by a great expansion in the market as competition fosters demand for new services, and the effect of these forces on prices. Rochester, like other regulated phone companies, is required to subsidise its residential services which are extremely cheap - Dollars 13 a month for a basic service with unlimited local calling. To win regulatory support for its plan, the company is proposing to keep its residential prices static until 1995, with inflation-based increases between then and 1998. Mr Purcell hopes that prices will rise after that. The final advantage of the restructuring is that the new holding company might be able to move much more quickly to raise capital and launch takeovers - like a much more entrepreneurial business. It is likely to be 1994 before the New York commission, traditionally in favour of competition, decides on Rochester's plan. As it weighs up the benefits to the consumer and company, a question bound to be asked is whether any other company will dare take on entrenched Rochester. Mr Purcell dismisses the fear: 'In the US telecommunications industry, for the past 20 years, every time there's been a window for entrepreneurs to buy wholesale and resell, they've jumped at the chance.' Why should Rochester be any different?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE BREAK-UP WOULD WORK  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Rochester      R-Net     R-Com      Holding                          Telephone                           company  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Revenues (millions)           313*        236        77            - Assets (millions)           1,285         580        13          693** Employess                   2,040       1,400       530          110  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Assets relate to subsidiaries of Rochester Tel outside Rochester area * Revenues exclude subsidiaries outside Rochester  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Rochester Telephone  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

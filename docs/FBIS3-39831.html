			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure </F> by Isabelle Graviere and Jean-Michel Lamy; place, date not  given: "Enlargement Must Result in Progress for Europe Without  Blocking the Decisionmaking System]    [Text] France's representative at the extraordinary  European Council meeting today and tomorrow, which is devoted to  Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway joining the European Union  [EU], reaffirms the preconditions which need to be fulfilled for  any expansion of Europe. In particular he put forward as a  vital precondition that the majority vote should not be weakened  and that Community achievements should be fully respected. In  return, the Twelve may grant a transitional period in the most  sensitive spheres, namely agriculture and fishing. In general,  he thinks that French enterprises should derive a commercial  advantage from it.    [LES ECHOS] Four countries are trying to complete their  negotiations on EU membership before 1 March. What importance  do these new partners have for France?    [Lamassoure] Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway are  democratic and highly developed countries with which we have  numerous historical, political, economic, and cultural ties.  That is why we want them to be capable of joining us. In  addition, these countries represent significant potential  outlets for our enterprises, which have hitherto not been  sufficiently investigated. In 1992, France's trade deficit with  these four countries was 27 billion francs [Fr], with a total of  Fr40 billion in exports but Fr67 billion in imports. By means  of these new memberships, we hope to see our foreign trade with  them balanced (the Norwegian case is special because of our  purchases of hydrocarbons), as was the case with Spain and  Portugal when they joined the Community.    [LES ECHOS] Would it also be an opportunity for European  building as a whole?    [Lamassoure] These countries have economic, cultural, and  political traditions which are sometimes different from ours:  so much the better! France has never thought that Europe  should be a uniform entity. Europe's originality lies in its  variety. But on one condition: We want the candidate  countries, whichever they are -- Austria and the Nordic  countries today, Central and Eastern Europe in the future -- to  accept not only the spirit and letter of the European  institutions but also their ultimate aim. For us, Europe is not  only a market, it is an economic power, a political edifice.  From this viewpoint, we are satisfied with the agreement  already reached with the four candidates on the "foreign and  security policy" chapter which we thought would be the most  difficult. However, they have all agreed to adapt their  legislation to the requirements of the foreign and security  policy.    Having said that, expansion is not an end in itself for the  EU. It does not have a hegemonistic vocation. We will not  measure its success by its final geographical dimension.  Membership is a prospect offered to the European countries  currently outside the EU. It is for them to know whether they  wish to join us and, to that end, whether they are ready to  accept the rules of the European "club."    [LES ECHOS] This means that the countries currently  negotiating with Brussels must make major concessions compared  with their initial demands.    [Lamassoure] They must accept the rules of the game which we  have set for ourselves in all spheres. What is called the  Community achievements. I am thinking in particular of  everything relating to equal conditions of competition, the  agricultural price policy, fishing, and the funding of the  European budget. On these points we can accept transitional  provisions but no permanent exemptions under any circumstances.    [LES ECHOS] Are there other essential conditions for France  to ratify this membership treaty?    [Lamassoure] For us, these negotiations must result in  progress for Europe, not in a questioning of the achievements,  or a threat to our future decisionmaking system. Let us take  agriculture: With our 11 partners, we want to see all the  candidate countries applying the European agricultural prices  from the first year. However, they will have the opportunity,  during a transitional period, to pay their farmers national  income support to compensate for the necessary price cuts in  Austria, Finland, and Norway. These countries have agricultural  prices which are much higher than the European prices.    As for the implementation of compensatory amounts to  rebalance the prices at the borders, the statistics currently  available show that this solution would be too costly for the  Community budget: ECU1.5 billion over five years for the three  countries concerned, of which 156 million would be paid in the  first year. However, all three have a per capita income that is  markedly higher than the Community average, and does not justify  such a contribution from the Community budget.    [LES ECHOS] The candidate countries may also be counting on  regional aid, knowing that the least wealthy regions are  precisely those in which agriculture is less competitive.    [Lamassoure] Absolutely. Alongside the common agricultural  system which we have just discussed, the new members will be  able to benefit from the European regulations on aid to  underprivileged regions, which consists of a mixture of national  and Community aid based on existing criteria. This approach  will make it possible to support the Austrian Burgenland and a  large part of the arctic regions.    [LES ECHOS] Do other issues specific to particular countries  also present a problem?    [Lamassoure] Fishing is one of them. Norway wanted there to  be two "blue Europes" -- ours and its own. There can obviously  only be one. The EU is a single market, meaning the pooling of  resources. Although, here too, we can accept a transitional  period. On the other hand, we certainly have lessons to learn,  in France and in Europe, from the Norwegian fishing policy,  especially with regard to the stringency of their management of  resources and the organization of the producers.    There is also a problem with regard to road transport in  Austria. But France is less concerned than others because French  transporters are only involved in 0.7 percent of truck traffic  between Germany and Italy. Our concern, in this case too, is to  reach a common market rationale as quickly as possible and to  get rid of the bilateral systems which limit relations between  France and Austria.    [LES ECHOS] Does France share the positions of its 11  partners on all these points under negotiation?    [Lamassoure] I think I can say that there is a great  similarity of views among the Twelve. We have had no problem in  drawing up joint positions. And with regard to the Commission,  we will be very vigilant, as we were during the GATT  negotiations.    [LES ECHOS] In all, are you optimistic about the chances of  reaching agreement with the four candidate countries by 1 March?    [Lamassoure] Like most of my colleagues, I think that we  have a 50 percent chance of reaching agreement by the deadline.  It depends on the candidate countries.    [LES ECHOS] Will increasing from 12 to 16 change the EU's  identity?    [Lamassoure] Yes, I am convinced of it. This quantitative  change will also correspond to a qualitative threshold, without  the identity of the four new countries being in question. In  this case, going from 12 to 16 means crossing a threshold. We  have been clearly aware of that since there have been 16 of us  around one table during foreign policy cooperation exercises.  That is why this change within the EU must lead us to rapidly  adapt the Community institutions.    We are determined that this expansion should not be carried  out to the detriment of the EU's efficiency and especially its  decisionmaking system. We have spent years negotiating among  ourselves, with 10 members and then 12, the establishment of an  effective system, with a qualified majority vote within the  Council of Ministers. We can therefore only accept an expansion  if the weighting of the blocking minority within the Council of  Ministers increases arithmetically. In other words, if the four  countries join at the same time, it must go from 23 votes (out  of a total of 76) to 27 votes (out of 90). That is a vital  precondition. Omitting it would amount to blocking the European  decisionmaking mechanism. We are currently divided from our  British and Spanish friends on this point.    The present French Government even wanted more major reforms  to be carried out at the same time as the membership  negotiations. We said that in particular at the European  Council meeting in Brussels on 29 October. The majority of our  partners thought otherwise, preferring that these discussions  should take place at the time stipulated by the Maastricht  Treaty -- in 1996. The countries which are now candidates, if  they have meanwhile become EU members, will therefore  participate with us in the 1996 institutional exercise.    [LES ECHOS] That would not make it impossible to start  thinking about possible reforms within a working group.    [Lamassoure] We are not really in favor of that, because the  reform has been postponed. The idea of a committee of wisemen  does not displease us. I think I was among the first to discuss  it a few months ago. But starting a major debate now without  being able to complete it would only complicate matters, both in  the candidate countries, whose populations will vote in a  referendum, and within the Twelve, where the June European  election campaign is due to start.    [LES ECHOS] In the absence of current thinking by the  Twelve, is there already a French position, particularly within  the government coalition?    [Lamassoure] We must await the political parties' platforms  for the June elections. With regard to the majority, I note  that there are broad areas of agreement between the UDF [Union  for French Democracy] and RPR [Rally for the Republic]. The  working group which brings together the leaderships of the two  parties should produce a joint document fairly soon. But before  changing the institutions, the important thing is to adapt our  Community administration method to the new responsibilities  which the Maastricht Treaty gives us: currency, foreign policy,  internal affairs, and justice. With regard to the currency, we  have an accurately defined administration system which is  centered on the European Monetary Institute.    On the other hand, with regard to foreign policy, internal  affairs, and justice, the treaty only put forward the principle  of European competence and the qualified majority decisionmaking  method for what are called "common actions." It does not  stipulate the preparation of the decision or its funding. So,  it is as if we were pretending to have a common foreign policy  with 12 ministers and no ministry! There is no body around the  Council table capable of evaluating a foreign policy option, of  defining the common interest which is never the sum of the  individual interests, and then ensuring the implementation of  the decision made.    Similarly there is the question of funding this foreign  policy. At present there is only one example: We have decided  on a humanitarian program to help Bosnia, worth ECU48 million,  on a half-Community, half-national basis. But this case is not  a precedent. We do not yet have a joint position of principle.    [LES ECHOS] Do these unresolved problems cast doubt on  expansion to Eastern Europe?    [Lamassoure] We need to solve them, with or without  expansion. With regard to the eastern part of the continent,  France thinks that the definition of relations with Central and  Eastern Europe is a fundamental point on which it wants to make  progress during its term as EU president (in the first half of  1995). There is an urgent need: Hungary will make a formal  application for membership. We have so far told these countries  that they have a vocation to join us, but without specifying the  conditions, the methods, or a timetable. We are proposing to  draw up criteria which will make it possible to assess the  convergence of the economies and societies of those countries  with ours. Specifying that all the Central and East European  countries must be put on an equal footing. We are to have a  discussion at France's request at the European Council of  Ministers meeting on 7 and 8 March.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> A half-dozen paintings by Bill Komoski look like X-Rays of aged wood siding, or  infrared diagrams of brush marks made by emulsion materials reacting to a photo  sensitized surface. In fact Komoski uses only a brush, matte acrylics and paste  to ape the look of machine made effects.  </P> <P> On deep purple-blue grounds, the artist trowels a brush laden with iridescent  violet paint back and forth to create lateral banding. The strips run from  opaque to transparent as the paint on Komoski's brush varies, and he  intentionally alters the width of the striations to jostle readings of figure  and ground. Komoski is deft at highlighting color with lighter accents to  recreate the tinsely look of mylar or a photographic negative.  </P> <P> Highlights also give many canvases the appearance of a strong and inexplicable  vertical light strafing their centers. Some of the works pantomime machine  techniques so well they're distancing and cold, but the good ones address the  whole issue of gesture in post modern art.  </P> <P> The New York school emblazoned original gesture, the color fielders  spiritualized it, Pop art spoofed and demystified it and conceptual art reduced  gesture to pure matter and process. Komoski's paintings are interesting because  they draw from every point along that continuum: look awhile and they're  shimmery and transcendent, look longer and they're poker faced puns  decontextualizing the age-old brush and paint vocabulary of art.

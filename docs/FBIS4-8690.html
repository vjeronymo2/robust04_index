			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F> Horn by Pal Szombathy; place and date not given: "Citizens Do  Not Vote on the Basis of Party Suggestions"]    [Text] One should not attribute exaggerated importance to  declarations made during the election campaign, Gyula Horn,  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] chairman, told us. Gyula Horn  said that the parties winning the elections will be able to form  a government because there are no big differences between the  various programs and many people would like to get into power  and even more people want a change. Speaking about persons,  Gyula Horn said that they would welcome non-party members Ferenc  Glatz and Kalman Kulcsar in the government.    [Szombathy] Although the comparison of various party  programs would make it possible to form coalitions, the attitude  of political forces in the election campaign is weakening the  chances of agreement. For example, the chairman of the  Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], a party you called  unacceptable to the MSZP, called cooperation with the Socialists  "the kiss of death." Can these contradictions be still bridged?    [Horn] One should not attribute exaggerated importance to  declarations made during the election campaign: One can find a  wide gap between the promises of the 1990 election campaign and  the implementation of these promises. There are no major  differences between the programs of leading political parties:  Almost without exception, everyone wants to continues  privatization and agrees with the importance of agriculture.  The difference lies in who wants to do what in reality. We do  not react to various declarations; we only reply to blatant  statements. We treat the accusations in accordance with our  style prevailing so far, and I only react to unfounded  accusations. However, it is a particular development that the  right-wing conservatives and the liberal forces regard the left  as their main opponent. The probable reason for this is that  the socialists are regarded as having the biggest chance of  winning.    [Szombathy] However, there is an interesting harmony between  your opinion and that of [Prime Minister] Peter Boross according  to which both of you count on a conservative-left-wing  competition....    [Horn] With the exception of a few hundred people, no one is  interested in these speculations. Citizens will not vote on the  basis of party suggestions. I never said that that the liberal  parties might not have a weight in the 1994 elections although,  in the long term, I imagine a role similar to that prevailing in  Western Europe for them. To find the common contact points is  much more important than this, because people want change, and  the main goal of this change is to replace the current coalition.    [Szombathy] Together with yourself, several MSZP leaders  expressed their openness toward a coalition made up of the MSZP,  the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and the Federation of  Young Democrats [Fidesz]. Do you think that this is  increasingly strange, given the growing rejection of the Fidesz?    [Horn] I would rather say that all this is manifested on the  part of some Fidesz leaders. I do not attribute particular  importance to these declarations, because Viktor Orban and his  followers change their opinions frequently. However, we will  also stick to our guidelines and ideas after May. Hungary needs  a predictable political activity; I am sorry for the Fidesz  because they gave up their earlier rational and calm policy. It  is difficult to find out why the Fidesz changed their earlier  popular attitude.    [Szombathy] What is your opinion about the chances of  forming a government? It seems that the current system of  political parties in Hungary is still pliable and, thus, it is  no accident that Peter Boross said that the government can still  function as an executive for a long time and that parliamentary  cycle shorter than four years cannot be excluded either.    [Horn] Every day spent in power is obviously important for  the present government. It is terrible to think what can still  happen in the remaining weeks. It is enough to mention that it  was precisely the KDNP that asked that the privatization be  stopped. Coalition talks lasted more than five weeks in 1990  and, presumably, this period of time will not be shorter this  time either. However, a new government can be formed, and the  victorious parties will be able to come to an agreement. Many  people would like to get into the executive power, and even more  people want to get rid of the present style. Thus, individual  and social interests are equal. However, there is a danger,  namely the one predicted by Peter Boross: The new government  will be facing a very difficult period. Stability will require  social dialogue and agreement.    [Szombathy] The party system has partially lost the  citizens' confidence since 1990. Do you think that, after the  current promises, the new government will continue to be faced  with further loss of confidence?    [Horn] The citizens will display confidence and patience if  professional and honest people form the new government. On our  part, we would like to see nonparty-affililated experts in the  next government like Ferenc Glatz or Kalman Kulcsar, people who  stand comparison with their current colleagues. The MSZP will  continue to maintain a social dialogue. The new government will  not have room for maneuver without such a dialogue.    [Szombathy] Do you continue to regard yourself as the number  one target among the opposition politicians?    [Horn] Yes, especially among the client journalists of the  government parties, who are trying to discredit me with every  possible means. One thing is certain: If we have anything to  do with the next government, we will not allow any kind of  government party press around us.</p>

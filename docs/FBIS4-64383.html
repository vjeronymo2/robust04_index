			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 2 (AFP) -- France called on Monday [2  May] for urgent concerted efforts to find a political solution  to the war in Bosnia, warning that pressure to lift the arms  embargo on Serbia and Bosnia would become irresistible.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said there was strong  pressure to lift the embargo from some sections of the U.S.  Congress, the Islamic Conference Organisation and "in France  also."    Addressing a meeting of the Anglo-American press  association,  Juppe said: "Can we continue to resist this pressure? I am no  longer sure. If the situation bogs down, the pressure will  become irresistible."    Without an early political solution, he said, the outcome  would be "the solution of despair, with immeasurable  consequences" and the withdrawal of United Nations peacekeepers.    Juppe called for a meeting of the foreign ministers of  Russia, the United States and the European Union [EU] to  relaunch peace efforts based on the EU's peace plan within 10  days.    He urged unity of approach by Washington, Moscow and the EU  to prevent the Bosnian protagonists from playing off one against  the other, criticising the slowness of "itinerant diplomacy" by  the contact group trying to set up new peace negotiations.    Juppe also called for Brcko, thought likely to become the  next Serbian target in Bosnia, to be declared a security zone  "with an air strike in response to the first Serbian shell."    Juppe said the Serbs were reportedly moving troops and  heavy weapons towards Brcko, where the Bosnian Moslems are  seeking access to the Save River, a tributary of the Danube, as  part of any peace settlement.    The Serbs want control of Brcko to widen a corridor linking  their conquests in eastern and western Bosnia.    The French foreign minister said that Brcko should be added  to the list of six other safe areas in Bosnia including Gorazde,  Sarajevo and Srebrenica.    Negotiations held under EU auspices had been within a hair's  breadth of success before being sidelined by the arrival on the  scene of Russian and U.S. diplomats last February within the  contact group, he said.</p>

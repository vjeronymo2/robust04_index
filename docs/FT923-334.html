			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Special Report on Franchising (4): Resilient in a recession  -The Americans who have had a good year IN DIFFICULT year for US businesses, one of the few bright spots has been the franchise industry. During a difficult period of post-recession stagnation, the franchise industry displayed one of its greatest strengths - resilience in tough times. According to the International Franchise Association, a Washington-based industry body, franchise sales exceeded the growth of the US economy by more than 500 per cent in 1991, rising 6.1 per cent from Dollars 713.8bn in 1990 to Dollars 757.8bn last year, in spite of the near stagnation in the wider economy. Today, 542,000 franchises employ more than 7m people in more than 60 different industries. The outlook remains bright, in spite of modest expectations of growth in the economy as a whole. A study by Arthur Andersen published this month forecast that the number of franchises will grow by 15 per cent in 1992. Total sales are expected to rise by a similar amount to Dollars 812bn, to account for more than 35 per cent of all US retail sales. Ironically, the franchising industry is drawing its strength from the very economic weakness that is troubling the rest of the country. Experience shows that franchising is a counter-cyclical business. During recessions unemployment rises, and large numbers of newly unemployed workers, including many with management experience, are forced to look for new work. In the present recession, unemployment in the US has risen to its highest levels for eight years. Increasing numbers of the newly jobless, particularly those disaffected by life as a regular employee in a large company, have turned to franchises as the best hope of gainful, and relatively secure employment, and become franchisees. For them, a franchise business offers a large degree of independence and potential for profit, a business backed by the financial, marketing and psychological support of the group that owns the franchise - the franchisor. Franchising has done especially well out of this latest economic slump because the rise in unemployment has been unusually marked among well-educated managers in white-collar, service industries. These are just the sort of people that traditionally supply fresh blood for franchises, partly because they take substantial sums in redundancy payments from their jobs, money that can be invested in franchises. Furthermore, many franchising operations cover certain businesses that profit most from providing consumers with quality goods and services at relatively inexpensive prices - which is exactly what people look for when belt-tightening is the economic priority in households. Other factors help franchises prosper in difficult economic times. Co-ordinated marketing and advertising programmes provided by national groups help franchises respond quickly to changes in consumer habits, especially regarding growth in the demand for 'value' goods and services. Demographic trends are also in franchises' favour: as more women work, franchises can fill the gap by taking on tasks normally done at home. Mr Leonard Swartz, a former managing director of Arthur Andersen's franchise consulting services division, says: 'Corporate workforce reductions, shifts in human and financial resources, changing consumer needs, and the rising appeal of entrepreneurship are fuelling franchise growth in the US.' Despite the rosy outlook for franchises, there are some clouds on the horizon. Tensions between some franchisors and franchisees over the terms of contracts have been building, particularly between older, more experienced franchisees operating multiple franchises in a mature market. Growing numbers of these 'multi-unit' franchisees, many of whom have become millionaires from decades of success, are concerned about transferring the ownership of their franchises to family members and about the renewal of long-term contracts. Mr John Reynolds of the International Franchise Association in Washington DC explains: 'Some of these multi-user franchisees are in a tug-of-war with franchisors over what their relationship is going to be like over the next 10 to 20 years. They want a deal for the next 10 or 20 years that is at least the same as, or preferably better than, the one they signed 20 years ago.' It is not just the more experienced franchisees that are getting involved in disputes. Younger ones are just as unhappy with some current contracts, which they claim limit their rights and opportunities for personal financial success, while others claim to have been defrauded by franchisors but, because of their contracts, cannot take up their grievances in the courts. On the other side of the fence, however, franchisors want to maintain control over the franchise system, and ensure any contracts they sign will keep them competitive in the marketplace. The result has been a growing number of contract battles, some of which are resolved privately, some of which go to arbitration, and some of which go to court. To no-one's surprise, government legislators have stepped into this battle, eager to provide better protection for 'David' franchisees against 'Goliath' franchisors. At a state level, the most dramatic change has been in Iowa, where legislation was passed in mid-July that John Reynolds of the IFA describes as a 'radical departure' from the general body of laws and regulations regarding franchise contracts. 'Under the Iowa law, in the contractual relationship the franchisee gets more leverage at the expense of the franchisor's control over the organisation,' says Reynolds. The Iowa statute bars termination of franchisee contracts without advance notice, requires franchisors to accept sales of franchises to relatives and qualified buyers in some circumstances, and voids all contracts between parties that call for legal disputes to be resolved outside Iowa. Franchisors were quick to respond. MacDonald's and Holiday Inn, two of the country's biggest franchise groups, have filed lawsuits in Iowa to challenge the constitutionality of the law's provision regarding pre-existing contracts, and industry observers believe the suits have a fair chance of success. Franchisors, however, face a fight not just in Iowa. Many states are currently considering some form of new legislation for franchises, and at least five are reported to be considered following Iowa's radical route. At the Federal level, Congressman John LaFalce, chairman of the House Small Business Committee, has filed two pieces of legislation that travel much the same legislative path as Iowa's. To counter the new regulations, franchisors have been lobbying at the local and national level, arguing that the new laws could discourage franchisors from creating new franchises because the strict legislation make expansion economically unviable. Despite the rash of contract disputes and threats of tougher legislation, industry observers do not expect the problem to prove a major hindrance on franchise growth in the US. John Reynolds of the IFA is confident about the future: 'Franchisors and franchisees will eventually realise that there is more to be gained by avoiding costly contract disputes, legislative battles and litigation, because both sides lose when that happens.'</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OLDER HOMES AND QUAKE DAMAGE  </P> <P> Bill Ross' answer to a homeowner's question about bolting a house to its  foundation in the June 10 Ask the Inspector column was apparently not well  researched, and may have been a disservice to homeowners.  </P> <P> The vast majority of homes came through in "good stead" during the Loma Prieta  earthquake of Oct. 17, 1989, but more than 23,000 homes were damaged and over  1,000 destroyed.  </P> <P> Much of the major damage occurred to older homes with inadequately braced  cripple walls at their crawl spaces, but there was a large number of homes that  slid off their foundations because they lacked foundation bolts.  </P> <P> Repair of this type of damage is expensive; it often requires wholesale  foundation work and replacement of the crawl space framing and plumbing.  </P> <P> Older homes still pose a significant risk of earthquake damage, not only in Los  Angeles but throughout much of the state. There is a 60% chance of a major  earthquake occurring in the Los Angeles basin sometime within the next 30 years  that may cause much higher levels of ground shaking over a much wider area than  the three earthquakes you mentioned in the column.  </P> <P> Also, you indicated in the column that 1935 was the year when houses were first  required to be more earthquake-resistant. While this may have been the case in  a few communities, houses were being built in many parts of the state without  foundation bolts or cripple wall bracing as late as the 1950s. We estimate that  there are over 2.4 million such homes in California that are at risk from  significant earthquake damage.  </P> <P> A bill pending in the Legislature would require earthquake hazard evaluations  at the time of sale and installation of anchor bolts and cripple-wall bracing  in older homes if they are not present. If passed, Assembly Bill 3561 would  take a big step toward reducing earthquake hazards in older homes.  </P> <P> We agree with you that it would be a "bit close-minded" to exclude an older  home from anyone's plans simply because the foundation is not bolted.  Wood-frame structures remain one of the safest types to occupy during an  earthquake.  </P> <P> But, please consider that it could cost the average do-it-yourselfer only a few  hundred dollars and a few weekends to bolt a house to its foundation and nail  plywood to crawl-space walls.  </P> <P> An owner who hires a contractor can typically expect to pay $1,500 to $4,500 --  roughly 1% of the home's market value. We believe that house-bolting,  cripple-wall bracing, and abatement of falling hazards such as water heaters  are the best forms of earthquake "insurance" a homeowner can buy.  </P> <P> L. THOMAS TOBIN  </P> <P> Sacramento  </P> <P>  Tobin is executive director of the state Seismic Safety Commission.  </P> <P>  Editor's note: Ask the Inspector writer Bill Ross agrees, as does his group,  the California Real Estate Inspection Assn., with the points raised by Tobin  and will delve more deeply into the important issue of foundation bolting in  future columns.  </P> <P> </P></p>

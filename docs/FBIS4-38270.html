			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, QUDS PRESS -- A Palestinian party  participating in the Palestinian self-rule authority council has  criticized PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's  delay in coming to the self-rule areas in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho.    A statement by the Palestinian Democratic Union, FIDA, said  that this delay, whatever its justification or reason, causes  harmful effects on the unity of the Palestinian leadership's  performance in various spheres and on the clarity of the plan of  action. It also paralyzes the capacity of members of the  national authority in carrying out their responsibilities as a  collective team.    The party hinted at withdrawing from the authority and  pointed out that "its support for and continued participation in  the authority depends on the its possession of a comprehensive  national plan to pursue the battle of independence; on the  realization of adequate participation, justice, and equality;  and on the granting of freedom." The statement also called for  accelerating the completion of the authority's domain.    The party is currently represented in the authority council  by its secretary general, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, who holds the  education and arts portfolio, and Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, who  holds the youth and sport portfolio.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A Fraunhofer team headed by Dr. Andreas Weber and  working at the Fraunhofer Institute of Coating and Surface  Technology's Hamburg laboratory is the first in the world to  succeed in precipitating pure, golden-colored titanium nitride  coatings from an organic titanium compound at low temperatures.    Titanium nitride is the hard material most widely used to  coat tools such as drills and milling cutters to enhance their  mechanical resistance. It will also perform a significant role  in future memory chip generations, where it will form the  barrier preventing the semiconductor material, silicon, from  diffusing into the metallic strip conductors.    The Fraunhofer researchers had a number of tricks up their  sleeves: They used tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium as a  volatile metal compound, which they fed into an ECR (electron  cyclotron resonance) plasma together with nitrogen or ammonia.  An ECR plasma is a particular form of excited gas state in  which a magnetic field and an alternating electrical field are  used to project and accelerate electrons onto spiral paths, a  highly efficient method of activating gas molecules by inducing  collision with electrons.  <H5>  Golden Coatings at Boiling Temperature </H5>   The researchers in Hamburg manipulate the gases in this  plasma in such a way that pure crystalline titanium nitride  layers with ideal material properties can be precipitated at a  temperature as low as 100 degrees Celsius; this cannot be  accomplished below 500 degrees Celsius in conventional  processes. The test parameters are set in such a way that the  breakdown of the organic metal compound can be piloted to keep  the layers free of the carbon impurities that would otherwise  usually contaminate them.    The project was financed by the Federal Ministry of Research  and Technology and managed by the VDI-TZ [Association of German  Engineers Technology Center] in Duesseldorf. The low  precipitation temperature makes the process attractive primarily  for microelectronics applications and for coating  temperature-sensitive substrates such as plastic. About 50  research teams worldwide have been working for around 10 years  on precipitating this valuable substance from volatile organic  metal compounds.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by political </F> correspondent Shlomo Raz and Rafi Rosenfeld on 31 December;  place not given--recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Raz] Mr. Rabin, there  seems to be a crisis, a stalemate, or a delay -- I wonder what  word you would use -- in the talks today, the day of our  interview with you. A fax was received from Nabil Sha'th, in  which the PLO was practically backing out of some of the  agreements achieved in Cairo -- at least agreements on the issue  of the crossings on the Jordan bridges.    [Rabin] True, we are faced with a problem, but things should  be put in the right perspective. Both sides, the Israeli and  the Palestinian -- the PLO -- are committed to the Declaration  of Principles [DOP] agreement, to the negotiations, to the  implementation of the first stage of the Gaza-Jericho First  agreement. And there are disagreements. Following the Paris  and Oslo meetings, the nucleus of the Israeli-Palestinian  liaison committee met in Cairo, with the Israeli side headed by  Foreign Minister Peres and the other side by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh  in Paris and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] in Cairo. We received  the impression that they had arrived at a draft reflecting the  agreements on some of the main disputed issues. The agreement  was naturally contingent on the endorsement of both Tunis and  Jerusalem.    It transpired, however, that so far Tunis has not endorsed  the draft. For that reason, there has been no endorsement from  Jerusalem, because it is inconceivable that we should agree to  approve something Tunis has not approved. Had we done it, the  draft which required reciprocal endorsement would have become a  unilaterally endorsed draft, and that would have made it the  starting point of negotiations, triggering new compromises  beyond anything the two sides had agreed on.    Two faxes have been received. One was from Nabil Sha'th,  written after the meeting with President Mubarak in Cairo, after  Nabil Sha'th and Major General Amnon Shahaq were tasked with  elucidating several points in the draft. Shahaq and Sha'th had  a conversation, but due to time constraints, they agreed that a  fax reflecting the agreements would be sent. Another fax from  Nabil Sha'th which arrived yesterday contained far-reaching  remarks by the chairman and, although they were defined as  remarks, they practically overturned the contents of the first  fax.    In these circumstances, I would like to spell out my stand.  We are committed to the DOP. We are ready to negotiate the  interpretations of whatever is written in the DOP agreement. I  absolutely refuse, however, to make additional compromises on  the agreements achieved in the DOP agreement. Interpretation --  yes, another compromise -- no.    [Raz] And does that interpretation of 'Arafat -- the  chairman, as you referred to him -- reflect a retreat from every  previous agreement on the issues of Gaza, the scope of  withdrawal from Jericho, the bridges, and the crossings?    [Rabin] They are remarks implying a retreat. They are not  presented as demands, but the implications of the second fax are  clear to me. Therefore, although we would like to continue the  negotiations, we would like to ponder the matter and to  elucidate a few things at the beginning of next week, before the  negotiations are resumed, in order to avoid departing from a new  starting line each time, because we believe that the agreements  should bind both sides. [passage omitted]    [Rosenfeld] Recently there have been reports about Israelis  and Syrians participating in a workshop in Washington. Do you  have any information about this track of talks? Does it operate  with your knowledge, your sanction, your consent?    [Rabin] Neither I nor the Government of Israel have  authorized anyone to conduct negotiations with the Syrians. We  were very interested in holding quiet contacts with the Syrians,  because the experience of the Dayan-al-Tuhami meeting in Morocco  had proved that this kind of meetings can pave the way. Oslo  has proved the same. We wanted very much to hold such meetings,  but the Syrians refused. Therefore, I do not know what the  newspaper reports were based on. Israelis may have met with  Syrians on occasion, but not one of these Israelis had been  authorized by either me or the Government of Israel to speak on  our behalf. [passage omitted]</p>

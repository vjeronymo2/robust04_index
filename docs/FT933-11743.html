			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / People: Campbell Lutyens loses Hudson Just days after Joseph Perella left New York investment bank Wasserstein Perella, David Hudson, a partner in a much smaller British enterprise Campbell Lutyens Hudson has jumped ship. Hudson, 48, is joining a former Kleinwort Benson colleague John MacArthur at the latter's firm MacArthur &amp; Co. Campbell Lutyens Hudson says that the parting is amicable, but that Hudson had developed a strong interest in the expert witness field, an area, however, in which the partnership felt it did not want to be involved. Expert witnesses are often called upon to testify against other merchant banks, for example in takeovers that are perceived by one or other party to have gone wrong. Hudson himself says that CLH has grown rather large for his tastes, that he prefers work of 'a more intellectual nature', and that he did not want to become 'the corporate animal' that would have been necessary had he stayed. However, he still retains his 'substantial' shareholding, and his name stays on the CLH letterhead for the foreseeable future. MacArthur and Hudson were together at KB in the late 1960s; one of the other two board members, Nigel Christie, is also an old KB hand. Hudson later moved to Samuel Montagu, as deputy head of corporate finance and head of international banking. He moved to James Capel as head of corporate finance and then on to Henry Ansbacher as chief executive, before joining CLH.</p>

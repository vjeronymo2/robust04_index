			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Leeds edges forward on disclosure Leeds Permanent, the UK's fifth largest building society, is seeking to differentiate the life assurance and unit trust operations it will launch next month by aiming for the high moral ground. Giving details of the two subsidiaries yesterday, Mr Roger Boyes, acting chief executive, said staff would be paid mainly - though not entirely - by salary, and that there would be no 'direct link' between sales and remuneration. He added that the life assurance company would provide customers with information about the charges it would make, and would explain fully to customers what policies did and did not cover. However, it will not operate the full commission and pro-duct disclosure regime demanded by City regulators until the beginning of next year when it becomes com-pulsory for the whole industry. Of the 10 largest societies, only Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bristol &amp; West are now tied to selling the products of one life assurance company without having said the arrangement will end. The Leeds subsidiaries will sell a range of pensions, investments and protection products, concentrating initially on providing a service to the society's existing customers. The 800 sales staff have been drawn from Leeds' current employees, in the interests of continuity. Mr Chris Chadwick, Leeds' commercial director, said: 'The traditional life assurance sales process is a total anathema to us.' Mr Ladislav Suchopar, who joined Leeds from Allied Dunbar in 1991, is chief executive of the life company, and Mr Andrew Watson, formerly of the Prolific group, will run the unit trust company. Mr Boyes said that Norwich Union, for which Leeds has been a tied agent, had not wanted to handle the administration of the new organisation. Instead, General Accident Life will deal with the administration for the life assur-ance side, and SG Warburg will be the unit trust admin-istrators. Gartmore and JP Morgan Investment Management will act as fund managers.</p>

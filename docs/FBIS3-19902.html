With a wild mixture of fiscal programs and  promises, the SPD is writing the population "a wealth of  unsecured blank checks." Enforcing the 20 expenditure measures  contained in the SPD program would increase public debts to a  record high. Tax increases would be accordingly large. Under  the SPD's monetary guidelines, people earning over 4,000 German  marks [DM] net per month -- this includes qualified workers --  would have to expect a higher tax burden.    Waigel called the tax increases on higher assets a "job  creation program for Monaco, Liechtenstein, and certain parts of  Switzerland." The figures published imply that the levy on  property would increase six-fold, which would cause a large  amount of mobile capital to flow abroad. The minister also  criticized the SPD's plan to introduce an "ecological tax  reform," which should levy the incurred costs on the given means  of transport. In Waigel's view this would increase gasoline  prices to DM4 to DM5. The SPD's overall concept leads to "a  fiscal and economic fumble."    According to AFP, the Free Democratic Party of Germany's  [FDP] economic expert, Otto Graf Lambsdorff, speaking on RTL  television, accused the SPD of a "high degree of negligence."  "This is an incredible policy, thoughtless and unprofessional."  The Social Democrats "cannot handle money, nor can Mr.  Scharping." The chairman of the German Employees' Union, Roland  Issen, demanded that the SPD increase the income level for the  supplementary tax to DM80,000 for single people and DM160,000  for married couples. A ceiling of DM60,000/120,000, "still hits  the majority of average income earners in the country."  According to Issen, "these are net incomes in the DM3,200 to  DM3,500 range." In addition to a supplementary tax, labor and  employment policy must be financed "through a general labor  market levy" to be paid for by everyone.    The German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) estimates  that the government's tax plans -- a 7.5-percent solidarity  surcharge as of 1 January 1995, payable by everyone -- would be  a heavier burden on the economy than the 10-percent  supplementary tax on gross incomes over DM60,000/120,000  envisaged by the SPD. According to ASSOCIATED PRESS, Dieter  Teichmann, the DIW's fiscal policy expert, told the NEUE PRESSE  in Hannover: "If the lower incomes are exempted from the levy,  as suggested by the SPD, this will have a positive effect,  because those earning lower incomes consume comparatively much  and save little."    This means that the loss in private consumption would be  lower with the SPD model than with the government's solidarity  surcharge, even if the SPD wanted to achieve the same revenue of  DM23 billion to DM25 billion. Only people liable to taxes on  salaries and wages, would keep DM14 billion more than under the  government's model.    Ruediger Pohl, president of the Institute for Economic  Research in Halle, however, warned against introducing a  supplementary tax and demanded a cut in expenditure instead of  an increase in tax progression. Pohl told the Cologne EXPRESS:  "If a supplementary tax is levied on those earning higher  incomes, this will primarily have a negative effect on the  economy. The new debate on taxes does not only make the  citizens feel insecure, but it also unnerves businessmen." With  tax progression increasing to such an extent, investors will  consider investing in financial assets abroad instead of buying  machinery in Germany. This will get worse if the income limit  for the supplementary tax on single people is increased to  DM60,000 or more.    The former member of the "Wise Men of Economics" is  basically  opposed to a tax increase, but he thinks that if taxes must be  used to finance public deficits, the burden should be widely  spread, also including lower incomes -- as the solidarity  surcharge model suggests.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Major stalls on Lamont MR NORMAN LAMONT'S hold on the chancellorship was growing more precarious last night after prime minister John Major refused to confirm that he would present the first unified Budget in November, writes David Owen. Mr Major - who minutes later said he was 'four-square' behind Mr John Patten, his embattled education secretary - fuelled speculation about a cabinet reshuffle by declining Labour calls to remove the question-mark over Mr Lamont's future. Coming within 24 hours of an implicit acknowledgement from Mr Major's office that cabinet changes were under consideration, the exchanges reinforced expectations at Westminster that Mr Lamont will be moved in a July cabinet reshuffle. Although he praised Mr Lamont for his 'excellent record' on inflation and interest rates, the prime minister stopped short of giving the assurance demanded by Mr John Smith, opposition leader, that the chancellor would be in his post for the Budget.

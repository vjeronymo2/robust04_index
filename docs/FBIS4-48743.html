			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today  said that he did not support the idea of the Organization of  African Unity, OAU, establishing a military wing to solve the  problems of the continent. The president pointed out that the  establishment of a military wing will only serve to suppress the  people, adding that he believed in dialogue to solve Africa's  problems. The president said, that for a country like Kenya to  have survived for 30 years without being distracted by coups,  was a clear indication of the existence of democratic practices  since independence. The president observed that it was  unfortunate that countries like Kenya, who have all along been  practicing democracy, are lumped with other countries which have  just started observing democratic principles.    President Moi was speaking at parliament when he officially  opened the 25th conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary  Association, Africa region. President Moi noted that  Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, having stemmed from the  roots of a long established parliamentary process, should have  formed committees to look into the best ways of introducing  multiparty democracy in the African continent. President Moi  said such committees would have looked into the final details of  how African societies were going to implement multipartyism. He  said that it was unfortunate that the continent now has to deal  with the devastating effects of pluralism in some countries.  President Moi said Africa should endeavor to have home grown  parliamentary democracy, rather than copy blindly and without  judgement other people's systems of governance. The president  said that he had consistently spoken against any attempt to  impose systems of government that militate against the wishes  and value systems of the African people.    President Moi noted that anyone or group of people imposing  their will on others was oppressive, and also denied others the  freedom to manage their own affairs. The head of state told  African leaders to strongly reject moves by the developed  countries to experiment with their peoples. The president said  that Kenyans were now struggling with the effects of political  reforms that have led to a state of tribal loyalities and  inter-tribal animosities. He noted that the reforms have  widened ethnic divisions, and now threatens the cherished goals  of national unity. He said that pluralism has adversely  affected institutions such as the judiciary, public service  commission, and the civil service, which should be rendering  quality service without paying attention to political  affiliations or being partisan. President Moi said that, in  spite of Africa's economic potential, the continent still lags  behind in development, and this has been made worse by the large  concentration of refugees. President Moi told the Commonwealth  Parliamentary Association conference that leaders must seriously  start thinking how to avoid the eminent disintegration of the  continent. He said good politics always results in prosperity  and enjoyment of life, adding that by all means politics of  bloodshed and unnecessary suffering must be avoided. He told  the conference to explore to what extent parliamentary democracy  as practiced in African countries may have contributed to the  problems that confront the continent. The president said the  most crucial task is to educate the people to appreciate the  importance of the continent's age old cultural values and  democratic practices.    He told the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to also  promote understanding and respect among the nations of the  world, and especially among its membership. [passage omitted]</p>

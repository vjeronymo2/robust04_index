			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: ANDRIES WINS BACK TITLE . . . AGAIN  </P> <P> Dennis Andries waited 13 months for revenge. On Saturday in Melbourne,  Australia, he got it.  </P> <P> Andries knocked out Jeff Harding in the seventh round to regain the World  Boxing Council light-heavyweight title he lost to the Australian last year.  </P> <P> Andries stunned Harding with a chopping right to the head, then knocked him out  with an overhand right at 2:15 of the round.  </P> <P> Andries, a Detroit-based Englishman, became only the second to win the light  heavyweight title three times.  </P> <P> "Three times man, I did it," Andries said after improving to 37-8-2. "I came to  his back yard and did a demolition job."  </P> <P> Andries, 36, also was champion in 1986-87 and 1989. Marvin Johnson is the only  other three-time champion in the division.  </P></p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Motoring: Too good for the mud - Range Rover Vogue LSE WOULD you walk into your drawing room wearing muddy wellingtons? I thought not. In which case, having invested Pounds 40,000 on a new Range Rover Vogue LSE, with its leather-seated and Italian poplar-veneered interior, the last thing most owners would do is drive it axle-deep in mire. Here we have a paradox. The two most significant improvements to the 1993 Range Rover are electronic air suspension and traction control. They equip it to do even better what only a handful of owners ask of it  - which is to go clambering about on rough terrain. A clever suspension system depends on an electric compressor to keep the air at the right pressure in the rubber bags which replace the normal coil springs. There are five heights. In access mode, the vehicle sinks down on to its bump stops, making it easier to enter and leave. The next setting (low profile) is assumed automatically at more than 50 mph (80 kmh) to improve main road ride and handling. For driving at modest speed on normal roads, the suspension sets itself to standard profile. High profile is for off-road use and when fording rivers. Extended profile is an emergency setting which would be handy should it run aground on its belly. Apart from low profile, all the other ride heights are driver-selected by push button. But should you drive away in access mode, the suspension - which also keeps the car on an even keel regardless of load - pumps itself up to standard height automatically. When I drove a Range Rover Vogue LSE last month, there must have been a leak somewhere. Every few seconds, the compressor started to refill the suspension's air reservoir with a heavy breathing noise like an elephant making an indecent telephone call. But the suspension absorbs the bumps beautifully and subdues tyre noise although it still has not cured what, to me, is one of the Range Rover's main drawbacks - its roly-poly restlessness on winding roads. Although it holds the road well and corners quickly and securely, its handling is not as car-like as that of a Mitsubishi Shogun or Isuzu Trooper. For driving across rough country, the Range Rover is still the one to beat. The new electronic traction control system uses the same wheel sensors as the ABS brakes. Whatever grip the tyres have, the driver can make best use of it. Exclusive to the Vogue LSE is a 4.2-litre, 200-horsepower development of the veteran Rover V8 engine, linked to a four-speed automatic transmission. It provides brisk acceleration, quiet motorway cruising, and enough muscle to tow trailers of up to four tons. The official figures suggest an average fuel consumption of about 17 mpg (16.6 l/100 km) or 300 miles (480km) from an 18-gallon (82 litre) tankful. I think this might be over-optimistic, especially for motorway driving. I shall know soon. Next week I am driving a Vogue LSE to Paris for the Mondial de l'Automobile show at which it makes its public debut alongside the latest Land Rover Discovery, with its 3.9-litre V8 petrol engine and automatic transmission. The show also will mark the European debut of the big, new Chrysler Jeep Grand Cherokee - a Range Rover rival, although Britain will have to wait until 1994 for right-hand drive versions. Having sampled the air-suspended Range Rover, I thought the steel-sprung Discovery automatic would be an anti-climax. In fact, I preferred its feel and handling on the road. Past experience has proved that, even without adjustable ride height, it is formidably capable across rough country. As a single air-suspended, super-luxury LSE (at Pounds 39,995) costs almost twice as much as a Discovery (from Pounds 19,654), you have to ask if Range Rover prices have finally gone over the top. Or have they, like the air suspension at only standard height, still some upward movement left?</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: BA warning in spite of 63% rise in pre-tax profits - At a Glance British Airways this week reported a 63 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to more than Pounds 300m for the year to March, but warned that it might have to make provisions on a Pounds 275.3m investment in USAir, its troubled US partner. Annual pre-tax profits totalled Pounds 301m, compared with Pounds 185m in 1992-93. BA's progress reflected its cost-cutting drive, increased revenues and a 6 per cent recovery in first and business class traffic. The future of BA's 24.6 per cent stake in USAir remains the biggest cloud over its short-term prospects.</p>

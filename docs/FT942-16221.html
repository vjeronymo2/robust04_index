			<p>940412 FT  12 APR 94 / World Trade News: US wildlife embargo on Taiwan US President Bill Clinton yesterday imposed an embargo on imports of wildlife products from Taiwan because it had failed to stem trade in rhinoceros and tiger parts, animals in danger of extinction, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. China escaped similar sanctions after the US determined that it consolidated and burned its stocks of rhino horn and tiger bone and enforced laws against such trade. The US action came under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.</p>

It reviewed Arab and  domestic activities that took place in the Kingdom during the  past few days, particularly the results of yesterday's visit to  Jordan by Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa.    The JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY has learned that the prime  minister  explained to the council that during this visit, the negotiating  position on all fronts was reviewed, with an emphasis on the  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Cairo, which were held with  an Egyptian participation to arrive at an agreement on the  Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho.    Dr. al-Majali indicated that 'Amr Musa explained that there  are three major points which are still being negotiated between  the Palestinians and Israelis. The first is supervision of  traffic over bridges and sovereignty over them. The second is  the size of the Jericho region from which the Israeli Army will  withdraw. The third point is the security control of border  areas which will be evacuated, especially in the Gaza Strip.  During the visit, Musa affirmed that contrary to the Israeli  Government's allegation, the Palestinian and Israeli sides have  not reached an agreement in Cairo, but that a paper was  presented by the Israeli side which proposed that the  Palestinian side study it and agree on it with competent PLO  authorities. During Musa's visit, bilateral relations were also  discussed, especially with respect to the meetings of the Higher  Jordanian-Egyptian Joint Committee. It was agreed to activate  this committee and to convene it under the chairmanship of both  countries' prime ministers. In accordance with the regular  order of its meetings, the committee will hold its next meeting  in Amman soon.    During the session, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state  for foreign affairs, reviewed the most important results that  have been reached on the bilateral level with the Qatari side  during Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabir  Al Thani's recent visit to Jordan. It was agreed to set up a  joint bilateral committee under the Jordanian minister of state  for affairs and the Qatari foreign minister to discuss all  bilateral issues of interest to the two countries, including  economic, political, and media issues, as well as joint  investments and cooperation between the private sectors in both  countries.</p>

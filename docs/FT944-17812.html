			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: US healthcare Forget the Clintons. US healthcare reform is forging on without them. The latest consolidation was yesterday's merger between Columbia/HCA Healthcare and HealthTrust, the country's two biggest hospital groups. The deal creates a Dollars 15bn company with 311 hospitals and 170,000 employees. That makes it the 12th largest employer in the US - not bad for a company which in 1992 generated sales of just Dollars 1.2bn and controlled only 23 hospitals. Columbia's strategy is simple. It purchases several hospitals in a specific region and improves profitability by rationalising them. At its most brutal the group strips a hospital of all equipment, knocks it down and then sells the real estate. Cost savings are also achieved by using greater purchasing power - it annually buys Dollars 2.5bn of hospital supplies - to drive down prices. Doubts remain whether Columbia can continue to implement its strategy successfully. The easiest cost-cutting has been completed and the biggest hospital groups have been snapped up. The company argues it can maintain momentum by branching into other fields such as nursing homes. Even if Columbia stumbles, the pressure on hospital suppliers is unlikely to let up. Other groups such as National Medical in California and Epic in Texas are replicating its strategy. Given the prospects for hospital supply companies' pricing and volumes, their shares' 17 per cent underperformance since January 1993 is no surprise.</p>

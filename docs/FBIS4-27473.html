			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Pricha Musikun, deputy minister of sciences,  technology, and environment, told reporters after receiving a  Canadian space delegation, headed by (Alan Deforest), vice  chairman of the Canadian Space Experts Committee, that Canada  has agreed to cooperate with Thailand on the development of  space technology. For the initial stage, the (Spy) Company, a  Canadian firm specializing in satellite technology, will be  assigned to provide technical assistance and training courses  for Thai officials.    Pricha disclosed that Thailand has set up a satellite  division under the jurisdiction of the National Research  Institute. The division is unable to cope with the work load,  however, and thus Thailand has to depend on other countries for  satellite information on natural resources, environment,  forestry, and telecommunications.    Pricha said that Thailand needs a specific agency at the  national level to handle satellite issues and coordinate with  other countries. The Ministry of Sciences, Technology, and  Environment will soon propose to the cabinet the establishment  of a national independent satellite agency.    Pricha added: "In the future, it also will be necessary for  Thailand to have its own satellite launching pad, and the most  appropriate site is in Narathiwat Province. Canadian assistance  in setting up a satellite data center will be useful to both  Thailand and the neighboring countries."</p>

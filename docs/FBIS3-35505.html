			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Dani Yatom, commander of the </F> Central Command, by reporter Gil Litman and other unidentified  correspondents, in Hebron -- live]    [Text] [Litman] General, can you tell us what happened in  the Cave of the Patriarchs this morning?    [Yatom] A very grave incident occurred in the Cave of the  Patriarchs this morning. We are still holding debriefings. I  came here to investigate with the other commanders. What we  know at this moment, which is not everything, is the following:  At about 0530 this morning, a Jewish resident, an Israeli  citizen, entered the prayer hall in the Cave of Patriarchs where  several hundred Palestinians were praying, opened fire in all  directions with a Galil rifle, killing a number of Arab  worshipers, and wounding others. Later, he apparently committed  suicide by shooting himself.    As I said, the event is extremely grave. It is an horrendous  act by an armed man at a group of absolutely innocent  worshipers. I would like to take this opportunity not only to  denounce what happened, but also to express my condolences to  the families of the fatalities and to wish the wounded a speedy  recovery.    [Litman] General, do you know what the current situation in  Hebron is? We are receiving reports about disturbances not only  in Hebron but throughout Judaea and Samaria, and about  additional Arab casualties due to IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  fire following many stoning incidents and riots. Can you  confirm this?    [Yatom] That is inaccurate. In Hebron, there are no  disturbances at the moment. I am not saying there will not be  any, there might be later on, because the Arabs are in a state  of high tension. We are sending forces into the area in order  to restore calm as much as possible. To that end, we imposed a  curfew on Hebron city. There are attempts in several other  places in Judaea and Samaria to disturb the peace. IDF and  security forces are being sent in to prevent disturbances.  There are no additional casualties among the Arabs. A  Palestinian in Hebron hurled a firebomb at a member of our  forces a few minutes ago. He was shot in the leg, wounded, and  captured.    [Litman] General Yatom, what can you tell us officially  about the number of fatalities in the Cave of Patriarchs  massacre?    [Yatom] I do not have an official count. The number of  fatalities is 10, 16, or even more. Neither we nor the  Palestinians have yet succeeded in counting the number of  fatalities and making a full report on the number of casualties.  I hope the figure will be as low as possible.    The act was the initiative of a single person who carried  out  a despicable act by shooting at an innocent crowd. I can  understand the outrage among the Palestinians in Judaea and  Samaria. I cannot agree to disturbances. I do not think a new  situation has been created. We will take action to restore calm  and to make sure there are no disturbances.    [IDF Radio's Netan'el Semrik] Did the Israeli assailant  operate on his own?    [Yatom] The Israeli acted on his own, and as things appear  now, it was the initiative of one man. I do not know what  happened to him, but there is no doubt that it was the act of a  crazy man. We increased protection on the Palestinian and Jewish  populations in the Hebron and Qiryat Arba' vicinities. I did  not recommend in the past and I still do not recommend that the  Jewish public avoid travelling. I would like to say what I said  in the past: Whoever has to travel on Judaea and Samaria roads  in order to do whatever he thinks he has to do, can do so. We  will provide the necessary security, especially in this area.    [Unidentified correspondent] We have different figures on  fatalities.    [Yatom] You have data, and I have data. I do not know if  information is accurate. I very much hope that my reports are  correct and yours are inaccurate. I cannot promise anything. I  checked after some of them were published in the media. We gave  clear instructions to the forces to avoid as much as possible  opening fire on disturbers of the peace or on crowds. The order  is to open fire only if the lives of soldiers and security  forces are endangered. In all other cases, the instructions are  clear, and unequivocal: Do not open fire. We will disperse the  disturbances and demonstrations using other means.    [Litman] General Yatom, will you change the orders in the  Cave of the Patriarchs, a sensitive location, where Jewish and  Arab worshipers pray together?    [Yatom] Jews and Arabs have been praying together at the  Cave of the Patriarchs for many years. The prayer arrangements  permit both the Jews and the Muslims to express their religious  feelings. The prayers sessions there are definitely complex  because the prayers often take place simultaneously -- in  different halls, but at the same time. There is no doubt that  this is a charged place. I do not know if in the wake of this  grave action we will have to issue new instructions. The risk  is that friction between Jews and Arabs will break out due to  close contact between two groups of worshipers. This danger has  been with us for many years.    [Corespondent] General Yatom, were there IDF soldiers in the  Cave of the Patriarchs during the bloodbath, and should the  instructions be changed so that only unarmed people enter the  cave?    [Yatom] IDF soldiers were in the vicinity of the Cave of the  Patriarchs this morning, as they always are, since an IDF force  has been deployed at the cave for many years and its job is to  safeguard the place, especially externally. The prayer  arrangements permit the Muslims and Jews to enter, often at the  same time. For many years, the Israeli worshipers have entered  the Cave of the Patriarchs with their weapons. We make sure  that the weapons are emptied of their ammunition. There is no  doubt that we will have to review the situation. I cannot say  whether following the review we will issue new instructions.    I would like to add that we offered all our assistance to  the  Palestinians in this grave incident. At one stage, a request  was made to provide helicopters to transfer some of the gravely  wounded Palestinian casualties to hospital. I approved it  immediately, but the Palestinians withdrew their request. They  preferred to evacuate them in a different way.    [Litman] General, you are also the prime minister's defense  secretary. Did you report to him on what happened in Hebron and  can you tell us what is happening in other areas of Judaea and  Samaria, which are under your authority?    [Yatom] I am now the Central Command's commander and I  report to the prime minister only via the chief of staff. As I  have said, except for reports about disturbances and riots in  the Bethlehem area, I have no other reports, which means there  are no other disturbances. In reference to the assailant, his  identity is known to us. I can say that he entered the place  wearing an IDF uniform with his rank insignia from the reserves.  He is an officer in the reserves.    [Correspondent] General, in the General Staff and Central  Command consultations will a decision be made to sharpen the  divisions between the Jewish and Arab public, to impose curfews,  and perhaps even a closure?    [Yatom] I do not want to go into these things now. As I  said, this event will force us to study the present  arrangements, especially where Jews and Arabs coexist. We will  study the issue and then act.</p>

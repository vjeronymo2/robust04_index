			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> EX-UCI LECTURERS FIGHT DISMISSALS  </P> <P> Defending two UC Irvine lecturers of Chinese language who were notified in May  that their contracts would not be renewed, a representative of the American  Federation of Teachers charged Friday that the university acted in an  "arbitrary and capricious" manner.  </P> <P> "We believe this was total disregard for equal opportunity," said Daniel C.  Tsang, vice president of AFT Local 2206, after a grievance hearing before the  dean of the School of Humanities. "Neither of them received an interview for  the positions."  </P> <P> Tsang is seeking the immediate reinstatement of Richard Liao and Jennie Hu,  both of whom filed grievances with the university after three new lecturers  were hired to replace them in the newly formed East Asian languages and  literature department.  </P> <P> Tsang said that if the current grievance is unsuccessful, he will appeal to  William Parker, acting executive vice chancellor. A decision is expected within  the next 10 days, he said.  </P> <P> While Tsang said he believes Liao and Hu were treated unfairly, the university  maintains that both were treated appropriately.  </P> <P> "All of the applicants are not required to receive an interview," said  university spokeswoman Linda Granell, noting that each year there is a new  hiring process for all one-year positions, provided those positions are  continued the following year.  </P> <P> "In this case, these lectureships were advertised and applicants were sought  from across the country and people were selected to fill those positions,"  Granell said.  </P> <P> "It is a waste of taxpayers' money to do a national search for year-to-year  appointments when you have qualified people locally," Tsang said, suggesting  that Liao may have been let go because he would have been eligible for an  extended three-year contract during the 1990-91 school term.  </P> <P> After six years, lecturers become eligible for extended contracts, he said.  </P> <P> "The university does not operate like that," responded Granell.  </P> <P> Both Liao and Hu received letters on March 27 notifying them that the  university was interviewing applicants for the lectureships and both indicated  their interest. But neither of them was contacted for an interview, Tsang said.  </P> <P> "It's very suspicious," he said, noting that Liao was shocked when his contract  was not renewed as it has been for the past five years.  </P> <P> Liao "assumed that since he had never had to go through this before, everything  was fine."  </P> <P> Granell said interviews are done in some cases but are not mandatory.  </P> <P> Liao, who holds two master's degrees in Asian studies, received consistently  favorable reviews from students and university observers, according to his  personnel file.  </P> <P> Evaluations for the six courses taught by Liao during the fall, 1987, and  winter, 1988, terms, show that 63% of his students rated his classes as "one of  the best," while another 32% rated his class as "above average," according to a  listing for the 1988-89 academic year.  </P> <P> "I love this job," Liao said, noting that because of budget limitations he  often purchased teaching materials with his own money. He is currently teaching  part time at Santa Monica City College.  </P> <P> Hu, who taught at the university for three years, is a native of China and  received a bachelor's degree in Chinese literature.  </P> <P> She was out of the country Friday and unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Of the three people recently hired as lecturers for the upcoming term, one  holds a doctorate degree and all are natives of China.  </P> <P> Granell said she could not release the names of the three until they officially  become UCI employees when school begins in September.

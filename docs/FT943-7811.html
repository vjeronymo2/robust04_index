			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Now it's Catch-22 at C&amp;G It is not quite Catch-22, but the arrangements for members of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society after the Pounds 1.8bn Lloyds Bank cash takeover offer have brought to light a new ver-sion. Catch-22 was that if an airman was crazy, he could be grounded: all he had to do was ask. But as soon as he did, he was deemed not to be crazy  - and had to continue flying. Catch-C&amp;G is that the investors who do not benefit under the revised cash payments scheme - and who are, of course, most likely to want to challenge the plans - are those who became members after the end of 1992. But only those who have been members for two years can call for a special meeting to force C&amp;G to discuss its proposals - ahead of the special meeting the board plans to call next year, anyway, to vote on the bid. C&amp;G is not alone among the larger societies in having rules saying that a special meeting can be called only after a resolution from 100 members of at least two years' standing with at least Pounds 100 in their accounts. Woolwich, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Leeds Permanent all have similar provisions. The position is only slightly easier in the two largest societies. At Halifax, it takes 200 members of 56 days' standing with Pounds 100 in their accounts to call a special meeting - but there is a two-year qualifying period and a minimum of 100 members for any special resolution to be discussed. At Nationwide, 100 investors who became members at the end of the previous financial year and have at least Pounds 100 can call for a special meeting. But the board does not have to agree to one unless there is a qualifying resolution where, again, the two-year threshold applies.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Yates plans to double retail side after float Yates Brothers Wine Lodges, the independent drinks group which claims to have first introduced wine to the north of England, yesterday announced plans to double the size of its retail operations following its forthcoming flotation. Funds raised by the Pounds 10m placing, giving the company a Pounds 54m market capitalisation, will be used to reduce group borrowing and launch an expansion programme which envisages a portfolio of 100 outlets by the year 2000. Institutions have been offered shares at 140p as part of the float, which involves 5.7m new ordinary shares and 1.3m existing shares. Although the placing will dilute the Yates family's 75 per cent shareholding, some 40 relatives will be left with a 65 per cent stake when the company obtains a listing. Mr Peter Dickson, managing director and great-grandson of Mr Peter Yates, the group's founder, said he was confident ofwinning widespread institutional support for the expansion. 'We believe there is potential to open a Yates in every town with a population of more than 75,000,' Mr Dickson said. The group - which first came to the market in 1986 under the matched bargain Rule 535 - has set its sights on new outlets in three target areas: Yorkshire and the north-east, the Midlands and the M1 corridor to London. Initially, however, most of the funds raised by the placing will be used to wipe out Pounds 8.5m of secured loans and unsecured bank overdrafts. Mr Dickson said the company would rely on progressive borrowing to fund new outlets, but added that gearing was unlikely to exceed 33 per cent. Gearing in the year to March 27, when the group made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.36m (Pounds 2.77m) on turnover of Pounds 43.9m (Pounds 35.3m), was 25 per cent. Dealings are expected to begin on July 19. The placing was sponsored by Panmure Gordon.</p>

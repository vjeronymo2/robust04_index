PBZT is a new high-strength aerospace and  armaments-oriented composite with superior high-temperature  resistance, environmental stability, and chemical corrosion  resistance. This new [conducting] polymer material, now under  development in the United States, Japan, and a small number of  other advanced Western nations, has been included by the State  in the ``863'' High-Tech Plan in an effort to catch up with the  international state-of-the-art.</p>

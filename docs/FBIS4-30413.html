			<p>BFN     [Text] Details of a deregulation plan which the Ministry  of Transport [MOT] will newly implement have been revealed. In  connection with the issue of standards and certification for  automobiles, which is a focal point of the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks, the MOT will improve the system of accepting  international standards and data on foreign inspections. The  27- item deregulation plan also includes: 1) flexible  management of freight railway fares and warehouse charges; and  2) expansion of business areas for trucks. The plan will be  incorporated into a deregulation package to be compiled by the  government at the end of June. The MOT will not introduce the  price ceiling system (price cap system) for railway fares,  saying "there are still many problems" in the system. The  introduction of the system has been demanded by JR [Japan  Railway Company] and the Administrative Reform Headquarters'  working group on imports promotion, market access improvement,  and distribution.</p>

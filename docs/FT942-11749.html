			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Marzotto falls 74% to L10.2bn A slump in demand on the world clothing market has hit 1993 profits at Marzotto, one of Italy's largest clothing and textile groups. The company, which controls Hugo Boss, Germany's biggest menswear designer, yesterday reported a 74 per cent decline in net earnings to L10.2bn (Dollars 6m), against L39.8bn in 1992. Net earnings in 1991 were L40.1bn. Sales were little changed at L1,953bn, against L1,955bn, of which three-quarters came from the European Union. The parent company announced a net profit of L4.4bn, compared with the 1992 loss of L44.7bn, which was struck only after some L70bn of extraordinary provisions. Sales of the parent company fell 8.3 per cent to L956bn, and operating profits were cut to L25.9bn from L55.2bn. Marzotto's caution was reflected in its decision to recommend a cut in dividends, to L150 per ordinary share from L280. However, the group said orders were up in the first quarter of 1994, both in Italy and in overseas markets. The end-March order book was worth L774bn, nearly 20 per cent higher than at the same time last year. Sales at the same date had reached L591bn, down 2 per cent on the first quarter of 1992. The company explained that it was in Italy - particularly in the market for classic men's clothing - that Marzotto felt the pinch last year. The group said the downturn had offset growth in net profits from its textile manufacturing subsidiaries, and its holdings in Hugo Boss, and Linificio, a thread manufacturer. Marzotto owns nearly 64 per cent of the voting stock of Hugo Boss, which last month announced 1993 profits 73 per cent higher at DM76.5m (Dollars 44.5m).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Japan was the world's  largest donor of Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 1993  for the third year in a row, Japanese officials said Friday [24  June].    Foreign Ministry officials, quoting figures released by the  21-nation Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),  said Japan's ODA rose 1.0 percent to 11.26 billion dollars.    The United States was second with 9.01 billion dollars, down  16.7 percent, followed by France with 7.90 billion dollars, down  4.5 percent, Germany with 6.85 billion dollars, down 9.7 percent  and Italy with 2.91 billion dollars, down 29.4 percent.    But Japan ranked 18th among the 21 nations in terms of the  ratio of ODA to gross national product (GNP), standing at 0.26  percent.    The OECD data also showed ODA extended in 1993 by the 21 DAC  member nations fell 11.4 percent from the previous year to 54.79  billion dollars, marking the first double-digit fall.    The officials noted most industrial nations, suffering from  economic slowdowns, are beginning to lose enthusiasm toward ODA.</p>

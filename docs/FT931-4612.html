			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Candover assets up 9% but new activity halves CANDOVER Investments, an investment trust specialising in management buy-outs, increased net assets per share and pre-tax profits in 1992 but saw a halving of its new investment activity. Mr Roger Brooke, chairman, said it would take only a modest economic recovery to produce a significant increase in the value of Candover's investments, but it remained difficult to read the UK economy, The sharp decline in interest rates would, however, make it considerably more difficult to maintain income levels from the company's cash and investments in short-term securities this year, he warned. Net assets per share rose by 9 per cent to 267p in the year ended December 1992 while fully diluted earnings per share rose 12 per cent to 13.7p. Candover proposes to pay a final dividend of 6.5p, making a total of 10.25p, an increase of 8 per cent. Pre-tax profits rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 4.1m. Because the tax charge was smaller than expected, profits after tax rose by 11 per cent to Pounds 3.15m. Net assets increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 59.8m to show annual compound growth of 22 per cent in the eight years since Candover was listed. The FT-A All-Share Index has risen 14.3 per cent a year over the same period. Candover was cautious about making investments in 1992 because of uncertainty about when the recession would end, while many companies deferred disposing of non-core activities by means of a buy-out in the hope they could obtain a better price by waiting. The result of this was to reduce total investments by Candover and its managed funds to Pounds 45.8m from Pounds 89.8m in 1991. Candover still had Pounds 100m available in its two main funds and so did not have to think seriously about raising new finance, Mr Brooke said. Germany, which accounts for half of Candover's non-UK investments or 5 per cent of its total assets, has been a cause of concern. Candover's shares rose 5p to 253p.</p>

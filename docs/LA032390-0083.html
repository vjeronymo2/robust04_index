			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHERS GROUP LOSES BID TO STOP BILINGUAL  BONUSES  </P> <P> Members of United Teachers-Los Angeles, the union representing 33,000 teachers  and other school professionals, defeated a measure that would require bilingual  teachers to turn down $5,000-a-year bonuses from the school district, union  President Wayne Johnson said Thursday.  </P> <P> An initiative by Learning English Advocates Drive, a statewide group started by  Los Angeles teachers opposed to the district's bilingual education program, was  defeated by a 2-1 margin.  </P> <P> The group had sought to block the bonuses, arguing they are unfair to teachers  who speak only English.  </P> <P> The bonuses are part of the teachers' contract signed last June. District  officials say the bonuses will attract more bilingual teachers to classrooms in  the 610,000-student district, which has 180,000 students who are learning  English.  </P> <P> LEAD founder Sally Peterson said she will continue to fight the district's  bilingual teaching method by lobbying state legislators.  </P></p>

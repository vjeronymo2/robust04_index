			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: How NHS bulb-changing activities came to light Sir, Discussion of the current NHS light bulb saga, in the media and elsewhere, is revealing a misunderstanding. NHS staff and managers are finding that exhorting people to work harder and faster when they are already fully stretched merely erodes morale, and any gains in one department are obtained at the expense of other departments. The light bulb-changing story, which applies to most other simple maintenance activities, is typical. Such examples exist in hospitals all over the world. They are only turning up now because some hospitals, mainly trusts with progressive managements, are starting to take a long, hard look at the way they carry out their work, not just at how well they do what they have always done. So we should give those hospitals credit for re-engineering their work habits, and urge the rest to do likewise. Change should actually eliminate unnecessary work, not just allow the same old tasks to be performed better or faster. It can be a gold mine for the NHS, as it is proving in hospitals around the world. And it can be shown to cut patient stays, reduce waiting lists, improve standards of care, ease the work of staff, and give much better customer service to patients. While they by themselves are not going to solve the problem, the NHS and the trusts at least deserve credit for what they are trying to achieve.

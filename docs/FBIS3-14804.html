Gavriil Popov, chairman of the Russian Movement for  Democratic Reforms, addressing a meeting of the movement  leadership on Saturday, said the president could have  forestalled the amnesty decision of parliament by putting before  it his own draft resolution laying down conditions on which  those involved in last October's conservative revolt could be  released, one of which could be a ban on any political activity  for a specified period.    Parliament's amnesty resolution could prove to be "either a  step towards national conciliation or a step towards the  aggravation of the situation," Popov said.    He said the prosecution of the organizers of the 1991 coup  attempt and of the October 1993 rebellion had proved "the total  helplessness" of Russia's law enforcement system. The  Prosecutor General's Office needs "purging from top to bottom,"  he said.    At the same meeting, Popov described NATO's plan to carry  out  air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs as "the first attempt of  the West to provide a legal basis for Russia's expulsion from  the number of great powers."    He said the fact that the case of the Ames couple, charged  with espionage for Russia, was given publicity at a time when  the Serbs were withdrawing their heavy weapons from around  Sarajevo looked like "an attempt to discredit in the eyes of the  Americans the first independent step of Russia."    "Surely America could not admit that its policy in  Yugoslavia  had fallen through," Popov said.</p>

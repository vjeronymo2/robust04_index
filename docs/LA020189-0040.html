			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Flu has hit the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Orchestra Manager Nancybell Coe  reports that 10 of the orchestra's 75 instrumentalists scheduled to play a  Beethoven/Schubert program last week were out with the flu bug. The sick group  included Principal Concertmaster Sidney Weiss. "Because the program did not  require a full orchestra, and because only one player was taking the week off  anyway, we had to hire only two substitutes," says Coe. What will happen when  the Philharmonic meets today for its first rehearsal of this week, no one is  predicting. . . . ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

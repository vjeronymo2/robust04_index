			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters believe that the proposed notification requirements for ``Large Model Rocket'' launches are unnecessary and burdensome. Commenters argue that the FAA has cited ``no cases where notification would have increased air safety above and beyond .&blank;.&blank;. current regulations which require no notification.'' Several commenters also mention the potential for conflict to occur between lawful rocketeers and airport/ATC officials who are unfamiliar with model rocketry and with 14 CFR Part 101 entitlement. Two commenters detail occasions where misinformation was believed to have resulted in the denial of waiver applications or the interruption of model rocket launch competitions. Commenters are equally troubled by the requirement to notify air traffic officials within 24 to 48 hours of ``Large Model Rocket'' launches, regardless of where these launches occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed notification requirements assist the FAA and airport officials in determining how model rocket launch activities may affect flight operations in a given area. The proposed requirements are not intended to hinder or minimize model rocket activity, but merely to ensure that airspace is mutually accommodating of both model rocket operations and aircraft operations. To this end, FAA or airport officials review model rocket launch information and make it available to pilots, as necessary, via air traffic control or through Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) publications. NOTAMs highlight events that may result in airspace restrictions and give time frames in which restrictions will be in effect. Review of NOTAMs offers pilots an opportunity to adjust or reschedule their flight plans in light of planned aerial activity. Because a pilot's awareness of model rocket launches enhances this safety process, the proposed notification requirements are beneficial. Additionally, to facilitate disclosure of requested model rocket launch data, the NPRM proposed a decrease in the amount and specificity of information currently required from rocketeers. For example, when there are multiple participants at a single event, rather than give names and addresses for every rocketeer, a single person may be designated as the event launch coordinator for the operation. Similarly, rather than provide the specific number, size, weight, and maximum altitude of each rocket to be launched, the appropriate individual may estimate the information. The FAA further concludes that the current level of safety will not be decreased by utilizing the less restrictive reporting requirements as proposed in the NPRM when a single name and address of the person provided is that of the event launch coordinator, and this person is the one who has provided the other required launch data estimates for that event. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters recommend that notification of the airport manager or FAA tower facility be required only when large model rockets will be launched into controlled airspace or within 5 miles of an airport. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current prohibition against operating such model rockets in controlled airspace, within 5 miles of an airport, within 1,500 feet of any non-participant, or between sunset and sunrise, will not apply provided the person operating the model rocket complies with the proposed modified provisions of &sect;101.25. The intent of the notice requirement is not to exclude or hinder model rocket operations, but to provide notification of such operations to afford an adequate level of safety for person and property in the air, as well as on the ground. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters maintain that the notice requirement is unrealistic for several reasons: Model rocket launch times are inherently unpredictable as they are dependent upon favorable cloud cover and weather conditions; many impromptu launches occur at model rocket meets, making it difficult to give prior disclosure of the total number of participants and other launch information; the notification process may prove too complex for novice or youthful rocketeers; and, the notification process is likely to be cost intensive to the FAA, as the agency will be forced to process a presumably high number of waiver applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA disagrees that the notification process may prove too complex for novice or youthful rocketeers. Through voluntary compliance with the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Model Rocket Safety Code, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  model rocketeers of all ages have proven a ready aptitude and willingness for ensuring launch safety and have demonstrated an awareness of how to knowledgeably operate scientific equipment. The effective handling of these important responsibilities is believed to be an accurate indicator of rocketeers' ability to adhere to the proposed notification requirements. The FAA acknowledges that the agency will incur costs in receiving, recording, and evaluating notification information; but, the agency determines these costs to be minor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters believe the FAA needs to update 14 CFR Part 101 to reflect the current technology of model rocketry and to promote the inherent educational value of the hobby. According to the NAR, original model rocket limitations were set in light of what was the only foreseeable type of model rocket propellant at the time, black powder. Over the years, new propellant technologies have emerged that are vastly superior to black powder, both in terms of specific impulse and a capability to accommodate more complex payloads, e.g. cameras, radio control receivers, and computer equipment. One commenter mentions that it is difficult to construct these payloads while remaining within the present 16 ounce total weight limitation. Most commenters agree that the more diverse payloads available with larger-sized rockets present unique opportunities for promoting scientific study. Teachers and rocketry clubs report using larger rockets as educational aids. Science professionals use them in collecting data and conducting analysis. These groups believe their efforts help the United States remain academically and technologically competitive. As such, they assert that the FAA's proposed restrictions on large model rockets are counterproductive to scientific achievement and overall growth of the model rocket industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

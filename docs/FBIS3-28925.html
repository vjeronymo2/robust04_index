Earlier, Hosokawa had told leaders in his ruling coalition  government that Japan considered dialogue the best means of  resolving suspicions that Pyongyang may be attempting to build a  nuclear arsenal.    Hosokawa, following a meeting with U.S. President Bill  Clinton over the weekend, had indicated that Japan was ready to  support the United Nations Security Council if it decides to  impose sanctions on Pyongyang.    On Monday, Hosokawa spoke with Kim by telephone and both  leaders agreed that cooperation with the U.S. will be essential  to getting Pyongyang to accept inspections of its nuclear sites  by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the officials said.    With the IAEA board of governors set to meet February 21,  the  U.S. has indicated a willingness to take Pyongyang's refusal to  allow the checks to the Security Council and press for sanctions.    Japan and South Korea, which fear that sanctions might  further heighten tension on the Korean peninsula and eventual  disruptions in east Asia, have been seeking a negotiated  settlement to the inspections impasse.    Pyongyang maintains that its nuclear facilities are for  peaceful purposes only, but has refused for more than a year to  grant IAEA inspectors access to sites believed to be nuclear  waste storage facilities.    During the meeting earlier in the day with the leaders of  the  government and ruling coalition parties, Hosokawa said, "Japan  considers the best plan is through dialogue, no matter what the  situation is.    In Washington over the weekend, however, the prime minister  told reporters that Japan will take all possible measures to the  extent of Japanese law if the Security Council proposes  sanctions against Pyongyang.    Meanwhile, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social  Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest among the seven ruling  parties, told reporters Monday that imposing sanctions against  North Korea would be counterproductive.    Kubo proposed that a resolution be sought through the  friendly connections between the (North) Korean Workers' Party  and the Chinese Communist Party. He said further that there is  no way of knowing what kind of ill effects sanctions would have  on both North Korea and Japan.    "Even though negotiations for establishing diplomatic  relations between Japan and North Korea have broken down,  efforts to improve relations would open the path" to resolving  the nuclear issue, Kubo said.</p>

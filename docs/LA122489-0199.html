			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: SUBLIME PLEASURES OF THANK-YOU NOTES  </P> <P> Everybody who celebrates Christmas is looking forward to tomorrow afternoon,  Miss Manners trusts.  </P> <P> Yes, she knows that you plan to open your presents in the morning, or perhaps  Christmas Eve night. What she had in mind was the happy anticipation of  spending Christmas afternoon writing thank-you letters.  </P> <P> What an opportunity this is to curl up cozily in a favorite corner, with a  trusted old fountain pen and piles of enticingly fresh paper at hand, and dash  off notes expressive of your gratitude at being remembered, your delight in new  possessions, and your overflowing warmth toward those who took so much care on  your behalf. It also gives Christmas dinner a chance to settle.  </P> <P> Miss Manners is hearing some murmurs from the crowd. Perhaps there are  questions concerning this simple and rewarding task.  </P> <P> Yes? You, there, holding the, ah -- what is that thing, anyway?  </P> <P> "Exactly," you reply. "What about something I hate? Do I still have to write a  thank-you note, and if so, what can I possibly say?"  </P> <P> Miss Manners should not have to point out that it is just as much trouble to  select a useless, ugly object as it is a treasure. It is therefore necessary  for the unlucky recipient to render thanks for an unwelcome present as much as  for a welcome one. But as the giver obviously did not know how useless and ugly  the stupid thing was, the goal of the thank-you letter is to avoid enlightening  him or her on this point. It should therefore be indistinguishable from one  written out of genuine appreciation.  </P> <P> "How can I do that without lying?"  </P> <P> Miss Manners wishes that just once in a while she would hear such declarations  of devotion to honesty when it is not a question of getting out of a task (or  delivering an insult). There should be no trouble about saying honestly how  grateful you were to be remembered. Since a thank-you letter must also contain  something about the present, Miss Manners recommends to the morally fastidious  the words wonderful, terrific and awesome. A ghastly present can easily be any  one of these, as your dictionary will confirm.  </P> <P> "Do I have to write to people I thanked in person?"  </P> <P> Only for extraordinary presents. An oral "Gee, I really liked the car" is not  enough; a written document after a personal exchange of fruitcakes is too much.  </P> <P> "Can I save time by doing my thank-you letters on the computer?"  </P> <P> Do you suppose that your grandparents don't recognize an all-purpose computer  paragraph when they see one? Thank-you letters must be handwritten. Miss  Manners does give special dispensation to those for whom that is a hardship --  if the writing hand is arthritic, for example -- but will no longer tolerate  abuses of this indulgence from those who are too lazy to write legibly.  </P> <P> "Can I fax it?"  </P> <P> Yes, provided that you are not violating the rule against using office  equipment for personal business. Miss Manners is not unreasonable; she likes  toys as much as the next person who tries to dignify them under the name of  technology.  </P> <P> DEAR MISS MANNERS -- Should signet and monogram rings be worn so that the crest  and initials face the person wearing the ring, or in the opposite direction so  that the face of the ring is upright for an observer?  </P> <P> GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners hopes you do not fancy that such a ring has the  same purpose as a designer label, explaining the provenance of the body wearing  it.  </P> <P> As it is not intended to be read by appraisers, it is not worn to face the  public.  </P></p>

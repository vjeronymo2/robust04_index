			<p>Boride   Base Cermets   <F P=102> 43070061B Tokyo ISBB'93 in English Aug 93 p 26--FOR OFFICIAL  USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070061B </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ISBB'93 </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Kenichi Takagi, Toyo Kohan </F> Co., Ltd.]    [Text] Recently, wear-resistant materials require a wide  range of properties such as corrosion and oxidation resistance,  electrical and thermal conductivity, etc., in addition to wear  resistance. Borides, especially transition metal borides, have  intrinsic properties, i.e., high melting point, high hardness  and electrical conductivity, hence they are promising candidates  for the wear-resistant application. However, poor sinterability  and extreme brittleness of borides have notorious disadvantages  to form solid structures in spite of their excellent properties.    One solution to the above problem had reached the  combination  of a boride with a tough metal matrix, namely a boride base  cermet. But strong chemical reaction between a boride and a  metal matrix failed in the fabrication of the cermet with  satisfactory mechanical properties due to the formation of  brittle third phases.    By enhancing the reaction between a boride and a metal  matrix  instead of restricting it between them, a novel strategy to form  a ternary boride coexisted with metal during the sintering  process starting with a binary boride and a metal resulted in  successful achievement of a cemented boride with excellent wear  resistance and mechanical properties.    This new sintering technique, named reaction boronizing  sintering, has already developed three ternary boride base  cermets; namely, Mo[.sub]2[/]FeB[.sub]2[/],[.sup]1[/]  MO[.sub]2[/]NI- B[.sub]2[/],[.sup]2[/] and  WCoB[.sup]3[/] base ones. These new ternary boride base  cermets have been successfully applied to wear-resistant  applications such as injection molding machine parts, can-making  tools, hot copper extruding dies, etc.    In this paper, criteria for the development of ternary  boride  base cermets and the characteristics of those will be discussed.

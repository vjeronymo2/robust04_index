			<p>BFN     [Text] More than 3,000 people took part in the May-Day  demonstration in Nalchik on Sunday. The demonstrators marched  along the city's central street from the square commemorating  the 400th anniversary of Kabarda's joining Russia over to Lenin  Square. Among the demonstrators were Prime Minister of  Kabardino-Balkaria Georgiy Cherkesov, Vice President Gennadiy  Gubin and other leaders of the republic.    The meeting in front of the government building was  addressed  by President of Kabardino-Balkaria Valeriy Kokov, who said that  ethnic peace and agreement had been preserved and that May-Day  celebrations were marked by optimism and confidence in the  future. He also said that the embezzlement of national property  had been prevented, the labor potential saved and social support  provided for pensioners, disabled people and low-incomes groups.    Speaking about the situation in the Russian Federation,  Kokov  said that the adoption of the new constitution last December had  marked the beginning of a new process of sociopolitical  stabilization. "The bitter fate of the Soviet Union, whose  break up filled the hearts of million of people with pain, will  not befell on the Russian Federation," he said.    He also welcomed the signing of the Civic Accord agreement  as  a stabilizing factor which meets the interests of the people,  who are tired of political confrontation.    In conclusion, Kokov congratulated Christians on Easter and  expressed hope that religious confessions will help strengthen  the unity of Kabardino-Balkaria and preserve ethnic peace.    After the meeting festivities were held involving  professional and amateur performers.</p>

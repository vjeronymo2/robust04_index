			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent's report on interview with Tibor Fuzessy, </F> minister without portfolio in charge of the National Security  Office, at Ferihegy Airport on 19 January: "We Must Pay  Attention to Every Extremism"]    [Text] We interviewed Tibor Fuzessy, minister without  portfolio in charge of the National Security Office, about  cooperation between the Hungarian and Italian intelligence  services and the experiences of his recent visit to Rome, at  Ferihegy Airport on 19 January. Fuzessy also spoke about  intelligence activity regarding the extremist political  groupings.    "The late Prime Minister Jozsef Antall's widow and two  children flew to Rome for the holy mass in memory of her husband  on the same airplane as I did. Many people asked whether there  was any political connection here" -- Fuzessy told us. "This  was only a coincidence, because we planned my trip to Rome well  in advance; I paid an official visit, while the Antall family  paid a personal visit to Rome."    Fuzessy told us that the cooperation between the two  countries' intelligence services can now be openly called  partnership relations. Control over the intelligence agencies  was one of the major issues discussed at the meeting held at the  partner organizations.    "The answer to this question is never easy and never free of  debate" -- Fuzessy pointed out. In Italy, for example, a group  of several ministers is in charge of the intelligence services.  "We are trying to find a solution that provides the best  guarantee that the intelligence services cannot act against the  law. This is an important issue in Italy too, where the  political restructuring also affects the activity of the  intelligence services."    Fuzessy told us that antiterrorist actions and the struggle  against organized crime, money laundering, and the smuggling of  weapons and drugs were the main subjects discussed in the course  of his talks with the heads of Western intelligence services.  "We succeeded in getting the Hungarian intelligence  organizations accepted as partners at the talks" -- Fuzessy  added and said that this was one of the major achievements of  recent years.    Organized crime is a relatively new development in the area  of influence of the former Soviet Union and, naturally, in the  former Yugoslavia. The Western intelligence organizations,  including the Italian intelligence services, are very much  interested in this development, and we succeeded in agreeing on  the exchange of certain information, and we will receive  information about the movement and actions of certain groups.    Then we asked Fuzessy for any information about extremist  political groupings in Hungary, like the World National Popular  Rule Party.    "Many parties often fear that the National Security Office  keeps them under surveillance. This is not true. However, the  National Security Office must keep an eye on everyone who has  ideas or actions that could be anti-constitutional; namely those  that aim at overthrowing the democratic state" -- Fuzessy  pointed out. It is the obligation of the National Security  Office to pay attention to every political extremism, no matter  on what side.    Fuzessy told us that the activity of a party becomes a crime  when the party is striving to take over power. A fascist-type  takeover of power, or any organized activity with this aim would  already qualify as a crime. However, as long as a party  declares such an ideology but wants to achieve its goals through  democratic means, it cannot be called to account.    However, other manifestations, like the use of forbidden  symbols, already border on crime. Incitement also qualifies as  a crime. This is an area "that the extremist parties can easily  slip into" -- Fuzessy said in conclusion.</p>

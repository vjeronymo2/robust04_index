			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LATE PAPERWORK STALLS START OF BRODERICK TRIAL;  </P> <P> COURTS: AN UNFINISHED QUESTIONNAIRE FOR POTENTIAL JURORS STOPPED PROCEEDINGS  FIVE MINUTES AFTER THEY STARTED IN THE TRIAL OF A WOMAN CHARGED WITH KILLING  HER EX-HUSBAND AND HIS NEW WIFE.  </P> <P> Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick's double murder trial officially began  Thursday -- and concluded for the day all of five minutes later because a jury  questionnaire was not yet ready.  </P> <P> Jury selection in the case was due to start Thursday with distribution of the  questionnaire to hundreds of potential jurors. But since the form was not  finished, San Diego Superior Court Judge Thomas Whelan called a halt to the  proceedings and ordered them to resume today.  </P> <P> Whelan said that his preliminary review of the questionnaire indicated that it  contained some sensitive questions. He did not, however, disclose the nature of  any of the questions.  </P> <P> He also warned Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells and defense lawyer Jack Earley  that they would not be allowed follow-up questions in open court on the  sensitive material.  </P> <P> Broderick, 42, faces two counts of murder in the shooting deaths last Nov. 5 of  her ex-husband, Daniel T. Broderick III, and his new wife, Linda Kolkena  Broderick. They were shot as they slept in their Marston Hills home.  </P> <P> Daniel Broderick was a prominent medical malpractice attorney and a former  county bar president.  </P> <P> During and after a bitter divorce, Betty accused Daniel of using his legal  influence to cheat her out of her fair share of his seven-figure income.  </P> <P> Betty Broderick confessed to the killings in a March interview with The Times.  She said they were a "desperate act of self-defense" against a man who wanted  to control her.  </P> <P> Betty Broderick has pleaded not guilty. She has been held without bail at the  Las Colinas women's jail in Santee since November.  </P> <P> At Thursday's hearing, she wore an electric-blue suit that almost hid the  chains around her waist and wrist, a change from the appliqued pantsuit she  wore at previous court appearances. She also appeared to have lost considerable  weight.  </P> <P> Jury selection, which will begin officially today when the questionnaires are  distributed to hundreds of potential jurors, is expected to last two or three  weeks, Whelan said.  </P> <P> In all, the trial is slated to run six or seven weeks, Whelan said. "In no  event" should it last until Thanksgiving, he said.  </P></p>

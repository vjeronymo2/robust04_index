			<p>BFN     [Text] Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev made an  official statement for the mass media in which he assessed the  situation in the country. According to him, the government has  reached the conclusion that the days before signing the  agreements with the international financial institutes will  prompt the most acute conflicts from a political point of view.    [Begin Matinchev recording] Our opponents know that those  agreements will be signed in the next few days. On behalf of  the Bulgarian Government, I want to assure the Bulgarian people  that precisely those agreements, against the background of the  strenuous budget adopted by the National Assembly and the  difficulties that all people experience, will contribute to  stabilizing the general socioeconomic situation in the country.    Unfortunately, precisely at this moment, apparently sensing  an opportunity to destabilize the country, certain political and  financial forces are trying to create panic on the foreign  currency and stock market by disseminating incorrect and  provocative rumors, thus prompting speculators to purchase  convertible currency on their behalf in unjustifiably large  quantities.    In the last two days and especially yesterday, this caused  an  abnormal and speculative rise in the dollar rate on the foreign  currency market. [end recording]    Further in his statement, Evgeni Matinchev stressed that the  government is determined to achieve its goals and successfully  complete the talks with the international financial institutes.  Together with the National Bank, the government will adopt  measures aimed at stopping the speculations.    Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev appealed to sober  politicians  and all citizens to preserve maximum calm, something that would  guarantee the success of the reforms, prevent the devaluation of  the Bulgarian lev, and the destabilization of the country.</p>

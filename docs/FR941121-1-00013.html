			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Volkswagen and American Honda commented that replaceable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lens headlamps could be designed to require removal of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> headlamp from the vehicle in order to replace the lens. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have the effect, desirable to the commenters, of causing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners to rely on the vehicle manufacturer's dealers for lens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement. However, causing lens replacement to be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expensive and less convenient diminishes the prospect of greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> headlamp maintenance in states without inspection. Further,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners compelled by state inspection to replace parts often  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insist on making their own repairs to minimize their burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Making the task unnecessarily complex only increases the chances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the owner will make a poor repair. In the case of HID  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integral beam headlamps, easy removal of the lens without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disturbing the other components may reduce high voltage hazards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during owner repairs. The better solution, suggested by the AAMA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and others, is to adopt durability and environmental requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for replaceable lens headlamps to increase the likelihood that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relensed headlamps will perform satisfactorily regardless of who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services them. This solution minimizes the potential loss of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance from degraded reflectors and maximizes the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for inexpensive voluntary lens repairs in states without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The most detailed comments to the question of reflector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> durability were those of Ford Motor Company. They contain a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive statement of the reflector durability problem and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some general guidance concerning appropriate test procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford commented: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Replaceable bulb headlamps currently incorporate reflective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surfaces not specifically designed to withstand direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental exposure or abrasion. If the condition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prompting replacement of a lens has resulted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contamination or discoloration of the reflector surface  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., as might occur due to a lens crack or loss of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity of the lens/reflector seal), a degradation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> photometric performance would be expected, as compared to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new replacement headlamp. Attempts to clean a contaminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflector, as by wiping, could result in abrasion to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metallized surface, possibly resulting in degraded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> photometric performance and/or increased glare. Ford  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore recommends that rulemaking on replaceable lens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> headlamps consider the need for the reflective surfaces of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaceable lens headlamps to withstand appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental exposure and cleaning operations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ford's recommendations were:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Ford recommends that headlamps with replaceable lenses, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to present requirements applicable to replaceable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bulb headlamps, be subjected to salt-fog, moisture and dust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure without the lens in place. Additionally, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflector surface should be capable of withstanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance to chemicals that are likely to be used by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers or repair facilities to clean contaminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflector surfaces. Subsequent to appropriate environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and chemical exposure, the reflector should be cleaned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> according to a prescribed procedure. When fitted with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lens following exposure and cleaning, the headlamp should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of meeting the same photometric requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to replaceable bulb headlamps with bonded lenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aftermarket lens manufacturers should be required to certify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that any headlamp for which the lens is intended is capable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of meeting photometric requirements when fitted with a lens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of that design. Additionally, aftermarket replacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lenses should be accompanied with complete instructions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly removing the old lens, cleaning the interior of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> headlamp body, cleaning and preparing the mating surface on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the headlamp body and installing the new lens on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> headlamp body. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The durability and environmental requirements for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present replaceable bulb headlamps and the deliberations that led  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to them may be useful in considering reasonable requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reflectors of replaceable lens headlamps. When the agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended Standard No. 108 to permit replaceable bulb headlamps, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was aware that German vehicle inspection data showed significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rejections due to dull, corroded and damaged headlamp reflectors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, NHTSA promulgated an appropriate test of corrosion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resistance for replaceable bulb headlamps for use in the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States. The lamp assembly must be exposed for ten days in a salt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spray chamber, with the additional requirement than the bulb be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed and the spray deactivated during the last hour of all but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two test days. The test put a premium on the ability of the lens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to protect the reflector from the salt spray. It also required a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree of direct corrosion resistance exceeding the performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of some European headlamps by having the lamps exposed to several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours of salty air in the chamber without direct spray. In its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original form, the rule required that the headlamp pass the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> photometric test at the completion of the corrosion test. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> post-exposure photometric test was later eliminated because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the possibility of salt deposits that could not be removed easily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a headlamp with a bonded lens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

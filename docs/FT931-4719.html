			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Fundholder axed THE Far Lane Medical Centre in Sheffield yesterday became the first to be expelled from the government's fundholding scheme. Trent Regional Health Authority expelled the practice because of 'failure to effectively and efficiently' manage its budget. Last year it overspent by Pounds 100,000. It is forecast to be in deficit again this year.</p>

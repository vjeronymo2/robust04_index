			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow May 19 (CTK) -- The visit of leader of the  ultra-national Liberal Democratic Party of Russia Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, which was to take place at the weekend, has been  postponed indefinitely, the party's representatives told CTK  today. They said the decision had been made at today's session  of a faction of the Liberal Democrats, adding that the reason  was a bribery scandal involving members of the faction.    "Vladimir Volfovich must stay in Moscow for the time being.  This is a fault of the irresponsible journalists who are as  always slandering the Liberal Democratic Party," head of the  party's faction in the State Duma (lower house of parliament)  Andrey Losev told CTK. "The visit has been postponed at the  moment. It is difficult to say when it will take place," he  added.    Commentator Nikoli Svanidze said last week on Russian  Television that Zhirinovskiy had promised each member of his  party $500 if they voted in favour of the government-submitted  draft state budget. The Liberal Democrats want to lodge a  complaint against Svanidze and they demand that he be barred  temporarily from the television screen at least.    Zhirinovskiy was to come to Bratislava at the weekend at the  invitation of private businessman Ladislav Mojzis and Jozef  Lauko, who was a guest at the April congress of Zhirinovskiy's  party in Moscow.    Originally Zhirinovskiy was also to visit Prague on March  20,  but the visit at the invitation of the extreme-right Assembly  for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) was  cancelled after a representative of the Liberal Democrats met  with a Czech Embassy official.    According to unofficial sources in Moscow, the  representative  informed the Liberal Democrats that the Czech Government  considered their leader's visit to Prague "most inappropriate"  and that it would use all legal possibilities to prevent it.  Zhirinovskiy explained the indefinite postponement of this  visit by the SPR-RSC's refusal to finance his trip.</p>

			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE  </P> <P> Conine states that it would not be unfair to expect Social Security recipients  to shoulder their share of cutting the deficit. He forgets one thing. Social  Security recipients, by and large, live on a fixed income. Any new burden  cannot be shouldered without extreme hardship.  </P> <P> I was a notch-year baby so I do not get my fair share of Social Security. The  tax reform bill raised my taxes, not lowered them. Now I must pay a lot more  than I planned on for Medicare, $31.90 per month plus user taxes.  </P> <P> Now, people like Mr. Conine feel that I must shoulder more taxes. I wish they  could walk in my shoes for the proverbial mile.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH GRAHAM  </P> <P> Palm Desert  </P></p>

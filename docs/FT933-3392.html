			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CentreGold to play the market CENTREGOLD, a leading UK publisher and distributor of video game and computer entertainment software, is planning to come to market through a placing with institutional investors. The Birmingham-based group was founded by Mr Geoff Brown, a former teacher, with Pounds 200 of capital 10 years ago. Mr Brown expects to retain about a 30 per cent stake in the group. He said the planned flotation would provide additional capital for the group and enable it to continue to expand in both UK and other markets. In the 12 months to July 31 1992 CentreGold doubled its pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.7m on sales of Pounds 55.1m and in the eight months to end-March this year posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.55m on sales of Pounds 25.3m. 'We have expanded steadily through organic growth,' Mr Brown said. The group operates through two main subsidiaries - CentreSoft, which distributes computer and video game entertainment software to 1,300 retailers including the Boots and John Menzies chains, and US Gold, which publishes PC software and video games for Sega and Nintendo games machines on both sides of the Atlantic. Other subsidiaries include Electric Dreams, which sells computer entertainment software and hardware through concessions within Harrods in Knightsbridge and Allders in Croydon, and IBD which provides wholesale distribution of low-cost, often older, business software and peripherals. CentreSoft ranks among the biggest distributors of Sega and Nintendo games cartridges in Britain while US Gold ranks among the top six UK publishers. After producing the official video game for the Barcelona Olympics, CentreGold now has the rights to next year's winter Olympics in Norway and World Cup football finals in the US. CentreGold has been advised by Smith New Court.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / OECD fear at private debt levels THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has expressed concern about the build-up of private-sector debt in the US, UK and Japan over the past decade. In its latest thrice-yearly review, Financial Market Trends, the Paris-based think tank of 24 industrialised countries said it could not be argued that private debt developments posed a menace to global financial stability. 'But in a number of major countries the volume of private indebtedness has affected the soundness of the banking system and is a factor that hampers economic recovery.' The OECD singled out for concern 'the slump in real estate in the US, the UK and Japan' and the low loan-loss provisions of Japanese banks. The report said it was unclear whether deregulation of interest rates and credit would lead to a lasting increase in instability in the financial system, as some feared. Financial Market Trends: 53.

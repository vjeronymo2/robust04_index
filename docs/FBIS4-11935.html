			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, April 1 (AFP) -- Forces opposing Afghan  President Borhanoddin Rabbani killed and wounded inhabitants  Friday [1 April] in a hail of rockets, loyalist radio Kabul said.    The broadcast, monitored here, said the attack came on the  eve of a planned visit by a special United Nations peace mission  led by Mahmoud Mestiri.    The UN team is to leave Islamabad for Kabul Saturday for  talks with Rabbani, his rival, Prime Minister Golboddin  Hekmatyar, and other factional leaders to explore ways of ending  13 weeks of fighting for control of Kabul.    The radio, controlled by Rabbani loyalists, blamed the  attack  on Hekmatyar and his military ally, Abdoul Rashid Dostam, leader  of the Uzbek militia, and said it came despite their pledge to  hold a temporary ceasefire from dawn Friday to facilitate the UN  visit.    The radio said people were killed and wounded but it gave no  figures.    No confirmation was immediately available from the rival  side.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Letter: Carlton TV committed to current affairs Sir, As a one-time member of the This Week production team, I share some of Christopher Dunkley's sadness at the passing of the programme ('Sad goodbye to long-term survivors', December 16). A pity, though, that despite information made available to him on This Week's final edition, he sketches a less-than-accurate picture of the plans of Carlton, which takes over from Thames on January 1. The Good Sex Guide is not Carlton's 'top-ranked' factual programme. As he knows, the major current affairs programme which we will supply to ITV is Storyline, commissioned from a former World in Action producer of considerable experience. It will be broadcast at 19.30 on Thursdays for the first seven weeks of 1993, returning later for a further six editions, and we hope thereafter on a more regular basis. That decision is for the network, and not for Carlton to make. And the Cook Report has not been scheduled for this slot. Last, it seems that nostalgia breeds anachronism. It is a long time since any UK current affairs programme found it editorially or financially sensible to base its agenda on flying out crews 'to cover any trouble spot in the world'. As successive editors of Panorama and This Week have discovered over the past 15 years, the revolution in satellite news-gathering and the multiplication of other news-based factual programmes have made instant reaction a rare feature of the flagship titles. That is, of course, part of a broader debate about the role and scheduling of factual programmes. Suffice it to say that Carlton has every intention to offer current affairs programming of quality and substance from January 1993. Peter Ibbotson, director of corporate affairs, Carlton Television, 101 St Martin's Lane, London WC2N 4AZ</p>

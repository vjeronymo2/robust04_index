			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report under the "Foreign Policy" </F> rubric: "Two Press Conferences on One Problem. Two  Diametrically Opposed Views Expressed on Yugoslavia"]    [Text] Two press conference have been held at the State  Duma on the same day by deputies who spoke about their trips to  the former Yugoslavia. The first group was headed by an  official, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, deputy of State Duma Chairman  Ivan Rybkin and Liberal Democratic Party Chairman Zhirinovskiy.  He was accompanied by Vitaliy Sevostyanov, a communist; Lyubov  Rozhkova, from the New Regional Policy faction; and Yevgeniy  Fedorov, an independent. The second group was made up of Viktor  Sheynis, "Yabloko," and Mark Feygin, "Russia's Choice," who  traveled there at the invitation of the Serb-Russian Friendship  Society.    Speeches at the press conferences have demonstrated an  expected, but still paradoxical result: the official group was  characterized by extreme radicalism, while the private one was  extremely moderate. Both groups outlined a similar range of  problems facing the present-day Balkans, but offered  diametrically opposed assessments of the problems and methods to  resolve them.    In the view of Mr. Vengerovskiy's "team," the situation in  the republics of the former Yugoslavia could not be worse, while  Mr. Sheynis and "Yabloko" believe that "the tide is turning,  although it is weak and fragile." The deputy speaker thinks  that the Yugoslav conflict was provoked by outside forces, while  his opponent thinks that internal ones are to blame. The State  Duma's official representatives entitled their statement "On the  Situation in the Serb Republics," while the unofficial ones  emphasized that there are no such subjects of international law.  The former denounced the Russian Foreign Ministry for conniving  at the UN actions, while the latter praised the Foreign Ministry  for its recent constructive steps.    Speaking about the Serbs' hopes for Russian support, the  first group focused its attention on the Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia and military assistance provided in the form of  "Russian volunteers" as opposed to "Muslim and Croat  mercenaries;" the second group pointed to Russian democrats who  could support Serbia's peace-loving forces.    The officials offered two exotic drafts: the resettlement of  140,000-200,000 Russians -- "refugees, officers, and warrant  officers" -- to the Adriatic coast and the deployment of the  Russian Navy in locations where Croat aggression seems most  probable. The other group was stingy with drafts.    Both groups favored the lifting of sanctions against  Yugoslavia, but by different methods. Mr. Vengerovskiy proposed  that they be lifted immediately, that the Serb republics be  recognized, and that "UN bribe takers," who profit by smuggling  illicit goods, be spurned. Mr. Sheynis pointed out that a lack  of joint borders between Yugoslavia and Russia makes it  impossible to lift the embargo unilaterally, that bypassing the  United Nations would be irresponsible and counterproductive, but  that one has to fight for the official lifting of the sanctions  imposed because the Serbs rejected the Vance-Owen plan, which  has already been buried by all the conflicting sides.    The two missions had different visions of the State Duma's  role, too. The deputy chairman called on the Duma to head the  pro-Serb movement in Russia and to revise "legislation that  regulates the activity of the Russian Government with regard to  the republics of the former Yugoslavia." The "private" Sheynis  put forward the modest idea of "influencing public opinion in  Russia and abroad" and parliamentary hearings on the Yugoslav  question.    The only occasion where Mr. Vengerovskiy sounded softer  involved his opponent: In his words, Sheynis professed  universal human values. The opposite side's assessment was  harsher: In "Yabloko's" opinion, members of the official group  were characterized by a pre-formed stance, incompetence, and the  desire to exploit international problems in the domestic  struggle.</p>

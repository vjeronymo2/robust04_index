			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (1): Strains start to ease - Recession persists and the remnants of market protectionism and government controls are still in evidence. However, the Balladur administration's recently launched privatisation programme could, if it is successful, propel the sector into a new era of modernisation WHEN Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, this month announced that more than 2.8m private investors had applied for shares in Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), he knew that the first phase of the French government's privatisation programme had been a success. The success of the privatisations is critical not only to the credibility of Mr Alphandery and the rest of the Balladur administration, but to the future of the French financial system. The last privatisation drive, launched in the mid-1980s when Edouard Balladur was economy minister, marked the start of the modernisation of France's financial sector by loosening its old links with the state and heralding a new wave of market deregulation. International investment has since flooded into France. Many of the leading players in French finance have expanded their activities into other countries. Yet the path towards modernisation has been impeded by lingering anachronisms from the old era of market protectionism and government controls. Although the humiliating spectacle of the Balladur government's climbdown in the Air France dispute has raised serious doubts among international investors about the strength of its commitment to liberalising industrial policy, in theory the new privatisation programme should be the catalyst for completing the process that Mr Balladur began. Despite the Air France debacle, the Balladur privatisations, which could include the sales of the Credit Lyonnais banking group and three insurance groups, Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), Assurances Generales de France (AGF) and Groupe GAN, as well as that of BNP, could scarcely have been better timed. The French economy is still in recession, but seems to have stabilised. Although no sign of industrial investment responding to lower interest rates has yet emerged and consumer confidence is depressed by the continuing rise in unemployment, the consensus among economists is that France will return to growth next year. 'There is no evidence yet of a general economic recovery,' said Michel Albert, chairman of AGF. 'We're still in a state of stagnation, but there are some positive signs.' It was this promise of recovery that secured the success of the BNP issue. BNP, like the other leading French banks, has had a hard time over the past two years. The credit market has been static for the first time since the second world war and the banks have been forced to make hefty provisions because of the rise in business failures and the collapse of the commercial property market. All the French banks have suffered but by far the most vulnerable has been Credit Lyonnais, which last year crashed into the red because of its exposure to a string of corporate horror stories, from the late Robert Maxwell media empire to MGM, the troubled Hollywood movie studio. The banks are still under strain, but most analysts suspect the worst is over - even for Credit Lyonnais. Trading is now more stable, as is the property market and, although the banks may have to make more provisions on small corporate loans, they do at least have breathing space to tackle internal issues such as cost cutting and productivity improvements. 'Our performance at the moment is still influenced by the economic situation,' said Michel Pebereau, chairman of BNP. 'The economy will eventually recover and in the meantime we must concentrate on becoming more efficient and on controlling costs.' The insurance industry is in a similar predicament, albeit for different reasons. The main difficulties for the French insurers were intense competition from the banks and specialist mutuels groups in the buoyant life insurance business and a steep increase in claims in the less resilient damage sector. They have also been affected by falling commercial property prices, which meant they could no longer compensate for their trading problems with lucrative real estate deals. Those pressures are now easing. Commercial property is still in the doldrums but the insurers, like the banks, are starting to benefit from recent cost cutting and technology initiatives. Life insurance remains competitive, but the growth of the mutuels seems to have peaked and the market has continued to grow in spite of the recession. Signs of improvement are also appearing in the damage sector, where companies have countered the rise in claims by increasing premiums. Francois Heilbronner, chairman of GAN, expects the industry next year to come out of the red in damage insurance. As a result UAP, AGF, GAN and eventually Credit Lyonnais should be able to present investors with convincing recovery stories when their privatisations get under way. They should also benefit, as did BNP, from the high level of interest in French equities on the part of international investors. The Balladur privatisations have come at a time when US and Japanese investors are keen to take advantage of their strong currencies and the US mutual funds are in the process of internationalising their portfolios. The level of interest among the French public is also high, as illustrated by the BNP issue. Mr Balladur plans to use the privatisation drive to boost share ownership in France. Last summer's ingenious 'Balladur bond' and the decision to price BNP's shares so cheaply are just two of the tactics he has employed. Further, as interest rates fall, equities should seem even more attractive to the public against the dwindling returns on bonds and cash savings schemes. The companies themselves all appear to welcome the prospect of privatisation. 'Privatisation won't be a revolutionary process for us,' said Mr Albert of AGF. 'Don't forget we were a private company for many years before we were nationalised in 1946. We've also been preparing to be re-privatised since 1986 and if it had not been for the 1987 stockmarket crash we'd have been sold off six years ago. We've already changed the culture of the company by making sure that all our employees realise that profitability is our goal.' Yet privatisation will herald some changes. The most obvious differences will be that the government will no longer be able to hire - and fire - senior executives, and that the companies themselves should have more flexibility to raise capital by issuing new shares. The banks may also have more freedom to determine their own policies on interest rates and investment. Moreover, the entire financial system should benefit from the impact of privatisation on the Paris stockmarket. One of the market's main problems has been a lack of liquidity, caused by a shortage of equity and investment. Privatisation will provide an instant, if partial solution by releasing up to FFr45bn (Pounds 5.24bn) of new shares on to the Paris market this year and at least FFr55bn next year. It should also help to address the investment issue by bringing new capital from international institutions and the French public into equities. The next landmark for the French financial sector after privatisation will be pension reform, which will not only provide a profitable source of new business for the banks and insurers but should also include the creation of private pension funds. Pension reform is still at a preliminary stage. Mr Balladur only recently asked Mr Alphandery to create a working party to examine the options for the future. It will be years before the French pension funds can achieve the size and stature of the established funds in the US and the UK. Yet the formation of fledgling pension funds is at least a step in the right direction. In the long term, the growth of such institutions should ensure that the Paris markets have the support of the type of powerful independent investors that already underpin the markets in London and New York thereby helping to complete the modernisation of the French financial system.</p>

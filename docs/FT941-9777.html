			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Latin America): Brazil closes up 3.4% in pre-Carnival burst Brazilian stocks closed up 3.4 per cent in heavy trade, buoyed by a strong inflow of foreign money, in advance of next week's Carnival holiday. The Bovespa index of the 54 most-active shares ended at 10,354 points, up 345 points. Brazil's bourses will remain closed until Wednesday. Trading will resume on Thursday. Volume finished high at Crz205.2bn (Dollars 378.1m). State telecom company Telebras rose 1.8 per cent to Crz28.60.

Brazilian stocks have surged around 55 per cent in dollar terms so far this year. Investors are also awaiting news on Sao Paulo state water and sewage utility Sabesp's forthcoming share launch. Mr Luiz Antonio Fleury, governor of Sao Paulo state, announced on Thursday that he wanted Sabesp to go public over the next 30 days. The Mexican bolsa was down moderately at the close, as profit-taking that began two days ago continued. The key IPC index of 36 leading shares dropped 16.38 points, or 0.58 per cent, to 2,802.06 on volume of 123.38m shares. Falls outnumbered gains by 59 to 47. Traders said profit-taking drove the market down to what technical analysts consider its support level of 2,800. Following recent declines, analysts said the market was likely to begin climbing toward 2,900 again.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Letter: Eastern Europe: no alternative to shock therapy Sir, Michael Prowse lashes out at 'shock therapists' in general and me in particular ('The drawbacks of shock therapy', March 2). His arguments are typical of European socialism of times passed. Rather than looking into the actual situation of the former communist countries, he refers parochially to postwar Europe, failing to see how limited its relevance is. Also, conditions in east Asia were completely different. The collapse of communism left Poland, Bulgaria and the former Soviet Union in hyperinflation. The only cure known is strict macroeconomic stabilisation, or what Mr Prowse contemptuously calls 'shock therapy'. Nor does Mr Prowse realise the extraordinary degradation and corruption of the state administration in the former communist countries. To argue in favour of intrusive state regulations under such conditions is to favour the corrupt. An obvious parallel is the end of feudalism in Europe, which was followed by laisser faire in the 1840s, in the absence of a working state administration. My chief lesson from the Polish experience is that deregulation has not gone far enough. Therefore, red tape and corruption are thriving, blocking economic recovery. Finally, Mr Prowse accuses me of not having predicted the current big fall in production in Russia. Anyone who knows my writing can witness that I have expected a stark, inevitable fall in Russian industrial production (of some 35 per cent) in connection with the change of system. While Mr Prowse continues to fight for socialism in the columns of the Financial Times, the Russian government as well as I and my colleagues are concerned with helping the Russian people from the frightful plight of socialism.

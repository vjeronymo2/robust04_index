			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / International Company News: American Brands advances to Dollars 216m AMERICAN BRANDS, the Connecticut-based tobacco and consumer products company, reports after-tax profits of Dollars 216.6m in the fourth quarter of 1991, thanks to strong performances from the tobacco and drinks businesses as well as hardware and home improvements interests. The figure compares with a Dollars 7.1m net profit earned in the same period a year earlier, but that was depressed by certain non-operating charges. At the operating profit level, American Brands made Dollars 442.3m in the final quarter of 1991, against Dollars 399.1m in the fourth quarter of 1990. The results leave the consumer products group posting a Dollars 806.1m net profit for the year, up from Dollars 588.6m in 1990. The shares rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 46 on the news. American Brands said that the underlying sales and operating profit increase in the tobacco business was 5 per cent, once the sale of a Dutch business was excluded. Operating profits here totalled Dollars 1.08bn. The insurance side saw an 8 per cent rise in operating income for the year overall at Dollars 151.8m, although fourth-quarter profits were slightly lower after higher reserves, benefits and expenses. The spirits arm - which takes in Whyte &amp; Mackay in the UK - saw an 11.9 per cent operating income improvement for the year, at Dollars 151.6m. During the year, American Brands failed to bid for Invergordon Distillers but agreed in November to acquire the trademarks of seven spirit brands owned by Seagram. Of American Brands' remaining divisions, hardware and home improvements showed a sharp advance to Dollars 141.5m from Dollars 78.1m, but operating profits in the office products sector plunged to Dollars 37.7m from Dollars 87.2m.</p>

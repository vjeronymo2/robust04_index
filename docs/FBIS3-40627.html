			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Om Prakash: "India Bowed Down to the Dunkel </F> Proposals"]    [Text] New Delhi, 19 December. The Permanent Parliamentary  Committee has given details of when and how India's attitude of  submission to the Dunkel proposals and GATT in its report  yesterday. Appropriate responses to two comments made by the  Congress (I) in the Parliament is also included in this report.  One comment was that V.P. Singh had discussed the agreement  positively when he was India's finance minister in 1986 just  before the Uruguay conference. The comment was used in a wrong  way. It was mentioned in a way to imply that V.P. Singh had  endorsed it in the Uruguay session. The second comment was  questioning why the V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar governments  did not get out of GATT? Why is the Narasimha Rao government  being asked to get out of GATT?    The Permanent Committee of the commerce ministry after  reviewing the report has raised the same concerns over the  Dunkel proposals that are bothering the people around the  country. According to this report, this whole agreement is a  device to make all the developing countries economic colonies.  The Permanent Committee warned that if there is even a small  understanding of the history of verbal assurances, we should not  trust them. Even the officials of GATT have said after repeated  analysis that GATT has become an instrument in the hands of  developed countries to crush the developing countries through  trade. V.P. Singh's comments on this agreement are included in  this report, and these show that India had not bowed down in the  beginning. The report says that this will affect our country's  autonomy and the interests of the poor will be affected. The  real compliance began in April 1989. Rajiv Gandhi's government  agreed that talks can be held with GATT over intellectual  endowment. The second important turn was taken in January 1992  and a few months before it. Anvarul Huda, then special secretary  in the commerce ministry and now the assistant director of GATT,  said, "India did not think it important to make final decision  over Dunkel in January 1992. In the January 1992 agreement, all  the participating nations had to present their final decision."  If we look at the history, at a time when the whole world was  ready to present a clear stand, the Indian government did not  even want to discuss Dunkel proposals with any one. The actions  of the governments led by V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar are  written in the history. No decision was made over GATT during  either of these two governments.    The Permanent Committee had presented its preliminary report  to the Parliament on 10 May 1992. It had tried to warn in that  report also. The history of GATT and the Uruguay conference  fully shows how India is helpless and alone on this last chance  to approve the Dunkel draft and how much control the United  States has. For more than four decades, the international trade  followed GATT regulations in customs tariffs. It was felt after  the World War ll that there should be a common agreement on  international trade. This agreement combined with the World  Bank and the IMF gave a new form to the international economic  system. It was believed that this organization would function  without any bias and will keep in mind each nation's  developmental needs to avoid wars like the WWII caused by  economic rivalries. The goal was the protection of humanity,  fairness, and equality. Therefore, 23 nations started a general  agreement over trade and tariffs. This agreement later evolved  into GATT.    However, the United States and its allies started their  games  soon after GATT was formed. The race to make the international  trade their personal property started. The United States refused  to accept the Havana Charter in 1948 and stopped the formation  of the international trade organization. The United States had  its eyes on controlling world trade after WWII and did not wish  for any international body to control trade. Only an ad hoc  organization like GATT, which it could pressure into submission,  could protect its interests. GATT has been in this format for  the last four decades. Its rules change depending on the needs  of the United States.    The first five meetings of GATT were called just to give an  international color to the U.S. mutual trade laws of 1934. When  its trade increased in 1962, the GATT meeting of Kennedy era  (1962-67) was held to absorb this increase. The Tokyo meeting of  1973 was held to facilitate the proposed 1974 U.S. trade law.  The Uruguay conference in 1986 was held to give an international  form to it all-encompassing trade and competition law of 1988.  It was clear during the '50s that GATT did not belong to all and  was not to protect everyone's interests. After one decade, GATT  concluded that it was not fair to the third world countries. The  Herbler Committee made it clear to all. It said that the  developed nations block consumption of third world countries'  products. It was against the GATT rules. The developing  countries brought this issue in the United Nation to stop this  monopoly in GATT. At that time this organization still had some  clout and the UNCTAD (United Nations Committee for Trade and  Development) was formed. Its first general secretary, Raul  Prebish, investigated GATT and concluded that it could not  relate trade with the development structure. GATT had to accept  under the pressure of the developing countries that developed  nations and developing countries are not equal where trade was  concerned. Every nation has its own unique developmental needs  and this should be kept in mind when discussing trade.    However, the UNCTAD efforts were limited to paper only. The  developing countries brought up GATT again in the Tokyo meeting  and called it a club of few rich nations. It does not help poor  nations' trade as is proved by its trade figures. In 1966, the  developing countries had 11.2 percent share in the world trade.  Twenty years later, in 1986, this share increased to 13.8. Thus  GATT did not help reduce the trade chasm between the poor and  rich nations. This situation of status quo was until 1986. At  that time GATT only decided customs and tariff rates. It was not  used to interfere in other countries internal policies or put  limitation on their economic autonomy. The richer nations, first  stealthily and later openly, started to control economic space  of other countries after the Uruguay conference. First the  question of unrestricted exchange of services was brought up.  Japan and other countries had beaten the United States in  manufacturing. It felt that it can keep its autonomy on  international trade only by controlling services. Then  agriculture was brought up because the European Common Market  countries had beaten the United States in this area. The idea of  protecting intellectual property was introduced by the back door  by saying that the things manufactured by copying should be  restricted. Later, this was changed to autonomy over  intellectual property.    It does not matter if Pranab Mukherji says that no other  laws  except patent laws will be changed. However, India has said many  times in the Uruguay meeting that it has to change many of its  laws if it agrees to the proposal. It is important to mention  here that India received the Dunkel Draft in December 1991.  However, for 9-10 months, the Indian government could not even  say what amenities it wanted in this agreement. The report of  the Permanent Committee clearly indicates that the perfunctionry  act of getting information by the government was performed under  pressure from the people.</p>

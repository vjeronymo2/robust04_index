			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Construction Contracts: Midlands office development One of the more spectacular office blocks in the Midlands - Point North - is being built at Brierley Hill, Dudley. The Pounds 8.4m design and build contract for the building (pictured above) has been awarded to TARMAC CONSTRUCTION by Richardson Developments. Point North will stand at the heart of the Pounds 200m Waterfront office complex on the 300-acre former Round Oak steelworks site, now an enterprise zone. The 96,000 sq ft building will cascade down through six stepped storeys to the edge of the inland waterways marina at the heart of the Waterfront. Point North will enclose a quiet courtyard which will open on to landscaped terraces by the waterside. The architecture is enhanced with tinted glazing, pitched roofs and circular glass columns. A three-storey circular drum, highly glazed and with external balconies, will accommodate a conference suite.</p>

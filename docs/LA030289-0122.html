			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD CITY COUNCIL DISSOLVES ASSESSMENT DISTRICT  </P> <P> Oxnard City Council members Tuesday dissolved an assessment district designed  to promote the city's beleaguered downtown because the ordinance establishing  it contains one incorrect word.  </P> <P> City Atty. Gary L. Gillig, who revealed the flaw in the district's enabling  ordinance in January, told the council that the district could not withstand a  legal challenge as it is written and so it is unenforceable.  </P> <P> The council also voted to return $34,532 in fees collected so far by the  district to stage advertising campaigns, festivals and other efforts to upgrade  the downtown area's image.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'It's a Shame'  </P> <P> "I don't think we had a choice," Councilman Manuel M. Lopez said after the  meeting. "If anyone objected to paying the assessment they didn't have to. You  can't have a district that way. It's a shame."  </P> <P> The fatal flaw in the ordinance was that it cited a 1965 state code describing  the assessment as a "tax." Proposition 13, the law that forbids cities to raise  property taxes without an election, ruled out such taxes in 1978.  </P> <P> But a law passed a year later reinstituted the districts by describing their  fees as "assessments."  </P> <P> Council members were pessimistic about the likelihood of reviving the district  because of opposition that has steadily grown against its fees since it was  approved a little more than a year ago.  </P> <P> Since then, more than half of the downtown's 450 businesses have refused to pay  the assessments, which ranged from $33 to $300.  </P> <P> The district was approved with the support of only slightly more than 20% of  merchants, the minimum allowable, said Steve Kinney, the director of Oxnard's  Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> He said he thinks that the Downtown Oxnard Business Improvement Assn., the  organization that had positioned itself to receive the funds, might be  successful if it reintroduces the district in a year or two.  </P> <P> By then,, the Oxnard Redevelopment Agency will have opened a children's museum  and a business complex created from historic homes, which may in turn build  support for further revitalization efforts, he said.  </P> <P> The assessment district had been billed as the extension of redevelopment  efforts in the flagging area where merchants banded together two years ago to  roll back a pedestrian mall that had choked off business on A Street for 18  years.  </P> <P> Such districts now exist in 100 to 150 California cities, according to David  Kilbourne, a Chico businessman and a past president of the California Downtown  Assn., which advises businesses on how to revive blighted downtowns.  </P> <P> "If the opposition would let these people function for 24 months, they'd  probably be pleasantly surprised," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Behrens' Memory Invoked  </P> <P> At Tuesday's meeting, assessment supporters begged council members to allow  them to do just that by invoking the memory of Al Behrens, a former A Street  shop owner who became the patron saint of revitalization in downtown Oxnard. He  pushed to have the mall removed and an assessment district established, but  died last June.  </P> <P> "The city can save this district," said B. T. Martin, the owner of a 6th Street  printing shop and the president of the Downtown Oxnard Business Improvement  Assn., "or it can treat Al Behrens' memory the same way Pontius Pilate treated  Christ's."  </P> <P> But Gillig told the council that "there is no method by which the council can  salvage the district. The government has to dot every 'i' and cross every 't.'  "  </P> <P> The district's opponents, who appeared to outnumber supporters by a 5-1 margin  at Tuesday's meeting, expressed relief at the council's decision.  </P> <P> "I think they finally have an idea of all the good reasons for disestablishing  this district," said Lee Montemorra, who owns the Sportsmen's Exchange, a C  Street gun shop, with her husband Anthony.  </P> <P> Opponents had questioned the authority of the Downtown Business Assn. They had  contended that state code dictates that only the City Council could decide how  the funds could be spent. City officials disagree.  </P> <P> Opponents had also questioned the need for the district, pointing out that much  of downtown is occupied either by professionals or specialty shops that would  not benefit from the retail-oriented campaigns planned by the association.  </P> <P> "People don't buy more firearms because there's a parade, a festival or coupons  in the paper," Anthony Montemorra said in an interview.  </P> <P> But members of the business community said they will not be so easily  discouraged. They vowed to continue paying into the district on a voluntary  basis in the hopes of continuing the efforts of the Downtown Assn.  </P> <P> "People have paid hard cash to reopen A Street . . . and they're not going to  walk away from that investment," said Dana Young, president of the Oxnard  Chamber of Commerce.  </P></p>

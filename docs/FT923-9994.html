			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Food: Morocco bound to have the freshest fish IT USED TO be said that you should never order fish in a restaurant on Mondays because it would not be fresh. This is not quite the case now. New markets - early each Monday at Brixham, Devon, and Newlyn, Cornwall, for example - and improved refrigeration techniques, particularly vacuum packing, have helped to preserve the quality of Saturday's catch. But traditional fishing ports have been reluctant to change their routines and, like most people, fishermen prefer weekends at home. Suddenly, however, top-quality fresh fish is arriving in London in time for delivery on Monday mornings from an unexpected source: Morocco. Because they are Moslems, fishermen there rest on Friday - their holy day - and go out at weekends. And they have plenty of sea to work in: Morocco has 400 kilometres of Mediterranean coast and, more significantly, 2,600 kilometres facing the less-polluted Atlantic. Traditionally, Moroccans have used simple 20 ft rowing boats to fish for anchovies and sardines, but both are being exhausted. So the fishermen have moved up market to John Dory, red mullet, red bream of sufficiently high quality to be eaten raw in London's Japanese sashimi bars, spotted bass, large weever with their poisonous spines, and rascasse (scorpion fish), the fish for bouillabaisse. What guarantees quality is the fact that, although they are landed at ports modernised by the Moroccan government, the technology for catching these fish has not improved. Because there has been very little investment in the boats, most of the fish are caught by line rather than trawled; consequently, they are not damaged in the nets. And because the boats are so small, they work by day in the rich inshore fishing grounds and land their catch the same night. This ensures that fish do not spend two or three days losing freshness in a ship's hold. The best fishing ports are along the Atlantic coast: El Jadida, Safi, Essaouira, Agadir and Tan-Tan. Catches are delivered immediately to Casablanca, where the fish trade has been controlled for centuries by several family firms. The fish is then packed under ice in polystyrene boxes to be flown abroad. Moroccan fish can now be found on many of the most fashionable dining tables in London including Le Gavroche, Tante Claire, Clarke's, Kensington Place, The Ivy and Le Caprice. The importer, Cutty Catering, of London SE15, is confident that Morocco will become an important supplier because the absence of a large fish market means prices do not fluctuate as much as they do in Europe. At the same time, cheaper air freight is making other unheralded sources more accessible. Iceland, once regarded merely as a supplier of cod for fish and chip shops, could soon be supplying large quantities of top-quality monkfish, halibut and haddock. The same goes for its smaller neighbour, the Faroe Islands. Both have the benefit of deep, cold and relatively unpolluted waters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In a letter to St. Petersburg's Mayor Anatoliy  Sobchak Secretary Oleg Lobov of the Russian Security Council  said the Russian military doctrine allowed the use of army units  against organized crime if a region of the Russian Federation  came under threat. The letter answers Sobchak's request for  additional powers in the fight against crime. But, Lobov said,  the Ministry of Internal Affairs must authorize the use of  troops under its control.    According to Lobov, President Yeltsin was working on a  decree  on immediate moves for the protection of the citizens'  constitutional rights and freedoms from criminal attacks. The  decree would lay a legal foundation for the use of army units in  anti-mafia operations and in a bid to maintain law and order.  Bodies of the executive branch would enjoy the right to commit  troops to action.    The decree would also grant the executive branch additional  powers for controlling internal migration. Draft bills which  introduce tougher penalties for unauthorized entry and stay in  the Russian Federation, had been prepared and sent to the  government. According to Lobov, the Mayor of St. Petersburg can,  in his capacity as the chairman of the anti-crime and  anti-corruption commission, coordinate moves by law and order  bodies and plan long-term and immediate anti-crime actions in  the region under his control.</p>

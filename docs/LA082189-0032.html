			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: INTERNATIONAL FILM SERIES CONTINUES AT MELNITZ THEATER  </P> <P> "The Cutting Edge II," a series of distinctive films from Europe, Asia and the  Soviet Union assembled by the International Film Circuit, continues Tuesday at  8 p.m. at UCLA's Melnitz Theater.  </P> <P> Yuri Illyenko's "The Eve of Ivan Kupalo" (1968) was inspired by the same story  with which Nikolai Gogol launched his career. The Ukrainian Illyenko was the  cinematographer of Sergei Paradzhanov's lush folk tale "Shadows of Our  Forgotten Ancestors." His "Eve of Ivan Kupalo" was banned for nearly 20 years,  reportedly because it failed to show proper regard for the dictates of  socialist realism. Like the films of Paradzhanov, who had a similarly difficult  career in pre-glasnost Russia, it is astoundingly sensual and mesmerizing, even  when it proves elusive to the American viewer. You don't have to be able to  understand all the nuances of this shimmeringly beautiful film to be enchanted  by it.  </P> <P> By coincidence, its basic situation is the same as Paradzhanov's recent "Ashik  Kerib": a poor young man (Boris Khmelnitsky) pursues a rich man's daughter  (Larisa Kadochnikova). Sharing that film's visual lushness and poetic elements  of supernatural and folklore, "The Eve of Ivan Kupalo" is different both in the  direction its story takes and in the style with which it's told. The film  quickly develops into a Faustian tale of temptation and redemption and unfolds  as dynamically as a ballet, in contrast with the exquisite tableaux of  Paradzhanov. One gorgeous yet deliberately naive image follows another; at one  point, a dark meadow is suddenly inundated with balls of fire. Most elusive,  yet certainly dazzling, is Pidorka's climactic journey to Kiev, which becomes  an Impressionist trek through Ukrainian history.  </P> <P> A presentation of the UCLA Film Archive, "The Cutting Edge II" continues  Thursday at 8 p.m. with Swiss film maker Clemens Klopfenstein's "Macao, or  Beyond the Sea" (1988), a jaunty and unexpectedly romantic fantasy. A  middle-aged Swiss named Max (Max Ruedlinger) boards a plane from Zurich bound  for Stockholm, then finds himself regaining consciousness after his plane  crashes inexplicably along the shore of an island off Macao. He and the pilot,  apparently the only survivors, gradually realize that they cannot leave the  island or communicate with the outside world. Max's initial resistance to the  kindly islanders is often comical, but the film, which is as plain as the  homely Max, develops into a fable of tenderness and poignancy. It also has, of  all things, a heroine (Christine Lauterberg) yodeling in longing for her  missing husband.  </P> <P> "Marin Karmitz and MK2," the UCLA Film Archive's tribute to the noted French  producer and his company, continues Saturday at 8 p.m. in Melnitz Theater with  Alain Tanner's "No Man's Land" (1985) and a revival of Jean-Luc Godard's "Every  Man for Himself" (1980).  </P> <P> In the moody "No Man's Land," Tanner focuses on three restless people stuck in  a remote French provincial village hard by the Swiss border. Paul (Hugues  Quester) smuggles people and goods across the border but dreams of emigrating  to Canada. Madeline (Myriam Mezieres) runs a disco but dreams of escaping to  Paris to become a singer. Louis (Jean-Philippe Ecoffey), a local farm youth, is  a trained clock maker whose conflicting desires make him the focal character.  There is virtually no action, but there is plenty of interaction, and Tanner  makes the beautiful but isolated locale highly expressive of his trapped  people's thoughts and emotions.  </P> <P> A key film by a major film maker, "Every Man for Himself" is the Godard  masterwork that marked a second beginning for him. In it, he delineated the  death of feeling and the flowering of an aggressive self-absorption in  contemporary life with both amazing beauty and much humor. The Karmitz series  concludes at 8 p.m. Sunday with "Melo" (1986), Alain Resnais' elegant but  terrifically demanding film of the 1929 Henry Bernstein play, and "Le Bon  Plaisir" (1984), a tedious tale about the president of France (Jean-Louis  Trintignant) and his ex-mistress (Catherine Deneuve) coping with an amateur  blackmailer.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 206-8013, 206 FILM.  </P></p>

The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said this when asked to comment  on  the report that Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten might table the  second portion of the constitutional package before the  Legislative Council of Hong Kong in March. "We hope that the  British side withdraws its partial constitutional package that  has been submitted to the Legislative Council and return to the  negotiating table in view of maintaining Sino-British  cooperation and the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong  Kong," the spokesman said.    If the British side does not withdraw the partial  constitutional package and goes on to submit the second portion  of the package to the Legislative Council, he added, it will  only demonstrate that the British side has set its mind on not  returning to the negotiating table.    "The British side should bear all the consequences arising  from this," he said.    China has reiterated that in a time when no agreements have  been reached between the two sides, any legislation passed by  the Legislative Council concerning the 1994/1995 election will  not be accepted, he noted, adding that any institute or  organization established according to that legislation will last  only till June 30, 1997.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / G30 to review use of derivatives THE GROUP of Thirty, the Washington-based think tank, plans to launch a review of the risks to the world's financial markets from the growing use of derivative instruments such as futures, options and swaps. This would mark the first comprehensive study of the risks which have built up in the financial system following the explosive growth of all types of derivatives since the early 1980s. Regulators around the world have been working towards ways of measuring and limiting such risks, though no comprehensive solutions have yet emerged. Derivatives are financial products whose value is based on underlying assets such as bonds, currencies or stocks. They exaggerate price movements in the underlying assets, and so potentially pose greater risks to financial institutions. A G30 review would carry influence with bank supervisors, some of whom have expressed concern over the increasing use of products such as swaps and options. The full risks of these instruments are not shown on banks' balance sheets. A chairman has yet to be appointed by the G30, but the review is likely to get under way during the summer. The review will attempt to define and measure the various types of risks involved in the use of derivative products - including market risk, credit risk and settlement risk - and will also examine how that risk can best be managed. The review will not only examine the role of banks but also of other participants such as brokerages and insurance companies. It could make or break bankers' hopes of winning a favourable interpretation of the Basle guidelines on the capital adequacy of banks which come into force in January 1993. For example, bankers have been pressing for rules which would allow them to net off their exposures in the Dollars 3,000bn (Pounds 1,751bn) swaps market, effectively reducing the amount of capital they need to hold to protect against loss. 'Because the Basle accord requires banks to calculate their . . . exposure on a gross basis, it places banks at a competitive disadvantage' and could threaten the future of off-balance sheet business, according to Mr Mark Brickell, chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association, who expressed his backing for the G30 project at the association's annual meeting in Paris on Friday.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUNGER STRIKE PAYS OFF; VISA OKD  </P> <P> A Westminster couple's four-day hunger strike in front of a federal immigration  office came to a happy ending Thursday afternoon when top immigration officials  said the woman's ailing mother will be allowed to emigrate from Romania to the  United States after all.  </P> <P> "God Bless these men for helping this poor woman get here," the sunburned and  unshaven Vasile Sofroni said at the end of his 80-hour fast in Westminster to  win an entry visa for his mother-in-law, Livia Groza, 54.  </P> <P> "My legs are shaking. I don't know if it's from lack of food or from  happiness," he said outside the INS office in Westminster.  </P> <P> Harold Ezell, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's western  regional commissioner, told Sofroni and his wife, Lia, both 31, that acting INS  Commissioner James Buck had personally reviewed Groza's case Thursday morning  in Washington. Ezell said Buck decided that Groza did qualify for a special  humanitarian visa.  </P> <P> Ezell said the visa means that Groza, who has a serious heart condition and  hasn't been able to work for five years, can now legally come to the United  States and stay indefinitely. He explained that the government, on rare  occasions, grants special visas for humanitarian reasons, to aliens who  otherwise cannot legally enter the United States with a regular immigrant visa.  </P> <P> "Today's decision is in line with our policy to promote family unity by  offering special consideration. . . . This family should be together here in  the United States," Ezell said Thursday.  </P> <P> The Sofronis launched their fast in the INS parking lot at 5 a.m. Monday after  three years of efforts, including assistance from Rep. Robert K. Dornan  (R-Garden Grove), failed to win entry for Groza.  </P> <P> Vasile Sofroni said he had become increasingly concerned about his  mother-in-law's welfare when money he sent failed to reach her in Dimisoara,  Romania.  </P> <P> The INS originally denied Groza's petition for a humanitarian visa in early  May, saying that she was still young enough to support herself and therefore  did not have to be with her closest living relatives, the Sofronis, who have  permanent U.S. residency status, the couple said.  </P> <P> Ezell said that Groza's case, which was being handled by the INS office in  Washington, came to his attention when he saw a local TV news broadcast  Wednesday night about the couple's hunger strike.  </P> <P> Ezell said that both he and Dornan called acting INS Commissioner Buck early  Thursday and asked him to personally examine the request.  </P> <P> Buck interceded, overruling other INS officials to whom the Sofronis had been  appealing for various entry visas for about three years. Ezell said the INS  already has sent a cable to the U.S. Embassy in Romania, advising officials  there that a visa has been approved.  </P> <P> "This is a belated Fourth of July gift to the Sofronis. We talked to Mr. Buck  and explained that the State Department had already given the OK," said  Patricia Fanelli, a Dornan aide. She said the congressman has been working on  Groza's case since last year.  </P> <P> Sofroni said Thursday that he and his wife were driven to fasting because  Dornan's office "promised all this time, and they keep trying, but nothing  changed. (We got) the same answers," and because Groza was not getting the  money they were sending to Romania.  </P> <P> " 'I don't know what you are doing, Vasile, but I see nothing from you,' " he  said his mother-in-law told him in a telephone conversation in April.  </P> <P> That is when Sofroni said he decided to act. "I said no more waiting. . . . If  I don't help her, she is going to die because nobody else there to help her."  </P> <P> INS officials emphasized that without valid grounds for granting a humanitarian  visa request, the hunger strike would have done no good.  </P> <P> "The hunger strike was not the reason parole status was granted. . . . There  was a lot of hard evidence to support their claim in the second review," INS  spokesman Ron Rogers said.  </P></p>

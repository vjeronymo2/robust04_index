			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "To New Airfields?"] </F>   [Text] Ukraine expressed its readiness to transfer to  Russia nationalized strategic bombers -- but for a lot of money.  The Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation believes that  our state presently has 42 heavy bombers at its disposal, while  the Russian Air Force has 77 such machines. The Russian Army  finds it difficult to deploy new aircraft because the financing  of their serial production has been halted. As a result, in  accordance with the plans by the Russian Federation's Ministry  of Defense, the Air Force will remain without changes until the  year 2000. "If Ukraine does not agree to our terms, the  aircraft will remain on its territory," stated a representative  of the Russian Federation's Ministry of Defense. This was  reported by the information agency ITAR-TASS.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Nervous day for Glaxo TRADING in Glaxo was nervous, with early strength eroded by expectations of bearish developments ahead of a briefing by French government health officials. The officials were concerned with the pre-launch promotion in France of Glaxo's migraine drug, Imigran, seen as a potential blockbuster, but yet to gain approval there. It had been feared that the French officials might make an announcement on Glaxo's drug pricing policies. Two weeks ago, the UK pharmaceuticals group was challenged over its European drug pricing strategy by the Danish Office of Fair Trading, which made a complaint to the European Commission. Observers said the combination of an EC inquiry and a government complaint against a drug still in such early stages of a launch was unheard of. The shares were off 9 at one stage and closed a net 3 down at 783p. Lonrho down again Reports that Lonrho, the international conglomerate, has attracted institutional criticism of its management methods, together with confirmation that the group's stockbroker, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, has reduced its current-year profits forecast, triggered yet another slide in the shares. Dealers said the market was worried that Lonrho might lose its place in the FT-SE 100-share index. At the close of business yesterday, the stock had dropped another 10 to 85p, the lowest level since 1985. Last week Lonrho stock ran into heavy selling as markets reacted to news that Moody's, the US debt rating agency, had lowered its credit rating on Dollars 360m-worth of Lonrho Eurobonds. Moody's rating shift accompanied hints of the UBS downgrading and suggestions of bearish comments from other broking houses. Setback for WPP Advertising group WPP dropped 15 to 80p after reporting a steep fall in profits and stating that it was continuing talks with its banks about refinancing. Analysts had forecast profits of Pounds 43m to Pounds 50m, and WPP managed Pounds 56.1m. However, that figure was boosted by a Pounds 17.7m exceptional item, a release of provisions. A number of securities houses were last night adjusting profits forecasts for the company. BZW, already at the bottom of the analysts' range, cut back its 1992 estimate by a further Pounds 10m to Pounds 47m after talking to the company. James Capel lowered its estimate by Pounds 19m to Pounds 42m, with the agency broker feeling that 'they were terrible figures and it is really not looking good for this year'. Fears that events in the Gulf might take a turn for the worse, and even culminate in military action against Iraqi weapons installations, attracted a burst of domestic and overseas buying of oil shares. Dealers said there was evidence of further big switching activity between BP and Shell, as well as between Shell and Royal Dutch. The switching business, out of BP and into Shell, still left BP 3 1/2 ahead at 266 1/2 p on 7.5m, while Shell settled 4 better at 450p on 2.9m. A note published by BZW was said to have been responsible for boosting Enterprise Oil, which settled 9 firmer at 371p. The BZW oil team, comparing Enterprise with Lasmo, said Lasmo's acquisition of Ultramar had placed it alongside Enterprise and Oryx with reserves in the region of 1bn barrels of oil equivalents. BZW said the acquisition has created severe short-term problems and rated Lasmo shares a sell. But BZW is bullish on Enterprise, saying: 'The company's potential for dividend growth makes it a buy.' BZW said it saw fair value for Enterprise as 430p to 500p a share and fair value for Lasmo as 150p to 180p. The utilities areas of the market showed further signs of extreme nervousness, in spite of the more reassuring opinion polls that appeared over the weekend. In the electricity stocks, Eastern declined 6 to 231p and East Midland 7 to 241p, while the Electricity Package lost 38 to Pounds 2600. Northern based brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle slipped 13 to 443p on news that the Department of Trade and Industry has cleared its deal to take over wholesale distribution of Whitbread products to free houses in Scotland. S &amp; N will acquire 215 accounts in Scotland, taking on loans to more than 100. Whitbread 'A' gained 2 to 424p. Allied-Lyons put on 4 to 623p, awaiting the Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruling on its planned brewing venture with Carlsberg. Bass rose 3 to 542p on hopes of an improvement by its Holiday Inn subsidiary. Guinness continued to suffer from profit-taking ahead of Thursday's figures, which are expected to produce 1991 profits slightly under Pounds 1bn. The shares lost 8 to 559p. Lack of further developments involving the possible take-over of Dalepak knocked 5 off the shares to 379p, while lines of stock on offer pushed Associated British Foods down 5 to 415p. United Biscuits firmed a penny to 408p as Smith New Court described the shares as a safe, rather than dynamic, investment longer term. Positive market comments boosted Tesco, ahead of the company's results expected early next month. In heavy turnover of 5.3m, the shares rose 4 to 247p. J. Sainsbury was also active but slipped 4 to 376p on turnover of 3.3m after mixed reaction from a series of meetings with brokers that resulted in several analysts downgrading their forecasts. Political worries and disappointment with last week's Budget weighed on some leading stores, with Dixons falling 6 to 218p. On the other hand, nervousness about the implications of a DIY price war appeared to fade. Kingfisher lost only a penny to 483p and WH Smith 'A' 2 to 454p. Lloyds Chemists was a firm spot, climbing 3 to 343p on hopes of a successful acquisition of Macarthy, to reinforce the company's earnings potential following recent well received interim figures. Interest in the property sector on Friday proved short-lived as investors steered clear of the shares, sentiment being affected by declining hopes of a cut in domestic interest rates. However, MEPC continued to benefit from Friday's buy recommendation from Smith New Court, edging forward 2 to 332p. Slough Estates, which stood at 240p two months ago, may have found a floor after its recent dramatic decline, the shares improving 2 to 178p. Hotel group Forte's recent good run held out in the wake of broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew turning a buyer of the shares on Friday. The stock gained 3 to 232p in volume of 1.4m. With under a month to the opening of its Paris theme park, Euro Disney was again the subject of profit-taking after its recent surge which followed news that it is to join the CAC 40 index in Paris. The shares relinquished 17 to 1638p. There was further weakness in Thorn-EMI, which lost 6 to 762p in thin trading. Some in the market believe that the initial positive reception for its Virgin Music purchase has now receded in the knowledge that the benefits to the group will be strictly long term. Speciality chemicals group MTM was erratic as more news emerged from the company. However, early selling was seen as overdone and the stock shot up to end 14 higher on the day at 84p. Laporte shed 12 to 579p ahead of Solvay's placing of 9 per cent of Laporte's shares and on recent negative comments from analysts. Solvay is placing the shares to finance the disposal of Interox, the Belgian group's joint venture with Laporte, and will cancel 16 per cent of Laporte's shares as part of the deal. Medeva, which said it was buying the rights to two Hepatitis B products from Epitec and GA Investments for SFr24m, put on 9 to 278p. Engineering group Renold jumped 9 1/2 to 55 1/2 p after announcing that TT Group, the industrial holding company, had acquired a 2.9 per cent stake. Auction house Christies International was down 12 at 115p after announcing a dividend cut with its 1991 results. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (24).

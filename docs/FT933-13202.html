			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / German court's ruling allays asylum law fears GERMANY'S federal constitutional court last night dismissed an appeal by an asylum-seeker from Ghana facing deportation, allaying fears that legal appeals would be systematically used to circumvent Germany's tough new asylum law. German officials were worried that asylum-seekers whose applications have been denied by the government would use the court system to avoid deportation. Under the new law asylum-seekers arriving at German airports directly from their countries of origin can be deported within three days if the Federal Office for Refugees rejects their claims. They can appeal to local administrative courts within two days, with the court required to rule on the case within two weeks. A final appeal to the constit-utional court is then possible. Fears that appeals would be used to undermine the screening system and burden the German legal system arose last Friday after the constitutional court, in its first ruling since the new asylum law came into effect on July 1, granted an Indian asylum-seeker the right to stay pending a second hearing next month. The man, who said he faced persecution by Kashmiri police, was due to be deported after arriving at Frankfurt airport. But the court ruled that his case needed further examination. Asylum-seekers arriving from 'safe third countries' which include all bordering countries, can be sent back to those countries without a hearing. According to the federal interior ministry, the new law has led to a reduction in the number of asylum applicants.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Omron gains against the trend OMRON, the Japanese maker of control components and health equipment, bucked the trend of poorer performances caused by recession with a 7.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits. Omron's profits increase in the first half of fiscal 1993 to Y2.16bn (Dollars 20m) from Y2.01bn a year ago came on higher turnover of Y173.8bn, up 2.4 per cent from Y169.8bn. The company, which makes control equipment for factory automation, electronic fund transfer systems and electronic thermometers, attributed its better results to a strong rise in export sales despite the yen's appreciation. While business in Japan was negatively affected by the virtual freeze on plant and equipment purchases by Japanese manufacturers, this was more than offset by strong exports, Omron said. Exports, which make up less than 20 per cent of Omron's sales, were particularly buoyant in Asia, which saw a rise of 32 per cent in the first half. However, sales in the US were also 15 per cent up on the strength of the economic pick-up in that country. Sales to the EC were also up 9 per cent. Omron was not spared the impact of the high yen, which came to about Y1.6bn. However, it was able to combat the adverse effect of the currency's strength with cost-cutting efforts in addition to higher sales. The company expects capital expenditure, for example to fall by Y4bn from its initial forecast of Y33bn for the year. It has also implemented a programme to cut employee levels by 1,500 through natural attrition over the next three years.</p>

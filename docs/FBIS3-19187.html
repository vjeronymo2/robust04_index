			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Philippe Tesson] </F>   [Text] The Balladur government has suffered setbacks. In  some cases it is not to blame, and in other cases it is to  blame. The Majority is reprehensible when it stresses these  failings. The Left, however, would be clumsy not to seize on  them. However, politics is not simply a question of adroitness,  or at least adroitness has its limits. Let us consider the  example of youth and the unemployment crisis. It is quite  legitimate for [Socialist Party Secretary General] Michel Rocard  -- even if he was unable to convince youth and could not solve  the unemployment problem, and even if, being who he is, he has  resorted to using vulgar arguments -- to criticize [Prime  Minister] Balladur's policies. It is not acceptable, however,  for him to draw fire and bitterness, and feed the flames of  anger with his insidious remarks that combine the problems of  secularity, unemployment, and the supposed censuring of freedom  of expression. Everything precludes these actions: the nature  of his responsibilities, his failures, and good will.    Let us take another example, that of civil liberty. When  Mrs. Danielle Mitterrand sensationally condemns the attacks on  civil liberties by the current government, clearly accusing  Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, although not naming him  directly, of endangering democracy, she is parodying reality,  overstepping her duties, and insulting her adversaries. France  is clearly not a land of oppression. Mrs. Mitterrand does not  occupy the post of judge, and the Majority has passed the laws  that she is questioning.    The similarity between these references is no coincidence.  Naturally, it is hardly likely that the wife of the president of  the Republic and the first secretary of the PS planned together  to heap opprobrium on the Balladur government. However, it is  not merely by chance that they seized on the same opportunities  to fight the same battle with the same arguments on the same  ground and with the same political objective. There is a common  thread behind the cause they are defending. This thread is the  disarray of youth. There are no holds barred in feeding this  disarray, irrespective of the excesses and the harm that this  could result in. It is the government's weak point. It is thus  this weakness that they are attacking, with even the most  trivial of weapons. Let us agitate the most malleable of  armies, those people who are the most affected by the current  hard times, and attack the enemy!    The socialist Left was looking for this kind of clientele.  Now it has found it. The Left is faltering: The Mitterrand  generation will give way to the Rocard generation! Since they  cannot prepare a political and ideological takeover campaign,  they are restoring an inexhaustible issue -- youth -- under the  banner of an inexhaustible myth -- liberty.</p>

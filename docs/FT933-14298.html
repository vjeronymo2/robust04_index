			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Bifu to ballot on strike at Lloyds BIFU, the banking union, is balloting its 12,000 members at Lloyds Bank this week on a series of one-day strikes over pay, Diane Summers writes. The union is protesting at the ending of cost-of-living increases and the introduction of performance pay. The ballot will close at the end of August. The 22,300 members of the Lloyds Group Union have been balloted on the same issue - the result is expected in the next few days. Lloyds management said that although there had been no cost-of-living increase, performance awards to the 48,000 staff this year had added 3.4 per cent to salaries on average. Employees had also received an average 4.1 per cent through profit-sharing.</p>

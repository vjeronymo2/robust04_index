			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HARASSMENT AT NAVAL ACADEMY  </P> <P> The command structure at Annapolis that countenanced the climate that led to  the outrageous attack on Dreyer, then winked at the perpetrators, should be  immediately reassigned.  </P> <P> As for those "good-natured" midshipmen, participants and the gawkers who could  have stopped the stupidity, let them see what it's like to be ordinary seamen  for a year or two. Maybe by then they will have a better understanding of the  damage they have done to Ms. Dreyer and be more worthy of becoming officers.  </P> <P> FRED BENES  </P> <P> Cambria  </P></p>

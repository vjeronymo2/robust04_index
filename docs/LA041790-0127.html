			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAKER RULES OUT RETURN TO POLITICIZED UNESCO  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III today ruled out the possibility of an  early U.S. return to UNESCO membership, saying the U.N. body is still  mismanaged and excessively politicized.  </P> <P> Baker said in a report to Congress that UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor  continues to be haunted by his reputation as a "well-intentioned but poor  administrator."  </P> <P> Six years ago the Reagan Administration withdrew from UNESCO, known formally as  the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Britain and  Singapore quickly followed suit.  </P> <P> Renewed membership would cost the United States about $50 million annually.  </P> <P> Baker said UNESCO at this stage "does not possess the characteristics of a  well-managed and focused organization."  </P> <P> A principal U.S. complaint over the years has been that UNESCO tries to limit  press freedom.  </P> <P> Baker said in his report that Mayor, after some highly encouraging comments on  that subject, has since equivocated by stating that press freedoms must be  "balanced" against the desires of governments to control the flow of  information.  </P> <P> Baker also said UNESCO resolutions heavily biased against Israel and often  based on false information continue to be adopted.  </P> <P> Baker said that instead of imposing personnel cuts, as he had promised, Mayor  has proposed a restructuring plan that would create 33 new posts at an  estimated cost of $6 million. The plan has plunged UNESCO into its worst crisis  in six years, Baker said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 4 Apr (EFE) -- Today, Peru officially  presented its request to return to the Andean Pact -- a request  that was accepted -- and said it will "fully resume all of its  commitments" on macroeconomic issues and joint commercial  negotiations that bind the five members of the Cartagena  Agreement. Peru's return was approved at the 70th period of  sessions of the Cartagena Agreement Commission, which was  inaugurated in Caracas today.    The Peruvian delegation presented its request to the  Bolivian, Colombian, Ecuadoran, and Venezuelan commissions. The  proposal, which included the terms for Peru's return to the  Andean Pact after nearly two years of absence, was approved  unanimously. Peru was authorized to continue as an observer in  the regional organization's internal negotiations to establish a  common custom duties tariff, which is now being discussed by the  remaining members of the Andean Pact.    The Cartagena Agreement Commission's Decree No. 353 declared  that now that Peru has returned to its full commitments within  the Andean Pact it will be allowed to start incorporating  products into the free trade zone -- products to be included  under a 31 December 1994 customs tariff of 0-5 percent.  Likewise, bilateral agreements on commercial integration signed  by Peru with the rest of the Andean Pact member-states will  continue to be valid until all of the products are gradually and  concurrently incorporated into the Andean Pact system.  According to the commission's statement, Peru's reentry into  the organization highlights the need for Andean Pact countries  to reinforce their original purpose of providing a mechanism to  expedite the process of bilateral integration.    Foreign Trade Institute Minister Albert Poletto said Peru's  return to the Andean Pact "marked an important milestone in the  Cartagena Agreement." Poletto stressed that the establishment  of a common customs tariff is an important pending matter that  must be resolved by the Andean Pact at the Cartagena Agreement  Commission meeting being held in Caracas. Poletto added that  another issue that requires agreement by the Andean partners is  the need to increase the presence of the Andean Pact in the  international trade sector.</p>

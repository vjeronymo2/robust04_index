Finlay Vaccines and Serums Institute, attended  the Finlay assembly -- part of the Parliament in the Workplace  process -- where workers discussed the revitalization of the  economy and domestic finances. Finance Minister Jose Luis  Rodriguez stated in his address that research is not a state  expense but an investment for development. In the meeting, the  workers called for implementing measures least affecting people  while most benefiting the economy.    In his closing address, Jose Miyar Barruecos, Central  Committee member and secretary of the Council of State, stated  that centers such as the Finlay are obliged to become essential  pillars of the Cuban economy.</p>

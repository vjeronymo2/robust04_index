			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Viktorov, with commentary by the Economic </F> Policy Department: "Tax Policy Outlook: World Bank Experts  Propose Coordinating Federal and Local Taxes"]    [Text] After KOMMERSANT-DAILY last Friday published an  article on proposed adjustments in the tax system as prepared by  the Russian Chamber of Trade and Industry, our editorial offices  were contacted by Ms. Cristine Wallich, head of a group of World  Bank experts, requesting that we outline the recommendations  regarding reform of Russia's tax system that have been developed  by specialists from that leading world financial institution.  For two years they have been working within the framework of a  technical cooperation program entitled "Budgetary Relations  Between Governmental Bodies at Various Levels in the Russian  Federation."    The work of this group of World Bank experts in Russia  culminated in the publication of a summary report entitled  "Russia and Problems of Budget-and Tax-Based Federalism." The  assessment of mutual tax relations between the center and the  regions and the accompanying recommendations contained in that  report were very striking. Specifically, the experts are quite  well aware that Russian authorities are attempting to balance  the federal balance through the arbitrary shifting of as many  expenditures as possible to the regional level, particularly  expenditures for social needs and capital investment. As a  result, local governments do not have a very clear idea for  which specific expenditures they are responsible, or which  sources they should use to cover those expenditures.    Taking the experiences of economically developed federative  states (primarily the United States and Canada) as their point  of departure, the World Bank experts propose as a first step  that the list of expenditures for which local governments are  responsible be clearly established, once and for all (with basic  expenditures for social needs and capital construction brought  back to the federal level). The next suggestion is to put all  tax revenues in Russia from the basic taxes (income tax, profit  tax and value added tax) in a single "pool" and clearly define  what portion of that money will be sent to local budgets, and  what portion will remain in the federal budget, based on the  division of expenditures between budgets at various levels. It  is also suggested that a portion of the money set aside for  local budgets be shared between regions proportionally to the  amount of taxes collected in each -- with the more economically  developed regions naturally getting more. The remainder should  be divided up between regions with the objective of levelling  their economic playing field. It will also be necessary to get  away from the excessive number of local taxes (those that are  paid directly into the local budget), leaving only the most  stable of them, primarily the land tax.    Also notable was the approach taken by the World Bank  experts  to differentiation of tax rates by region. They propose  abandoning the current system, which allows the possibility of  various profit tax rates being established in various regions of  the country (in addition to the 13-percent tax that is paid into  the federal budget, between 0 and 25 percent of profits may also  go to the local budget based on a decision by a local  legislative body). This kind of tax system creates a tangled  "tax jungle" for business people, forcing them to choose not so  much between various regions with varying prospects for  profitable investment as between regions with varying tax  systems. It is also proposed that we move to a differentiated  tax system for personal income taxes (regions would simply be  granted the right to collect regional surcharges over and above  a unified federal income tax, with those surcharges paid  directly into local budgets). If this were the case, every  citizen would understand that he or she would have to pay a  larger share of his or her income to live in a city with nice  homes, schools and roads than in other regions (fully in keeping  with American tradition, for example).    In addition the World Bank experts, while supporting a  clear-cut and well-defined system of relationships between  budgets at various levels, are also fully aware that Russia's  government has a certain interest in an "ill-defined" system  that makes it possible to present the federal budget to  international lenders in a favorable light whenever one wishes.  However, they assert that lenders will be quite understanding of  the fact that reform of budget relationships between the center  and the regions in Russia will worsen official budget indices,  and consequently will somewhat reconsider their strict  requirements with regard to macroeconomic indicators.    * * *  <H5>  Commentary </H5>   The recommendations prepared by World Bank experts are not  seen as a fundamental reform of the existing tax system, but  rather as proposals aimed at improving that system.  Specifically, the attention of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts was  drawn to the idea of efficient expenditures of tax revenues and  reduction in the current number of local taxes, combined with an  expanded role for land taxes. This idea is not new, but it is  quite timely and (a point of some significance) it can be easily  and painlessly implemented in Russia right away. For fairness'  sake it should be noted that proposals that local taxes be  reduced have been put forward repeatedly by Russian scientists,  in particular by Academician Dmitriy Lvov and Professor Vladimir  Frolov (see: KOMMERSANT-DAILY, 29 April), as well as by sections  of the executive branch, i.e the State Tax Service and the  Russian Ministry of Finance. It is easy to explain such rare  unanimity: collecting these taxes is inefficient. With the  possible exception of land taxes, the cost of collecting taxes  to pay for things like parking or police often exceeds the  amount of money actually collected.    However, in addition to some proposals that are quite  self-evident, this report by World Bank experts also contains a  number of proposals that are quite unexpected for the Russian  tax system. For example, the thoroughly logical and justified  idea of introducing higher taxes for residents of the most  economically prosperity localities. However, under Russian  conditions this innovation will most likely not lead so much to  social justice (better living conditions as a result of  additional funding) as to greater social tension, since -- and  of this KOMMERSANT-DAILY's experts are quite certain -- an  increase in local taxes will not result in any noticeable  improvement in the quality of life in the immediate future.    Also of interest is the idea of establishing a standard  level  of payments into local, republic and federal budgets out of the  sum total of all significant tax revenues. Previously tax  revenues were paid out to the various regions at various rates  (with the distribution of 1992 profit taxes particularly  indicative in this regard). However, the proposal to support the  most backward regions with the objective of "equalizing their  economic position" will also be complicated in Russia due to its  economic peculiarities: an additional infusion of money into the  regions might just become another financial "feeding trough."    The World Bank experts took an untraditional approach to the  widely proclaimed "regional independence" with regard to  regulation of local tax systems. This time they were undaunted  by accusations that they might be infringing on fragile Russian  democracy and proceeded primarily on the basis of fully  self-evident assumptions. However, it should be noted that tax  rates still vary among the various states of economically  prosperous America.</p>

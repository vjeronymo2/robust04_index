			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Argent property shows Pounds 23.6m increase in value Brindleyplace, a Birmingham development site bought last June by Argent Group, a property investment and development company, for Pounds 3m has been revalued at Pounds 26.6m. The valuation of the site, which has planning consent for 1.1m sq ft of offices and 330,000 sq ft of retail space, excludes a parcel of residential land, which Argent has sold for Pounds 2m. The figures were shown in the pathfinder prospectus for Argent, which is set to join the stock market with a market capitalisation of about Pounds 140m. Argent also owns 16 investment properties, which were valued at Pounds 197.1m on March 31 and has exchanged contracts to buy another investment property, valued at Pounds 13.3m. The placing and offer will raise about Pounds 25m of new money. The company has net assets before flotation of Pounds 123m and net debts of Pounds 121m. Net assets per share have risen from 100.3p at the end of 1991 to 232.8p at the end of 1993. In 1993, the company incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.86m (Pounds 3.76m), due to write-offs of interest rate hedging instruments. Warburg Pincus, the US venture capital fund which owns 66 per cent of the company, will reduce its holding to below 50 per cent. The management, which own 16.6 per cent, do not intend to sell their shares. Argent said it would not pay dividends until 'the board is satisfied that it is in the interests of the group to do so'. Its principal objective is growth in net assets per share.</p>

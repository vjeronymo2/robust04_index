			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Airsprung's 22% growth prompts share price rise SHARES IN Airsprung Furniture Group rose 11p to a record 518p after Britain's second-largest bed manufacturer reported a 22 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 6m. Sales rose by 12.9 per cent to Pounds 65.6m in the year to March 31 and operating profit was 14.9 per cent higher at Pounds 5.8m. The group said its beds division, which accounts for 50 per cent of turnover, had performed well. Sales and profits were well ahead of last year, although it suffered from a shortage of demand at the top of its range. The upholstery division, which accounts for 30 per cent of turnover, increased sales, but severe competition had substantially reduced margins in the manufacturing companies. The pine furniture division, which produces 15 per cent of turnover, showed a substantial improvement in both sales and profits. Last month Mr Michael Coppel was appointed joint chairman alongside Mr John Yates, 77, whose family controls 42 per cent of Airsprung. Mr John Pierce replaced Mr Coppel as chief executive, Mr John Mack became chairman of the upholstery division and Mr Peter Ziemnak was appointed managing director of Airsprung Beds. Mr Coppel said those appointments would ensure continuity of management into the next century. The group said: 'The current year seems to be fraught with uncertainties. However, we have planned for further growth and are confident that this will be achieved provided we get a reasonable climate in which to operate.' Earnings per share fell from 33.1p to 31.4p, although the previous year's figure benefited from the release of deferred tax previously provided, worth 6.5p per share. A final dividend of 5.85p gives a total for the year of 9p (7.5p), a rise of 20 per cent.</p>

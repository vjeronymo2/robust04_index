The purpose of the above-noted condition is to put persons who act for the bank or broker-dealer on notice that they are dealing with a plan in order that any additional steps or procedures that are necessary to comply with the conditions of the exemption may be implemented. The Department believes that the identification of the client as a plan will help assure compliance with the conditions of the exemption. Accordingly, the Department has determined not to revise the final exemption in this regard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III(c)(6) of the proposed exemption required the issuance of a written confirmation statement for each covered transaction. The proposal required that the confirmation statement disclose the amount of U.S. dollars purchased or sold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commentator noted that U.S. dollars are not involved in every foreign currency transaction. In response to this comment, the Department has modified section III(c)(6) to require disclosure of the currencies purchased and sold pursuant to the final exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed exemption included a recordkeeping requirement which provided that the bank, broker-dealer or affiliate must maintain within territories under the jurisdiction of the United States Government, the records necessary to determine whether the applicable conditions of the exemption have been met. Several commentators objected to the requirement that records be maintained within territories under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Government. In this regard, they represented that this requirement creates difficulties for those banks who maintain foreign exchange trading desks in a country or countries other than the United States. In addition, one commenter suggested that the recordkeeping requirement may result in higher costs to plans involved in foreign exchange transactions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ABA suggested that the recordkeeping requirement should permit the required records to be maintained on a computer system located at a foreign facility which would be accessible in the United States. These systems could print out any information requested and produce a hard copy to anyone who is authorized to have such information. These systems would contain all the bank's foreign exchange transactions on a daily basis for employee benefit plans as well as other entities. In this way, all information needed to test for compliance would be available in the United States. Other commenters suggested that requirements similar to those provided in the regulations under section 404(b) of the Act regarding the maintenance of the indicia of ownership of plan assets should be adopted. Specifically, they requested that the exemption permit the required records to be maintained at foreign locations described under the section 404(b) regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes that the purpose of the record maintenance requirement is to ensure that the persons described in paragraph III(e) of the exemption will have access to bank, broker-dealer or affiliate records involving covered foreign exchange transactions. The Department is unable to determine how the alternatives for holding securities, which are described in the regulations under section 404(b) of the Act, would operate in the context of a record maintenance requirement. If the records were maintained outside of the jurisdiction of the United States Government and became unavailable for reasons beyond the control of the bank, broker-dealer or affiliate, there would be no comparable records available for determining compliance with the terms of this exemption. Accordingly, the Department is not persuaded that the conditions described in the regulations under section 404(b) of the Act would be appropriate with respect to the record maintenance requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has considered the ABA's suggestion to modify the final exemption to include records which are maintained on a foreign computer system that could be accessed in the United States. We note, however, that the ABA is unable to represent that such records could always be accessed on a foreign computer system without the risk of restriction by a foreign government. Accordingly, the Department is unable to conclude that the final exemption should be modified to include this method of recordkeeping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

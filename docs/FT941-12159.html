			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Business and the Law: Increasing resort to liability insurance - Legal Briefs A survey of UK directors' and officers' liability insurance shows that 62 per cent of companies now have cover, compared with 46 per cent in 1991, and the total UK D&amp;O premium has risen to between Pounds 65m-Pounds 75m, up from between Pounds 40m-Pounds 50m in 1991. Almost half the companies that responded to the Wyatt Company's 1993 survey said they had bought D&amp;O cover because they felt their directors were at risk, with 22 per cent saying they had bought it on their insurance advisers' recommendations. The main business sectors buying D&amp;O cover were banking, consumer goods/foods, oil/chemical/pharmaceutical, and industrial holdings. All banking respondents, 88 per cent of consumer/food respondents and 78 per cent of oil/chemical/pharmaceutical and industrial holdings companies bought D&amp;O insurance. Compared to 1991, the purchase of D&amp;O cover has increased in every industrial classification except engineering.</p>

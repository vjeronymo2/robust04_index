			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Golovnin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo April 29 TASS -- Japan is the first of the  world's seven leading industrialized nations to get, ahead of  the G-7 summit in Naples, an official document prepared in Kiev,  Ukraine, which asks the group of seven countries for massive  economic assistance. The document was delivered to Tokyo by  First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Nikolay  Makarevich, who revealed to the press that Ukraine was expecting  subsidies amounting to nearly 20 billion dollars.    Informed diplomatic sources told ITAR-TASS that during his  Tokyo visit from April 26-28 Makarevich met Deputy Foreign  Minister of Japan Hiroshi Fukuda and representatives of the  ministries of foreign trade and industry. During these first  bilateral working consultations the parties discussed aspects of  economic aid to Kiev and future bilateral relations.    Tokyo welcomed on the whole Ukraine's intention to open its  embassy in Japan, but no specific accords were reached. No  specific decision was made concerning President Leonid  Kravchuk's visit, which Japan asked to schedule for the  beginning of next year because its present diplomatic schedule  for this year is overcrowded.    Japan and Ukraine agreed to continue consultations between  their foreign ministries and arrange a return visit by the  Japanese deputy foreign minister for the end of this or the  beginning of next year, diplomatic sources said.    Considerable attention during the Ukrainian deputy  minister's  visit was drawn to the document, brought by him, concerning  economic cooperation between Kiev and the leading industrialized  countries. The draft protocol,which is now being circulated to  the other members of the groups of seven countries ahead of  their July summit in Naples, contains Ukraine's request for  major assistance in overcoming its present energy crisis,  switching to a market economy and stabilising currency.    Nikolay Makarevich told journalists that according to  estimates, Ukraine will need at least 20 billion dollars in  subsidies to accomplish its outstanding tasks. This amount  includes coverage for the losses Ukraine sustained as a result  of U.N. sanctions against Serbia, the cost of freezing the  Chernobyl nuclear power station, as well as expenses connected  with the withdrawal and elimination of nuclear weapons.</p>

			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Yeltsin provokes anger of both left and right Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, who returned to holidaying in Sochi after visiting Germany and welcoming the Chinese leadership to Moscow, might well be tempted to extend his stay after coming under fire from both ends of the political spectrum. In Moscow yesterday, Mr Boris Mironov, a junior minister who headed the state press committee before being sacked for expressing extreme nationalist views, launched a stinging attack against the president, accusing him of failing to defend Russia's interests. He said Mr Yeltsin had 'viciously rooted out' Russian patriotism and no longer deserved the trust of the people. 'Russia was and remains a great power whose revival and return to its former position in the world is feared by other countries who have declared themselves to be the leading seven,' he said. Mr Mironov said Mr Yeltsin had rejected a programme of national revival needed to remedy Russia's 'spiritual crisis'. Mr Mironov was sacked on Friday after declaring 'if Russian nationalism is fascism, then I am a fascist' and suggesting that greater restrictions should be imposed on the media. The liberal press reacted with outrage with one newspaper comparing Mr Mironov's remarks to those of the Nazi propaganda chief, Josef Goebbels. A government spokesman explained Mr Mironov's removal had shown how the authorities reacted to the popular mood. But Mr Mironov defended himself at his former place of work yesterday despite attempts by his superiors to cancel the meeting. He rejected charges of anti-Semitism and accused the so-called democratic papers, with the help of the president, of whipping up a 'hysterical campaign' against him. However, Mr Yeltsin cannot rely on the uncritical support of the liberal media. A front-page article in Izvestia over the weekend criticised Mr Yeltsin for his behaviour in Germany when television pictures showed him stumbling after drinking at a state luncheon and then insisting on conducting an orchestra. The newspaper, which has until now been a staunch defender of Mr Yeltsin's presidency, said Russians had watched the withdrawal of their troops from Germany with pride in what had been achieved in 1945. 'But there were also completely different minutes in which millions of our compatriots experienced completely different feelings of awkwardness, if not of shame,' it said. The newspaper compared Mr Yeltsin's behaviour with that of former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, when he banged his shoe on the table at a United Nations meeting.</p>

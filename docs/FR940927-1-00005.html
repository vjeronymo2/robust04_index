The NRC is soliciting comments from interested public interest groups, the regulated industry, states, and concerned citizens. This request is intended to assist the NRC in a review of its enforcement program which is being conducted to make recommendations for improvements in the regulatory process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The comment period expires October 24, 1994.

The comment period will close for that notice on October 24, 1994. Comments for this notice should also be submitted by October 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This notice was corrected on September 6, 1994 (59 FR 46004), by deleting the reference to a ``Proposed rule'' appearing in the action line of the August 23, 1994 notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this review effort is to (i) Perform an assessment of the NRC's enforcement program to determine whether the defined purposes of the enforcement program are appropriate, (ii) determine whether the NRC's enforcement practices and procedures for issuing enforcement actions are consistent with those purposes, and (iii) provide recommendations on any changes the Review Team believes advisable. It is expected that the Review Team will complete its review and issue its report, including recommendations, by the end of January 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the August 23, 1994 notice comments were requested on a variety of matters associated with the enforcement program. Item G. of the notice, entitled ``Exercise of Discretion,'' raised two issues associated with the exercise of enforcement discretion. However, a note was included under Item G. that provided that the enforcement review was not addressing section VII.C. of the Enforcement Policy entitled, ``Exercise of Discretion for an Operating Reactor'' that addresses ``Notices of Enforcement Discretion'' (NOEDs). 59 FR 43303. The Review Team has since reconsidered its position and concluded that this issue should be considered as part of the reexamination. Comments are now requested on this issue as described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 12, 1994, a report entitled, ``Notice of Enforcement Discretion Review Team Report,'' was issued which addressed a number of issues associated with the issuances of NOEDs. The recommendations in this report have not yet been adopted by the NRC. The report and its recommendations are undergoing staff review. A copy of that report is available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Document Room. In addition it is available on the NRC bulletin board system (BBS) that is a subsystem of FedWorld. Access to the NRC BBS is described in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In providing comments on the issue addressed below, please key comments to the numbering system used to identify the specific issues by providing the issue number before the particular comment (e.g., Response to K.1). General or anecdotal comments (such as a general comment to the effect that some enforcement conferences have not been effective or that some enforcement cases have been inconsistent with the Enforcement Policy) will not be particularly useful. Rather comments should be as specific as possible and should reference specific cases, as appropriate, so that the Review Team can understand and evaluate the comment. Responses which call for a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer should be accompanied with an explanation as to why the commenter agrees or disagrees with the issue. When the term licensee is used in the issues listed below, it refers, as applicable, to licensees, vendors, and other persons subject to NRC enforcement actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments may be provided in hard copy or through the NRC electronic bulletin board (BBS).

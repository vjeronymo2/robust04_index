			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called  on Germans to engage in "active patriotism." "Just as freedom  and love for one's fatherland belong together, in the future  patriotism and commitment to Europe must supplement each other,"  Kohl said in Munich on Sunday [19 June] when he accepted the  1994 Konrad Adenauer Freedom Prize. "Anyone who fans hatred  against foreigners can never claim that he is a good patriot,"  the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] chairman added.    Kohl received the award of the conservative "Germany  Foundation" during a festive event in the Bavarian Minister  President's office in Munich. "We need a new civic sense,  active patriotism for which we remember virtues such as courage  and reliability, industriousness and one's own responsibility,  love for one's fellow-man and helpfulness," Kohl said.    Patriotism must not be degraded with the insinuation that  the  borders between national pride and nationalism are blurring.  "Let us also resist the temptation to despise patriotism just  because this virtue got a bad reputation during the Nazi period  and was abused at that time," the chancellor stated.    In determining Germany's position so-to-speak, he  emphatically opposed a loosening of the FRG's ties with the West  after reunification. In view of the security policy challenges  of the future, it is in Germany's interest to continue the  policy of having ties with the West and of foreign policy  integration. Kohl rejects a special German role also concerning  future Bundeswehr missions to preserve and reestablish peace:  "A people that is no longer willing to cooperate with its  partners for peace and freedom has morally resigned from the  world."    According to the Foundation, Kohl received the Adenauer  Freedom Prize for his life's work in the service of freedom,  peace, and the unity of the German people in Konrad Adenauer's  spirit. The award was presented to him by Max Adenauer, the son  of the first German chancellor. Bavarian Minister President  Edmund Stoiber, CDU, said in a greeting address that with his  policy Kohl has found the answer to the greatest question of the  German people in 200 years, "the answer to the question about  unity and freedom."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Portanskiy report: "Your Authorization To Export </F> Foreign Currency Could Be Forged"]    [Text] If you have decided to go on a foreign trip, taking  with you a tidy sum in foreign currency so as not to stint  yourself at all when abroad, there is no problem. You can now  obtain authorization to export freely convertible currency  without any particular difficulty right at the currency exchange  facility. But prepare yourself not to faint from irritation at  the airport if you are suddenly not allowed through the barrier:  Your authorization could be forged.    "Based on the instances recorded by us, `forged document'  criminal cases are being instituted virtually every other day,"  I was told by Yuriy Afonin, deputy chief of customs at  Sheremetyevo-2. "We are seriously concerned by the massive  number of fraudulent currency exchange facilities. A completely  unsuspecting citizen goes there, buys foreign currency, and the  authorization issued to him turns out to be invalid."    Hapless passengers are taking out forty, fifty, or sixty  thousand dollars each under these false documents -- at  Sheremetyevo customs alone these sums apparently run to at least  $1 million.    On detecting a forgery the customs officers, as instructed,  carry out the necessary investigation: They inspect the foreign  currency, question the witnesses, including the foreign currency  carrier, and pass the case over to the Air Transport  Prosecutor's Office. Then the prosecutor's office conducts an  investigation and establishes that the authorization is indeed  forged; but it is not that the detained person made an honest  mistake -- he was completely unaware of the possibility of any  violation on his part.    Consequently the victim's money is returned to him. The  elements of a crime are not present, because the law considers  smuggling to be only that which is done with deliberate intent,  that is, when a person was aware of everything and desired the  consequences. In an attempt to get to the bottom of a forged  authorization, the investigative organs make enquiries at the  bank whose requisites appear on the document. But as a rule the  latter replies that the authorization in question cannot be  found in its records and consequently cannot have been issued.  The circle is closed and the case ends.    But it is not only exchange facilities that provide  authorizations. Certain citizens with no great respect for the  law are not averse to acquiring the coveted chit from dubious  types under the counter.    At the beginning of the year the Federal Service for Foreign  Currency and Export Control checked out only one of the  authorized commercial banks and discovered that tens of millions  of dollars in foreign currency were actually being issued there  without supporting documents. I was told by the aforementioned  service that new checks of both currency exchange facilities and  the banks themselves are scheduled for June.    From the viewpoint of the Federal Service for Foreign  Currency Control, and especially of the customs service, a  considerable share of the responsibility for violations of the  foreign currency exchange procedure rests with the authorized  banks.    The law-abiding citizen must have the unhindered opportunity  to obtain authorization to export legally acquired foreign  currency without the risk of being swindled. But now it is  better to do this only in reputable exchange facilities which  have a full list of the necessary documents and equipment.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UN pursues search for Afghan accord MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, will visit Pakistan today in an effort to encourage the formation of a council of mujahideen guerrilla representatives which could peacefully take power in Afghanistan. The visit comes at the end of a week of growing concerns about the failure of an earlier UN peace plan, as well as of something of a diminution in the organisation's role in resolving the Afghan dispute. The ousted Afghan President Najibullah has been in hiding at a UN office in Kabul since his fall last week. This has affected the organisation's image of impartiality in the eyes of mujahideen commanders, according to western diplomats and senior government officials. 'The world can huff and puff as much as it wants, but Afghans have their own way of doing things' said one western diplomat. Scepticism about international diplomatic activities has also been raised because of the Pakistani government's unsuccessful efforts to persuade groups of mujahideen based here to agree on a council to take power in Kabul. Mr Benon Sevan, the special UN envoy for Afghanistan, is continuing his efforts to secure a safe passage for President Najibullah, according to a senior Pakistani official. But the task has become 'a very, very difficult one', in view of a refusal by militiamen in control of Kabul airport to let him fly out. However, UN officials continue to defend the role of their organisation in the peace efforts, arguing that the failure of the peace plan and the presence of President Najibullah at a UN office in Kabul do not mean the organisation can play no further role in finding peace in Afghanistan.</p>

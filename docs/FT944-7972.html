			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Providing a base for long haul - The significance of Rolls-Royce's Dollars 525m acquisition of a US aero-engine maker Given the financial details of Rolls-Royce's proposed acquisition of Allison, the US aero-engine manufacturer, the City's reaction was remarkably positive. Rolls-Royce is paying Dollars 525m (Pounds 320m) for a company that was sold for 30 per cent less a year ago and that has lost more than Dollars 370m since 1990. The deal will be funded by a Pounds 300m rights issue which will hang over the market for months while Rolls-Royce seeks US regulatory approval. Yet its shares ended up 2p at 185p. Rolls-Royce had to work hard to convince analysts that the deal made short-term financial sense. But there were few who doubted the strategic benefits. Allison will broaden Rolls-Royce's product range in aero-engines, a market where the company itself admits it is difficult to predict winners. Allison also provides a US manufacturing base which is seen as important boost to Rolls' chances of involvement in future US defence programmes. Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, commented: 'Getting on new programmes such as Astovl and JAFT will require a constituency in the US.' More fundamentally, the deal provides further evidence of Rolls' determination to go it alone, rather than ally itself with with one of its US rivals - General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney. Rolls-Royce has increased its market share significantly over the last decade but in group terms it remains much smaller than its rival's parents. Many analysts believe it is too small to bear the risks and huge costs of developing new engine families. The acquisition of Allison and the associated rights issue, though a sign of management's confidence, will do little to address those concerns. It does, however, give Rolls exposure to some strong sectors of the aero-engine market. It may not be easy to predict which type of aero-engine is likely to show the best growth over the next decade. But most observers agree that large turboprop engines, where Allison has a near monopoly, is one of the most promising military markets. Allison's other strong market position is in small helicopter engines, where growth prospects are also good given the swing in defence budgets towards rapid response and surveillance. But of the four new Allison engines about to reach the market, it is the AE2100, large turboprop, that is likely to be its mainstay over the next few years. The AE2100 powers the C130J, the soon-to-be-launched successor to Lockheed's hugely successful Hercules transport plane. Although Sir Ralph denies it, the proposed purchase of Allison may make it more likely that the RAF will plump for the C130J as replacement for half its ageing Hercules fleet. Rolls, however, will continue to press for the RAF to support the proposed European rival, the Future Large Aircraft. Rolls is hoping it will be chosen by the FLA consortium to supply the engines. However, Rolls and British Aerospace believe they will be frozen out of the project if the RAF chooses to go with Lockheed. Some observers even suggest that Rolls' French rival, Snecma, will use the acquisition of Allison to argue against the FLA using Rolls engines. For the moment analysts are more concerned about Rolls' prediction that, despite its recent financial record, Allison will enhance group earnings. Rolls argues that recent cost-cutting has yet to show through fully in Allison's figures while research and development spending has fallen sharply following the completion of the four new engines. 'One has to take on trust Rolls-Royce's assurance that the business has turned,' said Mr Chris Avery, aerospace analyst at Paribas.</p>

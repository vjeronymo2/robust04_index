			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Generators may face early MMC referral over pricing THE electricity industry regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, is to decide this year on whether to refer the UK's two main generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission after calling yesterday for significant reform in the power trading market. His deliberations on the monopolies referral will cast doubt on ministers' plans to raise Pounds 5.5bn from privatisation sales in 1994-95. The government would probably be forced to postpone plans to sell the state's 40 per cent stakes in PowerGen and National Power, worth Pounds 3bn, next year if the companies were referred. Prof Littlechild's move to bring forward a monopolies decision, previously expected in 1995, follows a two-month inquiry into price rises in the electricity wholesale pool where all power in England and Wales is traded. He said the generators' ability to raise prices, a primary cause of the pool increases, was a matter of widespread concern. Prof Littlechild criticised the pool's pricing mechanism. He said it should be simplified and more attention should be paid to customers' needs. The pool needed to think 'less about central planning and more in terms of what the market needs to work effectively'. He also urged changes in responsibilities between the pool and the National Grid, and backed proposals that would allow large customers to bypass the pool and buy directly from generators. This year's pool selling prices, up 20 per cent on last year, have hit hard the more than 1,000 large industrial customers such as Imperial Chemical Industries which buy directly from the pool. Domestic and commercial users have escaped unscathed because they are covered by long-term 'hedging' contracts between electricity companies. Prof Littlechild warned that their prices would be affected in future as new contracts would take account of pool price changes. ICI yesterday criticised the regulator for 'taking no firm action' to correct problems he had identified or compensating those companies that had paid for the price deficiencies. 'His conclusions are limited to exhortations to others to consider action, coupled with veiled threats of a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission,' the company said. In his report, Prof Littlechild said the size of the increase was more attributable to National Power than PowerGen. National Power said yesterday it was not easy to defend a rising price during a recession but said its prices were not excessive. It said pool customers had been enjoying artificially low prices for some time. Most of those now suffering had previously enjoyed subsidies. PowerGen said pool prices were not too high when judged against its need to provide a return on capital and sustain long-term investment. Mrs Margaret Thompson, pool chief executive, said an internal review of operations was already making progress in areas flagged by the regulator including simplifying trading arrangements.

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YEMENS MERGE; HOPE RESTS ON OIL RESERVES  </P> <P> Two countries on the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen and South Yemen, joined Tuesday  to become one nation, the Republic of Yemen, an impoverished land sitting on  newly discovered oil reserves.  </P> <P> Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh, the president of the unified state, raised the new  country's red, white and black flag at noon atop the Presidential Council  building at port side.  </P> <P> The republic is poor but has recently located oil reserves unofficially put at  2 billion barrels. The nation is on the strategically located Bab al Mandab, a  strait at the southern outlet of the Red Sea into the Indian Ocean.  </P> <P> Saleh said at a rally that the republic will honor all treaties either of the  former countries signed.  </P> <P> About 2,000 people attended and interrupted Saleh's address several times with  loud applause.  </P> <P> "The Republic of Yemen will be a factor for stability and security in the  Arabian Peninsula and the gulf (of Aden) region and a strong bastion for the  Arab nations, the Arab League and joint Arab action," Saleh said.  </P> <P> Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat was the only Arab  leader who attended the ceremony. He delivered a brief congratulatory message.  </P> <P> In Washington, the United States on Tuesday welcomed the union of the Yemens,  saying it will review the status of the new state on the U.S. list of terrorist  nations.  </P> <P> The United States last month re-established diplomatic relations with South  Yemen after a 30-year break. But South Yemen remained on the U.S. list of  nations that sponsor terrorism.  </P> <P> Arab foreign ministers meeting in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad to prepare for  an Arab summit hailed the unification. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al  Faisal said it will improve "the stability of the region."  </P> <P> The merger was approved Monday by the parliaments of the former countries. It  was pushed through several days earlier than planned so the Yemenis could  attend the Arab summit as one nation.  </P> <P> The new nation has 11 million people -- 9 million from the north and 2 million  from the south -- and is one of the poorest countries in the world.  </P> <P> South Yemen became the Arab world's only Marxist state after it gained  independence from Britain in 1967. Although it received aid from the Soviet  Union, the south's economy has languished for 20 years, and there has been  widespread labor unrest in recent months. Some Arab diplomatic sources said the  south endorsed unity mainly because of the democratic reforms sweeping Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P> Scores of Cuban and East German military experts are said to have left the  south in recent months. A friendship pact entitles the Soviets to maintain as  many as 18,000 troops in South Yemen, but the extent of the actual deployment  is unknown.  </P> <P> Sana will be the capital of the new state, with Aden the main commercial  center. Sana was formerly the capital of the north and Aden the capital of the  south.  </P> <P> Saleh was elected president of the five-man Presidential Council that will rule  Yemen. The 48-year-old army officer, who has served as president of the north  since 1978, was promoted from colonel to general on Monday by the north's  Parliament.  </P> <P> Ali Salem Bidh, the secretary general of the Socialist Party that ruled the  south, was elected vice president.  </P></p>

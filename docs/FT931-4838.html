			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Currency crisis takes its toll on Legrand LEGRAND, the electrical equipment group which has traditionally been seen as one of the most resilient French industrial companies, saw net profits fall by 6.5 per cent to FFr657m (Dollars 116.23m) in 1992 from FFr703m in 1991. The group's main problem last year was the strength of the franc following the September currency crisis which took a toll on its income from outside France. Legrand last year performed slightly below the expectations of analysts, who had been forecasting a slight improvement for the group in 1992. Legrand, which has maintained its dividend at FFr57.50 for ordinary shares and FFr92 for 'privileged' shares, said it was well-placed to withstand another difficult year. 'Everything is in place so that we can cope with the deterioration in the economic environment without jeopardising out plans for the future,' it said. The group, which is involved in both the production and distribution of electrical equipment, managed to increase turnover by 3 per cent (just ahead of French inflation) to FFr10.25bn from FFr9.95bn in 1991. However, Legrand estimated that it 'lost' FFr100m in net profits last year because of currency fluctuations in the final quarter and exceptional financial costs.</p>

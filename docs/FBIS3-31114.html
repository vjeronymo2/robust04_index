One hundred Danish troops will accompany the German-designed  Leopards, the first heavy tanks to be used by the UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, from Split in southern  Croatia, the UN force said Monday.    The tanks were moved to Split to try to reach Tuzla from the  south three weeks ago, after being prevented for four months by  the Serbian authorities from leaving Pancevo, near Belgrade, on  the grounds that they were offensive weapons.    Tuzla, held by the mainly-Moslem Bosnian armed forces, is  being besieged by Bosnian Serb forces, who are resisting  international pressure to reopen the airport there to  humanitarian flights.    The Leopards will first head for Tomislavgrad in southwest  Bosnia, which is under the control of Bosnian Croat militia,  pending further orders from UNPROFOR.    They are destined for the 1,000-strong Nordic battalion of  UNPROFOR in Tuzla.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India's jute rules relaxed THE Indian federal government has accepted the suggestion of the Indian Jute Mills Association to allow free import of jute in the current season to next June. The move is a reaction to concern about the runaway inflation in raw jute prices, which may force financially weak jute mills to close. Until now, the mills have only been allowed to import jute for use in producing export goods. However, industry officials said the liberalisation would not give much relief to jute mills. At this stage, the Indian mills would not find it easy to import jute of required grades and quantities and were resigned to importing low-grade fibre, including cuttings from Bangladesh where prices are higher than in India. The jute crop has suffered a setback both in India and Bangladesh. Industry officials said the situation would not have been as grave if the government had freed the import of jute earlier in the season. It had not considered it necessary to do so because official crop monitoring agency forecasts had pointed to a near-normal raw jute production of 7.2m bales in July. Now, the industry thinks the crop will be no more than 6.5m bales, while the trade estimate is even lower at 6m. Industry officials said most jute mills were finding it 'extremely difficult' to buy fibre at the prevailing rate.</p>

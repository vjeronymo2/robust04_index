			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Observer: Hiccup Dutch discotheque-owner Eric Doppen meant well when he installed an electronic speaking-breathalyser outside his door. But although the guilder-a-blow device has proved instantly popular, it is not being used quite as he foresaw. His object was to enable the Groenlo disco's customers to check whether they were legally sober enough to drive. Instead, they are using it as a referee for drinking-contests. The game is for parties to arrive by cab, whoop it up, then the one ending with the highest count on the breathalyser pays everyone's fare home. 'It's become a question of honour to be the one who pays,' the owner sighed.</p>

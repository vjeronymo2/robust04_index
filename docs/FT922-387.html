			<p>920627 FT  27 JUN 92 / International Company News: BSN takes control of Italian food group BSN, the French food group, is taking control of Galbani, a leading player in the Italian food industry, by buying an additional 10 per cent stake from IFIL, a company controlled by the powerful Agnelli family, for FFr1.35bn (Dollars 260m). The deal comes only a few months after the bitter takeover battle for the Perrier mineral water group in which BSN, a traditional ally of the Agnellis, dramatically switched sides to support Nestle, the Swiss food group which fought successfully against the Italian family for control of Perrier. Galbani, which has extensive interests in cheese and processed meats with brands such as Bel Paese and Santa Lucia, is now owned jointly by BSN and IFIL. Under the terms of the new agreement, BSN will take control by raising its stake to 60 per cent with an option to buy the remaining shares for not less than the price paid for its extra 10 per cent stake. The stake disposal represents a significant profit for IFIL, given that it values Galbani, which made sales of L1,730bn last year, at L3,000bn, more than twice as much as the L1,340bn that the Agnellis paid for it in 1989. BSN invested in Galbani in summer 1989, initially taking 35 per cent. Meanwhile BSN, together with its allies in the Perrier saga, is eagerly awaiting the conclusion of the European Commission's inquiry into the Nestle bid. The inquiry, which should be completed over the next few weeks, will determine whether Nestle can proceed with the bid and with its agreement to sell Volvic mineral water to BSN.</p>

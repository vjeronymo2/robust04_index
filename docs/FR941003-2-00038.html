			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federally purchased vaccines under the VFC Program will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be made available to children who are 18 years of age or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> younger and_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Who are eligible for Medicaid;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Who are not insured under any form of health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Who are not insured with respect to the vaccine and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> who are administered pediatric vaccines by a federally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified health center (FQHC) or in a rural health clinic;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Who are Indians, as defined in section 4 of the Indian  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health Care Improvement Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the VFC program, vaccines must be administered by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program-registered providers. Section 1928(c) defines a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program-registered provider as any health care provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Is licensed or authorized to administer pediatric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vaccines under the law of the State in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration occurs without regard to whether or not the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider is a Medicaid-participating provider;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Submits to the State an executed provider agreement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the form and manner specified by the Secretary; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Has not been found by the Secretary or the State to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have violated a provider agreement or other requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may apply that are established by the Secretary or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Providers may participate in the VFC program without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating in Medicaid if they are qualified to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administer vaccines under applicable State law. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such providers will not be reimbursed by Medicaid for their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services in administering the vaccine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the VFC Program, a provider may impose a fee for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine as long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the fee, in the case of a Federally vaccine-eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child, does not exceed the cost of such administration (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the Secretary based on actual regional costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for such administration). However, a provider may not deny  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vaccine-eligible child due to the inability of the child's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parents or legal guardian to pay the administration fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Provisions of This Notice With Comment Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. General Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This notice announces interim regional maximum charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These represent the maximum amount that a provider in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State may charge for the administration of qualified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric vaccines to Federally vaccine-eligible children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the VFC Program. It also specifies the methodology that HCFA used to establish these regional maximum charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are interpreting ``regional'' as specified in the statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be the ``State'', as discussed in section II.B.2. of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice. In addition, this notice gives Universal Purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States (that is, where the vaccines are purchased by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State for all children in the State) the right to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration charges that differ from those established by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA, provided they are reasonable. Therefore, Universal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Purchase States are provided the flexibility to accept the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum charges established by the Secretary or to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their own maximum charges. In either case, the statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gives State Medicaid agencies the option to establish and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply vaccine administration fees that are lower than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified maximum charges if they provide assurances that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid children have access to immunizations to the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent as the general population. Section 1902(a)(30)(A) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act, as amplified by section 1926, requires States to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay enough for obstetrical and pediatric services (which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include immunization services) so that those services are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the ``Medicaid population'' to the same extent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are available to the general population in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> geographic area. These assurances must be submitted to HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as part of the appropriate State plan amendment to impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fees. This notice specifies guidelines for States to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in setting lower administration fees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

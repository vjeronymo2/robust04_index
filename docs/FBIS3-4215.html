[Words indistinct] out a "primary framework" for resolving  the three issues at hand, said negotiators from the Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Association for Relations Across  the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), the two non-official organizations  authorized by Taipei and the mainland to handle cross-strait  exchanges.    The three issues are the repatriation of mainland hijackers,  the repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants, and  cross-strait fishing disputes. SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho  and ARATS vice chairman Tang Shubei at the end of their Beijing  talks in February claimed to have reached a "consensus" on the  issues and hoped that draft agreements would be signed at the  current round of talks.    According to Taipei negotiators, Beijing is reluctant to pay  the costs of repatriating the illegal mainland immigrants and  recompensing Taipei for their stay in Taiwan -- a cost the  Taiwan side has estimated to be NT$1 [new Taiwan dollars]  billion (about U.S.$38 million).    In addition, the mainland has disagreed with Taiwan's  suggested wording of the draft agreement on the repatriation of  hijackers: "Neither side has to return a hijacker who is a  citizen of that country." Since last April, 11 mainland  passenger planes have been hijacked to Taiwan.    In Taipei, the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] said the  mainland side was to blame for the lack of progress during  Friday's talks. "The mainland side is even tougher than  before," MAC spokesman Kao Kung- lien said.</p>

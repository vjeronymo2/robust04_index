			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Murayama fails to convey stability: Gerard Baker on the Japanese PM's performance at the G7 summit See Naples and die, they said, and for one awful moment on Saturday, Japanese thought their new prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, had interpreted the old Italian saying literally. A hastily arranged midnight press conference during the Group of Seven summit in Naples, relayed to Japan, hinted that the prime minister's emergency hospital visit might mean the worst. Within hours it emerged that the septuagenarian leader had succumbed to nothing worse than a bout of gastroenteritis, and he was able to resume his place at the Group of Seven talks on Sunday in the city which the old saying implies is so beautiful there is nothing else that remains to be seen on earth. But as he returned home to Tokyo last night, it was clear that the meeting had failed to resolve many of the lingering doubts about the durability of Mr Murayama's coalition. The government's verdict on the meeting betrayed pre-summit fears that Mr Murayama, elected to the premiership just two weeks ago with no ministerial experience, might not prove able to hold his own with his G7 colleagues. 'Prime minister Murayama relayed his views and ideas very frankly and effectively through talks with the six other countries,' said Mr Kozo Igarashi, the chief cabinet secretary. Mr Murayama had been schooled extensively in the arts of international relations in the days before the meeting, and there was relief that, intestinal matters apart, he had proved up to the job. But the more difficult task for the Japanese delegation was to convince the other members of the G7 that the new government, principally a coalition of the unlike-minded Social Democratic party and Liberal Democratic party, represented both stability and continuity with its predecessors. There was little evidence that they succeeded. In bilateral talks with US President Bill Clinton, and later in the first plenary session, Mr Murayama, from the SDP, and the LDP's Mr Yohei Kono, the deputy prime minister, stressed that in the key areas of trade and security relations the government was committed to the same goals as its predecessors: progress would be made on the economic framework talks and the Japan-US security relationship would remain the bulwark of Japanese foreign policy. The only acknowledged reservation was the role of Russia, elevated to the status of semi-member of a G8. Foreign ministry officials were reported to have expressed concern that Russia's presence at future political discussions would make it difficult for Japan to use the G7 as a forum for raising the subject of the Kurile Islands, disputed territory occupied by Russia at the end of the second world war. But the Japanese delegation had hardly left Naples before doubts emerged. The unwieldy coalition seems certain to face big difficulties in maintaining the commitments given at the G7 meeting. The death of North Korean President Kim Il-sung presents an immediate problem. The SDP has traditionally been friendly towards the Pyongyang regime, and the LDP has also adopted a conciliatory stance. The uncertainty following Mr Kim's death is likely to create strains between Japan and its allies if, as seems likely, the government adopts a dovish approach. But it is on economic policy that the coalition appears to be in disarray. At the summit, Mr Murayama committed himself to continuing the pump-priming of the economy to stimulate more imports and redress Japan's large trade imbalances. But the SDP is anxious not to offset the large income tax cuts implemented this year with increases in consumption tax, while the LDP and the powerful finance ministry support an early rise in consumption tax. As he left Naples Mr Murayama was forced to correct a misunderstanding from an earlier statement in which he seemed to imply that Japan had agreed to implement income tax cuts for another year, without an offsetting rise in consumption tax. Yesterday Mr Kiro Saito, the senior official at the finance ministry, described as 'meaningful' the view expressed by the G7 heads of government that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals, adding, 'It was important that a common stance was reaffirmed among the summit participants.' The verdict of business on the summit was mixed. Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, president of the Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations, welcomed the meeting's call for international policy co-ordination and structural measures for global recovery. But Mr Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, or Keizai Doyukai, expressed disappointment that the summit had failed to agree on specific measures to combat the rise of the yen on the foreign exchanges.</p>

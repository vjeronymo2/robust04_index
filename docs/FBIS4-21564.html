			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi -- India may have little option but to  turn towards nuclear-based deterrence if United States goes  ahead with its proposal to supply arms to Pakistan, according to  defence experts here.    India, given its precariously placed economy and an  indulgent  "Soviet Union" that has disappeared, is in no position to buy  frontline fighter planes. maritime patrol aircraft, and  state-of-the -art electronic warfare systems which Pakistan  gets, in case the Pressler amendment is waived.    With the balance of power already in favour of Pakistan,  thanks to the cutback on Indian defence spending, a fresh supply  of 71 F-16s, three harpoon-armed P-3 maritime aircraft, radars  and electronic warfare systems and main battle tanks will  completely load the dice against India.    Arguing that to merely correct this balance, India would  have  to step up its defence spending to 4 per cent of the gross  domestie product from the existing level of 2.4 per cent within  a year, Air Commodore Jasjit Singh, director of Institute of  Defence Studies and Analyses says, "the alternative cheaper  option may be to move towards defence-based nuclear deterrence''.    As it exists now, India cannot conceivably set aside 4 per  cent of the GDP on defence expenditure, without seriously  jeopardising its economic reforms.    Even under the US arms embargo following Pressler amendment  in 1990, Pakistan has quadrupled its combat capabilities  procuring fighters from Australia, China.    The contrast between the air forces of India and Pakistan is  striking. Since eighties when the IAF [Indian Air Force]  inducted 45-odd Mirage in answer to Pakistan's F-16's, it has  added on 35 Mig-27's manufactured at the HAL plant in Nasik.    Pakistan Air Force since 1990 has inducted 145 combat  aircraft (50 Mirage and 95 F-7Ps from China). Another 40 F-7P's  are due to join the force later this year.    From Italy, it is due to pick up 100 GRIFO sophisticated  look-up and look-down radars mounted on the F-7P's.    While India drags its feet over the advanced jet trainer,  PAF  [Pakistan Air Force) has started to receive K-8 jet trainers and  light tactical aircraft from China. The nuclear-capable M-11  ballistic missile supplied by China has been deployed in the  Pakistan air arm.    With the proposed supply ot 71 F-16's including 40-odd ready  for immediate delivery, the "balance of power substantially  swings towards Pakistan" a defence expert points out.    Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao who has warned that he  would review the defence policy in case the Pressler amendment  is waived for Pakistan is understood to have asked the research  establishment to speed up the light combat aircraft [LCA]  project.    The LCA scheduled to roll out by June 1996, on paper, is the  country's answer to the F-16. Simultaneously, IAF has been asked  to look at ways to upgrade the sophisticated Mirage 2000 which  was finally bought in answer to the first batch of F-16s  obtained by Pakistan.    The French manufacturers of the fighter aircraft are likely  to be asked to upgrade the avionics.    The implications of waiving the Pressler amendment are  understood to have figured high in the meeting of the Indo-U.S.  Air Force steering committee that began here on Monday.    The American delegation led by Lt. General John S.  Fairfield,  Vice Commander U.S. Pacific Air Force called on Air Chief S. K.  Kaul.    "Matters of mutual interest" were discussed, a Defence  Ministry release said.    IAF vice chief P. J. Jaykumar led the Indian side in the  steering committee deliberations aimed at enhancing  service-to-service cooperation. The first meeting of the  committee took place in Hawaii in August 1993 .    The security scenario in South-East Asia is expected to be  discussed at length in the three-day deliberations of the  steering committee. Officers from training, maintenance,  intelligence are taking part in the deliberations.</p>

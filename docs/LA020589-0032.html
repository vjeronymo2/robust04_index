			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIS DANDRUFF'S UP  </P> <P> As president of the men's chapter of the Society for the Preservation of Big  Hair in America (SPOBHIA), I was hard-pressed to control my disgust while  reading Gregory Farmer's Jan. 15 letter, in which he complained he had to sit  behind an "old thing with this antiquated beehive" at the movie theatre.  </P> <P> I can see this man (sic) so clearly, sitting in theater, his hair greased and  combed tight against his scalp, looking for some innocent minority to  pigeonhole.  </P> <P> Well, those of us with Hair Abundance won't stand silent before such rantings:  </P> <P> I pile my hair with pride, Mr. Farmer, as does my family and 7,000 SPOBHIA  members nationwide. Buy a VCR and stay home, you small-haired prig!  </P> <P> TIM CHRISTIAN  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P></p>

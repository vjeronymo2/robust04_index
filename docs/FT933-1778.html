			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: JIB calls for Pounds 19.9m to fund expansion JIB GROUP, the international insurance broker ultimately owned by Jardine Matheson, yesterday announced a rights issue and the planned acquisition of Nicolls Pointing, a London based wholesale and reinsurance group. It is raising Pounds 19.9m net by offering 13.8m shares at 150p apiece on a one-for-eight basis. Yesterday the shares fell 7p to 169p. Jardine Matheson, whose subsidiaries own 62.5 per cent of JIB, is committed to subscribe for its entitlement of 8.64m shares. The remainder will be underwritten by Robert Fleming and brokers are Cazenove. Consideration for Nicolls Pointing, which specialises in the energy and marine insurance sectors and in reinsurance business, is an initial Pounds 15.5m, comprising Pounds 6.75m cash, 2.53m ordinary shares valued at Pounds 4.4m, and Pounds 4.4m of convertible loan notes. A further consideration of up to Pounds 3.2m will be paid in shares and loan notes if Nicolls Pointing's profits after tax exceed Pounds 1.65m for 1993 up to a level of Pounds 2m. Last year Nicolls Pointing reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.99m on turnover of Pounds 5.7m. Mr Nick Cosh, JIB finance director, said the acquisition, the biggest since the group floated in November 1991, would significantly increase its presence in the wholesale market. He predicted further efficiencies, leading to enhanced earnings for JIB. The rights issue will finance the cash element of the proposed acquisition. It will also be used to refinance several smaller acquisitions made in the last two years at a total cost of Pounds 15m, of which Pounds 4m was deferred.</p>

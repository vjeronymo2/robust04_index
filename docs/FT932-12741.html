			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Leading Article: Moving on at the TUC THE resignation of Mr Norman Willis as general secretary of the Trades Union Congress offers an opportunity for renewal in the UK's trade union movement. Mr Willis's likely successor is Mr John Monks, a younger, sharper man who is more capable of thinking strategically about the future of the TUC. However, it will take more than a change at the top if Britain's trade union centre is to re-establish itself as an important organisation in national life. The most important challenge for the new general secretary will be to restore the fortunes of the TUC after a period of steep decline. From 12m affiliated members in 1979, the TUC now has around 7.7m members today. More than members, it has lost its place in the corridors of power, no longer wielding great authority as an estate of the realm. Yet like the unemployed person who daily leaves home for work that no longer exists, the TUC still behaves as if it remained a power in the land. Staffing levels have only recently been cut below 1979 levels. The annual seaside conference continues to instruct the nation on every aspect of policy from vibration white finger to international relations. Congress House generates endless paper for a myriad of committees which attempt to shadow Whitehall. Further weakening Until the mid-1980s, it might just have been possible for the TUC to revert to its previous role - had a government prepared to return to the corporatism of the 1970s been elected. No such government materialised. And all the while, the growth of a few large super-unions has undermined the need for a trade union centre which acts as the general command of labour. Unions such as the mighty TGWU general union, the AEEU craft union and the newly-formed Unison public-sector union are capable of providing their own research, negotiation and support services. They have little need for a TUC which soaks up Pounds 1 a year for every affiliated member. A further weakening of the centre's role will come when the new trade union bill reaches the statute book. The TUC will no longer be able to operate the Bridlington Agreement, which stops its affiliates from competing for members. For many smaller unions, affiliation to the TUC was partly justified by the protection it gave against poaching. Without Bridlington, competition for members may further fracture union unity. The challenge for the TUC is to find a new niche, in which it offers indispensable services which no individual union can hope to provide. This includes the collection of data from its members, in much the same way that the CBI, the employers' body, has become a unique source of figures on business confidence. The growing importance of European Community law in the workplace makes the recent opening of the TUC's Brussels office overdue. Coherent strategy The TUC should also be the think-tank which throws out new ideas on the issues facing people at work and outside the labour market. It is hard to think of much that Congress House has contributed to the debate over labour market reform to cut unemployment, for example, that stands comparison with the effusion of ideas which has flowed from the tiny Employment Institute with a fraction of the TUC's resources. Nor has the TUC found it possible to open a dialogue with employers on the possible trade-off between pay rises and extra jobs, an issue on which rank and file trade unionists in places such as Sheffield have taken bold initiatives. At the heart of TUC's difficulties, however, is the absence of a coherent strategy for the union movement in a post-collective bargaining era. There is certainly a role for unions in such circumstances, as is seen in the success of those unions which provide high-quality services to individual members. And unions are uniquely well-placed to voice the concerns of people at work in national discussions on workplace matters such as health and safety, employment law and pensions. If the TUC did not exist, a government might have to create a surrogate to represent such interests in the future. The challenge for Mr Willis's successor is to encourage the TUC to fill these needs, and to sweep away the delusions of grandeur based on its past.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Wooltru down on decline in consumer spending A SHARP fall in consumer spending caused a 28 per cent fall in earnings at Wooltru, one of South Africa's premier consumer-based retailers, in the 26 weeks to December. Mr David Susman, chairman, described the trading period as the 'most difficult for many years.' He noted clothing, footwear and textile sales showed showed a real decrease of 3.5 per cent, while food volumes were 13.5 per cent down on a year earlier. The results are the first from a blue-chip retailer for the second half of 1991, and are considerably worse than other market leaders which reported towards the end of last year. They confirm that consumer spending dropped off sharply last year, South Africa's long-running recession having initially been restricted more to the capital goods sectors. Although turnover rose by 17 per cent to R1.98bn (Dollars 77m), net income before tax declined by 28 per cent to R106.7m. Net income was 31 per cent lower at R57.3m and earnings per share were 28 per cent down at 164.5 cents. Commenting on the results, Mr Susman said budgets and buying plans set early in 1991 were too optimistic and, faced with excess stock, drastic markdowns were forced on the group. Hardest hit was Makro, the wholesale arm of the group, where an aggressive store development programme led to a 61 per cent drop in pre-tax profit. Woolworths, the upmarket food and clothing flagship of the group, had a disappointing performance with pre-tax profit down 55 per cent. This was due to weaknesses in textile procurement, marketing and management controls. The board said the fall in profits in the second half should be less severe. The dividend was maintained at 77 cents per share.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / London hospitals to learn fate next month Decisions on the future of some of London's best-known hospitals have been deferred until next month. An announcement had been scheduled for this week, but work on a final package to be presented by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is continuing. The government is committed to cutting hospital beds in the capital and shifting resources to family doctor and community services. But complex and politically sensitive considerations are involved. If a package is agreed this week the announcement is now likely to come around February 2 but it could be delayed further. One of the most controversial decisions involves Guy's and St Thomas' teaching hospitals. Guy's &amp; St Thomas' Trust Board was asked to consider ways of locating all services at one hospital, but it responded with a proposal to retain both sites. Since the trust board made its recommendation in November, it has been asked by the government to evaluate further possibilities including single-site options. Among these have been the possibility of housing the hospital at St Thomas', and moving King's College medical school to Guy's buildings. Studies have shown that a combined Guy's and St Thomas' hospital could be accommodated on either site but the trust board does not believe sufficient capital funding would be available to achieve this. A twin-site solution is therefore a strong possibility although several options remain before ministers. Another sensitive decision concerns the future of the Royal Marsden cancer hospital's Chelsea buildings. A government-commissioned review of specialist services has recommended a transfer to a site at Sutton, Surrey. This provoked a powerful campaign to keep the Royal Marsden in Chelsea and a decision to close it would court unpopularity for the Conservatives ahead of May's local elections in London. Some health service managers believe single-speciality hospitals such as the Royal Marsden will not prove cost-effective in the new contract-based internal market. An option for ministers would be to defer a decision, leaving the market to decide whether the Royal Marsden has a future at Chelsea. The forthcoming decisions do not only concern hospitals facing possible closure. Others risk the removal of services which could make them uneconomic in the internal market. The trust board of St Mary's, Paddington, has told the government that proposals to withdraw its cardiac services would lose it Pounds 6m, or 6 per cent of turnover, and another Pounds 2m in private patient fees - 28 per cent of private-wing income. The hospital says that health service cardiac surgery has risen from 440 to 660 cases this financial year and is forecast to rise to 750 next year.</p>

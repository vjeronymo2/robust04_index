			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UN issues warning to Serbs The United Nations yesterday said Bosnian Serb forces were flouting terms of a UN 'safe area' accord in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde and warned them not to test UN/Nato resolve. UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi had written to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to try to reverse 'a deterioration' of conditions inside Gorazde's 20km weapons exclusion zone, a UN spokesman said. Foreign ministers of major western powers and Russia will meet in Geneva on Friday to discuss new peace moves for Bosnia but there seems little hope they will find a quick way to end the war, diplomats in Geneva said yesterday.</p>

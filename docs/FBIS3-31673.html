			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Birger Hilstrom: "Massive Support for Albania"] </F>   [Excerpts] Large Danish contributions are on the way for  rebuilding Albania's health-care system and amount to the most  extensive export ever of a Danish overall system. Foreign Aid  Minister Helle Degn has a pool of 45 million kroner [6 million  dollars] ready and is calling a meeting to decide on  distribution of the funds. [passage omitted]    The 45 million kroner will be provided to the Albanians over  the next three years, and Degn will invite Danish foreign aid  organizations and a Danish consulting group, with EU [European  Union] Parliament member Freddy Blak (Social Democrat) as  chairman, to a meeting on 31 January to decide how the funds are  to be distributed.    "Until now we have only granted humanitarian aid of between  2  and 4 million kroner, but the effort needs to be coordinated and  targeted correctly," said Degn. "I think we must support the  weakest, and this means orphaned children and the handicapped,  and to set up an Albanian legal system."    The Albanian Government on Sunday [16 January], asked for  Danish help in drawing up a comprehensive plan for taking care  of the mentally handicapped of that poor country. A  comprehensive plan for psychiatric and mental retardation care  will be the largest Danish system export ever, amounting to  hundreds of million [kroner], and the plan will include  decentralizing from Tirana, training of Albanian personnel, and  establishing of new housing through [the private] ASF Danish  Folkehjaelp.    The Danish consulting group, which received a request for  help from the Albanian Ministry of Health following an  inspection of badly deteriorating hospitals, is gathering funds  for the project from, among other sources, already appropriated  EU loans.    "We have broad experience in the decentralizing of  institutions for the develpmentally impaired, and the Albanians  wanted our model," said former Director of Social Services  Alfred Dam, who has just returned home from Albania and is in  the process of drafting a report on the shocking conditions in  Albanian institutions.</p>

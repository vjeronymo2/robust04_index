			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Letter: Mature approach of EBRD Sir, Recent attacks on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have some justification and the bank's president, Jacques Attali, has been unwise in certain internal spending policies. These criticisms should not obscure, however, the bank's achievements and the spade-work done for the future in terms of development and merchant banking. While those of us who deal with the EBRD feel a degree of frustration at the procedural requirements and delays, the bank's own systems will doubtless be refined and many of the problems are not of its making. They arise, rather, from the varying political and economic characteristics of the countries of eastern and central Europe and from the need for strategic overviews prior to investment. The bank has a responsibility to consider not only shorter-term financial criteria but the longer-term environmental and strategic development of the regions. Such policies can only be developed on a step-by-step basis. I and my colleagues recognise that the bank can have no magic wand in securing an 'open cheque book' for potential investments but we believe this mature approach will achieve a long-term future for growth. The EBRD should be congratulated on the manner in which it provides information and briefings to interested parties and on providing a high level of informative documentation to those attending the annual meeting. Before the recent spate of criticism, M. Attali had proved to be a visionary in having established the EBRD with a high-profile and well-developed structure for future operations, over a short period. In due course a more traditional banker will no doubt become the bank's president, but this contribution should not be overlooked.

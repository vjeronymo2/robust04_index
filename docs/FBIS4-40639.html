			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasiliy Kononenko: "B. Yeltsin Has Made </F> Suggestions To His Subordinates Concerning Results of His Trip  to the Amur District, Tuva, and Novosibirsk"]    [Text] President B. Yeltsin's return from a three-day tour  of the country -- he visited Blagoveshchensk, Tuva, and  Novosibirsk -- has not been covered by television and the  newspapers. But it was at this concluding stage of the program  that the impressions which the president took away from his trip  seem to have emerged. At an improvised conference at the  airport lounge (O. Soskovets, A. Shokhin, A. Zaveryukha, P.  Grachev, A. Kozyrev, V. Yerin, S. Filatov, and other  high-ranking officials were present) the president imparted his  impressions and, most important, demanded an investigation of  many problems which have become obvious to him.    In Blagoveshchensk he agreed with the oblast leadership's  suggestion to leave up to 20 percent of the gold that is mined  in the local budget. But with regard to the privatization of  gold mines he said: "We still have to look at the matter...."  Obviously he was informed of the unhealthy situation in the  oblast connected with the auctioning off of the Pokrovskoye  deposit. According to local journalists it was sold for 12  billion rubles [R] while its real cost is something like 2-3  trillion. And for some reason the auction was organized in such  a way that the opportunities for bidding were limited and as a  result the titbit went to the "Tokur zoloto" company. In this  connection even the local prosecutor's office has protested.    The president demanded that his subordinates investigate the  privatization of large industrial establishments and mineral  deposits around which fighting between the "money-bags" has  broken out.    In the Amur district there was also a discussion of the  project to construct a cosmodrome on the basis of a strategic  missile division. The president did not make a decision there  but promised to think it all over. In Moscow he demanded that  the military department and other officials work on this  scenario and submit their ideas to him very soon.    At the airport there was also talk of the situation in Tuva.  In Kyzyl after a conference with the local leadership B.  Yeltsin, at a meeting with workers of Tuva's power structures,  promised to give money for the construction of a sheepskin  factory. "We will give as much money as you can assimilate," he  said, which gave rise to applause from the workers of the  president's apparatus and the Supreme Hural. He also promised  help for the development of their water transport. According to  some calculations at least R40 billion will be required for this  just for a start. Then an unexpected phrase was heard which  shocked many people, primarily A. Shokhin.    "I forbid all government officials and all presidential  structures from demanding that the republic earn money for  itself and not be subsidized. That is impossible. The  necessary economic infrastructure does not exist in the  republic. It must be created gradually. The Amur district is  another matter. Everything necessary exists there and I  criticized the local leadership for its lack of initiative."    At "Vnukovo-2" he said more or less the following: Not all  republics can be treated the same. From this demand of the  president's it may be concluded that today he prefers to pay off  Kyzyl with money rather than have political problems. As we  know the republic has adopted a Constitution which opens up an  opportunity for it to leave Russia. Local nationalists are  exploiting this subject, although they have no real support  among the people.</p>

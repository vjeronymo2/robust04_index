			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Accounts watchdog may make criticisms public THE FINANCIAL Reporting Review Panel, the UK's watchdog of accounting standards, may start to make public criticisms of accounting practices where they confuse readers of accounts. The move would mark a shift from the panel's formal legal role in reprimanding companies that breach the 1985 Companies Act in their annual published accounts. It marks a growing sense of frustration among panel members that companies are producing accounts that do not break the law but which do not serve the best interests of shareholders and creditors. The panel already refers such matters to the Accounting Standards Board for consideration as topics for revised standards. Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council, the review panel's parent body, said there was 'considerable disquiet' over companies operating within the letter, but not the spirit, of the law. He warned that typical accounting abuses might be highlighted in future copies of the FRC's annual review - probably without reference to the companies. In the second edition of the review, published yesterday, Mr Edwin Glasgow, chairman of the review panel, said there was a considerable 'grey area' between 'sophisticated accounting standards' and the 'disarmingly simple' legal requirement for accounts to show a true and fair view. Figures compiled since the report was printed show that the panel is scrutinising 17 companies' accounts for potential breaches of accounting standards. It has examined 81 companies since it was created in the middle of last year, based on referrals generated roughly evenly between audit reports, press comment and from individuals and organisations. Of those, 29 were not pursued beyond an initial examination, while 35 cases have been resolved, including 10 in which public statements were made. The panel has also written to the directors of 240 companies that failed to include in their accounts a note of compliance with applicable accounting standards.</p>

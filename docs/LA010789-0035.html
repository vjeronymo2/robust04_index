			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS SAY THEY'D BID TO RETAIN LYNN  </P> <P> The Chargers will not lose defensive coordinator Ron Lynn to the Raiders  without a fight.  </P> <P> That was the word Friday from Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of  football operations. Ortmayer returned late Thursday from Hawaii, where he was  scouting players at the Hula Bowl. He met with Lynn and other Charger assistant  coaches Friday.  </P> <P> "Yes, we would hate to lose Ron Lynn to the Raiders," Ortmayer said. "And I  believe he won't get away without our knowledge."  </P> <P> Ortmayer said he has an understanding with Lynn that Lynn won't accept a  position with the Raiders without giving Ortmayer a chance to counter.  </P> <P> Lynn had preliminary talks with Raider Coach Mike Shanahan this week about the  Raider defensive coordinator job, which became vacant recently when Charlie  Sumner was fired.  </P> <P> Lynn also is a strong candidate for the Chargers' head coaching job, which  opened up when owner Alex Spanos fired Al Saunders Dec. 19. But Ortmayer said  he hasn't formally interviewed Lynn yet.  </P> <P> Ortmayer reiterated that he won't interview George Seifert, the San Francisco  defensive coordinator, until the 49er season ends. The 49ers play the Bears  Sunday in Chicago for the NFC championship.  </P> <P> Ortmayer also said he has asked permission to talk to two other candidates but  declined to name them. He said his interviewing might start as early as this  weekend.  </P> <P> And, he added, "the timetable for hiring a head coach may move forward (speed  up) as our appetite gets whetted."  </P> <P> Ortmayer also said he is conscious of competition in the job-search market now  that Kansas City has released its coach, Frank Gansz. "That begins to concern  you, yes," Ortmayer said.  </P> <P> But the prospect of losing popular and talented Lynn to the arch-rival Raiders  concerns Ortmayer, a former Raider assistant, much more. The Chargers are still  smarting from the summer trade (and the subsequent negative public fallout)  that sent Pro Bowl offensive lineman Jim Lachey to the Raiders in exchange for  tackle John Clay and running back Napoleon McCallum.  </P> <P> Clay missed most of training camp with a back injury and most of the regular  season with a neck injury. McCallum is in the Navy and might not be available  until 1990.  </P> <P> Ortmayer stopped short of saying the Chargers will retain Lynn at all costs.  Such a statement could tie his hands in any negotiations with Lynn.  </P> <P> Ortmayer wouldn't say how short his list of potential candidates has become.  But three -- UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, former Steeler assistant Tony Dungy and  Redskin assistant Joe Bugel -- are believed to have become longshots where they  once were being more seriously considered.  </P> <P> Former Cleveland Coach Marty Schottenheimer is still very much in the picture  as a potential hire for the Saunders' vacancy.  </P></p>

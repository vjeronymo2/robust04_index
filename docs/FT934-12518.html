			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Telekom hangs on for sell-off call - The German group's privatisation faces political hurdles Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom (DT), is generally unflappable. But he talks in almost apocalyptic terms about the privatisation of Germany's state-owned telecommunications company. 'It is five to midnight,' he says. His fear is that the interminable political debate on privatisation could delay the process until well beyond next year's 19 federal and state elections. That, he says, would severely hamper DT in its attempt to become a first division competitor in and beyond Europe's liberalising telecoms markets. Even in its home market, DT faces unprecedented competition. The company will lose its monopoly on ordinary telephone services in January 1998, when the European Community opens up national telecommunications markets to competition. It already faces competition in the high-growth satellite and mobile markets. Two years ago, Mannesmann, the industrial group, was granted a licence to operate a second national cellular phone network in competition with DT's. It now has a 50 per cent market share. The Brussels deadline gives DT five years to become competitive, but Mr Ricke is anxious to get the privatisation trauma over long before then. So is Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, which has been pressing for a sale for the past two years. However, privatisation requires a constitutional amendment; and to achieve the required two-thirds majority, the support of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) is needed. Most SPD leaders are not opposed to privatisation in principle. They appreciate the 1998 deadline, and the need for DT to be able to raise funds on the stock market in order to continue its large investment in eastern Germany. However, the SPD wants to retain significant state controls over a privatised DT. As a compromise, the government has agreed to create a holding company in which it will keep a majority stake until full EC liberalisation. But before even partial privatisation can proceed, government and opposition have large differences to settle over how much managerial influence the holding company will be granted. The government has drafted a 1,000-page privatisation bill, which is the subject of negotiations between the government and SPD. The bill is reported to give only a minor role to the holding company. Ministers argue that in order to achieve the objectives of privatisation, DT must have sufficient managerial freedom to make it attractive to investors. Much depends on the line taken by hard-liners in the SPD leadership. Mr Ricke hopes that, once the privatisation bill is adopted, the company will be able to sell a first tranche of shares worth between DM10bn and DM15bn (Dollars 6.25bn-Dollars 9.37bn) on the stock market in 1996. He says that delay will have 'fatal consequences', for three reasons. The company needs to raise cash to reduce its DM100bn debt and continue its DM60bn investment programme in eastern Germany. A privatised DT will be freer to forge international alliances, now de rigueur in the industry. DT needs privatisation to push through cost-cutting measures. Mr Ricke stresses that liberalisation will progressively undermine DT's revenue. He estimates that German tariffs for domestic and international calls, which are among the highest in Europe, must fall by 20 per cent by 1998 if DT is to be competitive. The company is losing DM2bn a year on local calls, which are subsidised by international traffic. With just a 5 per cent drop in overall phone bills, the company stands to loose in 1995 DM2bn-DM3bn in revenues, Mr Ricke claims. Mr Wolfgang Botsch, the post and telecoms minister, has pledged to reinvest all the privatisation proceeds in Deutsche Telekom. As well as lifting investment in the eastern states, this will allow the company to reduce its debt - which cost DM8bn to service last year, and is expected to rise to DM140bn in 1995. Privatisation will allow DT to reinvest more of its own profits, which are depleted because of a legal obligation to cover the deficits of the post and postal bank. The company last year had to transfer DM5bn to the federal government and DM1.5bn to the two sister companies out of its DM6.5bn net profits. DT urgently needs to cut costs. Above all, that means greater productivity from its 230,000 strong workforce. But that will not be easy. More than half of DT's employees are civil servants who enjoy benefits such as life employment and special pension funds. The privileged status of German civil servants is written in the constitution and cannot be modified against their will. Mr Ricke hopes that after privatisation, financial incentives will motivate many of them to retire early or become regular employees. But such plans are regarded with suspicion by the 550,000-strong Post Trade Union, which has strong links with the SPD. The union and SPD accept DT will have to stop subsidising the post and postal bank and become an independent shareholders' entity. But they still have two demands. They want the constitution to specify the duty of a private DT to service all parts of Germany, regardless of the population density. The post ministry maintains this is a regulatory matter, not a constitutional one. The union wants to retain some influence over DT's management. It wants voting rights on important issues such as wage settlements and redundancies, and is particularly afraid of Mr Ricke's desire to slash 30,000 jobs by 2000. DT contends any such restraint will simply slow down the pace of change, to the detriment of all DT employees. DT managers want the freedom to take risks in the global market. A DT-led consortium is the front runner to become strategic partner in the privatisation of Matav, the Hungary state telecoms operator. But in general, argues Mr Klaus Grewlich, DT's director for international affairs, foreign partners are looking for a private company free from state interference. Government and opposition risk clashing on such issues throughout the autumn as they finalise the privatisation bill. If no compromise is reached soon, it is highly unlikely the current 1996 privatisation date can be kept. This is the second in a series on the privatisation of Europe's state telecommunications operators. The first appeared on October 11; the third appears on Thursday.</p>

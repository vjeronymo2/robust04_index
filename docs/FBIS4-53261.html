			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By NODONG SINMUN reporter Kim Kyong-chun] </F>   [Text] A children's food processing unit has newly been  established at Sinyang Food Processing Plant under the great  love and consideration of the great leader and our party, and is  now producing various food for children.    All kinds of children's food produced by the plant --  including rice powder, vegetable powder, and tangle powder --  are good, and powdered bean milk is better than anything else.  The plant has prepared excellent processing lines with its own  strength and technology.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il noted: "By vigorously  carrying out the technological revolution, the light industry  sector should remodel production facilities after a modern  style, modernize equipment, make them high-speed, and mechanize  and automatize processing lines."    When the question on providing children with bean milk was  raised, Sinyang County began to build a facility for producing  bean milk at the county's food processing plant without  hesitation.    With the desire to timely embody the great leader and the  party's great love and consideration for children, functionaries  at the plant tried to find a way to build a modern facility for  producing bean milk.    The county's party committee intensified the party-oriented  guidance to prepare a modern bean milk production base at the  food processing plant in accordance with the party's intention,  by mobilizing functionaries and technicians at the local  industry sector of the county.    Food scientists engaged in light industrial scientific  research came to the plant to render their active technological  support in preparing the bean milk production facility.  Scientists, functionaries of the county, functionaries and  workers of the plant, technicians, and three revolutions team  members cooperated together in studying and testing, and  completed bean milk processing lines one by one, displaying all  their strength and wisdom.    They finally succeeded in producing quality powdered bean  milk after repeated research and tests.    This processing line can be easily introduced into any  plant.  The production process is not complicated, but simple.    The plant has excellently built these processing lines with  its own strength with the scientists' active cooperation, and is  now able to supply quality powdered bean milk to day nurseries  and kindergartens, which give children powdered bean milk mixed  with water. Nurseries and kindergartens say they can economize  labor and traffic expenses since it is easy to transport and  preserve powdered bean milk. Above all, this food is good for  children's health since it is digestible, as well as tasty,  because it is fermented by milk bacillus.</p>

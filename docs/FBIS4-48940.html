			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Beijing, 30 Apr (XINHUA) -- Facing the  situation in which the audio and video publications market is in  disorder and illegal copying and pirating continues despite  repeated bannings, the more than 60 members of the China Audio  and Video Publications Exchange Association, who produce audio  and video publications, recently joined forces in drawing up the  "Convention on Protecting the Copyright of Audio and Video  Publications" to protect audio and video publications producers'  legitimate rights and interests and to crack down on the very  rampant illegal copying and pirating of audio and video  publications.    The "Convention" stipulates: All convention signatories  pledge to exemplarily comply with all relevant state regulations  on protecting copyrights and will boycott all activities that  infringe on the rights and interests of audio and video  publications producers. All signatories are naturally agents  for protecting copyrights and give full authorization to other  signatories in investigating pirating, illegally copying,  counterfeiting identification marks, selling counterfeit  publications, and other activities infringing on signatories'  rights that take place in their locale. The convention is the  first of its kind of China's audio and video publications  industry. [passage omitted]    It has been learned that the China Audio and Video  Publications Exchange Association is China's first mass  organization dealing with the audio and video business. The  organization primarily devotes its efforts to protecting  copyrights of audio and video publications and to conducting  exchanges between the audio and video industry and the film and  television industry, as well as exchanges with units outside the  country, to bring about common improvements, to improve the  quality of China's audio and video publications, and to purify  the country's audio and video publications market.</p>

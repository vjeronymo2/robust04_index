The Islamic Republic of  Iran is well aware of the sources of such information.    The embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran would like to  stress once again its neutral position regarding the Karabakh  conflict and strictly rejects such baseless declarations which  are aiming to aggravate the crisis and therefore to  internationalize the conflict.    The Islamic Republic of Iran is consistent in its external  policy and is trying to support the peace course from the very  beginning of the Karabakh conflict. Meanwhile it keeps the  right to take strict measures if any of the conflicting sides  violates the borders of the republic.    The Islamic Republic of Iran considered one of the main  topics of its external policy to be in friendly relations with  all its neighbors including the Republic of Armenia. The people  of Armenia and Iran have a good history of friendship and  coexistence. By this very reason after the official relations  between the two countries have been restored, the Islamic  Republic of Iran has been taking all efforts to further improve  these links and relations. Therefore the provocative news of  this kind based on the principle of separating and ruling are  will not create any obstacles in the relations between the two  countries.</p>

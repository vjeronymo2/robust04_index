			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Appeals Run Out for Hoiles: The state Supreme Court rejected an appeal from  dissident Freedom Newspapers shareholder Harry H. Hoiles, ending years of  litigation against his sister's and his late brother's families to break up the  Irvine media concern by taking one-third of its assets. The court's unanimous  decision keeps intact previous rulings against Hoiles, who had claimed that he  was entitled to his share after the majority reneged on a promise to make him  Freedom's chief executive.  </P> <P> The majority argued that he proved himself incapable of running the firm and  was entitled only to the value of his minority stake, not to actual assets. The  firm owns the Orange County Register, 26 smaller dailies, 25 weeklies and five  television stations.  </P></p>

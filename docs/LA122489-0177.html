			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT;  </P> <P> THE TASTE MAKERS;  </P> <P> PRESENTING THE BIG PLAYERS AND MAJOR IDEAS THAT -- FOR BETTER OR WORSE --  SHAPED THE 1980S. THIS IS CALENDAR'S FIFTH ANNUAL TASTE MAKERS REPORT, EXPANDED  THIS TIME TO COVER THE LAST 10 YEARS IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: SHOW BUSINESS  EXECS, FILM PRODUCERS, FILM DIRECTORS AND WRITERS, STAGE, TV, MUSIC, DANCE, POP  MUSIC, JAZZ, COMEDY, RADIO, ART AND RESTAURANTS.;  </P> <P> DANCE;  </P> <P> MIKHAIL BARYSHNIKOV  </P> <P> Using ballet as his launching pad, this restlessly adventurous artist (now 41)  redefined dance-star versatility in the '80s through his involvement in movies,  television and, finally, the legitimate (non-dance) stage -- and by testing  himself against more movement idioms than seemed possible or even wise.  </P> <P> From Martha Graham modernism in the theater to the finale of "A Chorus Line" on  TV, and from the Red-baiting melodrama of the "White Nights" movie hit to the  periodic reminders that this was the greatest Albrecht of our lives,  Baryshnikov triumphed.  </P> <P> Even his failures loomed large: the sexual and directorial inadequacies that  Gelsey Kirkland detailed in her best-selling book "Dancing on My Grave" and the  grandiose image-mongering of the movie "Dancers," with its ads showing  Baryshnikov and his filmic love interest, Julie Kent, in roughly the same  size-ratio as King Kong and Fay Wray.  </P> <P> Barynishikov influenced tastes, all right, but not always positively. By  example and instruction he undoubtedly upgraded the standard of classical  dancing at American Ballet Theatre during his time as director. However, in his  regime the company also grew increasingly irresponsible toward classical  choreography. Indeed, Baryshnikov's ABT became a source of fake antiques, with  his recent "Swan Lake" typifying the patchwork of styles at its most ruinous.  </P> <P> Finally, as a leader and the most visible personality in dance, couldn't  Baryshnikov have done a lot more, a lot sooner, to combat the dance world's  widespread denial concerning both drug abuse and the AIDS crisis?  </P> <P> The Taste Makers project was edited by David Fox, assistant Sunday Calendar  editor.

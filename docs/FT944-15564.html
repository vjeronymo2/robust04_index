			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Atomic weapons plant safety standards attacked Safety standards at the Atomic Weapons authority were criticised yesterday by the government's Health and Safety Executive. A 16-strong team of inspectors highlighted 65 areas of concern about safety at four sites, with 19 points identified as priorities. The group's review of health and management arrangements at Aldermaston, Burghfield, Cardiff and Foulness was announced in May last year. The inspectors called on Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, to remove the establishment's immunity from licensing. They said that doing so would provide additional controls. The Ministry of Defence, which brought in Hunting-BRAE as management contractors to run the sites last year, said it would examine this closely. It accepted all the other recommendations. However, Mr John Rimington, the health and safety group's director-general, said: 'I must make clear our judgment, for the time being, that parts of the plant most critical to safety are adequately safe by the standards we apply to hazardous plant. The team found much to praise both in the attitudes and actions of the management.' The 19 priority areas include: Production of an up-to-date instruction for the system which prevents high-radiation events. Facilities for the examination of drummed intermediate-level waste and a waste-management strategy. Work is already under way on the 19 main points, and the establishment must respond within 12 months to the other 46 recommendations.

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Survey of Mid Glamorgan (4): Valleys' blurred vision - Anthony Moreton follows the progress of Lord Walker's initiative AMONG politicians it has become something of a tradition in Wales that St David's Day should be celebrated with a package of economic and political goodies for the principality. Mr David Hunt, the former Welsh Secretary, did not disappoint his expectant audience on March 1. The Valleys Programme was launched five years ago in the Rhondda by his predecessor, now Lord Walker, to regenerate what was described as Wales's only inner-city-type problem area. Now it was to be extended. Precise details of how that was to be done were to come later. For Lord Walker, the consummate political public-relations man, the programme was a vehicle to breathe life into an area of Wales that had suffered unduly from the rundown of structural industry, especially coal. An invited audience was bemused when Walker outlined a vision in which south Wales would, within a recognisable time, become one of the most prosperous parts of Britain. That Walker renaissance has still to occur. But if cynics and critics ask what precisely has happened the government can point to an inflow of investment and jobs, environmental changes and new town-centre schemes. The valleys, as envisaged by both Walker and Hunt, are wider than the county of Mid Glamorgan, although it remains at the heart of the initiative. 'The important thing about the scheme,' says one former civil servant now leading a quango, 'is that it focused attention on a part of Wales that had never received its due share of support. 'It is no coincidence, for instance, that private contractors such as Redrow, Bailey and Barratt are now building houses for sale in areas such as the Rhondda and Merthyr Tydfil where they would never have ventured before. This may be a small example but it could be multiplied as the programme begins to take effect.' Tony Roberts, chief executive of Cynon Valley council, concurs. 'The programme has put attention firmly on the valleys, which is very much to their benefit.' Lord Walker's plan was to boost advance factory building by the Welsh Development Agency, speed up the clearance of derelict land, increase urban aid, support the arts and tourism and improve 32,000 houses, as well as the health services. The eye-catching statistic, though, was unemployment. He prophesied that it would drop from 37,000 to about 12,000. But other figures were almost as revolutionary: public investment of Pounds 500m in economic and social activities, leading to a private sector injection of Pounds 1bn. Paradoxically, the modern printing company where Lord Walker chose to make his announcement has fallen on hard times, a victim of the recession he was not to foresee. Generally, though, the forecasts have been achieved. Last month David Hunt opened a car door-panel factory in Merthyr owned jointly by Japanese and French concerns. Ford has spent large sums at its engine plant in Bridgend and spark-plug factory in Treforest; EMMS, an American company, has invested Pounds 272m at Caerphilly; other investment has come from the US, Germany, Singapore and South Korea. Mr Hunt said recently Pounds 780m has been invested since the programme was launched, 2.6m sq ft of industrial space has been built, more than 2,000 acres of derelict land cleared and Pounds 700m of private investment attracted. Within Mid Glamorgan, more than Pounds 64m has been spent on new or better roads, according to Hugh Thomas, the county's chief executive. Passenger railway services have been improved, 100 acres of derelict land reclaimed last year and a tourist attraction developed at the Rhondda Heritage Park on the site of the former Lewis Merthyr colliery. Both government and county point to a commendable record, more commendable still given the depth of the recession. Cynon Valley's Tony Roberts believes the Valleys Programme has not only put a spotlight on the area but also 'underpinned the need for a partnership in getting things moving. The way in which everyone has worked together for the benefit of the community - government, local authorities, tourist board, Welsh Development Agency, local enterprise agencies - is a model for the rest of the country,' he says. He concedes that the programme's beneficial effects 'have been hijacked by the recession'. Any appraisal of results must take that recession into account, he says. Even so, solid progress has been made. Walker's vision of unemployment down to 12,000 remains a long way off. The number out of work in April in Mid Glamorgan was 26,704, which suggests there has only been a slight improvement on 37,000 in the whole area in 1988. But David Hunt has said: 'There are over 10,000 people working in the valleys who would be unemployed if the area had followed the national trend'. Others are more critical. Labour's Welsh spokesman, Ron Davies, says that 'unless the Valleys Programme is replaced by a more positive scheme of investment in jobs, manufacturing industry and community regeneration, we shall fail to break the cycle of deprivation and under-achievement in the area. Valley communities will continue to decline.' The failure of the Walker-Hunt scheme, he says, is that while the valleys may be greener 'no foundations have been built for durable local economies'. Better transport services are needed, improved education and training systems, an innovation centre at the University of Glamorgan, one-stop shops set up for small business development and a greater integration of the valleys' industrial base with that of south Wales. One outside commentator, Dr Kevin Morgan, of University College, Cardiff, believes 'the social and economic plight of parts of the valleys is as acute as ever and a series of new and bolder initiatives is needed to reinforce the momentum.' The programme, which he calls 'a necessary initiative,' is ' not sufficient to regenerate the area, given current funding'. But the programme has had positive effects. 'It has placed the political spotlight on the valleys and nourished the principle of partnership.' This is one of the keys to social and economic regeneration, he says. Tony Roberts agrees, saying: 'The future lies not just in the 'positive partnership' between everyone involved in the health of the valleys, as advocated by the secretary of state, but in a equal partnership. This means adequate funding for all the authorities.'</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 25  January 1994 on page 4 reports that the Ministry of Economy and  Development (Mede) has opened a deregulation office to reduce  red tape based on input from businessmen to facilitate the  distribution of goods. For example, representatives of the  Cristal biscuit factory complained that the Ministry of  Agriculture and Livestock required an export certificate which  was not required by the country to which their products are  exported, while fishing industry representatives are seeking to  abolish permits required for exports to the United States, which  does not require a similar document, according to the article.  Mede Vice Minister Enrique Brenes explains that, in addition to  eliminating trade barriers, the office is sponsoring training  seminars for entrepreneurs.</p>

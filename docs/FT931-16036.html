			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Thirty killed in Bombay violence AT LEAST 30 people were killed and 120 hurt in Bombay as the commercial capital of India reeled under communal violence for a fourth consecutive day, writes Shiraz Sidhva from New Delhi. Mobs set ablaze a cluster of tenements in the north-western suburb of Jogeshwari yesterday, burning alive at least 11 people, including three women, after a tense night in which police opened fire in four areas to disperse rioting mobs. Police said at least eight people succumbed to stab wounds in hospital after street clashes between Hindus and Moslems which began on Tuesday. This week's tension is a fall-out from the communal violence that brought Bombay to a halt for over a week in December with over 300 dead, after Hindu militants destroyed an ancient mosque in Ayodhya on December 6.</p>

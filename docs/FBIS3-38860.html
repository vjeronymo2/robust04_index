Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko said although his  country supports the idea behind the Partnership programme he  did not feel it would "strengthen the security in Europe but, on  the contrary, might throw the situation off balance."    "We consider the cooperation in the framework of the  Partnership as a street with two-way traffic," he added in a  speech to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    "On the one hand, we must adapt ourselves to the NATO  standards and contribute to the NATO's activities and on the  other hand, we feel that finally NATO must inevitably change its  nature in the course of cooperation with the partners."    In addition to Ukraine, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia  and Hungary have also signed on to the Partnership deal which  provides for wider military cooperation with former Soviet bloc  countries but stops short of offering them, at least  immediately, full NATO membership.    Sergio Silvio Balanzino, NATO's deputy secretary general,  said that "by signing this document today, you (Ukraine)  indicate the importance you attach to the goal we all share  through such cooperation.    "Most of all it is a recognition that in today's world, the  benefits of independence can only be enjoyed and safeguarded  through cooperation with others."</p>

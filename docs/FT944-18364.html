			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Observer: Flight path Passengers on British Airways Boeing 757s may notice the quaint manner in which the craft are named after British castles. Watch out for the one named after Winchester Castle - it's quite a relic as Oliver Cromwell destroyed it in 1645. The castle that is, not the plane.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>   [Text] On February 4, leader of the Republican Party of  Crimea Yuriy Meshkov was sworn in as Crimea's first president.  In January, Interfax-Exclusive acquainted the reader with Yuriy  Meshkov as a candidate to the presidential post. Political  scientists believe that Meshkov's pro-Russian position may  complicated relations between Moscow and Kiev. Moreover, some  analysts predict that Crimea may become a second Karabakh.  Interfax correspondent Sergey Safronov talks with Yuriy Meshkov.    IF: Some assert that the forthcoming referendum on Crimea's  independence is the main element of your policy.    MESHKOV: The main aspect of my policy is Crimea's  independence. Independence alone will allow us to solve our  economic problems. The results of the presidential elections  confirmed the population's orientation to economic, cultural and  other links with Russia, and to a union with Russia. As to the  referendum, there is a law on the referendum which must be  observed.    IF: Do you mean economic aspects when you talk about  Crimea's  independence?    MESHKOV: Economy comes first. The forthcoming referendum is  expected to put Crimea's economic independence on a juridical  footing.    IF: Do you favor Crimea's integration with Russia or  Crimea's  complete independence?    MESHKOV: Our goal is an independent and self-sufficient  Crimea. It will not be isolated from the CIS, however, but be a  full-fledged member of a single economic system.    IF: Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko told Interfax  recently that Ukraine was planning to depart from the Massandra  agreements on the Black Sea Fleet and get back to the Yalta  agreements. What is actually meant here is Kiev's refusal to  pass the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia. What  would you say about this?    MESHKOV: This is not the first time Kiev violates the  international principle of observance of agreements. Agreement  must be implemented, said the Roman law more than 2000 years  ago. Ukraine's position has nothing to do with the principles  and norms of international law. The Black Sea Fleet must be  indivisible, belong to Russia and be based in Sevastopol which  is an inalienable part of the Republic of Crimea.    IF: Suppose the Black Sea Fleet will belong to Russia.  Simferopol may claim a compensation for the utilization of the  fleet's infrastructure. What will relations be like between the  Crimean authorities and the Black Sea Fleet?    MESHKOV: I hope these relations will be good and either side  will observe its own interests.    IF: Moscow anxiously followed both rounds of presidential  elections in Crimea. How do you assess Kiev's official reaction  to your success and the defeat of the Crimean parliament speaker  Nikolai Bagrov?    MESHKOV: How can one respond to almost unanimous results?  (Last Friday the Crimean president had talks in Kiev with  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. To quote Meshkov, the  talks were sincere and gave a fresh impetus to Crimean-Ukrainian  relations. "I returned to Simferopol with a shield," said  Meshkov. Journalists note, however, that Meshkov looked  depressed after the talks -- Interfax).    IF: Some argue that the elections in Crimea were illegal,  because they were at variance with the Ukrainian constitution,  so their results might be challenged. Do you think such a  situation may evolve into open military confrontation?    MESHKOV: No, it can't. One may say whatever one chooses, but  no one can cancel the more than a million votes cast for the  president. The elections were juridically grounded and no one  should anticipate any unreasonable steps on the part of Kiev.    IF: Crimea is faced with many problems, including the  problem  of the Crimean Tatars. How are you going to tackle it?    MESHKOV: We shall seek a solution of this problem on the  basis of international law and the laws of the Republic of  Crimea. The material damage inflicted on the citizens of the  Republic of Crimea must be compensated. The government must do  so by all means and Simferopol will provide such guarantees.  However, in tackling this problem Crimea must act in close  cooperation with Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan (most of the  Crimean Tatars banished from Crimea in 1944 live in Uzbekistan  -- Interfax).    IF: What would you say about the white Lincoln which a  Crimean billionaire promised to give you?    MESHKOV: If he keeps the promise which he gave before the  elections, when nobody knew who would become president, I will  not consider this limo as something given to a specific person.  I don't think I'll use it very often. But I might make use of  it to welcome Leonid Kravchuk or Boris Yeltsin here in Crimea.</p>

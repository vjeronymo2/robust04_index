A Slavyanka correspondent asked (Igor  Vlasov), head of the public relations sector of the committee  for (?conditional) problems about chemical and biological  weapons under the Russian president. He said:    [Begin (Vlasov) recording] Russia inherited chemical weapons  from the former USSR as follows: 40,000 [metric] tonnes of  toxic substances, including 32,200 tonnes of organophosphoric  toxic substances stored in aviation, missile, and artillery  charges; and 7,700 tonnes of old skin-sensitive toxic substances  dating back to World War I, that is, mustard gas, lewisite, and  their mixtures. They are stored in boxes, containers,  reservoirs, and so on.    Russia is not destroying chemical weapons because it has no  industrial facilities for utilizing or destroying chemical  weapons.

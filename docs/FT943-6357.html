			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Levers hold up Railtrack's ambitions: The company can only go so far in opening lines during the strike Railtrack's efforts to open longer sections of the British railway network on strike days seem set to slow down as the company reaches the limits of signalling technology. By concentrating staff at the most modern computer-controlled signalboxes Railtrack has in recent weeks managed to open up sections of track way out of proportion to the number of signalworkers employed. At first sight the numbers are hard to credit. Just 600 signalling staff - 13 per cent of the normal workforce of 4,600 - allowed Railtrack to open up 40 per cent of its network in last week's 24-hour strike. But unless striking members of the RMT transport union return to work in large numbers Railtrack will face serious problems in opening up its more labour-intensive lever-operated signal boxes. Railtrack has inherited three generations of railway signalling technology from British Rail. No fewer than 951 of the 1,125 signalboxes on the railway's 10,000-mile network date from the steam age. They need a signalman to pull a lever to change the signal. A further 165 are panel boxes introduced in the 1960s. These consist of large display panels where a red light records the passage of a train along the track and where the signalling staff push buttons to operate the signals. The latest signalling boxes are known as integrated electronic control centres. Signals are controlled by computer, although the signal worker can override the computer if a train breaks down or if there is any other disruption to the normal schedule. Railtrack has only nine of these control centres but they control extensive lengths of track. Railtrack has managed to open a disproportionately large part of its network by three main methods. It has allocated its signalling staff to the more modern electronic and panel boxes where they control greater lengths of track. Railtrack's Great Western zone, which operates 1,370 miles of track from London Paddington to the West Country and south Wales, has only eight panel boxes on the 225 miles from London to Plymouth but 11 manual boxes on the 80 miles from Plymouth to Penzance. It has concentrated its efforts on the panel boxes and maintained a 'near normal' mainline service down to Plymouth but no trains onwards to Penzance on strike days. This approach is typical of Railtrack zones around the country. They have shut down branch lines which depend on the manual boxes and kept open the main routes. Cutting out the branch line services simplifies the railway timetable and means fewer trains crossing over the main lines. Secondly, by reducing the frequency of many of its services there are greater intervals between trains so a smaller number of signalling staff can run the railway safely. Finally, although Railtrack says it has been running 40 per cent of its network, this claim is only true if it is applied to peak and daytime operations. Services are generally starting later than normal and closing earlier in the evening, so fewer signalworkers are needed on shift duty. The uneven distribution of the new and old technology boxes around the country has sometimes prevented Railtrack from opening up through routes. The east coast main line linking London King's Cross with Edinburgh has electronic control centres at Newcastle upon Tyne and York and panel boxes at King's Cross, Peterborough and Doncaster. But the middle stretch of line between Peterborough and Doncaster has a number of level crossings controlled by manual boxes. For the first 10 weeks of the strike Railtrack could open the northern and southern sections of the line but was unable to provide a through service. As BR has modernised its network it has brought in more electronic control centres. The Chiltern line is controlled from one box at London Marylebone and has maintained a near normal service. In the longer term, Railtrack is looking to bring in even more advanced technology which will do away with trackside signals and the wires which link them. Drivers will have in-cab display panels linked by radio to control centres telling them the state of the track ahead. The 550-mile west coast main line, to be modernised over the next few years, could be controlled by one signal box. The traditional signal worker seems set to go the same way as the fireman who stoked the steam engine.</p>

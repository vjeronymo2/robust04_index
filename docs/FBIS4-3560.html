			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa by unidentified </F> correspondents on "The World on the Air" program in Beijing on  21 April--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] After the [signing] of the  agreement, we meet now with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. This is  a happy occasion. Everyone is so upbeat. What will the  Egyptian people gain from the Egyptian-Chinese friendship?    [Musa] The talks were held in an excellent atmosphere of  cooperation, friendship, and trust. Egypt and China are going  through the same phase of economic development. In addition,  the two countries share a common view of a number of  international developments and problems.    We discussed international problems of common concern. We  went into detail on various problems in the Arab world, Asia,  Africa, and other parts of the world. We also discussed GATT  and the current international economic situation.    We then discussed the issue of economic development and  talked about the difficulties and successes experienced by the  two countries. We reviewed ways of bolstering bilateral  economic ties. We discussed investment opportunities in Egypt  and the advantages of using the Egyptian tax-free zones. We  talked about industrial and technical cooperation. We then  signed two agreements concerning investment guarantees and  judicial cooperation, all of which will propel Egyptian-Chinese  relations into wider horizons, particularly considering the  feelings of trust and friendship shared by the leaderships of  both countries.    President Mubarak, at the end of the talks, invited the  Chinese president to visit Egypt in the near future. This visit  will take place soon.    Egyptian-Chinese relations should take a high profile, one  that befits their promise. The Egyptian and Chinese  civilizations are very ancient, as old as history itself.  Cooperation between our countries will be fruitful in the  cultural, political, economic, and popular sense of the word.    [Correspondent] Did the leaders hold private talks before  the  delegations met, Your Excellency?    [Musa] The talks began with a private meeting between the  two  leaders followed by a session in which both delegations took  part. Tomorrow I will meet the Chinese foreign minister to  discuss with him a number of matters concerning bilateral  cooperation and political and economic ties.    [Correspondent] Have you discussed [words indistinct] as  Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Musa] Of course, we discussed all of these matters.  President Husni Mubarak, who is the current OAU chairman,  broached a number of African problems, including Somalia and the  situation in South Africa, in view of the progress recently made  in the latter country. We also reviewed the situation in the  Arab world, the peace process, the situation in a number of Arab  countries, the general Arab situation, and several international  problems including Bosnia- Herzegovina.    [Correspondent] Are there any specific topics that President  Mubarak plans to discuss tomorrow with Chinese officials?    [Musa] Yes, the talks will focus on bilateral relations and  economic cooperation. Trade between Egypt and China amounts to  $200 million. We import $140 million worth of goods from China  and export $60 million. Of course, this situation cannot  continue. The private sector should assume its role in this  matter. China is opening up its economy, so are we. Trade and  economy can no longer be shoved under the carpet.    [Correspondent] Thank you.</p>

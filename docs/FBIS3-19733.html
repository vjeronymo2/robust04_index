			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marios Papailia] </F>   [Text] The next target of the Turkish Secret Services could  be Dhimitrios Matafias, former National Guard Chief, who has  been named repeatedly in press reports and special books  published by writers cooperating with the Turkish agencies.    Correspondent Lazaros Mavros revealed this when he spoke for  the Committee for Solidarity with Kurdistan at a news conference  yesterday. Mavros added that the Greek security authorities  have been notified regarding the issue.    Party leaders or representatives attended the news  conference  organized by the Committee for Solidarity with Kurdistan to  denounce Yeoryiadhis' horrible murder and condemn the crime.  They also said that a parliamentary delegation would visit the  UN secretary general to denounce the continuing genocide of the  Kurdish people and Yeoryiadhis' murder.    Dhimitrios Sillouris, secretary general of the DISI  [Democratic Rally], said that with Yeoryiadhis' murder, the  Turks were promoting their beliefs, which do not allow them to  pursue the role of a peacekeeper in the former Yugoslavia. He  also mentioned that the state must improve its security  structure, adding that the murder will constitute the beginning  of a more intense struggle by those who deal with human rights.    Stathis Kittis, secretary general of the DIKO [Democratic  Party], stressed that Theofilos Yeoryiadhis' murder is  undoubtedly the work of Turkish agents who showed in this way  that the Turkish machine will stop at nothing. He added that  this must concern those who deal with our national policy.  Kittis said DIKO believes that we must all support everyone who  fights for their freedom.    In his short address, Andreas Khristou, AKEL [Restorative  Party of the Working People] spokesman, described Yeoryiadhis as  responsible, a fighter, and an ideologist. He added that  Yeoryiadhis gave his life when nationalism is growing and said  we must do much, as a people and as a parliament.    Vasos Lissaridhis, EDEK [United Democratic Union of Cyprus]  chairman, described the murder as a classic example of terrorism  and an insult to dignity, freedom, and democracy. He said:  Theofilos will go down in history as a man who realized the  connection among people who share a common source of danger--the  Turkish regime.    Yado Roz, European Kurdistan Movement representative, called  upon the international common view to resist and condemn the  murders of Kurdish figures and the Turkish regime. Theofilos'  murder and the murders of other members of Kurdish organizations  worldwide clearly show that Turkey insists on taking its dirty  war abroad.    Lakis Pingouras, representing the Committee for Solidarity  with Kurdistan, mentioned that the immediate goal is to try to  get the Kurdish state recognized and to establish the  committee's office here as the official voice of the Kurds in  Cyprus.</p>

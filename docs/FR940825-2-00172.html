The ideal and most competitive projects will constitute a well-reasoned combination of all of these activities. The exchange visits to all partner institutions must be for one month or more with the exception of planning visits which may be for shorter periods. Three-month or one-semester visits are strongly preferred and projects with longer lengths of stay will be more competitive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Acceptable projects will be to either establish new affiliations or to innovate and strengthen existing partnerships, not merely to extend projects previously funded by the College and University Affiliations Program (formerly the ``University Affiliations Program''), other USIA linkage programs or similar linkage programs funded by other U.S. government agencies. Projects for technical or development assistance and feasibility studies to plan affiliations will not be considered. Research projects must include collaboration by researchers from participating institutions and be linked to substantial participation in graduate-level seminars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The competition, as described in the separate section below on geographic area programs, is limited to selected countries and academic disciplines which represent USIA's geographic and academic priorities for the College and University Affiliations Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices drift lower on Opec deal disappointment OIL PRICES drifted lower yesterday after losing ground at the close of the New York market on Monday. North Sea Brent crude for January delivery was down 50 cents at Dollars 18.60 a barrel in London trading. Oil traders say the price weakness reflects the market's disillusion with the agreement reached at last week's meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 'The market took a good look at this agreement and decided it didn't add up to much,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, head of energy trading at Smith Barney in London. Market traders believe Opec's agreement, which does little more than formalise existing production levels, does not go far enough to support prices. The planned production cuts should take overall oil output to 24.58 barrels a day from November's production of about 25m b/d. But the ceiling does not include a production level for Ecuador, which has left the organisation. Without Ecuador, the organisation was pumping at a rate of 24.7m b/d which implies a cut of just over 100,000 b/d. Nevertheless, the meeting did allocate production quotas to individual members without official dissent. This is the first time this has happened since the Gulf war and was meant to avert a price collapse. 'To Opec watchers this looks constructive, but the market is looking for something more,' one trader at an international oil company said. At the same time, demand for oil products is weak in Europe and North America as the weather remains unseasonally warm. Refining margins have been squeezed to the level where it is becoming difficult to make a profit in the downstream sector. Mr Mehdi Varzi, industry analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London estimates that European refining margins for Brent crude are at Dollars 1.70 a barrel from a high of almost Dollars 2.50 a barrel October to November. Some commentators believe that the Brent price will remain stuck in a range from Dollars 18.50 to Dollars 19.50 a barrel until the end of the year unless colder winter weather provides a boost. Fina Italiana, the Italian subsidiary of Belgium's Petrofina, has confirmed an encouraging oil find in southern Italy near Potenza, and is seeking a concession to exploit the discovery, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The find is in a step-out well from an initial discovery made in 1989. It is at a depth of over 800 metres and has a flow rate of up to 3,470 b/d. Fina is operating in partnership with Lasmo and Enterprise Oil of the UK, the latter having a total stake of 44 per cent in the venture. Italy imports 73m tonnes of oil a year to complement modest local production, including gas, equivalent to 4.3m tonnes. ENI, the state oil concern, has already two exploration wells in the same area.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDIA TREATMENT OF THE 'HILARY IN HIDING' CASE  </P> <P> Re "Trail of Abuse in the Hilary Custody Case," by Howard Rosenberg (April 24),  about the dispute between Dr. Elizabeth Morgan and her former husband, Dr. Eric  Foretich:  </P> <P> Rosenberg claims this "may be the most stunning case of abuse by the media. . .  ." He himself has made a contribution to that abuse.  </P> <P> Nowhere does he address the central issue -- the (alleged) sexual molestation  of 7-year-old Hilary.  </P> <P> Morgan was forced to take her case to the media.  </P> <P> Rosenberg inadvertently demonstrates why. While pooh-poohing the claims of  sexual abuse by saying no court has upheld the allegation, he ignores that a  court barred Foretich from seeing another daughter (from a previous marriage)  after accusations of sexual molestation arose and he ignores other court  findings in this area.  </P> <P> I know of no woman who would have acted differently from Morgan in going  public.  </P> <P> MEGAN CALLAWAY, Los Angeles  </P></p>

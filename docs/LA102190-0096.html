			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HERSCHEL WALKER AND VIKINGS CRASHING AND BURNING TOGETHER  </P> <P> Expensively attired in a double-breasted gray sports jacket, black slacks,  white shirt and silk tie, Herschel Walker stood in the middle of the visitors'  locker room Monday night at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia and tried to make  sense of his great fall from grace. But his flawless appearance belied the  confusion he felt inside.  </P> <P> At first, Walker denied he was shaken by the poorest performance of his career,  but then, he changed his mind. "I did feel shaken," Walker said. "I wasn't  really stable. That wasn't the Herschel I know."  </P> <P> For the first time in the career of Herschel Walker -- high school sensation  from Wrightsville, Ga., Heisman Trophy winner at the University of Georgia,  U.S. Football League pioneer with the New Jersey Generals after leaving school  a year early, feature back with America's Team and centerpiece of a blockbuster  deal that sent him from the Dallas Cowboys to the Minnesota Vikings Oct. 12,  1989 -- he had been benched.  </P> <P> Walker carried three times for three yards, caught two passes for 25 yards,  lost two fumbles, was ruled down before a third apparent fumble and seemed to  be playing in a fog before Coach Jerry Burns replaced him on offense in the  third quarter with Allen Rice, which is like pulling Lou Gehrig to put in Wally  Pipp. Walker's humiliation and embarrassment were shared by all the Vikings  after they blew a nine-point fourth-quarter lead in a 32-24 loss to the  Philadelphia Eagles that left them reeling with a 1-5 record.  </P> <P> Fair or not, the focus was on Walker and the deal that was supposed to  transform the Vikings into Super Bowl champions but has sent them in the other  direction. The Vikings are 8-10 since the trade and wondering why, but no one  is more confused than Walker.  </P> <P> He denied being a victim of mental burnout, yet, he spoke of the need to  "re-energize, settle down, get myself together and relax." He blamed all the  fumbles on his failure to maintain concentration. "I've got to start fresh from  the beginning," Walker said. "It's almost like I've got to re-train myself." A  moment later, he added, "With my type of physical training and mental training,  maybe I've overworked myself. I need to slack off and rest a bit."  </P> <P> Walker's conflicting feelings mirror those of his employers. The trade that  brought Walker to the Vikings was forced on the coaches and players by  executive vice president and general manager Mike Lynn, who gave up five  players and seven high draft picks for what he believed was the player who  could take the Vikings to the Super Bowl. Walker rushed for 148 yards in his  first game as a Viking and has not been over 100 yards since because the  coaching staff decided it was best to work him into the Vikings' offense rather  than rebuild the offense around Walker.  </P> <P> "Herschel has never given our team the chemistry we hoped he would," said Bob  Hollway, the Vikings' assistant general manager for football. Hollway and the  offensive coaches have analyzed Walker's play with both the Vikings and Cowboys  in an effort to boost his production but haven't found the solution.  </P> <P> "It's very definitely a mystery," Hollway said. "The only thing I can say is  there is a wall for running backs. Maybe he's hit that wall. He did all the  ball-carrying at Georgia, the USFL and Dallas. Maybe he was close to the limit  when he came to us."  </P> <P> The idea that Walker is physically spent at the age of 28 doesn't have much  support around the league. He showed no signs of deterioration last season.  </P> <P> "Walker definitely has to get in the flow and see how his blockers are coming  off the ball," said one National Football League general manager. "He can't  carry it six times and catch six passes and produce big plays. I know they  think they've tried to adjust, but it's still the Vikings' offense."  </P> <P> The impression Walker created with his Monday night effort is that he has given  up because of the way he has been used by the Vikings. "There's talk he's  packed it in," the general manager said of Walker. "He doesn't have his heart  in playing football. I know he's had some shoulder problems, but he's not being  overused. It's more mental than physical. The guy is used to being on a  pedestal and being a featured back. He isn't that now, and he may have lost  interest."  </P> <P> Certainly, the Vikings' troubles run deeper than just figuring out how to use  Walker. Injuries to quarterback Wade Wilson and defensive tackle Keith Millard  have damaged them badly.  </P> <P> Contract problems and charges of racism last season contributed to Lynn's  decision to send players, coaches and executives to the Pecos River Learning  Center this past spring in New Mexico for what amounted to group therapy.  Everyone took part in a series of climbing and high-wire exercises in which  they were linked together and, thus, dependent on each other for survival. The  symbol each one took home as a reminder of the experience was a carabiner, a  safety device used in climbing that resembles a chain link.  </P> <P> Now, though, it's almost as if Walker and the rest of the Vikings, linked by  their carabiners, are falling together, pulling each other down.  </P> <P> Everything comes back to the Walker trade and Lynn's role in it.  </P> <P> Vikings guard Dave Huffman last week denounced Lynn as a "rat deserting a  sinking ship" when it was announced Lynn is leaving the Vikings as the result  of an ownership dispute to head the World League of American Football. There is  a board meeting scheduled today at which he may be asked to leave immediately.  Lynn did not return phone calls, but a WLAF source said Lynn is expected to  begin his World League duties sometime next week.  </P> <P> The Walker trade is Lynn's legacy, and all the Vikings can do now is live with  the consequences. Rick Fenney, who has been paired with Walker in the  backfield, said, "I don't know what's wrong with the offense. Herschel has  worked hard, but people expect an awful lot from him. We traded a lot for him.  He's played well in the past. I'm not going to make a judgment. It's mystifying  to us why we're having such a bad year."  </P> <P> Walker didn't help matters any by using a day off last week to go to Lake  Placid, N.Y., to qualify for world competition with the U.S. bobsled team. "I  don't think the timing of that showed good judgment," Hollway said. "He's  involved in a lot of different activities. You see some players start to make a  large salary, and all of a sudden, they throttle back because they've got it  made. They forget what got them the large salary."  </P> <P> Despite the Vikings' troubles, Walker always has refrained from criticizing his  coaches, but in the aftermath of his benching, it sounded as though he believes  it's time they take some of the blame for his decline. "They're professional  coaches, and I go out and do what they tell me to do," Walker said. "Everyone  else has to judge for themselves. If you have knowledge of the game, you can  see what I'm doing. Everyone said, 'Herschel is a back who can run the ball.'  I'm not doing that here.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt I feel more pressure on myself, but I can only do what I'm  called on to do, whether that's run a (pass) route or be a decoy."  </P> <P> As a benchwarmer, Herschel Walker can't even do that much for a team that  thought it was one player away from the Super Bowl and now is farther than ever  from that prize.  </P></p>

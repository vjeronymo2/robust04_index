			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Coalition near in Ireland Talks aimed at forming a coalition government in Ireland appear to be making progress, agencies report from Dublin. Acting Prime Minister Albert Reynolds met Labour leader Dick Spring yesterday to assess the talks on a Fianna Fail/Labour alliance. Mr Spring has dropped his demand for a shared premiership. But he is thought to have insisted on high-profile cabinet posts for his party, possibly including the job of foreign minister.</p>

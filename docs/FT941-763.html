			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Pay blamed for shortfall in scientists Industry may soon face a shortfall in well-qualified scientists and engineers because of a decline in their relative pay over the past decade, ministers warned yesterday. The warning came after a survey for the education department showed that the relative pay of private-sector engineers and scientists has fallen since 1980. Mr William Waldegrave, minister for public service and science, said: 'Ultimately, there is nothing I can do to force firms to pay people properly and send the right market signals. If they want to raise quality, pay signals help that.' Mr John Patten, education secretary, said employers had 'some hard questions to answer'. The report was commissioned after last August's results for A-levels - the main examinations for university entrance in England and Wales - showed falls in the number taking science, including a drop of 9.6 per cent in physics. It found that pay for male scientists fell from 15 per cent above the white-collar average in 1980 to 10 per cent last year. In engineering the fall was from 14 per cent to 10 per cent, while computing salaries fell from 11 per cent to only 1 per cent above average. Over the same period, pay for accountants rose from 11 per cent above average in 1980 to 17 per cent in 1993. The report says: 'The trend of relative pay for scientists and engineers over the 1980s is clear: it was falling, albeit erratically.' The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the report. It added that the evidence on pay signals was not strong enough to reach any firm conclusions. Mr Patten will be holding consultations on the report over the next three months. Other findings were that the proportion of school pupils taking A-levels only in science and mathematics fell from 30 per cent in 1984 to 17 per cent in 1993, while those taking only arts subjects rose from 41 per cent to 49 per cent. There had been a marked shift since 1988 toward 16-year-olds taking exams in combined science rather than individual subjects. Independent school pupils were much more likely to take single subjects. Entry standards to higher education were slightly lower than average for sciences, with engineers requiring 20 A-level points (where 10 are awarded for a grade A, and 2 for an E), while the average for all subjects was 21.1. Law required 25.7 and accountancy 22.1. Mr Waldegrave highlighted the fact that the problem was not unique to the UK. He said that France also had problems attracting science undergraduates, while the Japanese government had published a white paper on combating the 'serious problem of undervaluing science and engineering graduates'. The education department's survey of undergraduates also discovered that students were deterred from taking sciences because the courses were 'extremely hard work' and 'too fiddly'.

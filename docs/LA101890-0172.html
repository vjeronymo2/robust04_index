			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> 2 PLEAD GUILTY TO 3 BANK ROBBERIES  </P> <P> Two jobless Ventura men have pleaded guilty to federal bank-robbery charges in  connection with three recent Ventura County bank heists, an FBI official said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Robert Poynter, 31, and Julian Delgado, 29, entered guilty pleas Monday before  U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman for their respective roles in robberies  committed between July 26 and Aug. 22.  </P> <P> Poynter was indicted last month on charges of robbing seven banks in Ventura  and Santa Barbara counties. Under a plea agreement with the U.S. attorney's  office, he admitted robbing three of the banks in exchange for charges being  dropped in the four other cases, said Gary Auer, head of the FBI's Ventura  office. Delgado, his roommate, pleaded guilty to a single count.  </P> <P> The two men were captured Aug. 22 after robbing a Santa Barbara Savings and  Loan branch in Ventura. The FBI and Ventura police tailed the pair to the bank  after staking out their Anacapa Street residence for four days. CHRISTOPHER  PUMMER  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Some Hong Kong  legislators have lashed out at Governor Chris Patten for  sabotaging the Sino-British talks and felt uneasy about the  adoption of the partial reform bill at the Legislative Council  earlier this morning.    Veteran legislator Elsie Tu, who had tabled a motion to  delay  the partial reform bill in the hope that the Sino-British talks  might resume, said that the adoption of the bill means a total  breakdown of the Sino-British talks.    If the Sino-British talks remain stalled, Tu said, the years  between now and 1997 will not be smooth for Hong Kong, because  in a broken family there is inevitably a breakdown in  communication and a lack of co-operation.    "And in a broken family it is the innocent children who  suffer most. The innocent children in this case are the  ordinary people of Hong Kong, the silent majority, who seek  nothing more than to get on with their lives," she added.    Tu's adjourn motion was supported by 23 other legislators,  who described Tu as "courageous," "responsible," "incurably  optimistic" and with a "whole-hearted love for Hong Kong."    The Liberal Party headed by its leader Allen Lee supported  the move on the grounds that a one-month deadline be stipulated.  But some others disagreed with the view.    Philip Wong, who opposed the reform bill, told the  Legislative Council that by tabling bill to the Legislative  Council before any agreement is reached between the Governments  of China and Britain, Chris Patten has placed the Legislative  Council above the two sovereign states, indicating that the  British side had no sincerity to cooperate with China. The  reform bill would mislead local residents, he said.    Another legislator Lau Wong-fat criticized the Hong Kong  authorities for tabling the reform bill without consultation  with the Chinese side. "This action does not tally with the  interests of Hong Kong," he said.    In fact, Lau added, the electoral arrangements, which are to  last only two or three years, would undermine the basis for the  Sino- British cooperation and cause confusion and instability in  Hong Kong in the latter half of the transitional period.    Peggy Lam MBE [member of the Order of the British Empire]  stated that the political reform bill proposed by Governor  Patten in October 1992 has caused the relations between the  Chinese mainland, Britain and Hong Kong to deteriorate and made  local residents feel hopeless.    The Chinese side has time and again said that the  arrangements on the 1994-95 election can be discussed so long as  the British side shows its sincerity. But the Hong Kong  Government unilaterally advanced a reform package in disregard  of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and went on to submit it  to the Legislative Council, thus ditching the last chance for  China and Britain to resume their talks, she said.    It is the Hong Kong authorities that have compelled the  Chinese side to make its own preparations, she added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yermolin: "Federation Council Agrees </F> to 40.6 Trillion Rubles: Upper Chamber of Federal Assembly  Votes in Favor of the 1994 Budget Passed by the State Duma"]    [Text] The evolution in the Federation Council's attitude  to the 1994 draft federal budget law may be roughly  characterized as "no, no, no -- yes!" A categorical "no" rang  out from public platforms, was uttered into journalists'  microphones, and was heard in statements made, above all, by the  Federation Council chairman. "Yes" rang out immediately the  budget just passed by the State Duma reached the Federation  Council.    Let us recall that the members of the Federation Council  were  going to back to the bitter end defense expenditure of 55  trillion and an increase in expenditure items for the regions.  Commenting on the upper chamber's decision, Vladimir Shumeyko  assured people that a compromise had been reached between the  sides. What does this amount to as regards expenditure on  national defense? Let us study carefully the results of the  second and third readings: In both cases you have the figure of  40.6 trillion.    Indeed, there could be no other outcome. Had the Federation  Council started to wage a struggle over the budget, it would  have become obvious to everyone that the senators had assumed  total responsibility for the country's extrabudgetary existence.  Naturally, they had no wish to shoulder this burden. Moreover,  President Yeltsin made it perfectly clear two weeks ago that all  the key budget figures had been agreed with Viktor  Chernomyrdinn, Ivan Rybkin, and Vladimir Shumeyko.    It is pointless to bewail the sickly defense budget now. The  most important thing is to flesh out the intention of the  president, government, and parliamentarians to eliminate the  defense budget deficit by means of extrabudgetary appropriations.    You are prompted to draw the conclusion that there are few  statesmen in our time capable of resisting the temptation to  demonstrate their concern over defense problems. But when it  comes to making a decision, quite different interests prevail.  To be honest, the stance of those who opposed 55 trillion from  the very outset is far more understandable and attractive. But  such people, those who did not break into "defense rhetoric,"  were few in number.</p>

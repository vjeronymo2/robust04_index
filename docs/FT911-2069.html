			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Russia agrees to take over republic's coal mines THE RUSSIAN government has agreed to take over all the coal mines on its territory in the first large-scale transfer of resources from the Union to the republic's authorities. The move is also seen as a precursor to the transfer of the more precious oil and gas reserves. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, signed the agreement yesterday before a crowd of 5,000 in Novokuznetsk, in the Kuzbas coalfield. He called it a 'sign of solidarity' between Russia and the workers, and later told the Tass news agency that 'we take the miners under our guarantee, as it were, and what we promise and guarantee, we shall fulfil'. This means that the Russian budget, already in deficit, must fund a 100 per cent pay rise agreed with the Soviet government as well as overdue investment programmes. The agreement does not yet end the strike, however, as miners' leaders are waiting for the Soviet authorities to sign it. Mr Yeltsin told them he believed the Soviet side would sign this week. The accord, and the crumbling of the strike in the main Kuzbas and Ukrainian Donbas fields, should mean that most pits will be back in production by next week. If the agreements are honoured, it will mean that they will all be under republican control soon. The Donbas pits are already passing to the control of the Ukrainian government, and the Karaganda field is being taken over by Kazakhstan. Mr Yeltsin's agreement appears to limit republican control to the tax mechanism which encourages workers to lease the pits and allows them to sell for hard currency coal above the planned target. Some pits in the Kuzbas have already adopted this system. Mr Yeltsin's trip to the Kuzbas, which ended last night, was also the occasion of some early, and robust, electioneering for his campaign for the Russian presidency. When voices from the crowd at a May Day rally in Novokuznetsk called for the resignation of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, he replied: 'Together we can do that'. Mr Yeltsin and eight other republican leaders last week signed a statement with Mr Gorbachev pledging co-operation, and on Tuesday he exchanged telegrams with the president hoping for a new period of common endeavour. Mr Nikolai Ryzhkov, prime minister for much of the period since 1985, emerged yesterday as the first nationally known challenger to Mr Yeltsin in his race for the Russian presidency. He told the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda that various representatives of enterprises and public organisations had pressed him to stand and that 'if I'm nominated, I'm ready to enter the election campaign'. Mr Ryzhkov resigned last November after a heart attack, to be replaced by Mr Valentin Pavlov. Other suggested candidates include Mr Vadim Bakatin, former interior minister; Mr Alexei Sergeev, a leader of the hardline United Workers Front; Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Liberal party leader; Mr Vladimir Voronin, leader of the Centrist Bloc of Parties; and Mr Leonid Ubozhko, leader of the Conservative party.</p>

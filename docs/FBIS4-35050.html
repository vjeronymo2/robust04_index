			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 23 Jun (NA) -- Cordoba Governor  Eduardo Angeloz has warned that "some provinces are on the brink  of collapse or bankruptcy." Angeloz added that the economic plan  "has started breaking the pillars sustaining it."    "When you start setting strict guidelines limiting  productive  activities or people's activities things start to break down.  People start complaining and you start seeing the possibility of  unrest in many towns and provinces," the governor said.    Angeloz said he is not pointing his arrows directly at  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. The governor believes Cavallo  "cannot feel he owns the country. He cannot dictate rules for  others simply to follow or be placed on lists under definitions  only he makes."    The governor said the main causes of discontent that might  result in "social upheavals" are produced mainly by "the growing  trade balance deficit, the transfer to the nation of bankrupted  education centers and health systems, and the national  government's indifference to producer needs."    "People perceive that their personal situation is not  improving, that the country is not growing, and notice that the  social security system has very big holes," Angeloz insisted.    Angeloz protested because the provinces now must administer  their education and health systems "without resources," a  situation that is aggravated "because now the provinces get 44  percent and the nation 56 percent of the 4 billion pesos of  federal income sharing, a situation that is just the opposite of  the situation we had before."    Angeloz expressed doubts that former President Alfonsin had  said that the Radical Party [Radical Civic Union, UCR] will lose  the 1995 election, but just in case he made clear that he does  not share that belief, stressing: "Those who leave the  battlefield, those who do not fight, are leaving an empty space  that others will occupy."    "This will not happen to the UCR. We will fight in all areas  to transform the party and create a government alternative,"  Angeloz promised. He made these remarks during the program "Two  Voices" that is broadcast on cable television.</p>

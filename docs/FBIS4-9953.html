			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Absenteeism: A Challenge to Collective </F> Self-Respect"]    [Text] We Cubans have come to the 99th anniversary of the  Proclamation of Independence with a real feeling that the battle  waged by those revolutionaries continues today without the  actual fighting but with the same need to give our all for  national freedom and sovereignty.    Nevertheless, a century later the Fatherland is summoning us  not to our military duty to kill or be killed but rather to our  civic duty to do better work so that we can preserve law and  order, as well as our resistance, and development potential. If  we fail to do so, if we lack the willpower and intelligence to  build today, tomorrow the temptation will be great to bring Cuba  to its knees by force, and we will be forced to fight on the  battlefield, where courage, valor, and patriotism are gauged by  what we destroy, not by what we build.    Today's army must be one of creators. Just as soldiers are  given the opportunity to fight because of their willingness to  observe discipline, Cuban workers must be more disciplined than  they currently are in order to assure victory on the economic  battlefield.    In this effort the chiefs play a vital role, as their own  main disciplinary failing may be their inability or  unwillingness to demand discipline from their subordinates.    Cuban workers, most of whom are also soldiers, know that a  joint action will not be successful unless someone wisely  directs the efforts of all towards success.    One group of workers using the same materials as another  similar group, often does a disciplined, enthusiastic, and  efficient job just because they have a real leader.    Leadership is not a privilege; it is a demanding  responsibility. We need chiefs who do not look at numbers  impassively, who do not become demoralized, who can appeal to  honor and ethics, who are passionate about their work and their  people, and who can by their example inspire their workers to  move ahead and tackle problems.    One suspects that in many cases the high level of worker  absenteeism is due to cowardly chiefs and union leaders who do  not understand their political function and fail to demand  administrative action against labor indiscipline.    In their parliamentary meetings the workers are vigorously  denouncing absenteeism, although they understand the current  transportation difficulties and other limitations.    There is strong criticism of the people who regularly fail  to  show up for work. In many instances this small minority is to  blame for the statistics that are giving everyone a bad image.    At thousands of assemblies the workers have expressed their  desire to put an end to the lack of control over the issuance of  medical certificates and over the protracted process of  specialist reports on illnesses. In some cases these excuses are  denounced as mere legal pretexts that conceal a lack of  conscientiousness. In many places it is being argued that a  limit must be set on the number of days a year a worker can  avoid doing his duty on such grounds.    All of this contrasts with the simplistic approach to the  problem of absenteeism at other centers. The managers and the  unions there do not seem to realize that when they admit an  absenteeism rate of 9 percent, for example, they are saying that  they are not working one month a year. And we are talking here  about a far from exaggerated rate, in light of the actual  numbers.    In the wake of the work-center assemblies, where there was  so  much discussion about efficiency, without which the country's  economic recovery is impossible, managers, unions, and workers  have no choice but to devote themselves to reducing these high  rates of absenteeism, because there can be no talk of efficiency  in places that stop working one or two months a year.    We must show an elementary sense of social responsibility  towards and solidarity with the many workers who are evincing  true patriotism and conscientiousness. They are the ones who get  up when it is still dark and return to their homes by moonlight,  who do farm and other work often with worn out soles, who work  double shifts at hospitals so that patients are cared for, and  who do not flag in their daily duties in order to save the  Fatherland with hard work, intelligence, and honor.    It is true that being on time for work is not the be-all and  end-all of discipline. But if this primary obligation is not  observed, if this elementary rule is not complied with, it  cannot be denied that very little can be done to improve  technological and economic discipline at work centers.    During these early months of the year we have made great  progress in grasping the problems facing us. The year 1994 must  not close without clear-cut gains in reducing absenteeism.    Prescriptions are not necessary. Each work center must do  what each town demands. But also, in each town the problem of  absenteeism must be a challenge to collective self-respect, to  the expertise of chiefs, and to the prestige of the union  section.</p>

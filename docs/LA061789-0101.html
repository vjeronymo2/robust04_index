			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Court Denies MCI Request: A federal appeals court has ruled that MCI  Communications forfeited its opportunity to have a multibillion-dollar federal  telecommunications pact reopened because it failed to bid the first time.  Involved in the dispute is one of two contracts to redesign and provide a pair  of voice, data and video telecommunications networks in the 1990s, a project  that may total $25 billion over 10 years. The General Services Administration  awarded American Telephone &amp; Telegraph the contract for one network last  December and US Sprint Communications the other. Losing out was Martin Marietta  Corp., whose proposal included a substantial share for MCI.  </P></p>

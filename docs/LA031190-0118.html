			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MONGOLIA'S LEADERS PLAN REFERENDUM ON LEGISLATURE;  </P> <P> ASIA: NEGOTIATIONS ON A VOTE FOLLOW AN AGREEMENT BY THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT TO  RESIGN.  </P> <P> Mongolia's opposition groups negotiated with the government Saturday on  arrangements for a referendum to gauge public approval of the country's  parliament, the Great Hural.  </P> <P> The talks took place a day after an opposition hunger strike ended when  Communist Party leaders agreed to resign.  </P> <P> Damdindorj Ninj, who leads one of the four opposition groups pushing for a  multi-party democracy, said he is confident that the country's leaders will  follow through on their promises.  </P> <P> "This is our victory," Ninj was quoted as saying. "I'm very hopeful the  government will keep its promises."  </P> <P> The leadership pledged Friday to hold an extra congress in April to change  Communist Party rules and elect new party leaders.  </P> <P> It also agreed to hold a referendum to give the people an opportunity to say  whether they have confidence in the Great Hural.  </P> <P> Diplomats said that both the opposition and the government will meet to draft a  new constitution.  </P> <P> Ninj and 28 other protesters took part in a three-day hunger strike in  Sukhbator Square in the center of the capital, Ulan Bator, to demand the  resignations of President Jambyn Batmonh and the rest of the Politburo.  </P> <P> Batmonh announced on television and radio Friday night that the entire  Politburo will resign at a special plenum session Monday.  </P> <P> National television also broadcast live talks between two ranking officials and  representatives of the opposition groups Friday.  </P> <P> When the news broke that the leadership would resign, the hunger strike ended.  </P> <P> "People were hugging each other for joy and shouting hurray," one resident  said.  </P> <P> The hunger strike proved to be a very powerful weapon because Mongolians were  horrified at the spectacle of the hunger strikers, who carried on despite  subzero temperatures, she said.  </P> <P> The streets of Ulan Bator were quiet Saturday, and workers called off a general  strike.  </P></p>

Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA analyzed the estimated costs of each of the proficiency programs, estimates of participation, and the effects of fees on program participation. In addition, the Agency considered comments received on its ``Economic Analysis'' of the proposed rule. EPA's final analysis is contained in Economic Impact Analysis of the Radon Proficiency Program User Fee Rule, U.S. EPA/Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, November 17, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Methodology <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three methodologies were employed for evaluating the economic impacts of the imposition of fees for radon proficiency programs. The first methodology formed the basis of the participation drop off numbers in the proposed rule. This methodology used data from selected interviews with industry representatives to help EPA predict the impact of several levels of fees, and estimates the potential reduction in participation as the fee level increased. The Agency has updated this analysis to account for current estimates of program participation and operating costs. A second methodology involved the design of model firms to evaluate the effects of differing fee levels on estimated radon revenues and profits. A third methodology involved examining fees charges for similar programs, both in the public and private sector. The first and second methodologies were used in setting the fee schedule for participation in the RMP program. The third methodology was used to develop fees for the RCP program and for the individual proficiency component of the RMP program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Impacts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Total Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The total annual cost of operating EPA's radon proficiency programs was estimated at $2.6 million. This number is based on budget estimates for operating the proficiency programs during FY92. The proposed rule estimated the total program costs at $3.4 million annually. The difference of about $800,000 results from EPA's adoption of a continuous program and privatization of the training courses that were part of the proposed rule, as well as the decline in the number of organizations applying to the proficiency programs. The Agency will continue to work toward reducing its costs of operating the proficiency programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP) Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA'S analysis indicates that its final fee structure promulgated in this rule will have minimal impacts on the radon industry and the general public. According to the demand/response curve developed in the ``Economic Analysis,'' drop off in participation is estimated to be about 10% of primary measurement devices; in contrast, the proposed rule would have resulted in drop off of about 25% for primary devices. Secondary firm drop off is expected to be approximately 15%; the proposed rule would have resulted in a drop off rate of about 50%. Any level of fees is likely to have resulted in some participation drop off. The Agency was sensitive, however, to the concerns raised by comments that the proposed rule fees would have led to a dramatic reduction in the number of organizations participating in the RMP program. These comments were further substantiated by EPA's model firm analysis which indicated that the proposed fees would have represented a 80&hyph;95% of the average firm's radon profits. As a result of the lower fees in the final rule, EPA believes that the drop off will be small enough to maintain the availability of listed measurement service providers throughout the country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total estimated cost of the RMP program is about $1.6 million and the fees recovered from the RMP program are expected to equal about 30% of this cost during the first year of fee collection, or about $470,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Individual Measurement Proficiency and the RMP Exam <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is publishing an annual fee of $150 for participation in the individual proficiency component of the RMP program. The estimated Agency cost of operating the individual proficiency component of the RMP program is $435,000. The Agency is establishing a fee that will maintain participation in this program and achieve the Agency's goal of measuring the proficiency of individuals who provide ``in-house'' radon measurement services. EPA expects to collect approximately $225,000 the first year of fee collection. The fee was set at a level expected to maintain a high level of existing participants. The fee also reflects a fee that is comparable to existing environmental-related proficiency testing programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Radon Contractor Proficiency (RCP) Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As in the case of the individual measurement proficiency component of the RMP, EPA is promulgating a fee that it believes will maintain participation in the RCP. EPA has chosen to finalize the proposed annual fee of $200 based on the analysis conducted for the proposed rule. Comments received did not indicate that this fee would result in significant drop off of the RCP program participants. The $200 per RCP program applicant fee is consistent with fees established by State radon mitigation certification programs and other comparable federal programs. EPA expects to collect $140,000 in the first year of the estimated program costs of $550,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Metsa-Serla to invest FM2bn in paper machine Metsa-Serla, the Finnish pulp and paper group, plans to invest FM2bn (Dollars 421m) in a new paper machine at its Kirkniemi plant in Finland, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The machine, due to begin operations in late 1996, will be able to produce 300,000 tonnes a year of double-coated fine paper. This will raise the company's total annual capacity for graphic printing papers to 1m tonnes. Mr Timo Poranen, chief executive, said the investment was based on rising demand for coated offset printing papers, where growth of more than 5 per cent a year was expected between 1994 and 1998. He stressed the group intended to maintain a strong balance sheet. This is one of the biggest single capacity additions to be announced by a Finnish forestry group in the past three years. However, it may increase fears that the industry is heading for a new investments boom now that it is back in profit and prices are rising strongly. The downturn in the pulp and paper cycle between 1991 and 1993 was mainly caused by over-capacity.</p>

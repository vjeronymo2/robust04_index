			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] China shares Malaysia's views that the  membership of the UN Security Council should be reviewed. At  the same time, it agrees with Malaysia's stand of resolving the  Bosnian issue. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir was speaking to Malaysian  journalists in Beijing. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir has welcomed the United  States Senate vote to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia so that  the Bosnians could defend themselves from Serb attacks. He said  the U.S. Senate's move was in line with Malaysia's long-standing  call that the Bosnians be armed before countries with  peacekeeping forces there under United Nations auspices withdrew  them. The prime minister said he had told U.S. President Bill  Clinton during their meeting in Washington last week that  withdrawing the peacekeeping forces withouth first arming the  Bosnians would be like rendering them to be slaughtered by the  Serb terrorists. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir reiterated his views  that the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations on Bosnia  was invalid as it only applied to the former Yugoslavia which  did not exist. On the other hand, Serbia continues to get arms  supplies from Belgrade. [passage omitted]</p>

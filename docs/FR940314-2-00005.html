The plan suggests amounts of food for men, women, and children of different ages, and it meets most dietary standards. The cost of the TFP is adjusted monthly to reflect changes in the costs of the food groups. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> TFPs for Alaska and Hawaii are based upon an adjusted average for the six-month period that ends with June 1993. Since the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the source of food price data) no longer publishes monthly information to compute Alaska and Hawaii TFPs, the adjusted average provides a proxy for actual June 1993 TFP costs. The adjusted average is equal to January&hyph;June 1993 TFP costs for Alaska and Hawaii increased by the average percentage difference between the cost of the TFP in Alaska and Hawaii in June and the January&hyph;June average from 1976 through 1986 (a 1.53 percent increase over January&hyph;June costs in Alaska and a 1.82 percent increase in Hawaii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the period January through June 1993, the average cost of the TFP was $467.70 in Alaska and $596 in Hawaii. The proxies for actual June 1993 TFP costs were $474.86 in Alaska and $606.85 in Hawaii. The June 1993 cost of the TFP was $587.70 in Guam and $469.10 in the Virgin islands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The TFP is also the basis for establishing food stamp allotments. Food stamp allotments are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in food cost levels. Section 3(o)(11) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2012(o)(11)) provides for an adjustment on October 1, 1993, based upon 103 percent of the June 1993 cost of the TFP for a family of four persons consisting of a man and woman ages 20&hyph;50 and children ages 6&hyph;8 and 9&hyph;11. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The maximum food stamp benefit or allotment is paid to households which have no net income. For households which have some income, their allotment is determined by reducing the maximum allotment for their household size by 30% of the household's net income. To obtain the maximum food stamp allotment for each household size, the TFP costs for the four-person household were increased by 3 percent, divided by four, multiplied by the appropriate household size and economy of scale factor, and the final result was rounded down to the nearest dollar. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to section 3(o)(3) of the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2012(o)(3)), maximum food stamp benefits for Guam and the Virgin Islands cannot exceed those in the 50 States and D.C., so they are based upon the lower of their respective TFPs or the TFP for rural II Alaska. In addition, the urban Alaska allotment is the higher of the allotment that was in effect in urban areas on October 1, 1985 or 100.79 percent of the adjusted Anchorage TFP (see 50 FR 18456, dated May 1, 1984, and 51 FR 16281, dated May 2, 1986). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to regulations published at 51 FR 16281, on May 2, 1986, the allotment for rural I areas is the higher of the allotment that was in effect in each rural I area on October 1, 1985 or 128.52 percent of the Anchorage TFP (as adjusted). The rural II allotment is 156.42 percent of the adjusted Anchorage TFP (Alaska TFP). For further information concerning the allotments for urban Alaska, rural I Alaska, and rural II Alaska, see 51 FR 16281, dated May 2, 1986. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following table shows new allotments for urban Alaska, rural I Alaska, rural II Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

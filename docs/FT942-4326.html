			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / People: Hambro breaks links in its chain Harry Hill, 46, formerly joint managing director, has moved up to become sole group managing director of Hambro Countrywide, the estate agent and financial services chain in which Hambros has a stake. His erstwhile partner as joint managing director, John May, 39, is transferring within the Hambros group, to take up a post as deputy chairman and managing director of Hambro Group Investments. The move thus ends a joint managerial partnership at Hambro Countrywide which stretches back to November 1988. Hambro Countrywide returned to profit in its last annual results, reported in March this year. The 445-strong agency chain increased its commission income from Pounds 52.9m to Pounds 64.4m, turning a 1992 loss of Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 15.8m profit for the financial year of 1993. Christopher Sporborg, Hambro Countrywide's chairman, said yesterday that May's shift of post was entirely related to internal restructurings at the company, which had seen the financial products' division - for which May had been responsible - being brought under the aegis of the agency division, rather more the responsibility of Harry Hill. A key element of May's role having so significantly changed, Sporborg added that 'I did need to have him (May) here. Because of the changes at Hambro Countrywide, I met less resistance than I would have had two years ago.' Sporborg says May will remain a non-executive director of Hambro Countrywide, and will 'chair a strategy committee there. I think the move strengthens Hambro Insurance Services group, without weakening Hambro Countrywide'.</p>

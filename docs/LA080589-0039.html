			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UTILITIES WIN EXTENSION ON SMOG DEADLINE  </P> <P> In a major victory for electric utilities, regional air quality officials voted  Friday to give the industry 10 years to slash smog-creating emissions. The  decision ends a longstanding dispute that had threatened to cripple a sweeping  clean-air plan for the Los Angeles Basin.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District vote to impose a 1999 deadline  was hailed by the Southern California Edison Co., which had earlier threatened  possible legal action if a stricter emissions deadline were adopted.  </P> <P> "I think this is a poor alternative (with) some board members choosing to go  along with what Southern California Edison would like," said director Sabrina  Schiller, who wanted an earlier deadline for retrofiting equipment with new  controls.  </P> <P> "Nineteen ninety-nine is giving away the store as far as I am concerned," she  said.  </P> <P> Friday's decision, which came after nearly eight hours of testimony and debate,  repudiated a board panel's decision to make companies comply with the new rule  by 1996. Even that deadline had been a compromise of an earlier schedule that  called for compliance by 1993.  </P> <P> The board's 7-3 vote came at a time when the air quality board is under fire  for being too hard on industry. In fact, the state Air Resources Board, which  must approve the 20-year clean-air plan, recently delayed a vote on the  sweeping proposal because of grumbling by industry.  </P> <P> Mike M. Hertel, Edison's environmental affairs manager, said Friday's decision  shows that the district can be "fair" to business.  </P> <P> The standards adopted Friday, calling for a nearly two-thirds reduction in  emissions, are similar to those included in earlier proposals. Nitrogen oxide  emissions from the basin's electric power generators will be cut from 44.4 tons  a day to 15 tons. The plants now generate 4.3% of the total emissions of  nitrogen oxide, which can cause lung damage, premature death, obscured  visibility and a brown haze.  </P> <P> The district estimated the cost to utilities and other power generators at $682  million, a fraction of the amount claimed by the companies and utilities. The  Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, for instance, said the new rules  will cost it $1 billion.  </P> <P> Edison officials predicted that they will raise rates 2% or nearly $1 on  monthly residential bills to cover their costs. The DWP estimated rate hikes of  7% to 10% or up to $4 a month, while utilities in Pasadena, Glendale and  Burbank forecast increases of up to 15% or $4 a month. Most of the hikes will  probably not take effect until closer to the 1999 deadline.  </P> <P> Critics of the earlier emissions deadlines said they would give utilities too  little time to build new boilers that not only could meet the pollution  requirements but also save energy and money in the long run. Instead, they  argued, the firms would have to hurriedly put controls on outdated equipment.  </P> <P> Director Larry Berg, who favors stricter deadlines, seized on that argument in  aiming for a stronger rule.  </P> <P> "I am not interested in supporting a rule that is going to put equipment on  equipment that shouldn't be in the basin," Berg said.  </P> <P> So he proposed that companies willing to build new systems be given until 1999  to comply, whereas those planning only to retrofit meet the earlier 1996  deadline. The board narrowly defeated his motion.  </P> <P> Edison and DWP officials had argued that customers would have faced power  outages under the 1996 deadline, even though they admitted that technically,  they could meet it. Edison officials say they plan mostly to retrofit their  equipment, while the DWP plans to completely rebuild about half its boilers.  </P> <P> Mark Abramowitz, program director for the Coalition for Clean Air, said the  board's vote showed "they can't stand up to big business." He predicted that it  would add "fuel" to discussions by environmentalists of putting their own  clean-air plan on the ballot.  </P> <P> Voting for the 1999 deadline were members Stephen Albright, Los Angeles City  Councilman Marvin Braude, S. Roy Wilson, Robert Hammock, Carole Beswick, Leo  King and Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich.  </P> <P> Voting against it were Schiller, Berg and Henry Wedaa, the board panel that has  pushed for the tighter deadline. Directors A. Norton Younglove and Orange  County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder were absent.  </P></p>

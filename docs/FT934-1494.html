			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reduced deficit at United Inds The reorganisation implemented since the arrival in March of Mr Tom Brown as chief executive is beginning to bear fruit at United Industries, the precision spring, materials handling and process machinery group. Helped by a reduced interest burden, pre-tax losses for the six months to October 2 were reduced to Pounds 553,000, against Pounds 1.93m. Turnover from continuing operations amounted to Pounds 13m (Pounds 14.1m). The outcome was struck after a further exceptional charge of Pounds 133,000 for redundancy and reorganisation costs; there was a debit totalling Pounds 1.41m last time, largely reflecting losses on the disposal of the cutting tool operation. Losses per share were cut from 5.23p to 1.48p.</p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Construction Contracts: New offices in Telford town centre Two west Midlands companies are teaming up again in a Pounds 16m office development in Telford, Shropshire. Richardson Developments has chosen TARMAC CONSTRUCTION to design and build two multi-storey office blocks in the Telford Plaza project in Telford's town centre. The two companies have been responsible for many developments around the west Midlands including the Merry Hill retail and business complexes in Brierley Hill. Telford Plaza will be situated in an existing office area of Telford town centre, close to junction five of the M54. The Enterprise Zone development was one of the last to be given planning approval by Telford Development Corporation before it was disbanded. Design work has already started on the first phase of the project with construction work scheduled to begin this spring and to last 16 months. This phase will include an 11-storey lozenge-shaped tower providing a total office area of over 90,000 sq ft. The second phase will include an elongated six-storey block providing over 70,000 sq ft of space. The two offices will be set either side of an extensively landscaped plaza including water features. The external facade of each building will feature silver reflection glass complemented by expressed vitreous enamel metal cladding panels which will give the buildings a three dimensional look.</p>

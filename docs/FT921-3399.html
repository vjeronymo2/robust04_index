			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Limited inspiration for bourses in early US gains LATE-CLOSING bourses appreciated the early burst of enthusiasm on Wall Street, although not all of them rose on it, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH was lifted by a fall in domestic interest rates, and by the rise in US equities. The SPI index rose 6.3 to 1,124.9, but was still 1 per cent lower on the week. Among industrials, Alusuisse bearers were active, rising SFr18 to SFr901, and Brown Boveri bearers added SFr50 to SFr3,550. In chemicals, Ciba-Geigy bearers ended SFr50 higher at SFr3,330. However, Surveillance, the world leader in trade inspection, continued to fall. Its bearers topped the active list, as they lost SFr190 to SFr7,590, SFr510 lower on the week, on selling pressure from London. AMSTERDAM saw a sharp fall in Hunter Douglas after a bigger-than-expected fall in 1991 profits prompted some brokers to issue sell notes. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.3 to 125.2, down 2.2 per cent on the week. Hunter Douglas, which makes window coverings and architectural products, lost Fl 8.20 or 11.5 per cent to Fl 63.20. Kleinwort Benson recommended its clients to take their profits in the stock, in view of its 15 per cent outperformance since the start of the year and its demanding prospective multiple of 13.1. The retailer Ahold added Fl 1.50 to Fl 87.00 after reporting 1991 net profits just above expectations. FRANKFURT reported quiet trade before a breakdown in the bourse's price information system blocked transmission of real-time, screen-based price quotes, and limited trading to open outcry. After some delay, the closing DAX index was calculated at 1,732.64, up 5.14 after a decline of just 0.01 to 703.82 in the FAZ at midsession. Falls on the week were 0.8, and 1.1 per cent respectively. Volume fell from DM5.3bn to DM4.7bn. Shares moved on results, Bayer up another DM2.20 to DM294.90 after its maintained dividend this week and Henkel, at the speciality end of the chemicals industry, DM9 higher at DM621 on a mere 3.3 per cent rise in net profits. Henkel's results, and the 1991 rise of 18 per cent in sales at the construction group, Philipp Holzmann, were in line with some brokers' expectations. But Holzmann fell DM20 to DM1,170, in spite of its rise in sales, indicating that it takes more to please the construction sector. Carmakers mostly rebounded on technical factors, BMW and Volkswagen leading with gains of DM6 and DM4 to DM550 and DM371. But Porsche, which reported a 97 per cent drop in first half pre-tax profits for the current year, fell DM10 to DM585. MILAN gave up early gains in thin, technical trading before Monday's close of the March trading account. The Comit index fell 0.64 to 510.71, down 0.8 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at L90bn after Thursday's L93bn. Pirelli gained L45 or 3.9 per cent to L1,180 on short-covering ahead of the close of the account. Fiat rose L35 to L4,885. Among insurers, Alleanza fell L190 to L7,710 and Toro was down L310 at L20,500. But Generali added L100 to L30,000. The cement sector was weak on fears that Calcestruzzi's purchase of a controlling stake in the Greek cement group, Heracles, would lead to a price war in Italy. Calcestruzzi fell L500 to L15,900 and Italcementi lost L310 to L17,700. Standa, the department store chain owned by Mr Silvio Berlusconi, fell L100 to L29,200 on news that Mr Berlusconi was selling a minority stake. STOCKHOLM returned to the uptrend with new orders for Ericsson helping to generate momentum, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 9.0 higher at 986.5, 0.3 per cent higher on the week. Ericsson B rose SKr3 to SKr126 on news of a Malaysian digital telephone exchange order, and an order for microwave radio links from Mannesmann. Astra, which said that it would not be as hard hit as its competitors by the Japanese government's reductions in domestic medicine prices, saw its A shares rebound from recent declines and rise SKr6 to SKr555. ISTANBUL made a partial recovery on the announcement of a ceasefire in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. The index came off the day's low to 3,852.59, off 16.96 on the day but up 6.4 per cent on the week. BRUSSELS got a late boost from a firmer Wall Street opening. The Bel-20 index ended up 7.55 at 1,212.40, hardly changed on the week. The retailer Delhaize, which has a big exposure to the US, closed up 1.5 per cent at BFr9,240.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1150.49  1150.82  1152.51  1152.63  1153.24  1154.35  1155.74  1154.40  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Day's High  1156.28    Day's Low  1150.32  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Mar 12    Mar 11    Mar 10     Mar 9     Mar 6 1149.99   1161.88   1169.22   1165.45   1162.10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

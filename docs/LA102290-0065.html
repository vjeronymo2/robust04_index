			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATE'S OLD WORLD SIGNS  </P> <P> As more and more political signs appear it becomes increasingly clear that one  of our Moorpark mayoral candidates has his feet firmly planted on the green  hills of his Old World birthplace. Is Clint Harper still living, in his heart,  in those misty isles where the days are soft and where the green hills will  stay that way because they were hunting preserves owned by the monarch?  </P> <P> This is not a soft land; it is by nature harsh and arid. It becomes green and  benevolent only when man goes to the time and expense to develop it. And we  have no monarch who will give us vast tracts of green hills just so we can look  at them.  </P> <P> Sir, your signs are beautiful and no doubt expensive, but that hill is nowhere  to be found in Moorpark.  </P> <P> Perhaps I have been unfair. Perhaps that sign is not your Old World birthplace.  It could be a New World hill. In Patagonia, perhaps?  </P> <P> LINDA SYMCHAK, Moorpark  </P></p>

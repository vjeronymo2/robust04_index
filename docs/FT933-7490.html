			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / UK still unhappy with California tax proposals BRITISH officials are hastily seeking to reverse the impression that proposed changes to the California tax law, agreed by senators this week, would satisfy their complaints about the state's system of unitary taxation. The UK government has been fighting the unitary system for two decades, and has threatened to withhold a tax credit from Californian companies operating in the UK if the issue is not resolved by the end of this year. A California senate committee this week agreed on changes to the tax law that would enable any company to choose an alternative method of tax assessment, known as water's edge, to which the British government does not object. Committee staff said they had been unofficially assured by the UK that the proposed changes would be enough to remove the threat of retaliation. 'I am confident that this will take the heat off,' said Mr Steve Larson, the staff director of the state senate budget committee. The British Treasury, however, has hurried to deny that it has given any such private assurance, and took the matter seriously enough to interrupt Mr Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on his holiday. The proposed changes would address several specific complaints about the current law, which allows this water's edge option, but charges a fee for it which brings the state around Dollars 45m (Pounds 30.2m) a year. But the UK has been insisting on the total elimination of unitary assessments, and on a move to make water's edge taxation mandatory for all companies in California. UK Treasury officials have reiterated that they are looking for a mandatory water's edge system, and that anything less would fall short of that preferred solution. They said, however, that they would study the Californian legislative proposals with care, and take a view when they have assessed the final law. Both the UK and US Treasuries are caught, to some extent, in the middle of the battleground. The UK Treasury's natural inclination would probably be to avoid retaliation, which could trigger a costly transatlantic tax war, but it is under considerable pressure from senior backbench MPs and from British business to maintain a tough posture. The US Treasury, meanwhile, is seeking to avoid getting directly involved, while gently encouraging California to move towards legislation that would turn away British wrath.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> EL CAMINO REAL CASTS SHADOW;  </P> <P> POWERHOUSE: THE CONQUISTADORE STORY PROMISES MORE GLORY WITH COACH LUDLOW.  </P> <P> In the intensely competitive, increasingly high-profile world of high school  athletics, Coach Neils Ludlow is an anomaly.  </P> <P> Ludlow is the unlikely and unsung leader of the El Camino Real High softball  team, one of the greatest juggernauts in City Section history. The  Conquistadores have won six 4-A Division championships in the past seven years  and have reached the 4-A final every year since 1982.  </P> <P> From 1983-87, El Camino Real owned the state's longest softball winning streak,  a fabulous run of 73 consecutive games during which Karen Walker (UCLA) and  Beth Silverman (Arizona) helped establish the Woodland Hills school as a prime  source for Division I college material.  </P> <P> And the beat goes on.  </P> <P> The Conquistadores (23-2 last season), led by senior pitcher Chrissy Peck, last  year's 4-A Player of the Year, are stockpiled with talent, ready to begin their  quest for a third consecutive City title.  </P> <P> Yet despite the team's fearsome reputation Ludlow, contrary to the image of a  hollering, win-at-all-costs ogre, rules El Camino Real with fists unclenched.  </P> <P> Ludlow, 50, oversees El Camino Real in a tranquil, almost grandfatherly  fashion. It is almost as if Ludlow, who holds a master's degree from Pepperdine  in education administration, is just along for the ride.  </P> <P> "I just fill my role," he says.  </P> <P> Ludlow is reluctant -- in fact, he flatly refuses -- to accept plaudits for the  team's success.  </P> <P> "Don't give too much credit to me," Ludlow says. "A lot of times in life, you  find yourself in the right place at the right time. I'm a firm believer in  that."  </P> <P> After transferring from Parkman Junior High in 1985, Ludlow, a mathematics  instructor, agreed to take command largely because of a shortage of coaches.  </P> <P> Ludlow, who had coached for only a few years in church leagues, was reluctant  to believe that under his guidance El Camino Real, already a two-time defending  City champion, would continue to dominate.  </P> <P> "I didn't know what anyone expected," he said. "I thought we would do the best  we could possibly do."  </P> <P> This season, with Peck and fellow All-West Valley League players Cathy Balint  (shortstop) and Alisha Knopf (second base), and senior All-City catcher Jenny  Fleming, the Conquistadores should do fine. In fact, a ninth consecutive league  title seems imminent.  </P> <P> Peck, 64-13 in three seasons (she transferred from Bel-Air Prep after her  sophomore year), was 22-2 last season and batted .571. She pitched a one-hitter  in the title game to defeat San Pedro, 1-0. College recruiters are waiting in  the wings.  </P> <P> Ludlow shaped his team with the assistance of Gary Torgeson, who has coached  Cal State Northridge to four National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division II  titles since 1983. From Torgeson, Ludlow learned the concept of "little ball"  -- a bunt single here, a stolen base there, a squeeze play here equals a slew  of victories.  </P> <P> When pressed, Ludlow allows himself a dab of due. But not much.  </P> <P> "I feel I really do my part," he said. "I like to think I'm organized. I like  to think I'm competitive. But no way do I want to assume credit for what's  going on."  </P> <P> Other area programs to watch:  </P> <P> </P> <P> CITY SECTION  </P> <P> * Sylmar (East Valley League) -- The Spartans (13-2 last season) will rely on  sophomore right-handers Ruby Gonzalez and Krystina Moore to replace Deann  Wright, now at CSUN.  </P> <P> "I came in thinking, 'Oh, my gosh, where am I going to find a pitcher?' " Coach  Chuck Miller said. "Then I found two."  </P> <P> Seniors Missy Herrera (third base) and Wendy Alcantar (shortstop) batted better  than .400 last year. So did senior center fielder Irene Aguilar.  </P> <P> * Kennedy (North Valley League) -- Kennedy, which lost to Banning in the 4-A  quarterfinals last year, might have met the Conquistadores in last season's  final had right-hander Sabrina Davis (15-3) not been lifted in the fifth inning  against Banning because of the flu. Kennedy lost, 5-2.  </P> <P> Davis, a senior, returns. Third baseman Maria Fujarte is the only other  returning senior.  </P> <P> Junior Cathy Miyahira (right field) returns. Newcomers include senior second  baseman Flavia Fleischer and senior outfielder Alecia Verdugo.  </P> <P> * Poly (East Valley League) -- Poly reached the 3-A Division semifinal last  season, finishing 19-1 after losing to South Gate, the eventual champion.  </P> <P> Three players return: senior right-hander Jodi Soto (13-1, 0.96 ERA), a  two-time All-City selection; senior all-league second baseman Tracy Bell; and  junior catcher Kristie Faehnle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION  </P> <P> * Hart (Foothill League) -- The Indians (29-2), who reached the 4-A  quarterfinal last year, rate as the best Southern Section team in the Valley,  and senior right-hander Kym Weil ranks as the area's premier pitcher.  </P> <P> Weil was 25-2 last season with 299 strikeouts and a 0.12 ERA in 178 innings.  She also pitched 15 shutouts and surrendered only three earned runs. Not  surprisingly, she has received scholarship offers from several colleges,  including UC Santa Barbara, Oregon, Arizona and Hawaii.  </P> <P> Senior catcher Stephanie Keeler (.349, two home runs) has attracted the  interest of Hawaii, Oregon, Long Beach State and CSUN.  </P> <P> Other returnees include junior shortstop Krissy Carpenter (.243), who was 4-0  with a 0.93 ERA as Weil's backup. Sophomore designated-hitter Jamie Dean batted  a team-high .402 with a school-record 37 hits.  </P> <P> * Thousand Oaks (Marmonte League) -- The Lancers (25-6), two-time defending  league champions, have six returning players but some will switch positions.  </P> <P> Trisha Gregoire moves from third base to catcher, and Amy Chellevold moves from  left field to first base. Both were All-Southern Section 5-A selections as  juniors.  </P> <P> Junior Erikka Gulbranson moves from right field to second base. Senior Lisa  Stoddard, a reserve last season, will start at third base and also will serve  as a relief pitcher.  </P> <P> Four-year starter Phronsie Franco returns at shortstop. Senior right-hander  Alicia Zinner has improved markedly.  </P> <P> * Simi Valley (Marmonte League) -- The Pioneers have finished second in league  play three consecutive years and they're tired of it, Coach Suzanne Manlet  said.  </P> <P> "We're shooting for first place," she said.  </P> <P> That's a lofty goal considering that all-league pitcher Chrissy Oliver (10-6)  has moved on to Oklahoma State.  </P> <P> But 6-foot-1 junior Heather Santiago (11-2 last season) is a capable  replacement. Returning infielders Taina Tande (shortstop) and Amy Powell  (second base), both sophomores, give the Pioneers strength up the middle.  </P> <P> * Notre Dame (San Fernando Valley League) -- Right-hander Becca Berline (17-9  last season), the league MVP the past two years, and catcher Simona Errico form  a four-year battery.  </P> <P> Berline is 53-19 in her career. Errico was the most powerful hitter for the  Knights (17-10 last season), who reached the 2-A semifinals last season.  </P> <P> Four other players return: Senior center fielder Kim Fischer (all-league) and  juniors shortstop Vivian Carballo, first baseman Karen Erickson and right  fielder Karen Ljubetico.  </P> <P> * Alemany (San Fernando Valley League) -- The Indians, who finished second last  season with a 7-3 mark (16-10 overall), have 11 returning players.  </P> <P> Sophomore second baseman Krista Gomez hit six home runs to set a school record  for a freshman. Catcher Patti Seresi, also a sophomore, hit three home runs and  junior first baseman-designated-hitter Brenda Garcia hit two. Alemany hit 18  home runs last year.  </P> <P> * Agoura (Frontier League) -- Agoura (23-2), the defending 1-A with a 20-game  winning streak, will be competing next season in the Marmonte League -- a leap  to the 5-A level.  </P> <P> Junior right-hander Melissa Thatcher, entering her third varsity season, was  23-2 last season with 156 strikeouts and a 0.63 earned-run average in 178  innings.  </P> <P> * La Reina (Tri-Valley League) -- La Reina, which reached the 1-A quarterfinals  last season, has more returning starters than any other team in the league --  and three pitchers from which to choose.  </P> <P> Senior right-hander Sherri Sisco, the league's most valuable player as a  sophomore, was hobbled by a foot injury most of last season. Freshman  right-hander Michelle St. Pierre has been impressive.  </P></p>

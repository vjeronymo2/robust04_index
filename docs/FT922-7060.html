			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Prescott wins Oscarin battle over lunch IF AN ability to raise the spirits of party activists is the chief goal for Labour's leadership candidates, Mr John Prescott should abandon his campaign to be deputy leader and run for the top job. Yesterday, the Manufacturing Science and Finance union welcomed all four leadership contenders to address its annual conference in Bournemouth and, to the surprise of some, it was the shadow transport secretary who went home with the Oscar. Yet the day was also replete with ironies. This, after all, was the judgment of the largely leftwing delegates of a union representing thousands of Tory-voting white-collar workers, while the affluent south coast resort town appeared wholly oblivious of the passionate debate on the future of socialism taking part in its midst. Each candidate played his or her part in character. Mrs Margaret Beckett used her 15-minute address to play the gender card, making the case for a fresh appeal to women voters.

Mr Prescott's basic thesis remained unchanged. What the party needed, he said, was someone to grab it by the scruff of the neck and shake up its organisation. With characteristic plain speaking, he went on to bash the Tories and the press, with a sideswipe at the party leadership for good measure. 'There is much talk of the need for new radicalism and new vision in the Labour party - not that I resist new ideas - but I'm firmly convinced that, adequately presented, our historic values remain as true today as ever.' Where the other candidates won barely 30 seconds of respectful sedentary applause, Mr Prescott ended with a full minute of standing ovation. It was a triumph of a kind. But as a long-time champion of electoral reform reflected, in the Pavilion Theatre's upper circle: 'Under proportional representation, he could be leader of that sort of party and bring a lot of union influence to bear . . . in opposition.'</p>

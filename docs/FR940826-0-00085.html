Regulations regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean Air Act apply to this blend. HFC&hyph;125 and HFC&hyph;143a have very high GWPs, and the GWP of HFC&hyph;22 is somewhat high. Although HFC&hyph;143a is flammable, the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated that its composition never becomes flammable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 Industrial Process Refrigeration, New <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Please note that different temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (a) HCFC&hyph;123._HCFC&hyph;123 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in new industrial process refrigeration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because HCFC&hyph;123 contributes to ozone depletion, it is considered a transitional alternative. Since it poses much lower ozone-depleting risk than continued use of CFCs, EPA has determined that its use is acceptable for certain end-uses. In addition, HCFC&hyph;123's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than almost all other alternatives. HCFC&hyph;123 is not flammable. EPA strongly recommends that users of HCFC&hyph;123 adhere to any requirements provided in ASHRAE Standards 15 and 34. Worker-monitoring studies conducted by EPA demonstrate that in office building equipment rooms, HCFC&hyph;123's 8-hour time-weighted average concentration can be maintained at or under 1 ppm (less than the industry-established AEL of 30 ppm), provided that such standards are followed. HCFC&hyph;123 is acceptable for use in commercial building chillers and should pose no hazard in industrial uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (b) R&hyph;407A and R&hyph;407B._R&hyph;407A and R&hyph;407B, which consist of HFC&hyph;134a, HFC&hyph;32, and HFC&hyph;125, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 in new industrial process refrigeration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (4) CFC&hyph;13, R&hyph;13B1, and R&hyph;503 Industrial Process Refrigeration, Retrofit and New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This type of refrigeration requires temperatures well below those achieved with R&hyph;502 or HCFC&hyph;22. A limited number of substitutes have been identified that are capable of meeting technical requirements. These substitutes all contain components with extremely high GWPS, and EPA is concerned about their potential contribution to global warming. However, under SNAP, EPA intends to only find those substitutes unacceptable that clearly present greater overall risk. Given this framework, EPA finds these high-GWP substitutes acceptable. At the same time, EPA strongly urges industry to develop new alternatives for this end-use that do not contain substances with such high GWPs and long lifetimes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (a) HFC&hyph;23._HFC&hyph;23 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;13, R&hyph;13B1, and R&hyph;503 in retrofitted and new industrial process refrigeration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HFC&hyph;23 has an extremely high 100-year GWP of 9000 relative to CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and a lifetime of 280 years. Its GWP is the highest among the HFCs, and its lifetime is exceeded only by the PFCs. EPA believes HFC&hyph;23 could contribute significantly to global warming. In addition, the long lifetime of HFC&hyph;23 means any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible. While the current rule issued under section 608 of the CAA does not require recycling and recovery of HFC&hyph;23, or leak repair for systems using HFC&hyph;23, EPA strongly encourages users to anticipate future rulemakings with voluntary compliance. In particular, EPA urges users to reduce leakage and recover and recycle HFC&hyph;23 during equipment servicing and upon the retirement of equipment. HFC&hyph;23 is nonflammable and does not deplete stratospheric ozone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (b) R&hyph;403B._R&hyph;403B, which consists of HCFC&hyph;22, R&hyph;218, and propane, is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;13, R&hyph;13B1, and R&hyph;503 in retrofitted and new industrial process refrigeration. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because HCFC&hyph;22 contributes to ozone depletion, this blend is considered a transitional alternative. Regulations regarding recycling and reclamation issued under section 608 of the Clean Air Act apply to this blend. R&hyph;218, or perfluoropropane, is an extremely long-lived substance with an extremely high GWP. EPA believes this blend could contribute significantly to global warming. In addition, the long lifetime of R&hyph;218 means any global warming or other effects would be essentially irreversible. R&hyph;403B is only acceptable as a substitute for this end-use. The GWP of HCFC&hyph;22 is also somewhat high. Although propane is flammable, the blend is not. Leak testing has demonstrated that the blend's composition never becomes flammable. In a proposed rulemaking soon to be issued, EPA intends to propose R&hyph;403B unacceptable as a substitute for R&hyph;502 in all end-uses because other substitutes have been identified which do not exhibit such extreme GWPs or lifetimes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

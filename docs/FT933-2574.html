			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: French water group gains from Dollars 200m US takeover LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, the French group with interests in several UK water companies, will gain a strong minority position in the second-largest investor-owned water concern in the US as a result of a Dollars 200m takeover announced yesterday. In a cash-and-stock deal supported by Lyonnaise, United Water Resources, which supplies about 235,000 customers in northern New Jersey and southern New York, agreed to acquire GWC, which serves nearly 300,000 customers in 14 states. Lyonnaise, which currently owns 82 per cent of GWC, would hold a 26 per cent stake in the newly formed group, with a combined annual turnover of about Dollars 250m. Under the agreement the French company would gain four seats on United's board, which would expand from 11 to 15 seats.</p>

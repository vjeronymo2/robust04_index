			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER COMMENTARY / EXCERPTS;  </P> <P> TRUST NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION, BUT IN VOTES  </P> <P> How bad? In Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court had said that the right to decide  the matter of abortion belonged by and large to the woman. In the Missouri case  decided Monday, the justices ruled that the right to decide belongs  increasingly to the politicians.  </P> <P> In Roe, the court struck down state limitations on abortion. In the Missouri  case, the court invited state limitations.  </P> <P> "Thus," as Justice Harry A. Blackmun opened his searing dissent, "not with a  bang but a whimper, the plurality discards a landmark case of the last  generation and casts into darkness the hopes and visions of every woman in this  country who had come to believe that the Constitution guaranteed her the right  to exercise some control over her unique ability to bear children."  </P> <P> On the steps of the court, Faye Wattleton, the head of Planned Parenthood,  asked rhetorically about these constitutional guarantees: "When did it become a  political matter whether Americans have privacy? When did it become a political  question whether women had reproductive rights? When did it become a political  question whether poor people have the same access to their constitutional  rights as the rest?"  </P> <P> The answer to the question "when" was easy: On July 3, 1989, they all became  political questions.  </P> <P> Now every gubernatorial race, every statehouse seat, will become a referendum  on sexual politics. The legislatures themselves may suffer from gridlock as  abortion bills are rushed into committee in the next weeks and months.  </P> <P> In practical terms, the Webster case affects only Missouri. But the national  message is clear. Don't count on the Constitution to protect rights. Count  votes.  </P></p>

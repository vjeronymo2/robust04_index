[passage omitted] Suffice it to say that the gang's ringleader  has three criminal convictions, and one of its members was tried  for rape. Oleg Soskovets also noted the courage and endurance of  the pilots.    The main responsibility for dealing with the gang lay with  those subordinate to First Deputy Internal Affairs Minister  Mikhail Yegorov. However, all the heads of oblasts and the  rayons in the North Caucasus, even of those regions where a  state of emergency is currently in force, took part in resolving  the situation.

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS SECRETARY OF STATE;  </P> <P> FLORES TRIES TO REVIVE ISSUE OF EU'S HUSBAND'S FINANCES  </P> <P> Republican secretary of state candidate Joan Milke Flores attempted Thursday to  revive concerns about the financial dealings of incumbent March Fong Eu's  husband, a Singapore businessman whose refusal to divulge the secrets of his  wealth forced Eu to abandon her U.S. Senate candidacy three years ago.  </P> <P> Standing outside the locked gates to Eu's Hancock Park neighborhood, Flores  released her income tax returns for the last 10 years and called on Eu to do  the same. Flores said the disclosure, although not required by law, was  necessary to reassure voters that "we will put their best interests ahead of  our own."  </P> <P> Although Flores did not mention him by name, the challenge was clearly directed  at Henry Eu, who is part of an economically powerful Chinese family with  interests in Asian mining, real estate and herbal medicines. Henry Eu, who pays  the lease on the family's Hancock Park home, is not a citizen of the United  States and carries a Singapore passport.  </P> <P> "Do we as voters have a right to know this information?" asked Flores, a Los  Angeles city councilwoman who has been divorced for 27 years. "Absolutely . . .  especially since her husband could have investments in California. Until these  questions are answered, March Fong Eu will always be in a shadow of doubt."  </P> <P> A spokesman for Eu said Thursday that the four-term Democratic incumbent will  release her tax returns as soon as she can assemble them, but he predicted they  will not shed new light on her husband of 17 years because the couple do not  file joint returns.  </P> <P> "He is not even a resident of this country," said Anthony L. Miller, Eu's chief  deputy. "His interest here is having a spouse here."  </P> <P> Leo McElroy, Eu's campaign consultant, dismissed Flores' attack on Eu and her  husband as an act of desperation. "You are seeing somebody who has basically  failed to have her campaign catch fire and is still trying to light a match,"  he said.  </P> <P> Eu has long maintained that her husband does not share information with her  about his business dealings and that their finances are separate. Statements of  economic interest that she files annually with the state list only two of his  many business interests, and aides said her income tax returns do not account  for any of her husband's wealth.  </P> <P> Eu said in a recent interview that she rarely sees her husband. "I am my  family," she said. "My husband is not here much."  </P> <P> Henry Eu's secretiveness in 1987 made it impossible for his wife to comply with  federal campaign rules, which require candidates and their spouses to divulge  their international financial holdings. His refusal to do so eventually led to  his wife's withdrawal from the Senate race.  </P></p>

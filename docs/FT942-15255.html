			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / (CORRECTED) BSI changes quality standard Correction (published 21st April 1994) appended to this article. The British Standards Institution has bowed to criticism that it is unresponsive to the needs of smaller companies by promising to make certification for the BS5750 quality assurance standard simpler and cheaper. BSI Quality Assurance, the BSI's certification arm, said companies with less than 10 employees would pay a fee of Pounds 990 for registration and Pounds 710 for the subsequent annual assessment - a reduction of about Pounds 200 in both fees. CORRECTION There has been no change to BS5750, the quality assurance standard, as implied in last Friday's FT.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Italian deputies end vote secrecy ITALY'S chamber of deputies yesterday decided to abolish secrecy when voting on whether to waive the immunity of members involved in cases of corruption and the illicit financing of political parties. This represented a hurried attempt to mollify public opinion, outraged by the way parliament last Thursday blocked four of six requests by Milan magistrates for Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist leader, to face corruption charges. In demonstrations in Italy's main cities, protesters claimed immunity was being abused to protect parliamentarians like Mr Craxi. The outcome of the vote led the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), and the Greens to withdraw their four ministers from the Ciampi government within ten hours of it being formed. Only yesterday were four new ministers sworn in. The chamber was also willing to act quickly because a majority of the deputies were convinced that in the Craxi vote secrecy was itself abused. Members of the opposition like the populist Lombard League, the hardline communist group, Reconstructed Communism, and the Network (La Rete) are believed to have voted to preserve Mr Craxi's immunity - with the aim of embarrassing the government. The decision coincided with the late night agreement on Tuesday by the Socialist Party not to contest magistrates' requests for its deputies to be investigated. In an attempt to improve its image, the party also agreed that members under investigation, especially the 54 in parliament and the main party apparatus, should be suspended. The party, which has a new leader, Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, is also planning a new name and symbol. Rating downgraded, Page 28</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: FATHER KNOWS BEST -- COUNT ON IT  </P> <P> My husband is the parent with credibility in this family. I lost mine the day I  threatened one of the kids with, "You clean your room or you'll never see me  again. I mean it. I'm going to go to Africa and sit on a hillside with Jane  Goodall and watch chimpanzees for the rest of my life."  </P> <P> They knew I was bluffing. I wasn't going to do that. I wouldn't go anywhere  without a mall nearby.  </P> <P> After years of my exaggeration, they just sort of roll their eyes upward, shake  their heads and say, "Mom! You can't believe anything she tells you." But when  their father speaks . . . every word is chiseled on stone tablets. It is so.  </P> <P> He is to integrity what Walter Cronkite is to broadcasting, Mother Teresa is to  the poor and Lawrence Welk is to the polka. In a world of Janet Cookes, Ivan  Boeskys and Milli Vanillis, he shines like a beacon of goodness. He has given  his children their motto for life: "In Dad We Trust."  </P> <P> (I know this is taking a long time to build, but it's necessary to point out  how far he had to fall.)  </P> <P> A couple of weeks ago at breakfast, the Prince of Goodness announced to his son  (a USC grad) that the Trojans had beaten Notre Dame. He had heard it on a  late-night sportscast.  </P> <P> The kid was not only numb, he was ecstatic. Imagine that. SC knocked off the  Irish.  </P> <P> Later that night, he and his brother were flipping TV channels when they landed  on a replay of the USC-Notre Dame game.  </P> <P> Even though Notre Dame was winning, our younger son wasn't worried. His father  had told him the final score.  </P> <P> With five minutes left to play, his brother said, "It's all over."  </P> <P> The kid who had heard his dad's proclamation of a USC victory stood firm.  </P> <P> "The game's not over until it's over," he smiled. "They'll pull it out of the  fire. You'll see."  </P> <P> His brother looked at him like his pilot light just went out.  </P> <P> "Are you nuts? There's no way in the world USC can win."  </P> <P> With a minute left, the younger brother's eyes were still glued to the screen  awaiting the miracle that was prophesied.  </P> <P> "Don't rule out an 80-yard pass," he said to his brother. "They don't even have  the ball," his brother yelled back.  </P> <P> When the final score was announced -- Notre Dame 10, USC 6 -- I expected him to  lose faith in his dad . . . kind of like finding out Smokey the Bear plays with  matches.  </P> <P> Instead, he smiled and said, "Dad probably did me a big favor. Anyone else  would have walked out in the third quarter."  </P></p>

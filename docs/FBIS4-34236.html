			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras for the </F> "Doing Radio" newscast]    [Text] The Fourth Ibero-American Summit has just concluded  in Cartagena de Indias, a city that is part of the cultural and  historical patrimony of the world. The final document is 19  pages long and, obviously, we have not had access to it.  Judging from substantive elements contained in the final  document, we consider that the balance of this fourth summit is  positive. It is not all that we expected and -- this is a  personal opinion -- it is not what Latin America, the Caribbean,  and the Iberian world could expect under the circumstances that  currently prevail in the world; but it is evidently a step  forward in the efforts for integration and joint efforts among  countries of Iberian origin.    I believe, and it is quite obvious, that the decision  adopted  by the heads of state and government who participated in the  summit concerning the blockade against Cuba is a positive step  forward when compared with previous summits. Regarding this, I  would like to comment on what was approved yesterday at  Cartagena de Indias. The presidents and heads of state decided  to support the elimination, according to international law  principles and the UN resolution, of economic and commercial  measures which affect free development of international commerce  and impair living conditions in Ibero-American nations.    Obviously, the paragraph does not textually mention the  United States as the factor, the agent who has imposed a  blockade which has lasted for 32 years against our country.  Neither does it mention Cuba as the victim of this criminal and  unfair blockade, as Fidel termed it at the fourth summit. If we  analyze previous agreements however, we will see that in  Salvador de Bahia they took note, they only took note of the  decisions adopted in other international forums. To be more  precise, I would rather read what was agreed upon at the third  summit; and you will be able to compare the text of the  agreement adopted at the previous summit in Salvador de Bahia  and the one adopted in Cartagena de Indias.    Paragraph 68 of the resolution adopted at Salvador de Bahia,  Brazil, states: We take note of recent resolutions adopted at  international forums on the need to eliminate the unilateral  implementation, by any state and for political purposes, of  economic and commercial measures against any other state. The  paragraph begins with a note-taking action rather than an  opinion, censure, or explicit support for an accord's  elimination. This time, the heads of state and government who  met in Cartagena de Indias endorsed the elimination, based on  international law principles, of accords which harm or are  detrimental for Ibero-American nations. This is a clear  allusion to the criminal and unfair blockade imposed by the  United States against our country.    There are other substantive elements. For example, in a  world marked by neoliberalism, the document states the decision  to bolster cooperation and mutual aid in the Ibero-American  community, and a special emphasis was made on the need to look  after the poorest sectors of the Latin American population.  This decision in a world marked by neoliberalism, I repeat,  represents an assumption that this neoliberalism is incapable of  providing real solutions to the critical problems which afflict  the Latin American world, the world of Iberian origin.    Moreover, to conclude, I would like to state that within  this  effort for unity, cooperation, and collaboration, it is positive  that Latin America supported President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari's candidacy to the World Trade Organization. As you  well know, this organization replaces the GATT. Only the  Iberian countries in Europe, meaning Spain and Portugal, did not  support the resolution because they had already pledged to  support Italy's Renato Ruggiero. In other words, a  differentiation was made between 19 Latin American countries and  the European countries.    In essence, this represents a step forward, a positive step.  It is not what we expected but Ibero-American consultation has  been consolidated. Actually, it has been institutionalized, a  meeting of the coordination group will be held in Santa Fe de  Bogota. In fact, a timetable has been announced for the  agreement adopted in Madrid: Argentina next year; Chile in  1995, El Salvador in 1997, Portugal in 1998, Cuba in 1999,  Panama in 2000, and Peru in 2001. I know of no precedent in  which countries that will host the summit have been later  rejected.</p>

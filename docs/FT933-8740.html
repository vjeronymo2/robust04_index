			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Seven at premium SHARES in Seven Network, the Australian TV group, were listed on Australian stock exchanges yesterday and closed at a premium on the issue price of over 35 per cent. The shares, which were issued at ADollars 2, closed at ADollars 2.73 on turnover of more than 16m after the ADollars 600m (USDollars 410m) float was heavily oversubscribed and closed early. It was the second large Australian flotation in as many months to be overwhelmed by investors, with the ADollars 2.45bn Woolworths offer drawing subscriptions of more than ADollars 6bn. Major beneficiaries of Seven's strong debut are the company's two major shareholders, News Corporation, the Australian media group, with 15 per cent, and Telecom, the Australian communications group, with 10 per cent. Seven demonstrated the strategic value of the News stake on Wednesday with a programming coup, securing access from next year to programmes from the News-controlled Fox Television in the US. These programmes, which potentially include The Simpsons, are on contract to the rival Ten Network in Australia.</p>

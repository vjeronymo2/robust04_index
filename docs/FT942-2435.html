			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / SPD split ahead of meeting to endorse leader Deep divisions re-emerged in Germany's opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) at the weekend, only three days before a critical party conference to endorse its leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, as the candidate to fight Chancellor Helmut Kohl in next October's general election. Scarcely-veiled criticism of Mr Scharping's leadership, and the party's election strategy, was voiced by leading figures in the SPD, and a formal proposal will be put to the party conference in Halle on Wednesday to back an SPD-Green alliance in the October election, flatly contradicting the strategy adopted by Mr Scharping. The most prominent criticism of party tactics came from Mr Gerhard Schroder, the SPD state premier in Lower Saxony and the man defeated by Mr Scharping last year for the party leadership. In an interview with Der Spiegel magazine, Mr Schroder accused the party of relying too heavily on the theme of law-and-order, and concentrating too much on the person - ality of the party leader at the expense of his team, in its campaign strategy. He insisted that he was not calling for any change in leadership so close to the general election, yet he made it clear that much of the Scharping strategy, seeking to win the political centre ground by opting for a tough line on crime prevention, and to distance itself from any identification with the radical Greens, was wrong. 'We cannot compete with the CDU with law-and-order slogans, and, thank God, we can certainly not win,' Mr Schroder said. He insisted it was up to Mr Scharping to decide whether he wanted to seek a red-green coalition, as the party left is urging, or keep his options open for a revival of the coalition with the liberal Free Democratic party. The South Hesse branch of the SPD, the second strongest provincial branch after North Rhine-Westphalia, agreed at the weekend formally to propose a red-green coalition, a strategy seen by Mr Scharping and his advisers on the party's right as electoral suicide, because it would enable Mr Kohl and the CDU to label the SPD with the radical pacifist policies of the Greens.</p>

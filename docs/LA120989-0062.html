			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT;  </P> <P> MOODY SOUNDGARDEN GETS A LIFT FROM CORNELL'S VOICE AT WHISKY  </P> <P> "I see expensive equipment out there," Soundgarden's singer Chris Cornell said  as he eyed the photographers' gear at the Whisky on Thursday night. "That's  your sign to thrash."  </P> <P> It was a misleading invitation. The song that followed, like most of the  Seattle metal-pups' repertoire, moved at a deliberate tempo that dictated a  less frenzied brand of body language. The crowd responded with a sort of  slow-motion head-snapping, like repeated swings with a heavy hammer.  </P> <P> Cornell's little trash-the-rich injunction didn't hold much water either,  because Soundgarden isn't really a rabble-rousing, ideology-heavy operation. So  why has this low-speed-metal foursome become a leading force in the speed-metal  scene? Chalk it up to the band's ability to give musical expression to the  shapeless longing and ache of youth. The mighty throb of discontent makes this  group a rewarding, if wearying, arrival.  </P> <P> The big revelation at the Whisky was Cornell's voice, which was infinitely more  striking than on the current "Louder Than Love" album. He worked in the same  high, clenched range, but he was stronger and more supple, like a cable  stretched taut over the choppy instrumental sea, then loosening up and twisting  into winding shapes.  </P> <P> Combined with the processional tempos, the effect was almost liturgical -- a  ritual of moody and mournful urban boys' blues that they sustained with an  effort that was both concentrated and casual.  </P> <P> They were loose enough for play -- bassist Jason Everman hit the stage floor  for a while, and one big rhythmic breakdown brought a smile from bearded  guitarist Kim Thayil (he looks like a character off a Hindu calendar) as he  supervised a quick recovery.  </P> <P> While Soundgarden declined to offer high-energy release, its monolithic attack  did have a purging effect, and Cornell's presence was enough to keep your  attention.  </P> <P> On the songs where he stood at the mike and played guitar, his hair hung over  his entire head so that the mike stand looked like a mop standing upside down.  When his hair parted you saw a pretty, soft-featured face (did someone say Jim  Morrison?) with a thoughtful, distant expression.  </P> <P> Soundgarden's best hook carries a widely unprintable lyric and is a crusher  that Living Colour might envy. But the band also revealed roots beyond the  obvious metal templates, offering a version of the Beatles' "Come Together"  made queasy by a dissonant, droning riff, and stitching the Guess Who's  contemptuous "American Woman" into their own ecology/imperialism lament "Hands  All Over."  </P> <P> If the world doesn't destroy itself, Soundgarden will return to the Whisky  Sunday.  </P> <P> LENNON TRIBUTE: A series of John Lennon tribute events are being planned for  Milwaukee this spring. Sid Bernstein, who promoted Beatles' concerts at  Carnegie Hall and Shea Stadium, said details will be announced Monday at a  Universal City press conference that will be attended by Julian Lennon and his  mother, Cynthia, as well as by Paula Abdul and Rudolf Nureyev.  </P> <P> None of the surviving ex-Beatles, nor Lennon's second wife Yoko Ono, is  expected to participate, though Bernstein said that Beatles producer George  Martin has agreed to conduct an orchestra performing Lennon's music. Plans call  for the events to be taped and televised at a later date on a pay-per-view  basis to benefit several charitable organizations.  </P> <P> LIVE ACTION: Tickets go on sale today for Motley Crue at the Forum, Feb. 12.  </P></p>

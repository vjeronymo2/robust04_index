			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Italy assures Brussels on Ilva plan MR Giulio Andreotti, caretaker prime minister of Italy, has satisfied the European Commission's competition authorities that the Italian government is committed to the restructuring plan prepared for Ilva, the state-owned steel group. Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, must now decide whether to recommend approval of the state aid package, or whether it is likely to distort competition, in which case he can call for it to be altered or abandoned. Sir Leon is likely to submit his recommendation to the full Commission next week. A decision on the politically sensitive Ilva case was held up until after the Italian election. Within the last few weeks Mr Andreotti has written a letter to Sir Leon underlining the government's commitment to the package. Commission officials said they were sure that the caretaker government's promises would be honoured by the next coalition. The Ilva plan outlined last summer would have involved an injection of up to L1,200bn (Dollars 992m) in new capital from its parent, the IRI state holding company. The group received L350bn when it absorbed Sofim, the state agency entrusted with economic development in southern Italy. Ilva hopes IRI will come up with a further L300bn, and has said it will also sell off assets to concentrate on its core businesses. Ilva is likely to reveal more details of its plans today when it will announce results for 1991. The group is expected to report a loss of up to L450bn.</p>

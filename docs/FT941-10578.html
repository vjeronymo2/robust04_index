			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Calais cuisine troubles Rosbifs The prospect of having to eat boeuf bourgignon and drink house wine in some anonymous hotel on the outskirts of Calais has provoked British immigration staff to ballot on boycotting work on the French side of the Channel tunnel. More than 650 immigration service members of the NUCPS civil service union are being asked to boycott work at the village of Coquelles. The UK authorities have decided not to establish a permanent station on French soil to inspect UK-bound traffic using Eurotunnel's rail shuttle service. Instead the Immigration Service intends to send staff for a two-day shift. Officials estimate that staff will have to make stopovers about seven times a year. The union says it will be nearer 20 times. Immigration workers, who object to their deployment overseas in principle, say the arrangements for working in France are unacceptable. They object to having no choice of accommodation and the fact that they will be obliged to dine there, with no allowance for eating elsewhere. Mr John Oliver, NUCPS branch secretary, said members objected to the absence of choice. 'Many of our members are vegetarians. In addition, how many French hotels serve breakfast at 5am when we have to get up for our early shift?' Mr Oliver said he had heard that French immigration workers, who would be doing similar shifts in the UK, had also objected. The ballot result will be announced later this month and if successful the boycott will begin when the tunnel officially opens. Channel tunnel delay, Page 8</p>

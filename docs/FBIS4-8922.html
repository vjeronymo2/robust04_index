			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter Almond: "We Came to Keep Peace, Not Fight </F> a War, Says Rose"]    [Text] "You do not fight a war in white vehicles," said  the UN Commander in Bosnia, Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose, yesterday  as he considered his possible responses to the situation in  Gorazde. "I do not believe we are in the business of going to  war in order to create conditions of peace. And I don't think  either the world or the contributing nations would accept that."    With Gorazde "on the edge of a major humanitarian disaster",  as he told BBC Radio 4, and with the Serbs pouring shells into  the town at the rate of one every 20 seconds, Gen Rose has few  options -- short of "going to war" -- to stop the Serbs doing  what they want. The pressures on him are immense. Bringing to  the job the authority and background to take a more robust  approach to delivering aid he succeeded far beyond expectations,  both in brokering a ceasefire between Croats and Muslims and in  forcing the removal of Serb guns around Sarajevo. But the  pressures that defeated his three predecessors were always  present and are currently defeating him. White-painted vehicles  cannot be used for combat.    His main problem has been to distinguish between the UN  Security Council resolution that created a "safe area" around  Gorazde and other enclaves and one that calls for the protection  of UN personnel if they come under attack. He indicated  yesterday he remains torn between the two. "I am responsible  for the lives of 15,500 young men and women here who have been  sent here as peacekeepers, not to fight a war," he said in  Sarajevo. "My responsibility is to them as much as it is to the  people of Bosnia-Herzegovina."    The threat of air strikes succeeded around the safe haven of  Sarajevo, but Gorazde required close air support operations that  were quite different. Instead of the precision strike aircraft  that Nato had planned to use in operations against artillery and  command bunkers around Sarajevo, Gen Rose could only call on  available "cab rank" close air support aircraft to attack  opportunity targets around Gorazde.    The Serbs had the advantage of time and place in their  attacks: the Nato pilots were handicapped by bad weather, and by  rules of engagement that require positive visual identification  of specific tanks or guns threatening UN personnel directly.    American pressures to make no distinction between defending  UN personnel and protecting safe areas -- as stated by Mr Warren  Christopher, Secretary of State, a week ago -- appeared to  confuse the UN. While officials at the NATO air headquarters in  Italy pressed for a wide-scale bombing campaign to stop Serb  tanks, Gen Rose was pressed by Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN  Secretary-General's special representative, to use close air  support strikes only when absolutely necessary. Mr Akashi won.  Gen Rose was reminded that he is a UN officer on a peacemaking  mission. The resulting close air support actions were too  little and too late.    While properly prepared air strikes could still check the  Serbs, largely with American aircraft, Gen Rose knows that the  Bosnian Serbs still have more than 100 UN hostages, with  opportunities for grabbing others, and that he has very little  hope of getting more troops to reinforce his peacemaking  efforts.    Yesterday, he could only hope that the Serbs will be  merciful  in their victory at Gorazde. "I very much hope the situation  will slowly return to normality, that we can prevent a  humanitarian disaster around Gorazde and we can then go back to  what we're supposed to be doing here and that is helping to  return this country to peace and normality," he said.    Deflated and without his usual bounce, Gen Rose sounded  bitter at the duplicity and treachery of the Bosnian Serb  leadership. "It is a very sad day for the world when  peace-keeping is used as a cover for the prosecution of war aims  in such a blatant fashion. The assurances that were given  repeatedly during the peace talks over the last week to people  like Mr Akashi, and indeed to Mr Churkin (the Russian envoy)  have been totally ignored.    "We now arrive at a very very sad situation indeed. However,  you do have to put that against our overall mandate here in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is obviously a force for peace. And  if you look at what has been achieved in central Bosnia and in  and around Sarajevo you will find that life is slowly returning  to normal."    His options to help Gorazde now are limited to trying to get  medical help to the town. But even in that Gen Rose said he  depended on the agreement of the Serbs to let casualty  evacuation convoys in. The Serbs, he said, did not advise it  "for the moment," and he admitted it may be another day or two  before they do.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Unemployment could reach 6m, says minister UNEMPLOYMENT in the Russian federation could rise to 6m unless the government can encourage rapid expansion of the small and medium-sized private enterprise sector, Professor Alexander Shokhin, the labour minister and deputy prime minister of the federation, said in London yesterday. Mr Shokhin, attending a conference organised by Britain's Employment Department, said unem ployment could be held to 2m if a systematic programme of public works, self-employment, and privatisation of retail outlets was speeded up. The official unemployment level is around 500,000. However, Mr Shokhin said the Russian government was facing many obstacles towards implementation of the reforms. In particular, he said, communist party apparatchiks at the local level continued to wield considerable power. 'The gap between the federal structures and the local level is very wide. We can issue any number of decrees, but it is very difficult to implement them on the local level,' Mr Shokhin said. He also targeted the layers of bureaucracy in the ministries, as well as the plethora of committees under parliamentary control, which continue to delay implementation of the reforms. 'It is very difficult to translate ideas and laws into reality. There are many decision-making bodies, even at the centre. We spend a lot of our time going from one body to the other,' he explained. Nevertheless, the minister is cautiously optimistic about what has been achieved since January when the first reforms, including price liberalisation, were introduced. Soft credits by banks to enterprises have been reduced; the central bank now identifies with the Russian government's tight monetary policies; and a timetable, geared to introducing land reform and property rights, should be ready by April. 'And that is when we want to officially join the International Monetary Fund,' said Mr Shokhin.</p>

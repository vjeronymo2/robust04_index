			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Comic actor Terry-Thomas, who is suffering from Parkinson's disease, received  about $170,000 (100,000) raised at a London charity benefit Sunday. "I was  shocked to the marrow," said writer Richard Hope Hawkins, who helped organize  the event on behalf of the 77-year-old British actor. "Here was a man who had  given so much enjoyment to millions of people and he was a complete wreck . . .  now we can make sure Terry spends his last days as comfortably as possible."

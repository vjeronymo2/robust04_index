			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- The right-hand man of the  governing coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa said he will  continue efforts to amalgamate ruling coalition parties into one  unified party, while calling on the socialists to return to the  fold.    Kozo Watanabe, former minister of international trade and  industry and a Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] executive,  rejected a call from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan  -- SDPJ], however, to disband the 130-legislator parliamentary  bloc, Kaishin (Innovation), in the House of Representatives as a  prerequisite for its return to the alliance.    "I have pushed at every occasion the proposal by former  Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to create a unified parliamentary  force from within the governing coalition," Watanabe said in an  interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    "The proposal has been accomplished at a  faster-than-expected  pace thanks to the prodding by (Democratic Socialist Party)  Chairman Keigo Ouchi," he said, in an apparent reference to  Ouchi's surprise appeal April 25 to speed up the formation of  the parliamentary bloc. The appeal -- issued shortly after the  nomination of Tsutomu Hata as the new premier -- prompted the  DSP, Shinseito, Japan New Party, Liberal Party and the  Kaikaku-no-kai [Reform Group] to form the unified Diet bloc  Kaishin by the end of the day.    The establishment of the grouping enraged the SDP, which  subsequently announced its withdrawal from the coalition,  rendering the Hata administration to a fragile minority  government vulnerable to a possible tabling of a nonconfidence  motion from the opposition.    Watanabe dismissed the SDP's allegation that the  Shinseito-led conservative mainstream "betrayed" the socialists  in a bid to force the SDP to compromise its ideological and  policy differences with the rest of the coalition. "The  allegation that we waged a sneak assault (on the socialists) is  unfounded," he said in the interview before his departure for  Myanmar [Burma].    Watanabe appealed to the SDP to return to the alliance,  saying, "It is crucial for us to soften the Social Democratic  Party's emotional antagonism toward us... and lead them to  support the current administration."    The former Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] member also said  the coalition will try to garner support from the LDP for its  proposal to raise the consumption tax from the current 3 percent.    "Discussion on the tax system should be conducted for the  sake of this nation, apart from the interests of each political  party, so it is important to seek the endorsement of the LDP,"  he said.    The coalition has asserted that a consumption tax hike is  indispensable to enable the national treasury to extend this  year's income tax cuts beyond one term.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>   [Text] Galo Pinto, executive director of the Association of  Colon Free Zone Users, said yesterday that the Colon Free Zone  "will abide by the commercial sanctions ordered by the UN  against Haiti." Pinto said that "this Free Zone respects the  decisions made by the government" in regard to situations that  affect the democratic development of any country, in this case  Haiti.    Galo Pinto said that "users of the Free Zone are studying  the  effects the suspension of commercial exchange will have on that  Caribbean nation."    Meanwhile, a reliable source who requested anonymity said  that "Haitian businessmen are among the top clients of the Free  Zone; they invest thousands of balboas to purchase products that  are later reexported" to that French-speaking nation.    According to the spokesperson, "Haiti currently has one of  the biggest markets in the Caribbean and ranks among the 10  biggest Free Zone purchasers."    For the second time, the Colon Free Zone, third-largest free  zone in the world after Hong Kong and Singapore, will respect  the UN decision against Haiti. The UN sanctions on Haiti are  aimed at restoring democracy in that country and ensure the  return to the country of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.    The Association of Colon Free Zone Users is currently  studying the dispositions being implemented by other Latin  American governments against Haiti.</p>

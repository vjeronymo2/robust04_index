			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBBING THEM OF HOUSE AND HOME  </P> <P> As many as 1,000 poor, elderly widows have lost their modest homes in  South-Central Los Angeles recently to unscrupulous salesmen using a cynical  scam. But a lawyers' group and a black church are working to put a stop to it,  and they deserve considerable praise for their efforts.  </P> <P> The scam works this way: Predators billing themselves as home-improvement  salesmen go door-to-door in black neighborhoods. They target old women who live  in homes purchased decades ago. The old houses -- which may have cost as little  as $7,000 -- are worth 10 times that now, sometimes more, but need repairs.  </P> <P> A new roof, a heating system, new carpeting or the like are tempting. The widow  agrees and signs up for what she believes are small monthly payments. But there  is trouble in the fine print. The papers -- actually a loan contract and  mortgage -- require a large balloon payment at the end of one year, sometimes  as much as $25,000. When the owner can't come up with the money, she loses her  house.  </P> <P> Lawyers for Bet Tzedek Legal Services -- a nonprofit law firm started  originally to help elderly Jewish women -- have so far managed to save a dozen  houses. But stopping foreclosure is difficult after the papers have been  signed. So now they are trying to get the word out to elderly people in the  community to be wary beforehand. And the lawyers have formed a Home Equity Task  Force at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church to train volunteers to  sound a warning: Don't sign anything without legal advice and counseling.  </P> <P> The task force, the brainchild of Julius Butler, who belongs to the law firm  and to the church, is contacting other congregations to spread the word. Los  Angeles City Councilmen Bob Farrell, Gil Lindsay and Nate Holden have been  asked to pitch in. The task force is also letting people know that help is  available from the Los Angeles Department of Consumer Affairs. A telephone call  to (213) 974-1452 can start the process of saving a home, if the owner is  willing to complain.  </P> <P> Too many elderly women have lost their houses to this scam already. A few may  get restitution if either the city attorney or district attorney can  successfully prosecute the salesmen and loan companies involved, but in many  cases widows still lose their treasured homes. Here's hoping the Home Equity  Task Force can put a stop to this scurrilous scam.  </P></p>

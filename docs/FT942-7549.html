			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / People: Why Rogerson will need more energy at British Gas Philip Rogerson, finance director at British Gas, was yesterday given strategic responsibility for British Gas TransCo, the new corporate entity into which the transportation and storage division of the company has been placed. His appointment is the first of a number of such moves which will result in British Gas executive directors being given responsibility for a portfolio of operations. The moves are part of a wide-ranging restructuring of British Gas in preparation for the phased introduction of domestic competition from 1996. Rogerson, who was brought into the company in 1992 from ICI, said he welcomed 'direct involvement' in the operational side of the business. He hoped his new role would allow him to bring greater 'financial discipline to commercial decisions'. Harry Moulson will continue as managing director of TransCo, with day-to-day responsibility for its operations, while Rogerson concentrates on strategic issues. Rogerson described TransCo as the 'backbone' of British Gas operations, and the core of its business profitability. There was no linkage between his appointment and recent market rumours that British Gas is considering divesting the gas trading and divisions, he said. Rogerson will continue with his current financial responsibilities until a successor can be named, probably within a 'few months'.</p>

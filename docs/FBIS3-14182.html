The House decided to issue a statement condemning what one  deputy termed "a serious precedent which is an extension of U.S.  arrogance toward the Arab nation."    'Ali Abu-al-Raghib, a center deputy, described U.S. measures  in the Gulf of Aqaba as "an arrogant and uncivilized method  which brings to mind the cowboy method which developed into the  destroyers policy."    In a statement delivered on behalf of 20 deputies in the  House's final meeting in its first ordinary session,  Abu-al-Raghib said that the U.S. Navy "is -- with no  justification -- sending back al-'Aqabah-bound ships after  inspecting them in a manner that conflicts with UN instructions."    He added that this issue "has become a heavy burden on the  Jordanian economy and Jordanians." He pointed out that European  shipping companies have threatened to suspend shipping  operations to al-'Aqabah port. He also said that the tough  inspection measures are applied to Jordan, out of all the states  neighboring Iraq.    Deputy 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Rawabidah, a former minister, urged  the government not to return to the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations before the United States lifts "the sea blockade  imposed on al-'Aqabah."    Deputy Muhammad Dawudyah described the U.S. behavior as  "muscle-flexing, arrogance, and encroachment on national  sovereignty. It is an insult to us and represents a state  aggression and state terrorism."    Dawudyah, who held the post of director of the information  office in the Royal Court before his election as deputy, added  that the "U.S. position reflects hostility toward the Arab  nation" -- which requires "a pause for examination lest this  hostile position on al-'Aqabah affects the peace issue and our  national rights." he said: "How can we allow anyone who  carries out all these actions against us to become a broker,  partner, and sponsor in major issues?"    Well-informed Jordanian sources have told AL-HAYAH that  Jordan is being subjected to strong U.S. pressures to force it  to rush to to sign a peace agreement with Israel. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Ex-central banker accused A former director of the Bank of Spain faces a Pta15m (Pounds 74,000) fine following allegations of insider trading in connection with the removal late last year by the Bank of Spain of the board of Banesto, the private banking group. Mr Tomas Ramon Fernandez is alleged to have learned of the impending move on Banesto in discussions at the Bank of Spain on December 23 and sold Pta5m worth of personally held shares in Banesto the day before a central bank board meeting on December 28 which he attended. That meeting decided to intervene in the banking group. Mr Fernandez claims he sold his equity in Banesto to avoid a conflict of interest at the subsequent board meeting to decide on the intervention. He was sacked from the central bank's board in February after the stock market regulators began inquiries into possible insider trading.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / MPs urge more access to funds for Post Office The Post Office should be free to raise money outside the public sector borrowing requirement to help it compete, an influential committee of MPs is set to recommend. In a report to be published next week, the trade and industry select committee - on which the Conservatives have a majority - will urge the government to disclose the findings of its review of the corporation as soon as possible. The review, which has been running for 19 months, was intended to help the government decide how the Post Office should be run in the future, and to assess the option of privatisation. The trade and industry committee's report will argue that uncertainty over government plans is putting the Post Office at a serious disadvantage against domestic and foreign competitors, and that the status quo is not an option. But the report will stop short of proposing a specific plan to improve the corporation's position. The government's problems in devising a future for the Post Office have been underlined by pressure from a powerful group of cabinet ministers to shelve further radical legislation in the 1994-95 parliamentary session. The move - intended to clear the way for the government to concentrate on rebuilding its reputation ahead of the next general election - looks set to delay indefinitely the Post Office's privatisation. Several ministers have warned that privatisation of the Royal Mail would invite strong opposition both in the Lords and among Tory MPs because of the potentially damaging implications for rural services and post offices. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told the trade and industry committee last month that there was a strong economic case for privatising the Royal Mail, but he indicated that he had been prevented from doing so by political considerations. He said the alternative to privatisation - the 'halfway house' of giving the Post Office more commercial freedom within the public sector  - was proving extremely difficult.</p>

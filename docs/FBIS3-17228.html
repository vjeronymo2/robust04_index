[Meshkov] Yes, on 27 March.    [KURIER] But President Kravchuk has vetoed it....    [Meshkov] We are aware of that.    [KURIER] What would happen if Kravchuk were to impose a  state of emergency after the vote?    [Meshkov] Then I would have to feel sorry for the work of  his unprofessional advisers. I abide by the Crimean  constitution and what goes beyond it -- namely the desire of the  citizens.    [KURIER] What do you think of Zhirinovskiy?    [Meshkov] Zhirinovskiy is a highly talented man. He is much  more serious than one would gather from his behavior toward the  press. He is the only person in the Duma who expresses the  needs of this huge people.    [KURIER] What help do you expect from Russia?    [Meshkov] No state can survive without outside help. We  want to overcome isolation. If this is the only way out then we  will opt for it. Russia has never tried to avoid supporting us  -- which used to be normal, while now this support has been  artificially restricted.    [KURIER] Why do you want to integrate the Crimea into the  ruble zone?    [Meshkov] It is my duty to do the best for the Crimea. It  is not the fault of the Ukrainian laws that we have been  maneuvered into this disastrous situation. We must protect  ourselves against Ukrainian inflation destroying the economy of  the Crimea.    [KURIER] Will there be war in the Crimea as in the former  Yugoslavia?    [Meshkov] You cannot compare them. Here there are no  nationality or religious conflicts. We have always been part of  the Russian people -- and we are part of it today.</p>

An extremely fierce offensive has been going on for days.  There have been many civilian casualties. The municipal  hospital in Bihac is constantly being targeted by the shelling  and over the last few days it has been hit on nine occasions.  There have been 14 patients killed and the building itself has  been seriously damaged, the letter reads.    I urge you to declare that this hospital is in a neutral  zone  and to make it exempt from all enemy attacks by securing the  permanent presence of the International Red Cross Committee  delegates, the letter from President Izetbegovic to (Cornelio  Sommaruga) concludes.</p>

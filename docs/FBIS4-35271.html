			<p>BFN     [Text] Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah has  called on the Lebanese Government to withdraw from the peace  talks in response to Israel's abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani.  He affirmed that civilian peace is in the interest of the  resistance, coexistence, and building a state to which all  Lebanese aspire.    Al-Dirani's family yesterday appealed to the International  Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] to act quickly in providing  medical assistance to him. In a memorandum submitted to the  ICRC, al-Dirani's family held Israel responsible for the  deterioration of his health and for preventing the Red Cross  from visiting him.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Yeltsin aide seeks to tameparliament SUPPORTERS of President Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday proposed a constitutional 'compromise' which would effectively neutralise the Russian parliament led by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, his arch-rival. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, a deputy prime minister, said last night that parliament should refrain from exercising its rights to 'interfere' with the government's economic programme until a constitution was adopted. He said they should also not have a say in adopting a new constitution spelling out the division of power between the executive, parliament and the government. He said that for the Congress of Peoples' deputies - the full parliament - to adopt a constitution is 'like the situation when a man is the judge of his own case.' Mr Shakhrai said the constitution, drafts of which are now being prepared and exchanged by teams representing the president and parliament, should be agreed by a constituent assembly or alternatively by a referendum. Mr Shakhrai is a member of the president's team in the talks. Mr Yeltsin, he said, should also refrain from interference with the government. The government, however, is mainly at odds with parliament. It was clear in Mr Shakhrai's account of the president's strategy that Mr Yeltsin is prepared to confront Mr Khasbulatov on the economy. The main issue is the lack of agreement between the government and the central bank on the issuing of credits. Mr Shakhrai said the government should end the 'abnormal situation' in which it has no power over the bank's credit policy. Over the next few days, the joint presidential-parliamentary commission is due to thrash out a constitutional agreement which must then be ratified by a one-day extraordinary Congress of Peoples' Deputies in early March. Mr Shakhrai stressed that if agreement could not be reached, a referendum set for April 11 on the constitution would proceed. He warned of chaos and dictatorship if agreement could not be found, saying that in that case a constitution would be beside the point because 'there would be no elections for 30 or 40 years.' Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, warned last night that if foreign creditors forced Russia to pay more than Dollars 2.5bn this year towards the interest due on the Dollars 80bn debt it inherited from the Soviet Union it would do so, but the result would be 'catastrophe,' particularly for the other former Soviet republics which would be deprived of cheap oil because Russia would sell more oil for hard currency.</p>

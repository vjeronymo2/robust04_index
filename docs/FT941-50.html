			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: BASF/AlliedSignal nylon fibre merger collapses A plan for Germany's BASF and AlliedSignal of the US to merge parts of their nylon fibre operations into a joint venture with annual sales of around Dollars 1bn, has collapsed, the companies announced yesterday. AlliedSignal said that they were unable to find a satisfactory way to integrate their businesses but that they were well-placed in their respective markets for textile and carpet fibre products. The failure of talks, which were first revealed last October, is the third recent setback to the German group's ambitious restructuring plans. A proposed deal with Britain's ICI, under which BASF was to have exchanged its west European acrylic facilities in return for the UK company's polypropylene activities, failed because the German group placed too high a value on its side of the bargain. BASF agreed last month to pay ICI Pounds 60m (Dollars 87.6m) for its polypropylene business, including two plants in the Netherlands and north-east England. Completion of this part of the deal was seen as essential at the German company in the light of an earlier agreement between Shell and Montedison to merge their polypropylene operations into Europe's biggest specialist manufacturer in this sector. Earlier last year BASF failed to sell its polyester fibre divisions to Wellman, of New Jersey. Fibres, which is currently combined in a single division with plastics in BASF's operations, is one of the group's most troubled sectors. It has been especially affected by over-capacity and price erosion in its main European markets. The German company said last October that the deal with AlliedSignal would create a more cost-efficient producer with enough critical mass to compete more effectively. BASF officials said they had nothing to add to yesterday's announcement from AlliedSignal, and said further explanation of the circumstances of the break-down was unlikely. Mr Jurgen Strube, group chairman, said earlier this month that all divisions except plastics and fibres were making profits in the current financial year, but forecast a return to break-even by year end.</p>

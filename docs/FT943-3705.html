			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Howard accused on jail rule change The Home Office told Whitemoor Prison, Cambridgeshire, not to body-search visitors to IRA prisoners, the founder chairman of Whitemoor's Board of Visitors claims today and she calls for the resignation of Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary. At the end of last week a prison guard at Whitemoor was shot when five convicted IRA terrorists and an armed robber attempted to escape. In letters published in several newspapers today Mrs Paddy Seligman says: 'The decision not to body-search visitors to IRA prisoners was made not locally by management but at Home Office level. The implications resulting from this decision are now obvious. If the resignation of anyone is called for, it should be that of the home secretary.' Mrs Seligman, who was a member of the board of visitors until March, said the board had expressed concern about 'excessive privileges' given to prisoners in dispersal prisons. 'Coupled with our concern about the sparsity of searching of visitors to prisoners due to staffing level restrictions, security is inevitably compromised.' She says that custodial sentences must be available to protect the public in certain cases but they are an expensive option which must be adequately funded. Treasury economies must not preclude the protection of the public and prison staff. The escape attempt, after which two firearms were recovered, led to claims by Ulster unionists that the IRA's ceasefire had broken down. However the government made clear that it would have no effect on the peace process.</p>

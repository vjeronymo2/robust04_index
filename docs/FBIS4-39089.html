			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Krasnoschekov] </F>   [Text] Paris 3 June TASS -- "Today is a historical day for  the independent Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan], whose people chose a  path of true democratic development, formation of a legal state  and economic reforms," President of Kirghizia Asker Akayev said  at a solemn ceremony held in the Elysee Palace today, during  which he signed the Paris Charter for a New Europe of the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). This  document was adopted by CSCE member states in 1990, and France  is its depositary.    The Kirghiz president emphasised that the Paris Charter is  based on principles of maintaining stability and security in the  world, and triumph of democracy and human rights, the main  values, which must help human civilization make progress, so  that in the XXI century mankind does not have to know war,  sufferings and dangers which we are encountering now. "I signed  this document with a clear conscience, as we in Kirghizia affirm  the same ideas of personal freedom, political and economic  liberties, priority to protection of rights, interests and  dignity of mankind," he said.    Asker Akayev especially noted France's important  contribution  to the development of European partnership, establishment of  contacts between the West and the East, its role in preparing  and signing the final document of the CSCE Treaty signed in  Europe and the Paris Charter for a New Europe.    Having signed the Paris Charter for a New Europe, France has  become a full-fldged member of the vast international  community," President Francois Mitterrand said at the signing  ceremony. This document marks the end of the "cold war" and  division of the world into two confronting military blocs, and,  thus, has opened `new times' in relations between states, he  emphasised.    The two heads of state signed a treaty of understanding,  friendship and cooperation between Kirghizia and France, as well  as a number of other bilateral agreements on the develoment of  cooperation in political, economic and cultural fields.    Asker Akayev noted that Kirghizia attaches great importance  to these documents, because "French foreign policy has always  distinguished itself by its well-foundedness, wisdom and  insight." Francois Mitterrand's recent visit to Central Asian  republics bears a striking testimony to this fact, he said.  According to the Kirghiz president, this was a call to leading  powers of the world to see to it that Central Asian countries  developed as democratic, secular and civilized states. "I am  convinced that only this path can lead to progress and  prosperity of Central Asian states," Asker Akayev said.</p>

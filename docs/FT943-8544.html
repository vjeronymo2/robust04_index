			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Move to resurrect Fiat bribery charges An appeal was lodged yesterday against last month's decision by an Italian judge to drop bribery charges levelled at top executives of Fiat, the giant Italian industrial company. Mr Francesco Misiani, a Rome investigating magistrate, wants to overturn the decision not to send Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat chief executive, Mr Francesco Mattioli, finance director, and Mr Umberto Beliazzi, head of the company's Rome office, for trial. The trio were among 61 people facing charges that they paid bribes of more than L100bn (Pounds 40m) to political parties - particularly the Socialists and Christian Democrats - to win contracts for building Rome's underground railway system. Mr Bettino Craxi, a former Socialist prime minister who is living in Tunisia, was one of those sent for trial. According to Italian news agency reports, Mr Misiani's 18-page deposition to the Rome appeal court alleges that 'within the Fiat group the initiative for paying bribes was taken by the top managers'. All three executives have denied the charges. Executives in Fiat's construction subsidiaries have already come under suspicion for bribery and at least one has confessed. But Mr Misiani maintains that the subsidiaries' managers were only 'the last link in the chain' which began with Mr Romiti and Mr Mattioli. Milan magistrates have also asked for Mr Mattioli to be sent for trial in connection with bribes paid to political parties for Milan public transport authority contracts. Fiat confirmed last year that it had paid L50bn (Pounds 20m) in bribes to politicians and their intermediaries over the past 10 years. It claimed managers were obliged to pay, otherwise the company would have been forced out of certain markets, such as the public procurement sector. Separately, Mr Craxi - sentenced in his absence to eight and half years in jail in another corruption case last month - yesterday blamed anti-corruption investigators for the mild heart attack suffered at the weekend by his brother-in-law, Mr Paolo Pillitteri, former Socialist mayor of Milan. Mr Pillitteri, who is now recovering in hospital, was sentenced to four and a half years in jail in June for taking bribes. He is said to be working on the screenplay of a film about the mani pulite (clean hands) investigation.</p>

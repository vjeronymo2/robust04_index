			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Observer: City chiller The City of London establishment should surely shiver at the sight of Morgan Stanley International, the London end of the pushy Wall Street broker, sharing the underwriting of the Commercial Union rights issue with Kleinwort Benson. It's one thing for firms like Morgan Stanley to earn a crust by brokering clever deals to UK corporate clients. But the CU deal was a bog-standard rights issue which Kleinwort, CU's traditional adviser, would have dearly loved to have done on its own and collected the full fee. Presumably Morgan Stanley's name has been added as a reward for past favours to CU. It certainly belies the accusation that US investment banks are only interested in doing deals and not prepared to invest in long-term relationships with their clients.</p>

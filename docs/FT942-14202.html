			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Technology: Opportunity knocks - Collaboration between industry and academia is gathering pace in Canada, says Bernard Simon in the second of a series on research When Union Bank of Switzerland, the Japanese government, British Nuclear Fuels and Caterpillar, the US construction machinery maker, were looking for a fast and versatile data search and retrieval system, they turned to a small company in Waterloo, Ontario. Open Text Corporation's software can search 60m words a second in any language and in any database. Its system helps Caterpillar's customer-support staff around the world, including Japan, keep abreast of changes in maintenance procedures. Writers of Caterpillar product manuals can be sure of updating every reference to a component whenever a supplier modifies a specification. Open Text, which has been profitable for the past three years and expects 1994 sales to top CDollars 3m (Pounds 1.4m), is a rare example in Canada of a successful business nurtured by university research and a dollop of government money. The company has its origins in work done by two University of Waterloo scientists for the computerisation of the Oxford English Dictionary in the mid-1980s. An Ontario provincial agency put up seed money to help commercialise the software. While success stories such as Open Text remain the exception rather than the rule, there is growing collaboration between business, government and academia to apply the fruits of research to commerce and industry. Henri Rothschild, chief scientist in the Department of Industry, Science and Technology in Ottawa, says that 'science policy is now considered an integral component of industrial policy. It's not a peripheral issue.' Canada's research effort remains hobbled, however, by the dominant role of government laboratories and by a lop-sided allocation of private-sector resources. According to Statistics Canada, the federal government's 200 laboratories for research and development will account for almost one-third of all R&amp;D spending, totalling CDollars 11bn, in the year to March 31 1994. The research budgets of some agencies, such as the National Research Council and the Department of Agriculture, match the combined resources of all Canada's universities. By common consent, the government gets poor value for money from its in-house laboratories. They have little incentive to compete for funding or for the best brains. Private-sector researchers can only marvel at the bureaucrats' success at beating off every attempt to scale back or privatise government research facilities. Outside Ottawa, almost half all industrial R&amp;D is handled by 25 enterprises, led by Bell-Northern Research, the research arm of Bell Canada, the country's biggest telephone company, and Northern Telecom, the telecoms equipment maker. The 25 top spenders include three government-owned corporations. Industry, however, is starting to take research more seriously and to collaborate with universities and government. Much of the impetus has come from trade liberalisation, especially the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement. For years, high tariff walls shielded Canadian 'branch plants' from international competition, rewarding second-hand technology (usually imported from US parent companies) and discouraging innovative research. One recent business initiative involved a CDollars 700,000 gift by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce to the University of Waterloo to set up a centre for the management of technological change and innovation. The bank has retained Douglas Wright, a former president of the university, for advice on how to adapt banking practices to research-based companies. The University of Waterloo is leading the way in fostering collaboration between academia and business. It claims to have the world's biggest 'co-operative education' programme, in which some 10,000 students spend part of their courses gaining practical experience with 2,500 employers, including several Japanese companies. John Branch, Open Text's president, ascribes the company's existence to a university policy, unique in Canada, of allowing staff members to retain legal ownership of their research: 'They tend to keep their ear to the market place more closely than those who are just working on a research project.' Research on the Waterloo campus has so far spawned 19 companies, including Open Text. One spin-off venture designs and makes seat supports for the disabled, another produces high-performance image sensors and a third makes instruments to measure the computer-controlled drying of grains. Another closely-watched experiment in collaborative research involves seven so-called Centres of Excellence which were set up by the Ontario provincial government in 1987. Each centre is organised as a non-profit company, with equal representation from business and academia on its board. Industry nominees comprise a majority of the centre's advisory committee, which approves research projects. The seven centres, whose work ranges from groundwater and manufacturing processes, to space and mapping science, and laser technology, were the winners of an open competition. Some 40 proposals were judged by a panel of independent researchers, including several from outside Canada. The centres started with a CDollars 204m grant from the Ontario government, spread over five years. The government chipped in another CDollars 180m last year to keep the programme going until 1997. Thanks to the centres, about 2,000 postgraduate students have been able to work with some of the country's top researchers on industry-directed projects. The vice-president for finance at the space and terrestrial science centre has teamed up with one of the scientists to form a company. The groundwater centre has licensed production of its software programmes. When the independent judges returned for a five-year review in 1992, several of the centres got rave reviews. Especially encouraging is that the private sector's financial contribution has jumped from zero in 1987 to between 30 and 50 per cent of the centres' current budgets. Next week: Italy</p>

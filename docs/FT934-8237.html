			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Major offers talks with Sinn Fein if IRA lays down arms MR JOHN MAJOR, the UK prime minister, acted to break the Northern Ireland deadlock yesterday by issuing the first explicit offer to negotiate with Sinn Fein if the IRA lays down its arms. Mr Major told the Lord Mayor's banquet in the City of London that 'there may now be a better opportunity for peace in Northern Ireland than for many years'. He ruled out secret deals with terrorists, and insisted that the government would 'never' talk to organisations which declined to renounce violence. 'But if the IRA ends violence for good then, after a sufficient interval to ensure the permanence of their intent - Sinn Fein can enter the political arena as a democratic party and join the dialogue on the way ahead.' In his most optimistic appraisal yet of the prospects for Northern Ireland, Mr Major said there was a 'burning desire on each side of the community for peace'. He said the Irish government had shown 'a new understanding of the rights and concerns of unionists,' and most of the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland were 'purposefully' engaged in talks about a settlement. All the parties accepted that flexibility was needed, and that 'cherished positions' would have to be modified. 'These elements present the opportunity we are determined to pursue,' he said. Downing Street said the prime minister's words were intended as an 'explicit' demonstration that the government was 'very serious' about the peace process. 'Northern Ireland is something which the prime minister intends to keep on the front burner,' a senior official said. The speech also confirms that the UK government is prepared to press ahead without the participation of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, led by the Rev Ian Paisley, which has said it will 'never' talk to Sinn Fein, even after a cessation of IRA violence. The possibility that the British and Irish governments might be willing to talk to Sinn Fein was first raised in a joint declaration in Brussels last month by Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister. However, Downing Street said Mr Major's declaration last night clarified the government's position. 'It has never been explicit, as it is here,' said a senior official. The government dismissed reports in Northern Ireland newspapers that the government had held recent talks on a ceasefire with Sinn Fein or IRA leaders.</p>

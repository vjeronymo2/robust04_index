			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Focus remains on Italy and Hong Kong The same countries appeared at the top of the FT-Actuaries World Index rankings last week - Italy, in Europe, and Hong Kong and Malaysia, in the Pacific Basin - as headed the list the week before. There were signs yesterday that they could stay in the public eye. The depreciation of the lira this year means that Italy's performance, over that period, has been only a little better than the European average in sterling or dollar terms. However, fans of the market say that Italy is due for a period of export led growth after a decline in GDP this year, that consumer price inflation is falling and that the country's political problems are likely to resolve themselves favourably. In the meantime, Mr Marcus Grubb, equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, says Italian markets may be the focus of attention this week. Last Friday the president, Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, said that the country was close to calling early general elections as Italians strove to turn over a new leaf. This Thursday, says Mr Grubb, is the deadline for the passage of the 1994 budget. He adds that the improved position of the PDS at the December 5 elections has already boosted financial markets, and that the re-establishment of a centre-left party committed to financial retrenchment could provide the boost that the stock market needs: it is not expensive, he says, on a 1994 p/e of 16.4 and with the BCI index 33.7 per cent below the all-time high of 908.2 in May, 1986. Meanwhile, the Chinese warning that British companies will continue to lose out in competition for business in China, unless Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten backs down and shelves his democratic reforms, seemed to concentrate minds about the risk of Chinese sanctions, and whom they would affect. The colony's equity market built on the outstanding 10 per cent gain it scored in the five days to December 10 with a 3.9 per cent rise last week, and after yesterday's 2.3 per cent advance in the Hang Seng index it is running very close to a 100 per cent rise on the year to date. Malaysia cleared that mark last week, its 3.6 per cent gain taking it up by 103 per cent for the year so far. Yesterday in Paris the OECD said that while export growth should ease during the next two years, this should be offset by stronger domestic demand, and that the country was likely to score an 8 per cent GDP growth rate this year, against 8.5 per cent in 1993.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change    % change                 % change in local currency**    sterling**  in US Dlrs**              -----------------------------------------------------------              1 Week  4 Weeks    1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                             1993      1993        1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       -0.82    +2.68    +44.06    +35.50    +30.08      +28.10 Belgium       -0.60    +2.09    +30.60    +28.34    +21.89      +20.03 Denmark       -2.17    -2.01    +31.14    +34.56    +28.34      +26.40 Finland       -2.33    -4.09    +85.81    +88.39    +72.83      +70.21 France        +0.25    +2.86    +30.92    +23.40    +18.80      +16.99 Germany       -0.66    +2.85    +43.97    +38.08    +33.23      +31.20 Ireland       +2.20    +4.41    +54.95    +54.39    +37.17      +35.08 Italy         +3.87   +12.34    +55.50    +43.86    +27.73      +25.79 Netherlands   +0.81    +3.20    +38.51    +36.30    +31.87      +29.87 Norway        +0.79    -2.87    +34.26    +34.39    +27.53      +25.59 Spain         +0.00    +1.06    +43.60    +43.56    +19.20      +17.38 Sweden        +1.26    +0.46    +42.02    +34.92    +15.59      +13.83 Switzerland   +0.71    +4.68    +44.08    +39.56    +42.79      +40.62 UK            +2.37    +7.24    +23.40    +18.70    +18.70      +16.89 EUROPE        +1.14    +4.85    +33.23    +28.16    +24.28      +22.39  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     -0.58    -0.65    +33.38    +28.93    +29.02      +27.05 Hong Kong     +3.91   +15.23   +102.24    +95.68    +99.12      +96.09 Japan         +2.08    -3.37    +13.08    +14.60    +31.96      +29.95 Malaysia      +3.64   +14.03   +104.93   +103.34   +111.83     +108.61 New Zealand   -1.14    -1.97    +41.87    +37.19    +52.10      +49.80 Singapore     +2.62   +11.30    +65.32    +58.33    +65.61      +63.10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        -1.07    -0.31    +21.06    +20.09    +15.89      +14.12 USA           +0.47    +0.84    +6.83      +6.61     +8.26       +6.61 Mexico        +0.22   +11.52    +38.64    +34.98    +37.72      +35.63  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  +3.00    +9.47    +51.47    +50.27    +65.92      +63.39  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +1.18    +1.21    +17.85    +16.84    +21.66      +19.82  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on December 17th 1993.

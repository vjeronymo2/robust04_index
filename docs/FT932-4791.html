			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Russia stalls over EC partnership pact RUSSIA is refusing to sign a partnership agreement with the European Community over the western satellite market as it wants better access to other EC markets, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for trade, announced yesterday that he and the Russian government had clinched an agreement allowing Russia to conduct 12 commercial satellite launches between 1995 and the year 2000. He said, however, that a partnership and co-operation agreement would not be initialled as expected during President Boris Yeltsin's meeting with EC leaders in Copenhagen later this month. 'The progress that remains to complete that task is still substantial,' Sir Leon said, citing as examples artificially low domestic energy prices and the fact that Russian enterprises did not know what their costs were. The deal offered by the EC provides for regular political dialogue between the Community and the Russian leadership, provisions for inward investment, and most favoured nation status with regard to services, including finance, computer technology, and telecommunications. Existing curbs on Russian imports include quantitative restrictions on textiles and steel. As part of its attempt to re-join the international trading community, Russia has decided to apply for membership of Gatt, the free trade group whose secretary-general, Mr Arthur Dunkel, is due to visit Moscow this week. Denmark, which holds the presidency of the EC, hoped an EC-Russia deal could be initialled by President Boris Yeltsin at the Copenhagen summit in two weeks, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels. But the Commission believes it would be unwise to rush into an agreement for political reasons before important problems of substance have been resolved.</p>

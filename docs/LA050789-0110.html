			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF: THE DREAMS OF ZOO ANIMALS BY VALMAI HOWE (ST. MARTIN'S:  $15.95; 226 PP.)  </P> <P> Ever since Freud demonstrated that people actually do not grow apart from  family when they come-of-age -- they merely try to recreate as father and  mother the social dynamics that ordered their lives as son and daughter --  novelists concerned with individual freedom have been busy engineering ways for  their characters to escape the familial trap. Most prominent among them today  is John Fowles, whose dauntless heroines surmount even love to "find their  freedom," often making Jell-O out of noblemen in the process. Sarah, Valmai  Howe's protagonist, continues in this tradition, although at the beginning of  this novel (which has been nominated for the Canadian Book Award), she emerges  as the most gentle of girls: At her most mischievous, she takes a few sea  creatures from rock pools as "prisoners," carefully keeping them in water and  returning them after an hour.  </P> <P> After taking a summer job as a maid at a resort to gain some distance from her  dominating father, Sarah falls in love with Leon, the resort's medical officer.  An intense, lachrymose young man, Leon eventually suffers a nervous breakdown,  however, breaking into a zoo the two had visited and killing a lion they had  seen in a cramped cage "to put him out of his misery." While Leon is in jail  for the crime, Sarah decides to leave Australia and live permanently in  America.  </P> <P> Sarah's decision is presented as a courageous way of preventing herself from  being subsumed by another, but it seems more likely to prevent her identity  from fully flowering. Sarah's personality, after all, is almost singularly  defined by her caring, symbiotic relationship with Leon and several other  friends; in departing so abruptly, she seems to contemn this central dimension  of her identity. Sarah's mistake lies in failing to realize that human  character is defined in relation to other people, not in complete isolation  from them.  </P> <P> "The Dreams of Zoo Animals" has other flaws -- dialogue is often incidental,  for example, and provocative issues are raised and then abruptly dismissed --  but this novel remains compelling for its seemingly earnest text: believable,  one suspects, because Howe, like Sarah, left Australia as a young adult to  begin again in America.  </P></p>

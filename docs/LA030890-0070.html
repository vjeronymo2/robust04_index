			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Einstein Footage Found: Nearly 4,000 feet of rare film on Albert Einstein that  was reported missing after it fell out of a Federal Express delivery truck more  than a week ago was returned to the University of South Carolina Wednesday. The  films and other missing packages were returned by a Columbia, S.C., bail  bondsman who apparently was given the parcels by a man who picked them up  shortly after they fell off the truck.  </P> <P> The films had been on their way from their home at the university to be copied  for a French film maker. A university spokesman said Federal Express will get  another chance to transport the films, which have historical value to  researchers and historians, to their New Jersey destination.

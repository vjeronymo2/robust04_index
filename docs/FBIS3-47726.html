The Commerce source said that since the conclusion of the  Uruguay Round of world trade talks Japan has favoured an  organisation to counter what it sees as Washington's increased  bargaining power.    The ASEAN Secretariat was assigned last October to sound out  whether other countries outside ASEAN would support the  establishment of EAEC. But discussions with officials in China,  Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea have revealed neither strong  support nor outright rejection of the proposal. [passage omitted]    "EAEC is in the middle between ASEAN and APEC but it is  still  doubtful how members would benefit from EAEC as some already  have a strong organisation in ASEAN, so why not expand ASEAN to  cover other countries?" asked the Commerce source.    He said he thought that the visit of a Malaysian delegation  led by International Trade and Industry Minister Dato' Seri  Rafidah Aziz to Thailand and other ASEAN countries this week was  meant to lobby for the establishment of EAEC. [passage omitted]    But he said there was no guarantee that EAEC would  strengthen  the region's bargaining power -- that would depend on the  direction APEC takes. If APEC evolves into a bona fide trade  bloc, EAEC would become irrelevant since all its prospective  members would prefer to cooperate under the APEC umbrella.    EAEC would have better prospects if it included non-APEC  members such as the Indochinese countries, the source predicted.</p>

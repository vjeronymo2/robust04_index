			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Canada's forestry sector shows signs of recovery - Rising lumber prices, due to supply uncertainties, have boosted share prices The cliche that the darkest hour comes before the dawn aptly describes investors' prevailing view of Canada's depressed forestry industry. Almost every major Canadian forest products company is expected to report hefty losses for the fourth quarter of last year. Yet their share prices are steadily climbing. The Toronto stock exchange's paper and forest products index has advanced almost 14 per cent since last November to 3,660 this week. The price jumps in some cases have been little short of spectacular, perhaps because of the illiquidity of the sector, which only has a 2.3 per cent weighting in the TSE 300 index. International Forest Products of Vancouver surged from CDollars 7.63 to CDollars 10.25 in two months. MacMillan Bloedel, the big west coast producer, has climbed from a 1991 low of CDollars 15.50 to over CDollars 20. Pundits are confident that the worst is now over for a sector which has taken one of the most severe beatings of any North American industry over the past two years, with the exception of real estate. 'It's time to take a long-term view and jump in,' says one Toronto forest products analyst. Mr Richard Kellertas, analyst with McLean McCarthy in Montreal, forecasts that the forest products sector as a whole could rise another 15-20 per cent this year. The signs of recovery are most apparent in the lumber and pulp markets. Propelled by the steep fall in US interest rates, March and May lumber futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were at record levels this week. US housing starts grew by 2.6 per cent in December, fuelling hopes that the construction industry, the biggest buyer of timber, is starting to emerge from its slump. Supply uncertainties have also helped drive up lumber prices. The US Forest Service virtually stopped sales of timber in late 1991 from government-owned forests in Oregon and Washington in response to pressure from environmental groups to protect the northern spotted owl and other wildlife. About 8 per cent of total US timber production is expected to be withdrawn between the second half of 1992 and the end of 1993. On the pulp side, North American producers have gained from the recent rise in European currencies. They are due to raise the price of northern softwood pulp by USDollars 20 a tonne at the beginning of February to Dollars 540 a tonne, the second such increase in two months. Canadian producers, who account for more than a quarter of the world's market pulp output, shipped 21 per cent more material last November than a year earlier, thanks largely to their improved competitiveness in Europe. Their inventories have fallen steadily since last August. Companies with a relatively high exposure to lumber and pulp are at the top of analysts 'buy' lists. International Forest has no paper business at all. Other favourites include West Fraser Timber, Canfor Corp and two smaller west coast companies, Primex Forest Products and Slocan Forest. Primex's share price has climbed from CDollars 5.75 to CDollars 7.63 in the past two months. A dark cloud still hangs over newsprint, and the share prices of most newsprint producers have yet to show much sign of movement. Despite a relatively strong balance sheet, Abitibi-Price was trading at CDollars 15.13 this week, exactly where it was last November, and still below its book value. Cut-throat competition is still forcing both US and Canadian newsprint producers to offer discounts of 20-35 per cent on their list prices. The Canadians are at a particular disadvantage, with old machines and high labour costs. Canadian newsprint mills are operating at about 80 per cent of capacity, compared with 97 per cent for the US industry. Despite these handicaps, at least some Canadian newsprint producers may enjoy a marked improvement in profitability later this year. A combination of restructuring, cost-cutting, a weakening Canadian dollar, and low interest rates should show up on bottom lines by the second half. There is even some anecdotal evidence of a shaky recovery in newspaper and magazine advertising, a key element in the newsprint outlook. Several of the big newsprint producers are in the midst of painful but necessary adjustments. Canadian Pacific Forest Products has announced the closure of eight high-cost machines in Quebec and New Brunswick. More than 40 per cent of its capacity will then consist of machines which are less than two years old. CP Forest also announced earlier this month that it is easing its debt burden with a CDollars 218m equity issue. Fletcher Challenge, Abitibi-Price and MacMillan Bloedel are also all in the throes of restructuring. With US forestry stocks at a hefty premium to book value and at high price-earnings multiples, optimists are crossing their fingers in the hope that the Canadian shares will stage at least a partial catch-up when the recovery eventually gets into full swing.</p>

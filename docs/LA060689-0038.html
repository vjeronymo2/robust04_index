			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> $13.7 MILLION FOR 16 ACRES;  </P> <P> BURBANK AIRPORT TO BUY ADJACENT LAND  </P> <P> The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority voted Monday to spend $13.7  million to purchase about 16 acres of land that may eventually be used for  parking and taxiways.  </P> <P> The authority voted 8 to 0 to approve the purchase. Commissioner Mary Lou  Howard, who represents Burbank, was not present.  </P> <P> Airport spokesman Victor Gill said no definite uses for the two properties have  been determined yet, "but it's our policy to purchase land whenever it's  contiguous to the airport."  </P> <P> The commissioners voted to buy a 15.4-acre parcel where several machine shops  and factories are located, south of Sherman Way and north of Clybourn Avenue,  for $13.1 million from Lockheed Corp. Gill said the Lockheed property may be  used for a taxiway parallel to the airport's east-west runway.  </P> <P> In addition, a one-acre parcel at Hollywood Way and Winona Avenue will be  purchased from the Burbank Redevelopment Agency for $600,000. That property  will probably be used for remote parking and could accommodate up to 200 cars,  airport spokeswoman Elly Mixsell said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tested for Contamination  </P> <P> Mixsell said the Lockheed parcel will be tested for soil contamination and  toxic chemicals, although it is not thought to be contaminated.  </P> <P> The company is using a $4-million treatment system to clean chemically tainted  ground water beneath its Burbank plant. The state Water Quality Control Board  has said the Lockheed plant contributed to pollution of ground water that  forced the closure of more than 30 municipal water wells in Burbank and North  Hollywood.  </P> <P> Lockheed will vacate the property by December, and environmental work will be  completed by June 30, 1990, officials said.  </P> <P> Lockheed is transferring virtually all manufacturing, parts fabrication and  engineering activities to newer facilities in Palmdale, Rye Canyon and  Marietta, Ga.  </P> <P> The purchases will bring the total area of the airport to around 450 acres,  officials said. The state law that established the airport authority allows the  airport to grow in acreage, but prohibits the lengthening of its two runways,  Gill said.  </P></p>

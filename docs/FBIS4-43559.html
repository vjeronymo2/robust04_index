			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jutta Roitsch: "DGB Demands Signal From Kohl </F> Even Before the Election"]    [Excerpts] Berlin, 16 Jun -- The Federation of German  Trade Unions [DGB] Congress in Berlin on Thursday [16 June]  noted that its trade unions are determined to practice  solidarity with the unemployed. The trade unions promise "that  one of the focal points in wage policy will be the fairer  distribution of available work." In return, they have demanded  from the Federal Government a "program for economic impulses"  even before the Bundestag election in October.    "When it is true that there is enough work in this society,  then it has to be organized," Hermann Rappe, chairman of the IG  Chemie, the trade union of the chemical industry, said by way of  explaining a notice of motion. Then it must be decided how and  where the work is done and how this work should be paid. The  Federal Government must show its determination to do something  against mass unemployment this year. "If it does not, if there  is no initiative to fight unemployment, then the trade unions  can call for political change," Rappe, who is also a Bundestag  deputy for the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], said.    The employment signal which the DGB expects from the Kohl  government also includes, among other things, that public  investments, particularly in the spheres of transport,  environment, and energy, be made earlier than planned. [passage  omitted]    A premiere, which was much applauded by the delegates, took  place on Wednesday afternoon. The DGB Congress was for the  first time addressed by a spokesman for the Alliance 90. Ludger  Volmer praised the "productive relationship between closeness  and distance" and said that he was hoping that talks would  continue under the new DGB chairman. One of the last  politicians to convey a greetings message on Thursday afternoon  was Gregor Gysi, of the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS];  when he took the floor, the delegates of the IG Chemie left the  room in protest.

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Observer: British disease No other country makes such a song and dance about its budget as does Britain. Now even the British Psychological Society is in on the act, for the first time briefing the nation's media on its own nutty ideas. In the event, Cary Cooper from UMIST, together with his former PhD student Howard Kahn, now at Heriot-Watt, were hard put to go beyond the basic truisms. The budget 'can make people feel more or less financially secure, which can inevitably affect their spending or investing or entrepreneurial behaviours'. When cornered, Cooper and Kahn admitted they had no research to back up their conclusions. Cooper had rung overseas colleagues to see if they had looked into psychology and their budgets. They hadn't. Surprise, surprise.</p>

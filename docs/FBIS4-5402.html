			<p>BFN     [Text] Sendai, April 9 KYODO -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party] executive Kozo Watanabe said Saturday [9 April] the  ruling coalition would welcome legislators from the largest  opposition force, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who want  to join the coalition.    "If there are some LDP members who have the courage to join  an upcoming cabinet, we welcome them," said Watanabe, a  right-hand man of the coalition's behind-the-scene strategist  Ichiro Ozawa.    "We will pick the next prime minister from such a  broad-minded standpoint," Watanabe said in an apparent reference  to former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Michio  Watanabe of the LDP.    The LDP's Watanabe himself dropped hints on Saturday -- for  the second day in a row -- regarding his readiness to form an  alliance with Shinseito.</p>

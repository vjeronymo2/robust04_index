			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Law Society attacks curb on criminal justice report ARRANGEMENTS for publish-ing the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice were attacked by the Law Society yesterday. The society, the solicitors' professional body, is angry at the commission's refusal to give it an advance copy of the report and thereby enable it to prepare a response. The commission is refusing to allow anyone to see the report until tomorrow  -the date of publication. The society's irritation has been increased by the knowledge that several copies of the report have been circulating among senior members of the criminal Bar for several days. The society said the refusal to release the report in advance under embargo would prevent informed debate on the day and would heighten speculation. The commission, which has conducted the widest-ranging review of the English criminal justice system this century, is expected to recommend measures to prevent further miscarriages of justice, speed up criminal justice and cut waste in the system. Among measures expected to be in the report are: Introduction of a formal system of plea bargaining offering sentence discounts for an early plea of guilty. A requirement for defendants to disclose details of their case to the prosecution before trial. An independent tribunal to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice. An independent forensic science service available to defence and prosecution. Safeguards to prevent conviction on the basis of a confession unless it is made in the presence of a third party or supported by other evidence. The commission may also make recommendations curbing an accused person's right to silence. It is, however, believed to be split on whether to recommend abolition of a defendant's right to trial by jury in a case which can be tried by magistrates or in the Crown Court.</p>

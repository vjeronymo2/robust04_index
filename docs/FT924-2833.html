			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound records sharp correction STERLING'S recent gains were wiped out yesterday as investors decided that the time was ripe to pocket their profits, writes Peter John. The bizarre situation of the past few days in which the pound has strengthened with no visible sign of fundamental economic support and the dollar has fallen in spite of repeated nuggets of positive news was reversed. In a thin pre-Christmas market many currencies have been moved purely by technical factors with multi-national companies in particular said to have been keen to buy back sterling in order to balance their books. However, comments by two of the senior economists picked by the government to sit on a new economic advisory panel were seized on as a signal to sell sterling. One of the advisers, Prof Wynne Godley, has argued that base rates should come down to 5 per cent and sterling needed to be devalued by a further 15 per cent. This prompted heavy selling in the Far East and sterling fell sharply against the dollar and D-Mark at the start of dealing in London. By midday, it had tumbled four pfennigs to just above DM2.45 and had lost three cents against the dollar to hit Dollars 1.5639. Then, the blood-letting was staunched and sterling rallied to close at DM2.4650 and Dollars 1.5665. There is a divergence of views in the market with some analysts arguing that the recent rise had nothing to back it up and others seeing 10 pfennigs of upside over the next month or so. Merrill Lynch says longer-term investors and asset managers were 'severely underweight' in sterling until last week and have not yet had time to adjust their positions. The dollar, on the other hand recovered from a few days of pressure prompted by speculators with long positions selling the US currency to square those positions. Dealers said the speculative presure faded yesterday and genuine buying was seen. The dollar recovered to DM1.5705 from DM1.5570 but it was stable against the Yen and Panmure Gordon's chief economist Mr Robin Aspinall said laconically in his latest strategy review; 'The US economy is moving so fast, it is almost trundling'. The D-Mark also lifted, picking up against most of the exchange rate mechanism currencies. There is a general feeling that the Bundesbank will not cut interest rates when it meets today and the D-Mark gained against the lira, the peseta and the franc. The French currency continued weak in spite of some suggestions that the Bank of France had intervened. At least one dealer was adamant that the central bank had been buying francs and another said it had been dipping in and out of the market all day. But, others said that either they had not seen any intervention or that the Bank was simply checking prices. The franc slipped to a low of FFr3.414 against the D-Mark before closing virtually unchanged at FFr3.411.</p>

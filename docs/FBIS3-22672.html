Vujadinovic report: "At Risk Even With `Common' Sex"] </F>   [Text] Regarding the trend that hitherto placed drug  addicts at the top of the groups most at risk of contracting the  AIDS virus, according to data for the last year for the Belgrade  area, where there is the greatest concentration of registered  cases, a certain increase of AIDS cases among heterosexuals has  been detected.    According to Verica Ilic, epidemiologist from the City  Institute for Health Care, in the course of the last year 32 HIV  positive cases were registered, 43 diseased cases, and 58  fatalities. The institute registered some 30 HIV positive cases  among drug addicts, while 31 people contracted the virus through  heterosexual intercourse.    "Two years ago intravenous drug addicts were the group most  at risk. However, last year there was a considerable decrease  of cases in this group -- from 59.7 percent (registered 1992),  the percentage of drug addicts in the total number of HIV  positive cases dropped to 36.6 percent. On the other hand, in  1992 there were 23.6 percent of cases that had contracted HIV  virus through heterosexual intercourse, while in 1993 there was  a considerable increase in the number of such cases, jumping to  32.9 percent of the total," Ilic says.    How then can the possible mass spreading of AIDS virus be  prevented in the future, in view of such a turnabout of the  groups at risk, placing heterosexuals ahead?    "The most difficult thing is to control the sexual behavior  of people, and make them change it. It is particularly  difficult, in view of the turbulent times that we are living in,  to make young people change it. AIDS is certainly a deadly  disease, but those are also an entrance for all the problems  that the young people have today [sentence as published]. On  the one hand, sex is an outlet, but on the other hand, nobody  has enough time for teenagers. It is precisely for that reason  that we are insisting on talking to them and educating them,"  Viktorija Cucic, Yugoslav coordinator for AIDS with the WHO and  chairman of the Yugoslav Association for AIDS Prevention.    Starting from the association's basic goal -- to educate as  many young people as possible, in order to prevent death from  ignorance -- the travelling caravan headed by Cucic has recently  arrived in Montenegro, where a seminar has been held for 95  youngsters. "We also work with the teachers, using the program  "Together Against AIDS." It is about educational seminars  comprising six lessons each, which involve the most contemporary  educational methods. After the seminars, the teachers  themselves organize courses in their schools for students,"  Cucic explains. She also underlines that, given the poor  financial circumstances in Yugoslav health care, knowledge and  sane behavior are now the only available instruments for  fighting AIDS, so the association is making efforts to equip the  people with those instruments in order to develop in them  responsibility for their own health.</p>

[Begin Feijo recording] The priorities of the General State  Budget are still the same: defense, public order, health,  education, and social welfare. The adjustment proposal calls  for higher allotments to those items.    The Council of Ministers also approved a draft law on the  exemption of customs duties on basic commodities like rice,  sugar, beans, soap, medicines, and frozen meat.

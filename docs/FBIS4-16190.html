			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Knyazkov report under the "Postscriptum Events and </F> Comments" rubric: "Shooting on Baltic Practice Ranges May Drag  Out. The Signing by Presidents of Russia and Latvia of Accords  on Russian Troops Withdrawal From This Baltic Country Is  Postponed"]    [Text] The Defense Ministry of Estonia has announced that  servicemen of the 114th Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian  Armed Forces stationed in Tallinn conducted on 7 April practice  firing on the Manchiku range on Tallinn's outskirts without  permission from the Estonian authorities. Representatives of  the Estonian Armed Forces were not invited to the range to  observe the firing practice.    "Yes, we do hold combat training sessions," Guards Colonel  Yevgeniy Lazebin, the division's chief of staff, said,  confirming the information. "It is not being done spontaneously  but rather in line with approved plans and schedules.  Servicemen perform firing drills using submachine guns, and  practice grenade throwing which, incidentally, is done once  every six months. Since we have not handed over the range to  Estonia, it is being used for regular training sessions of which  we are not supposed to notify the Estonian side," Lazebin  underlined.    It is not accidental that KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has to explain in  such detail what appears to be a fairly banal situation  involving servicemen of the Northwestern Group of Forces. It so  happened that precisely the same situation that took shape two  weeks earlier in Latvia led to a protest note by the Foreign  Ministry of the Republic of Latvia. It maintained that during a  16 March firing practice, unsanctioned by local authorities, on  the firing range of the Russian military unit stationed in  Stopinskaya Volost of Riga Rayon, an incident took place between  Latvian militia members and Russian servicemen. Alas, this  information, too, needs some explaining. Col. Igor Golin, chief  of the Northwestern Group of Forces press center, explained that  the practice firing was carried out on a planned basis and had  been agreed with the local authorities -- not by Russian  servicemen at all, but by civilians: militarized guards hired  on contract to guard the Russian military unit's storages.    The Baltic states' desire to part with the Russian army as  soon as possible is to be appreciated. And for as long as it  remains in Latvia and Estonia, combat training will continue  there. It may even drag out because both in the Baltics and in  Russia there are many forces wishing to derail the dialogue  between Russia and the Baltic countries. As Sergey  Krasavchenko, deputy head of the Russian president's staff, has  stated to ITAR-TASS, "the error (in the Russian Federation  president's directive No. 174 on the creation of military bases  in CIS states and the Latvian Republic. -- Note by S.K.) was not  technical but a political action aimed at derailing the meeting  between the heads of Russia and Latvia. The aim has,  unfortunately, been reached -- Guntis Ulmanis has canceled the  visit to Moscow planned for 20 April.</p>

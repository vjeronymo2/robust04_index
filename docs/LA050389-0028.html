			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA PLAYOFFS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KNICKS COMPLETE SWEEP WITH OVERTIME WIN  </P> <P> Gerald Wilkins' 18-foot jumper with six seconds left in overtime gave the New  York Knicks a 116-115 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers Tuesday night and a  sweep of their first-round Eastern Conference playoff series at Philadelphia.  </P> <P> The Knicks, who won the first two games of the best-of-five series at New York,  will meet the winner of the Chicago-Cleveland series.  </P> <P> The Knicks trailed, 115-114, with 12 seconds left when Charles Oakley threw the  ball inbounds to Wilkins, who took several dribbles, pulled up and scored over  the 76ers' Maurice Cheeks.  </P> <P> Charles Barkley, who led Philadelphia with 29 points, got one more shot for the  76ers, but the ball caromed off the rim as time ran out.  </P> <P> Mark Jackson led the Knicks with 24 points, including three from three-point  range. He got help from Wilkins, who had 22 points, and Johnny Newman and  Oakley, who each had 17.  </P> <P> At the start of the overtime period, Wilkins and Newman scored on layups to  give the Knicks a 110-106 lead. But jumpers by Ron Anderson and Barkley tied it  with 3:42 left. Barkley then took a pass underneath from Anderson and dunked it  to give Philadelphia a 112-110 lead with 2:40 remaining.  </P> <P> New York's 7-foot center, Patrick Ewing, who scored only eight points and was  in foul trouble most of the game, made two free throws for a tie with 2:17 to  go.  </P> <P> With 54 seconds left, Tucker made a jumper from the corner that gave the Knicks  a 114-112 lead. Gerald Henderson's three-pointer put the 76ers back on top with  45 seconds left and then came Wilkins' winning basket.  </P> <P> Detroit 100, Boston 85 -- It was only the second time in 36 playoff seasons  that the Celtics, who have a National Basketball Assn.-high 16 titles, failed  to win a postseason game.  </P> <P> Detroit outscored Boston, 27-8, in the last 9:17 at Boston and, behind Vinnie  Johnson's 25 points, completed a 3-0 sweep that ended the Celtics' shortest  playoff season since 1956.  </P> <P> Detroit held Boston to fewer than 100 points for the third consecutive game,  and limited the Celtics to 30 points after they led, 55-51, at halftime. The  Celtics had only 12 points in the fourth quarter after leading, 73-71, entering  the period.  </P> <P> The last time the Celtics failed to survive the first round was 33 years ago,  when they lost, 2-1, to Syracuse. They were swept for the first time since a  4-0 loss to Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 1983.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 117, Atlanta 113 -- Ricky Pierce scored a career-high 35 points and  converted a go-ahead three-point play with 32 seconds left in overtime at  Milwaukee as the Bucks took a 2-1 lead in their best-of-five Eastern Conference  playoff series.  </P> <P> After Pierce's three-point play gave Milwaukee a 112-109 lead, Atlanta's Reggie  Theus scored with 19 seconds to go. But Milwaukee's Fred Roberts scored on a  dunk and then made a free throw after a break-away foul to put the Bucks ahead,  115-111, with 13 seconds remaining.  </P> <P> Antoine Carr scored for Atlanta with five seconds left, but Sidney Moncrief  made two free throws with three seconds remaining.  </P> <P> Phoenix 130, Denver 121 -- The Suns' resurgence continued through the first  round of their Western Conference series as they completed a three-game sweep  at Denver.  </P> <P> Tom Chambers, recovering from a miserable first half, scored 19 of his 32  points in the fourth quarter, and Phoenix rallied from a 23-point deficit.  </P> <P> The Suns played poorly in the first half, and trailed, 72-54, at halftime.  Denver extended its lead to 84-61 early in the third quarter on Michael Adams'  three-pointer.  </P> <P> But Phoenix closed the deficit to 101-88 at the end of the period and then  rallied in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Nuggets, 42-20. The Suns made  their first 13 shots and shot 17 for 22 in the period.  </P> <P> Denver, playing without injured starters Fat Lever and Danny Schayes, was led  by Walter Davis with 26 points. Alex English and Adams each had 22.  </P> <P> Chambers, who had only five points on one-of-nine shooting in the first half,  shared scoring honors with Kevin Johnson, who also had 32 points, 15 in the  first quarter.  </P> <P> Chambers, scoring on jumpers, dunks and free throws, had 15 points in the first  five minutes of the fourth quarter, helping the Suns close the gap to 114-109.  </P></p>

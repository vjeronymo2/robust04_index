			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Nahum Barne'a: "Goldstein's Victory"] </F>   [Text] Sitting somewhere in hell's nether regions, if hell  has any, Dr. Barukh Goldstein is looking down on the world and  laughing. His personal operation has succeeded beyond all  expectations.    The bullets he fired in Hebron kindled a fire in the Israeli  Arab sector. He dreamed to prove that Yafo is Hebron. And so  is Rahat. And Shefar'am. The Muslim world is also on fire. The  fire is threatening peace, security, and the country's inner  strength. You are now a shahid [Arabic for martyr], Goldstein.  Our own shahid. How nice for you.    A tree alley leading nowhere was once planted behind the  grocery store at the Qiryat Arba' entrance. It was named the  Kahana Alley. Beyond the edge of the planted area was where your  temporary grave was dug yesterday. All the village drunks and  junkies will come to carouse around the grave at night, dancing  and singing Blessed Be Messiah, Blessed Be He, until one of two  things happens: Either you will be moved to the Jewish cemetery  in the heart of Hebron, or Qiryat Arba' will be moved away.    Do you get it, Barukh?    They had heavy rains there yesterday, Barukh, and the rain  obliterated the last traces of Purim makeup off the children's  faces. Purim is over, and it left behind heaps of empty  bottles, a headache, and grief. The Army has clamped a closure  on Qiryat Arba'. The closure is rubbish, of course. We can  easily drive nuts any poor soldier dazed by the many orders he  has received. But the feeling of being blackballed is  intolerable. Sodom and Gomorrah they call us. We, Kahanists,  couldn't care less, but we feel awkward about the neighbors.    Yesterday the government decided to set up a state  commission  of inquiry. Rabin is angry. The Army is sweating buckets. The  Army will try to blame you for everything: You came, shot,  killed, were killed. But other charges will be brought forward  all around. The right wing will try to argue that you did not  just kill. That there were reasons. That there was a climate.  That the government is to blame. Because in Israel, a man is  never responsible for his acts: not for the Stock Exchange, not  for the murder of a taxi driver, and definitely not for a mosque  murder.    The media will suspect that the Army is tampering with the  evidence. Proof: On Saturday, soldiers were brought in to  scrub off all traces of the event in the cave. Proof: No one,  except uniformed Army personnel, has seen the place to this very  day. No one has been given official permission to talk to the  soldiers who were on spot, no one but their commanders.  Versions given out by the Army elevate you to Rambo's pedestal.  Your single gun has killed a thousand people. You? It could  be true, but it is unconvincing.    The Shin Bet, the Army, possibly the prime minister and  defense minister will be asked by the commission to explain why  we were permitted to do as we liked in Hebron, why we were  permitted to wear uniforms, exercise authority, go unpunished.  We will stand there as the guardians of enlightened justice and  democracy. Administrative detention? Being discharged from the  Army without a trial? Banishment? They are nothing. Dreifus  will look silly compared to Marzel, and No'am Federman will be  Emile Zola. Will you laugh!    At a certain point the commission will discover that we are  just the tip of the iceberg. The rules of the game should be  changed drastically. Not only in Qiryat Arba', throughout the  territories. Before the state hands powers over to the PLO, it  needs to recoup its powers from the settlers. Otherwise it will  have nothing to hand over. How can a 20-year reality be changed  now? Better give up the agreement.    Didn't Rabbi Kahana always say that the worse it gets, the  better? He said it and you made it true. You set the Israeli  Arabs and Jews against each other. That is good. You sowed  dissension among Jews. That is wonderful. Now the entire  settler population is identified with Rabbi Kahana.    You wiped out their coexistence illusion. They arranged a  make-believe coexistence in the Cave of the Patriarchs, and you  shot it to death. Very good. And you caused a lot of rational,  decent Israelis to look at the bodies on television and say:  Kudos to you. No more spilling of Jewish blood. And you did  it, just you.    Therefore, we drink to your death, Goldstein. Rabbi Kahana  said a little Kahanist hides inside each of us. Your death was  his resurrection.</p>

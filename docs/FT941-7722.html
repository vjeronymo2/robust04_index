			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Canon endorses IBM's PowerPC technology Canon, the Japanese camera and office equipment maker, has agreed to use US computer group IBM's PowerPC microprocessor technology in future computer products, and will help refine technology for use in consumer products and hand-held devices. The Canon endorsement represents a breakthrough for IBM, which aims to establish PowerPC as an industry standard competing with Intel's dominant microprocessor technology. Canon is the first computer systems manufacturer, other than Apple and IBM itself, to adopt PowerPC as a strategic technology. Canon is not, however, a big participant in the personal computer market and the agreement does not include any plans for Canon to incorporate PowerPC in its widely used printers, cameras or copying machines, IBM said. IBM said that it has distributed about 800 PowerPC 'reference specifications' to companies exploring the use of the technology. The agreement with Canon 'may be the first of many,' a spokesman said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter] </F>   [Text] Islamabad -- According to responsible sources, it  has been decided after high-level consultations to file a case  in the U.S. court through Pakistan's American legal adviser if  the F-16 fighter planes, P3C and N [as published] fighter  planes, and other defense equipment manufactured [for Pakistan]  and being stored in the United Sates are not supplied to  Pakistan by April. Pakistan has so far paid the United States  $1.01 billion for the defense equipment. If the equipment is  not supplied by April, then Pakistan's American legal adviser  will be directed to take this legitimate case to the court to  seek a clarification as to why the equipment was not sent to  Pakistan despite the fact that Pakistan already paid for them.    The sources said that the legal adviser whose services were  sought by Pakistan in the United States has completed  preparation of documents on the U.S. failure to supply the  defense equipment on schedule despite Pakistan fulfilling all  the obligations under the deal. The U.S. legal expert has  informed the Government of Pakistan that despite the existence  of the Pressler Amendment, Pakistan's case in relation to the  defense items is very strong. If this case is filed at a U.S.  court, then it can easily be proven that agreements --  liabilities of which Pakistan had been fulfilling even after the  implementation of the Pressler Amendment in October 1990 -- are  not covered by the amendment.    The sources said that when the opinion of the U.S. legal  adviser was ignored by the United States and the proposal for an  intergovernmental group to sort out the relevant legal issues  was rejected, Pakistani policymakers then decided to wait until  April to allow fulfillment of the U.S. promise of taking  political steps to do away with the discriminatory nature of the  Pressler Amendment. The sources said that Pakistan paid a total  of $1.01 billion to the United States for these defense items.  The funds were not taken as a loan, but were paid to the United  States in installments from the Pakistani exchequer.    According to the deal, Pakistan should have received 12 F-16  planes for its Air Force, three P3C planes for its Navy, and  other defense equipment produced for Pakistan by now. The  United States, however, is consistently saying that the U.S.  military aid to Pakistan has been suspended under the Pressler  Amendment and that the equipment will be supplied to Pakistan  after the Pressler Amendment issue is resolved. The sources  said that Pakistan has informed the United States at the  diplomatic level that it is being questioned by Pakistani public  opinion as to why the defense equipment cannot be obtained from  the United States even after Pakistan paid $1.01 billion for  them.</p>

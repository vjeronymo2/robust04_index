			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOARD ACTS CALLOUSLY IN CLOSING WELFARE OFFICE  </P> <P> There is a perception in the community that anyone living anywhere in the South  County area is financially well off, lives in an expensive home and drives a  luxury car. It is, of course, a myth.  </P> <P> But the county supervisors, who can reasonably be expected to know better,  sometimes act as if they actually believe that there are no poor people living  in the rapidly growing southern area. Maybe it's that they just don't care.  </P> <P> If they do care, why would they take such a callous approach to the plight of  the poor as to close the only county welfare office in South County? The office  serves hundreds of poor people each month. And the closure comes at a time when  the county has been generally moving in the other direction to provide police,  fire and other decentralized services to residents far away from the county  seat in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> With the office closed, single mothers and senior citizens, residents who need  the nearby service the most, will be the ones hardest hit. Many of them have no  autos. To get the service that was available close to them until Friday, they  now must ride the bus to Costa Mesa, a journey that requires three transfers  and takes about five hours for a round trip. That is a tiring journey for  anyone. For a single mother with four children in tow, or a senior citizen in  poor health, it is a major undertaking that a more sensitive and caring county  board would not subject them to.  </P> <P> The supervisors say they want to save money, supposedly only for a few months  while a full-service welfare office in Laguna Hills is being planned. But for  now, there is not even a guarantee that the services being discontinued in  South County will be available at the new office. No money has been allocated  for the staff needed. A $178,000 budget request for the new office was rejected  by the supervisors in August. And there is no assurance that the money will be  provided in January when the supervisors are scheduled to review supplemental  budget requests.  </P> <P> Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who represents the area and has been a supporter of  the social services provided, has vowed to lobby for money to open the new  Laguna Hills branch office. The other supervisors should provide the funds  needed.  </P> <P> It made no sense to close the office that has been operating in San Juan  Capistrano for the past five years if the county is serious about reopening it  in a few months. Board policy has been not to act on supplemental budgets until  the mid-year review. But policy is just something the board puts down on paper.  It can, and should, change it when common sense and need dictate.  </P> <P> Some local officials, social workers and administrators of several agencies  serving the poor were understandably upset by the county decision closing the  branch office. To them, it was an indication that the county did not recognize  the need for the office, or the extent of the problems facing poor people in  South County.  </P> <P> About 300 South County residents used the South County welfare service each  month. The need is there. The South County office should be too.  </P></p>

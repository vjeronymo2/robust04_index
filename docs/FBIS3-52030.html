He added that it was this fight that  prompted guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia (FARC) to kill 11 Ecuadoran policemen and soldiers.    The Ecuadoran official announced that U.S. Secretary of  State  Warren Christopher sent a note to Ecuadoran President Sixto  Duran-Ballen lamenting the death of the 11 uniformed men during  a FARC ambush. The 11 men were involved in a narcotics  operation in the area of the Putumayo River, at the Colombian  border, in December 1993.    The U.S. Government "realizes these personnel were killed  while courageously confronting and combating the threat of  international drug trafficking, and it values the sacrifices  made by the national government in this struggle," Christopher  stated.    The note from the United States also "guarantees that its  government will do everything it can to help Ecuador in this  effort," Paredes pointed out.    The foreign minister added that Ecuador will not budge in  its  struggle against drug trafficking and terrorism through the  application of the law without having second thoughts, and by  respecting human rights and the country's institutional system.</p>

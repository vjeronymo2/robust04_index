			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Sanyo plans Y22bn flash memory chip investment Sanyo Electric, a leading Japanese consumer electronics company, is planning to invest Y22bn (Dollars 203m) in flash memory chip production. Flash memory, an advanced silicon chip which 'remembers' what has been written on it without the need for constant electronic refreshment, is now a Dollars 500m market worldwide. Forecasters are predicting 100 per cent growth each year for the foreseeable future. It is seen as essential for success in portable computers and other portable electronics products. Intel, the world's largest semiconductor company and leader in the flash memory field, is marketing the chips as a replacement for hard disk drives in portable computers. The technology was invented by Toshiba of Japan, but Intel secured the leadership position by improving chip designs and making them both manufacturable and affordable. Flash memory has the advantage of high shock resistance, speed and low power consumption. While it is still more expensive than hard disk storage, it is expected to replace conventional semiconductor memory chips (DRams) as the leading high-speed memory technology by 1995. Sanyo plans to begin production of 1m bit chips in February and 4m bit chips in May. The company has signed a licensing agreement with Silicon Storage Technology (SST), a California-based chip designer and manufacturer. Sanyo will use SST's design and technology to manufacture the chips, which will then be supplied to the US company under the Sanyo brand name. Sanyo will also sell its chips in the merchant market, and supply processed silicon wafers, on which the chips are printed, for flash memory cards. Sanyo said its monthly output of chips would be about 500,000 each of the 1m bit and 4m bit variety. Sales next year from all suppliers are expected to amount to some 60m chips.</p>

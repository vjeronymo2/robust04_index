			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Technology: Semi-solids give extra strength - Ian Rodger on a Swiss company's technique for making car parts With the world car market in its present shaky state, now might not seem a good time to be developing techniques for manufacturing automotive parts. But Buhler, a large Swiss engineering group known mainly for its flour mills and other food processing machinery, is pushing ahead with a technology for forming high-performance light metal components. The technology, known as rheocasting or semi-solid metal casting (SSM), was developed in the material science laboratories of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the early 1970s but did not attract wide interest until recently because the patent rights were closely held and poorly exploited and the car industry was concentrating on easier ways to reduce vehicle weight. The technology is based on the fact that metal alloys move gradually from liquid to solid state over a range of temperatures. Within that range, they are in a semi-solid state with a consistency of butter or toothpaste. MIT researchers, led by Merton Flemings, became interested in this phenomenon with a view to improving the quality of die cast parts. They focused first on steel alloys, then moved to aluminium where the temperatures involved were much lower and so the material was easier to work with. The alloy, in the form of a semi-solid bar or slug, can be squeezed into a die or mould and cooled in the desired shape. MIT researchers discovered that this semi-solid state could be achieved in common aluminium alloys through a simple mechanical stirring process. Aluminium producers Alusuisse of Switzerland and Pechiney of France now do this by electromagnetic stirring. The resulting component retains better metallic properties than one made from the conventional liquid die-casting process. In conventional die-casting, the process of injecting liquid metal into a die causes turbulence, which results in unpredictable levels of gas entrapment. This undermines the strength of the component. SSM castings, on the other hand, are free of gas bubbles, and so can be heat-treated or welded and used in applications hitherto open only to premium cast or forged components. Furthermore, because the SSM process uses lower heat levels than liquid die casting - about 580'C compared with 680'C - a consistent chemical analysis can be more easily maintained because fewer elements burn off. There is less oxide formation and much less shrinkage during cooling. Cycle time can be faster because there is no long wait for the component to cool. SSM castings also have a big advantage over premium castings and forgings in that they can be made closer to net shape, thus reducing machining requirements. Buhler, which is a leading producer of conventional die-casting machines, has been interested in SSM technology since the early 1980s. 'We saw it as offering the opportunity for us to move into new markets,' says Ken Young, vice-president, engineering and technology, in the die-casting division. The group was one of the first to exploit the technology when the original MIT patents expired in 1992. It has developed a line of die-casting machines that can operate with both liquid or semi-solid metal feed - an electronic control automatically regulates the speeds and pressures of the plunger that pushes the metal into the die. Buhler calls its new line SC, an abbreviation of shot control, and says the control is sensitive enough to ensure almost perfect consistency of components. Young says SSM cast parts can be produced at costs equivalent to premium castings, excluding savings on machining. Savings on parts that are now forged can range from 10 per cent to 50 per cent, depending on the part's complexity. So far, sales of the SC machines have been modest and the line is not yet profitable. But Buhler is willing to be patient.</p>

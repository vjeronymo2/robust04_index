			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Observer: Bye-bye Brown? Never mind the quality, feel the name. This seemed to be the motto of many of the entrepreneurs who were chasing up the share prices of London's small merchant banks only a few years ago. However, times have changed, and owning a famous nameplate no longer attracts quality business the way it once did - otherwise Brown Shipley would not be thinking of selling its 182-year-old merchant bank to Kredietbank, its biggest shareholder. Montagu Norman, the most famous governor of the Bank of England, used to work at Brown, Shipley &amp; Co, as did ex-premier Sir Edward Heath. In its heyday Brown Shipley was one of the great transatlantic banking partnerships, on a par with the House of Morgan. Alexander Brown, a Belfast linen merchant, had emigrated to Baltimore; his firm remains a force in the business as does New York's Brown Brothers, Harriman which for over 100 years was part of the London firm. It's a great pity - but Brown, Shipley &amp; Co has long since drifted off course and seems to be following into retirement other once famous names like Arbuthnot Latham, Antony Gibbs, Seligman Bros and Wm Brandts. The name may linger on, but perhaps not much else.</p>

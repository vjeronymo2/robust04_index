			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Brittan warns UK over costs of shunning Emu Mr John Major's government was warned yesterday it could not 'wish away' the prospect of a single European currency as Sir Leon Brittan delivered a strong defence of Britain's place in the European Union. In a carefully-argued lecture in the City dismissing the views of Tory Eurosceptics and challenging some of the government's assumptions, Sir Leon, a former Conservative cabinet minister and recently reappointed as Britain's senior commissioner in Brussels, insisted the balance of costs and benefits for the UK remained in favour of the EU. He warned that whether or not the government chose eventually to exercise its opt-out from the single currency, it must participate actively in preparations for economic and monetary union. In a clear challenge to Mr Major's scepticism towards the idea of submerging sterling into a single currency, Sir Leon said the costs of standing aside from Emu would be significant. His speech came as the government confirmed that the first crucial Commons vote on legislation to allow higher contributions to Brussels would be on November 28, the day before the Budget. Mr Major's warning of a general election if the government lost appeared to have reduced the number of potential Tory rebels to five or six. With rebels facing possible suspension or expulsion from the parliamentary party, senior ministers voiced confidence the bill that would be passed intact. Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, signalled that he will seek to defeat the government if there is a real opportunity to force an election. But Labour would not be drawn into a trap designed to bolster Mr Major's authority. Sir Leon told his audience that those who thought Emu would not happen misunderstood the commitment in the rest of Europe. It was unlikely that a single currency would be created much before the end of the century. It was clear also it would not include all member states initially. But 'this does not mean, as some sceptics would have us believe, that it will not happen at all. Nor does it mean we can sit back and wait for 1999'. Delivering the Proudfoot Autumn lecture, Sir Leon stressed that member states were already working to meet the convergence conditions for Emu laid down in the Maastricht treaty. The European Monetary Institute, forerunner of the planned European central bank, and commercial banks were working on the practicalities of a single currency. And EU governments had begun to promote convergence of their real economies by promoting supply-side reforms. Sir Leon acknowledged that Britain might stay out of the first wave of countries, but added that the price would once again be exclusion from the central core of Europe. That would have harsh implications 'not just for our economy but even for our security'. European monetary union 'on course for 1997', Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

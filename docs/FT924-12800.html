			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bramalea's five-year financial restructuring BRAMALEA, one of two big property groups controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family, is making a new effort to persuade holders of CDollars 525m senior debentures to accept its five-year financial restructuring, writes Robert Gibbens. A committee representing the debenture-holders has blocked the company's plan, saying it is unrealistic. The scheme hinges on selling half of Bramalea's CDollars 6bn (USDollars 4.8bn) land and commercial property portfolio. Secured creditors would get notes and common stock, effectively giving them majority control. Mr Marvin Marshall, president, has said that Bramalea has developed a contingency plan to provide CDollars 65m extra cash-flow in 1993-1994. The restructuring plan is viable, he insisted. Bramalea is 'well advanced' in the sale of its 50 per cent interest in a big Toronto stores mall. Industry sources say Trizec, 72 per cent owner of Bramalea, will be the buyer.</p>

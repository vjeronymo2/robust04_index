			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> TOPOL DOESN'T FIDDLE WITH AGE  </P> <P> Israeli actor Topol is finally acting his age, even if it's in the same part.  </P> <P> Topol was only 30 when he began playing dairyman Teyve in "Fiddler on the  Roof," which opens Thursday night at the Forrest Theater here.  </P> <P> The part calls for a man between 55 and 65, and Topol is still only 54.  </P> <P> "At 30, I had to put a lot of energy into the part in order to make it  believable," he told the Philadelphia Daily News in a telephone interview from  St. Louis, the production's last stop before Philadelphia.  </P> <P> "I was the father of girls almost my age in real life, husband to a wife in  real life older than I was," he said. "However, I admit that very early in my  career I loved to play older characters, probably because it was kind of hiding  behind the character rather than coming on stage and playing yourself."  </P></p>

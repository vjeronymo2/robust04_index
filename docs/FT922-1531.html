			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Perot vs Bush, hawk vs rabbit IT HAS long been evident that there is little love lost between President George Bush and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire challenging him for the presidency. But the depth and age of their feud became clearer this weekend. Mr Perot has recently refrained from direct abuse of Mr Bush, although he has joined the chorus ridiculing Vice-President Dan Quayle's inability to spell 'potato'. But in a conversation six years ago that appears destined to enter the folklore of the 1992 presidential campaign, he apparently called the then Vice President Bush a 'rabbit'. According to the Washington Post, Mr Perot's hostility was sparked by his obsession with the fate of American servicemen missing in Vietnam. Dissatisfied with Mr Bush's lukewarm support for his efforts to locate US prisoners of war, Mr Perot launched, the Post reports, a series of unsuccessful investigations designed to implicate Mr Bush in tax and investment scandals, as well as in the Iran-Contra and October Surprise affairs. 'This world is full of lions and tigers and rabbits, and you're a rabbit,' he told Mr Bush, according to the Post. The episode appears unlikely to do much to change voters' attitudes. Those who find Mr Bush indecisive will think the 'rabbit' gibe apposite, while those who worry about Mr Perot's respect for the US constitution will find fresh evidence in his habit of unleashing investigators on anyone who crosses him.</p>

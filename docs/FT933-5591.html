			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Revamped Plantsbrook shows 21% expansion to Pounds 5.96m PLANTSBROOK, the funeral services group that has undergone extensive reorganisation, boosted interim pre-tax profits by 21 per cent, from Pounds 4.91m to Pounds 5.96m. Mr Peter Hindley, chief executive, attributed the rise to continued emphasis on client care and service, stringent cost controls and tight management. 'Our market share remains stable and we are optimistic that our recent acquisitions and new sites will enhance our overall performance', he said. The group has just under 9 per cent of the UK funeral market, and reported turnover just ahead at Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 26.2m). Dignity in Destiny, the previously loss-making pre-paid funeral scheme, was now contributing to profits, said Mr Hindley. In the past 18 months the group had reduced costs by closing 80 branches. During the first half it acquired three businesses for Pounds 1.8m and opened five new branches, taking the total to 330. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 334,000 (Pounds 1.3m). Gearing, which reached 415 per cent two years ago, had been reduced to 28 per cent compared with 75 per cent a year earlier. The group, which raised Pounds 10.5m through a rights issue in March last year, made a Pounds 2m placement in December and a further Pounds 2m placement in May. Mr Hindley said the group had repaid Pounds 3.6m of hire purchase debt at 10 per cent on its vehicles, and reduced its debtors by Pounds 1m in the period. Fully diluted earnings per share were 3.83p (4.31p). The interim dividend is raised to 1.1p (1p). Mr James Brown and Mr Graham Barber, both operational directors, were yesterday appointed to the board.</p>

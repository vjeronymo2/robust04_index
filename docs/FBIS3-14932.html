The statement was made after his meeting with Duma Chairman  Ivan Rybkin, following the State Duma decision on amnesty for  the leaders of the 1991 August failed coup, May Day riots and  the October 1993 revolt in Moscow.    Filatov said that the recent events have revealed the lack  of  proper interaction between the two branches. He noted that both  sides will set up working groups to iron out disagreements  before March 10 when the Duma, the lower house, will reconvene.  However, he refused to say in what particular directions the  groups will be working, adding that the State Duma, as a  collegiate body, should first "hold an internal discussion of  what has happened."    Speaking about reports that Yeltsin was planning to address  the nation on television tonight, Filatov said he did not know  anything about it.    "It is most important to understand that the Duma's  resolution means amnesty for only some people, but the  investigation should be carried on," Filatov said.    The meeting was also attended by Acting Public Prosecutor  Aleksey Ilyushenko, Yeltsin's representative in the State Duma  Aleksandr Yakovlev and his senior aide Georgiy Satarov.</p>

Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Defense Agency Chief Kazuo  Aichi will meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and  Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner for a discussion of  bilateral and regional security issues.    Coming as concerns grow over Japan-U.S. trade relations, the  talks are intended to promote understanding between Tokyo and  Washington in order to prevent trade frictions from affecting  political and security affairs, the sources said.    The talks are expected to focus on North Korea's suspected  nuclear weapons development program and the strengthening of the  military in China as well as touching upon the issue of U.S.  military bases in Okinawa.    The meeting is also likely to consider revisions to Japanese  defense plans in the post-Cold War world and military reductions  by the United States, the sources suggested.    Until December 1990, the security talks had been attended by  the U.S. Ambassador to Japan and the commander of the U.S.  forces in the Pacific with the foreign minister and the Defense  Agency director general.    It was agreed to upgrade the talks, but the higher level  talks have yet to be held because of the changes in the  international situation.    Wisner is accompanying Christopher on his three-nation tour  of the Asia-Pacific region and will attend the talks for  Secretary of Defense William Perry who did not make the trip.</p>

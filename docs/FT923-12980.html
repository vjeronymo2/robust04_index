			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Letter: A catechism offered in defence of economic unorthordoxy Sir, How refreshing to find that attacks on economic orthodoxy can sometimes actually produce articulated outrage and not only the usual dismissive silence. But may I briefly reply to Messrs Thomsen and Wood (Letters, 13 July)? For Mr Thomsen, a catechism. Does he really believe that: Nissan is 'no better' than the British car manufacturers which it has displaced in Britain's domestic and export markets? if Britain's car and TV industries had also received what he considers was the salutary punishment for inefficiency meted out to the British motor-bike industry - namely extinction - we would rapidly have found other ways of earning enough foreign exchange to import as many cars and TVs as we now enjoy? How might our friend the invisible hand have done it? Banking services? Tweeds and whisky? the North American Free Trade Area and the European Single Market are so small that Japanese investors have to forego available economies of scale? Japanese neo-mercantilist planners were mistaken in the 1950s when they decided to protect, invest in, and build future world competitiveness in industries which (a) had higher value-added per employee, and (b) had greater world-income elasticity of demand, and (c) kept them closer to the world frontiers of technological development, than those in which they currently had comparative advantage? in so doing they reduced world economic welfare? For Prof Wood: may I lend him a recent paper by a current guru, Jagdish Bagwati, chief economic adviser to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He quite explicitly bewails the failure of theory to demonstrate that when two countries' prices differ trade always brings mutual advantages, no matter why they differ.

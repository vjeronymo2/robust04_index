			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Heseltine 'excluded' Treasury from DTI reviews Mr Michael Heseltine ordered the exclusion of Treasury officials from fundamental spending reviews at the Department of Trade and Industry. He then prematurely wound up the exercise four months before it was due to be completed. The trade and industry secretary is understood to have said that the working parties, which involved members of the DTI and Treasury officials, were taking up 'too much time' and that he had his own ways of scrutinising budgets. Mr Heseltine's action in February throws further light on the friction between him and Mr Michael Portillo, the new employment secretary, over the public spending review. Their differences came into the open earlier this week with the leaking of a letter in which Mr Portillo, then chief secretary to the Treasury, upbraided Mr Heseltine for failing to support policies to cut taxation and spending. Mr Portillo pressed Mr Heseltine to accept drastic cuts in a large number of DTI programmes and to end support for shipbuilding and an independent UK space programme. Civil servants said yesterday the tone of Mr Portillo's letter may have been influenced by Mr Heseltine's premature winding up of the reviews and the fact that he barred Treasury officials from the final meetings. Government officials, however, also said they were not surprised by the letter. 'The debate that has surfaced about what is the role of the DTI is one that has gone on for a long time, and it has never been resolved,' said one official. 'This time it has emerged in a sharpish form.' The reviews were devised to examine what Whitehall departments should be doing. The DTI review began late last year, with a number of working parties. Two months into the planned six-month review, Mr Heseltine said he wanted the working groups to be wound up within 2 1/2 weeks and that Treasury officials should be barred from attending their final deliberations. The groups concluded their work without the Treasury being part of the process. The Treasury said yesterday that it could not comment on actions by officials in another department. The DTI also said it was unable to comment.</p>

The document describes the state of law and order in the  republic as critical. The main reasons for this, as spelled out  in the text of the edict, "are the worsening socioeconomic and  political situation, a fall in people's living standards, a  lowering of public morals, and the legal nihilism that has  gripped society and the power structures".    The president believes that the problem is so acute that it  must be made a priority, a nationwide task upon which the  stabilization of the situation and the fate of economic reforms  in the country is depending. The edict instructs the government  to work out before 1 April a state program on the strengthening  of public order. Power ministries must organize the patrolling  of urban streets and residential areas. To achieve this, it is  being proposed that the general public be drawn into this  process and that material incentives for this work be introduced.    At the same time, measures are being stepped up in the  procedure for checking passports. The document provides the  media with the opportunity to inform the population about how  the state's anti-crime program is proceeding.</p>

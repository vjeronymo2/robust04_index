			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Easier borrowing A CUT in Danish short-term interest rates yesterday bolstered hopes of easier borrowing conditions across Europe, even though the German Bundesbank failed to reduce its repo rate by more than a tiny fraction, Peter Marsh writes. The Danish central bank reduced its discount and key deposit rates to 7 per cent from 7.25 per cent. This came after the Bundesbank made a largely token cut in its 13-day repo rate, at which it feeds money into the banking system, to 6.39 per cent from 6.4 per cent. The moves underlined the general trends towards easier monetary policy in continental Europe. However, the decision-making Bundesbank council is thought unlikely to lower Germany's internationally important Lombard and discount rates when it meets later today. At its last gathering two weeks ago, the council brought down both rates by  1/2 percentage point to 6.75 per cent and 5.75 per cent respectively. In its deliberations yesterday, the Danish central bank kept its 14-day money market rate unchanged at 8 per cent. In Britain, hopes of a cut in base rates on or around Budget Day on November 30 were given a new lease of life by scrutiny of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report, released on Tuesday night. Although the Bank's economists used highly cautious language in writing the report, they were generally optimistic about inflation trends in the longer term. That was interpreted by some commentators as increasing the chances of a cut in interest rates around Budget Day. It is thought Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, may announce such an easing to compensate for a tax increase. Yesterday the December short sterling futures contract - which indicates the market's perceptions of cuts in official short-term interest rates - gained 6 basis points to close at 94.50. The three-month interbank rate eased slightly to about 5 5/8 per cent from about 5 per cent previously. In the UK money market, the Bank and the discount houses combined fairly smoothly in channelling Pounds 425m to the banking system through action by the Bank in buying bills. The relatively small shortage yesterday - estimated by the Bank at Pounds 500m - followed several big daily shortages in recent weeks which have proved more difficult to remove. The Bank bought Pounds 64m of band 1 bills at 5 7/8 per cent and Pounds 361m of band 2 bills at the same rate of interest.</p>

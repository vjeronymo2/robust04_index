			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: Reform will open Dutch bourse to outside capital MEMBERS of the Amsterdam stock exchange will be allowed to participate for the first time in the share capital of the bourse's 'hoekmen', or stock jobbers, under proposals put forward yesterday. A stock market committee said it was 'probably inevitable' that the hoekmen firms would turn to other members of the exchange to help strengthen their capital bases. Although there will be no limits to the size of outside investment, the hoekmen must retain their independence in day-to-day operations. Among the obvious candidates for putting up money are Dutch-based banks already active in bourse trading through their stockbroking subsidiaries. However, the bourse's members also include subsidiaries of foreign banks and brokers. The proposals are a development in plans for sweeping reforms of the Dutch stock exchange, due to take place early in 1994. The reforms, which centre on plans to divide the market into retail and wholesale segments, will mean that many of the 23 hoekman firms will disappear, to be replaced by better-capitalised 'specialists' similar to those on the New York Stock Exchange. The bourse has said that no more than 10 specialists are expected to be active in the retail segment of the market. Each of the new-style specialists will have exclusive rights to trade in specific stocks among Amsterdam's 30 most actively-traded companies. Currently, several competing hoekmen tend to trade in the same stock. The committee proposed yesterday that the top 30 companies be apportioned among interested hoekmen according to each firm's past level of brokerage fees in the stock. Those hoekmen firms which decide to close down will receive the equivalent of one year's total fees, based on average fees generated over the past 2.5 years. These sums will be paid by those hoekmen prepared to become specialists. The committee's proposals will be examined by the bourse's management next month before being put to a general meeting of bourse members in November. The overall bourse reforms, are designed to equip Amsterdam to beat off competition from London.</p>

The document establishes rules for sharing  the task of the two satellites' telemetry and route control, as  well as the responsibility of each country in this supervisory  process.    According to the agreement's terms, during the first 12  months after the launching of the first satellite -- the SSR-1,  which is scheduled to go up in October 1996 -- tracking and  control will be conducted by PRC experts. Brazil will be  responsible for the control for the next six months, and then  the PRC experts will resume their duties for two more months. A  decision on who will control the satellite during the  approximately two more years of its useful life will be made  later by the two parties.    As to the second satellite -- the SSR-2, whose launch date  still has not been decided yet because it depends on the first  satellite's performance -- PRC experts will monitor the  satellite's first eight months in orbit, Brazil will control the  next six months, and the PRC experts the six months after that.    The agreement also officially established that any damage to  the satellite while under the responsibility of either of the  two parties will have to be paid for by the country controlling  the satellite at the time. The formula for this payment,  however, still has to be studied and the decrease in the  satellite's value will be taken into account.    Funds to finance the Brazilian part of the agreement total  $50 million, while the overall cost totals $150 million. Oscar  Klingel, chief of staff for the Science and Technology Ministry,  said these funds are guaranteed by President Itamar Franco's  political decision. This decision was confirmed to the PRC  experts last year, when the Brazilian Government decided to  assign resources from the privatization of state-owned companies  to the program.    According to Klingel, the Brazilian Government already has  disbursed 50 percent of the overall cost, and $16 million from  last year's transfers are in the hands of the INPE [National  Institute of Space Research].    According to the negotiated terms, the satellites will be  launched from the Tai Yuan base, Shanxi Province. The satellite  will be put in orbit by a "Long March" rocket from the PRC  "Great Wall" company. Throughout their useful lives the  satellites will transmit information on climate and the subsoil,  which will be analyzed by Brazilian and PRC experts.</p>

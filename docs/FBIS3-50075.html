			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, January 21 (TANJUG) -- A certain easing of  tensions could be expected between the republic of Serb Krajina  (R.S.K.) and the Republic of Croatia after the signing of the  statement on normalization of relations between Croatia and the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( F.R.Y.) in Geneva on Wednesday  [26 January].    "The R.S.K. is ready for dialogue with the Croats on  restoring the severed flow in the area of infrastructure," said  R.S.K. foreign minister Slobodan Jarcevic in an interview to the  Belgrade Daily POLITIKA on Friday. The Serbs proclaimed the  R.S.K in 1991 in parts of Croatia in which they make up the  majority population in response to Zagreb's forcible secession  from the former Yugoslav Federation and attempts at reducing the  status of the Serbs from a constituent people to one of a  national minority. Croatia, which does not recognize the  R.S.K., was trying by means of war to establish there its  authority although the R.S.K was declared a U.N.-protected area  in the spring of 1992.    It was possible, for instance, to solve the question of  water  supply for the port city Zadar from the river Zrmanja, on the  territory of the R.S.K., but the Croatian side should in return  enable production of electrical power in the Obrovac power  plant, explained Jarcevic. The R.S.K. authorities in his view,  understood the problem of the Croats who were trying to restore  traffic between the south and the north. This will be made  possible, but in return most likely access to one of the  Adriatic ports on the Croatian territory would be requested.    "The Belgrade-Zagreb highway, the oil pipeline, the  establishing of telephone links are in similar packages," said  Jarvcevic. The R.S.K., he added understood the needs of the  Croats, but at the same time set out that its own interests too  were not to be overlooked. Jarcevic especially stressed that  `no negotiations on the R.S.K. territory could be conducted  apart from legitimate representatives of the R.S.K.'    In view of Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic,  the  Geneva agreement between the F.R.Y. and Croatia did not  prejudice the solution for the R.S.K. The Croatian Government  decided Friday to restore in a few days telephone links with the  F.R.Y. severed three years ago, it was announced in Zagreb.  Normalization of telephone communication was possible within a  period of two-three days, POLITIKA has learned at the Yugoslav  postal services. The paper said linking of the electrical power  lines between the F.R.Y. and Croatia could also be expected.  These were severed in September 1991.</p>

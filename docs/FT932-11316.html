			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Stronger pound fails to win appreciation: Manufacturers' fears that sterling's rise might damage their export business THE finance director of an engineering company said last week that if the government allows the pound to strengthen any further 'then it must be out of its tiny mind'. Mr Miles Vere-Hodge, director of corporate finance at TI, the specialist engineering group, said:'I am concerned that if the pound goes much further than it is now it will start to hurt exports, particularly with countries like France and Germany in recession and the US becoming more introverted. 'The government seems to be giving up some of the benefits that we gained from September's departure from the ERM.' Since February the pound has risen more than 5 per cent and last month broke through the DM2.50 level, its highest point since September. Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN, the engineering company, warned that another 5 per cent 'would be worrying'. Just over half a year has passed since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism. After its initial plunge on September 16 the currency drifted downwards to hit a low of DM2.31 during February 24, a devaluation of about 17 per cent from its DM2.78 floor in the mechanism. For exporters, the pound's decline was a gift from heaven. Goods priced in sterling were instantaneously cheaper allowing British industry to push for an ever wider share of world export trade and raising hopes for an export-led domestic recovery. The benefits are already apparent. Last week the Confederation of British Industry said exports were leading the country out of recession. It reported that in the past four months there had been a significant increase in demand for exports. Manufacturers expect the next four months to bring the strongest growth in orders and output for four years. However, with the pound creeping steadily higher against the dollar and European currencies, Britain's exporters have become alarmed that the recently won competitive gains of devaluation are about to be put in jeopardy. Industrialists can draw little comfort from the government's stance. Chancellor Norman Lamont has said that he does not have a target for the exchange rate but has, on other occasions, made it clear that he favours a strong currency. In Luxembourg two weeks ago he indicated that the government would like to see sterling appreciate, partly to offset inflationary pressures. 'I welcome strongly the recent strength of sterling,' he said. Prospects for another base rate cut, perhaps to offset the pound's rise, are also weak. In his Budget speech in March, Mr Lamont said base rates of 6 per cent were consistent with a sustainable recovery. The Treasury pointed out that although the pound was now somewhat higher than it was in February, there had still been a significant devaluation compared with September. Meanwhile, ministers are insisting that competitiveness is more to do with controlling costs and keeping down wages than a low exchange rate. Mr Ian Thompson, economist at the Engineering Employers' Federation, said that manufacturers would always prefer a lower exchange rate but said recent concern about the pound's appreciation was exaggerated. He said: 'Our view is that the bulk of the devaluation benefit is still there, even at the present exchange rate. The pound would have to increase a lot before we lost that benefit.' The worry for exporters is that, on balance, the pound is more likely to appreciate than depreciate over the next few months. Interest rates in Germany are on a downward path, making the D-Mark a less attractive currency to hold. The UK economy is stirring out of recession and many analysts believe base rates have hit bottom. Mr James Barty, economist at Morgan Grenfell, said he believes the exchange rate is about right. He said: 'There are worrying signs that the government wants sterling to strengthen significantly. This could damage the trade position and sustainability of the recovery. Do they never learn?'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information to be collected and recorded includes: the results of all waste determinations such as of volatile organic concentration at the point of waste origination and organic vapor pressure; design specifications for closed-vent systems and control devices and certain control equipment; emission control equipment inspection and monitoring results; Methods 27 test results; control device exceedances and actions taken to remedy them; leak repairs; management of carbon removed from carbon adsorption systems; identification of incinerators, boilers, or industrial furnaces used to treat hazardous waste in accordance with the general requirements of the rule; documentation for biological wastewater treatment units using air emission controls in accordance with the rule requirements; and identification of equipment fittings designated as unsafe or difficult to monitor or inspect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At a facility where air emission control equipment required by the final rule cannot be in operation by June 5, 1995, the owner or operator is required to prepare an implementation schedule for the air emission control equipment specifying dates by which progress will be completed by the facility owner or operator to ensure the required air emission controls are in operation no later than December 8, 1997. Alternatively, the owner or operator may come into compliance by modifying facility processes to eliminate waste streams with average volatile organic concentration greater than or equal to 100 ppmw at the point of waste origination. At a minimum, specific calendar dates shall be established for award of contracts or issuance of purchase orders for the air emission control equipment; initiation of on-site installation of the equipment; completion of the equipment installation; and performance of any testing to demonstrate that the installed air emission control equipment meets the standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA recognizes that, in some cases, owners or operators may be unable to meet the implementation date for reasons beyond their control. For example, several commenters pointed out that permit modifications may be required to implement necessary changes, and that modification processes can be lengthy. The EPA developed this rule to be self-implementing and to eliminate the need for permit modifications to the extent possible; furthermore, in the final rule the implementation period has been extended from 2 to 3 years. Therefore, the EPA expects that most if not all facilities will be able to comply. However, the EPA acknowledges that in some cases State permits may have to be modified (e.g., when surface impoundments are replaced with tanks). If the permit process is lengthy, or undergoes extensive appeal, the facility's ability to comply with the implementation date may be jeopardized. To address this and similar situations, the EPA has included a provision that will allow the Regional Administrator to extend the implementation date in situations beyond the owner or operator's control, where he or she made all reasonable and prudent efforts to meet the date. The EPA emphasizes that this extension would be available only where meeting the date was truly beyond the facility's control, and the EPA expects its application would be limited to situations such as delays in State permit processing. The extension would not be available where the facility's planning was at fault, a permit application was submitted unreasonably late, or permit processing was delayed because the permit application was inadequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

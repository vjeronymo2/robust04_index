			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA;  </P> <P> A OCCASIONAL LOOK AT POP-RELATED BOOKS, VIDEOS AND LASER DISCS THAT ARE OF  SPECIAL COMMERCIAL AND/OR CRITICAL INTEREST. THE RATING SYSTEM: FIVE STARS (A  CLASSIC) TO ONE STAR (POOR).;  </P> <P> ** "HANGIN' TOUGH LIVE" NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK CMV ENTERPRISES VIDEOCASSETTE  ($19.98).  </P> <P> If you're not a girl in your low teens, this 50-minute tape probably won't  interest you.  </P> <P> But those in that target group will find plenty to l-o-v-e in this no-frills  package. This white teen vocal group is so into piercing falsetto leads and so  heavily influenced by such '60s and '70s R&amp;B vocal groups as the Stylistics  that it's like watching five Bobby Brown wannabes. Sorely missing: interviews  to provide insights into this pop phenomenon. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

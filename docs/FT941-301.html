			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Government Bonds: US long bond yield surges back over 7% barrier The yield on the long-dated US Treasury bond surged back over the 7 per cent barrier yesterday as traders reacted badly to news of an unexpected jump in consumer confidence. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  15/16 lower at 90 1/16 . The yield climbed 8 basis points to 7.05 per cent, after dipping below the 7 per cent level the previous session on a big decline in oil prices. On the short end, the two-year note was down  1/8 to 99 7/16 , to yield 5.175 per cent. Although the day's economic news was unfavourable, analysts linked the sharp downturn to a broader shift in the market's psychology in recent weeks. After Monday's half-hearted rally, the session opened on a weak note, with many retail accounts staying on the sidelines before Friday's employment data, a keenly watched measure of economic strength. Forecasts centre on a March increase of 250,000 in non-farm payrolls, a figure which would suggest a solid recovery from the weather-related slowdown experienced in the previous two months. Such a pattern was evident in the Conference Board's latest reading on consumer confidence. The board's March index came in at 86.7, well ahead of February's 79.9. Against the backdrop of last week's interest rate boost and the approach of Friday's employment data, the news was enough to push prices across the yield curve moderately lower by midday. As the afternoon progressed the selling pressure intensified, with few buyers willing to wade into the market while prices continued to weaken. UK government bonds fluctuated in fairly light trading yesterday but the underlying trend remained weak as political concerns and a softer pound kept investors on the sidelines, traders said. Further liquidation of positions at the short end of the market kept downward pressure on gilts, so much so that the market was now discounting base rates of 6 per cent by the end of this year and 8 per cent by the end of 1995. The June contract of the long gilt future on Liffe fell by 1 3/32 point in the late afternoon to 105 1/4 , down from the day's best level of 107 1/8 . However, there was some optimism that today's auction of the Bank of England's first offering of floating-rate notes for 15 years would proceed smoothly. Traders forecast that the Pounds 2.5bn offering of five-year notes would be covered by between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 times. Some traders expected most of the bids to come in at 99 3/4 , above the Bank's minimum bid price of 99 1/2 , which would imply a discounted margin of  1/16 below Libid. Nevertheless, the market's overall weakness weighed on the when-issued price of the notes which fell from par to around 99.80, traders said. Italian government bonds failed to build on Monday's gains despite the accuracy of the election outcome rumours which had propelled the market higher. 'It has been a classic case of buying on the rumour and selling on the fact,' said Mr Andre de Silva, a market strategist at Paine- Webber. The weaker tone of the market also reflected investor concerns about the ability of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing alliance to form a government. These doubts have been fanned by the tension between the Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and Mr Gianfranco Fini of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, Mr de Silva said. Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson, said Mr Berlusconi's pro-growth policies could be negative for the long end of the Italian government bond market. A loose monetary policy and less restraint on fiscal tightening would make it difficult to reduce Italy's public sector deficit and would fan inflation, he said. The June contract on 10-year Italian government bonds on Liffe stood at 110.30 in late trading, down 1.28 point on the day and well below the day's best level of 112.75. German government bonds outperformed other European bond markets, supported by hopes that the Bundesbank would announce a further cut of up to five basis points in its repo rate today. The rate fell by eight basis points to 5.80 per cent last week. The June bund future on Liffe eased by 0.23 point to 95.93 in the late afternoon. However, some analysts warned that the sharp rise in call money yesterday due to a month-end liquidity squeeze could make it difficult for the Bundesbank to engineer a further reduction this week. Some German credit institutions were thought to have taken advantage of the Bundesbank's 6.75 per cent Lombard emergency lending facility in order to cover their minimum reserve requirements.</p>

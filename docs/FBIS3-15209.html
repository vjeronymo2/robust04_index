This  Federation Council sitting is planned for 15 March. Of course,  all this will have to be straightened out, which will take at  least another two weeks. After this the chamber will submit to  the president its proposals regarding a number of draft laws and  possibly presidential edicts translating the fundamental tenets  into the language of specific measures. We don't intend to seek  out things to criticize in the president's message, we are  concerned exclusively with action.</p>

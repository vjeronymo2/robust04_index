			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average rises ahead of elections LATE afternoon buying by futures traders, covering their shorts ahead of Sunday's general elections, fuelled speculation of an imminent rate cut, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average gained 173.51 to 20,331.53 after a low of 20,164.72 in the morning session and a high of 20,352.54 just before the close. The index was up 2.3 per cent on the week. Volume was 330m shares against 385m. Gainers led losers by 707 to 299, with 385 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 13.20 to 1,652.88 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.57 to 1,257.12. Arbitrage buying centred around shares linked to the Topix index rather than to the Nikkei 225. Traders said that investors and arbitrageurs were shifting futures positions to the Topix contract as the Nikkei 225 future is expected to be changed to a new 350 issue index. New investment trusts funds worth Y150bn, launched yesterday, also helped to support the market. The communications sector was strong on the advance of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which rose Y15,000 to Y915,000. Companies with close links to NTT were also stronger, with NEC up Y48 to Y1,020. Speculators dabbled in Gajoen Kanko which rose Y27 to Y170 on bargain hunting after falling by its daily limit on Thursday. Kirin Brewery gained Y20 to Y1,280 in spite of its announcement that it would withdraw adverts and sponsorship for concerts and other events after the revelation of its links to racketeers. Analysts feared this would hit profits at a time of declining demand, because of the economic slowdown. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 91.09 to 22,379.86 in volume of 21.9m shares. Roundup INDIVIDUAL issues dominated the trading on the region's markets yesterday. TAIWAN fell back on heavy selling in the Big Three banks after the provincial assembly dissolved without voting to approve their dividends. The weighted index lost 55.13 to 3,914.04, for a week's fall of 3.8 per cent. Turnover was TDollars 13.5bn against Thursday's TDollars 14.4bn. First Commercial Bank plunged TDollars 6.50 to TDollars 139, Changhwa lost TDollars 4 to TDollars 119 and Hua Nan dropped TDollars 7 to TDollars 126.50. HONG KONG declined on institutional selling in thin trading. The Hang Seng Index shed 53.32 to 6,925.22, a 2 per cent fall on the week. Turnover was low at HKDollars 2.7bn against HKDollars 3.9bn on Thursday. China related stocks continued to dominate, with the newly-listed Tsingtao Brewery easing 5 cents to HKDollars 3.55. SINGAPORE gathered pace in late trading on bargain hunting. The Straits Times Industrial index picked up 14.71 to 1,777.66, a 1 per cent fall over the week. KUALA LUMPUR, too, rebounded strongly at the close on bargain hunting and renewed institutional and retail buying. The KLSE composite index rose 21.55, or 3 per cent to 735.78, 1.1 per cent up on the week. MANILA eased on selling of blue chips after Philippine Long Distance Telephone fell in overnight New York trade. Its shares lost 5 pesos to 1,000 pesos and the composite index shed 9.01 to 1,615.06, a 1 per cent drop on the week. AUSTRALIA closed below the 1,800 level on selling of key issues. The All Ordinaries index slipped 6.1 to 1,799.8, a 1 per cent fall over the week, in turnover of ADollars 282.5m. BHP lost 16 cents to ADollars 14.50 and CRA 34 cents to ADollars 13.40. The market was prevented from a steeper fall by the alcohol and tobacco index, which added 100.4 or 1.8 per cent, to 5,526.6. BANGKOK ended broadly lower as turnover slipped to its lowest level for a month. The SET index dropped 4.69 to 885.36, in turnover of Bt2.8bn, off 2.4 per cent on the week.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAYGROUND BALL COSTS DODGERS; METS WIN, 3-2  </P> <P> It is one thing to be a proud World Series champion bravely losing a battle  with slumps, injuries and inevitable mortality.  </P> <P> It is another thing to be unable to play catch.  </P> <P> The Dodgers' problems, which grow more elementary by the day, fell somewhere  between the eighth- and ninth-grade levels Friday when they botched a rundown  play that led to a 3-2 loss to the New York Mets before a sellout Shea Stadium  crowd of 46,143.  </P> <P> In the sixth inning, the Mets' Kevin McReynolds singled and eventually scored  the winning run without benefit of a hit.  </P> <P> "We work on rundown plays every other day in spring training," Dodger infield  coach Bill Russell said, shaking his head.  </P> <P> "They are fundamental plays. They must be made."  </P> <P> "You in a rundown play," shortstop Alfredo Griffin said angrily, "you out."  </P> <P> Only sometimes, as the Dodgers proved Friday night. With one out and the score  2-2, McReynolds had reached first base on a grounder behind third base that  shortstop Griffin could only knock down. McReynolds, who had stolen 33 straight  bases dating to 1987 before being caught in Philadelphia earlier this year,  then stole second.  </P> <P> So he's quick. But he's not quick enough to escape what happened next -- a Dave  Magadan grounder back to pitcher Orel Hershiser that caught McReynolds between  second and third.  </P> <P> Hershiser spun and threw to Griffin on second base. Griffin waited for  McReynolds to edge toward third, then threw to third baseman Jeff Hamilton.  </P> <P> But instead of running McReynolds back to second base, as written in Dodger  manuals, Hamilton threw back to Griffin. And he threw it low. Griffin dropped  the throw, McReynolds ran to third, and Griffin could only run back to second  and tag an oncoming Magadan for the second out.  </P> <P> McReynolds didn't stay on third base long. With the count 1 and 2 to Barry  Lyons, Hershiser threw a curveball into the dirt. It bounced away from Mike  Scioscia, and McReynolds scored.  </P> <P> "While that pitch will show up as a reason we lost the game," Hershiser said  later, "it is not the reason. There are others."  </P> <P> The blown rundown was merely the most glaring. The Dodgers blew another chance  in the top of the ninth. After Mike Sharperson reached third base with one out  against reliever Randy Myers, the Dodgers' leadoff and No. 2 hitters couldn't  bring him in: Griffin struck out and Willie Randolph lined a fastball to center  fielder Juan Samuel.  </P> <P> Halfway down the first-base line, Randolph jumped, threw up his arms, and began  the walk back to the dugout.  </P> <P> Moments before he crossed a line of ushers in front of the dugout, he spiked  his helmet on the grass and left it there.  </P> <P> "I thought I had him," Randolph said. "I got my pitch. I had a good swing. I  thought this was it."  </P> <P> "I lucked out," Myers said.  </P> <P> That happens to good teams. Few are better these days than the Mets. They won  for the ninth time in 11 games. They moved within 3 1/2 games of Chicago in the  National League East.  </P> <P> It was Myers' team-leading 20th save. Met starter David Cone, who hasn't lost  since June 5, gave up Eddie Murray's two-run homer and six other hits in  winning his eighth straight decision.  </P> <P> The Dodgers, meanwhile, spent late Friday night as they have spent many late  nights this summer -- rehashing a defeat.  </P> <P> "You've got to be aggressive on rundowns, and Hamilton was not aggressive,"  Russell said.  </P> <P> "You are taught to run the guy back to the base he came from. If Hamilton had  done that, we'd have gotten a double play."  </P> <P> "Griffin held out his glove," Hamilton said, "and that's a sign to throw it to  him."  </P> <P> Russell said: "Yes, that's a signal, but the runner was not close enough (to  Griffin) to throw it. That's common sense."  </P> <P> Griffin was not immune to Russell's criticism, either.  </P> <P> "Alfredo tried to catch the ball too quick, tried to get cute with it, grab it  and tag the guy at the same time," he said.  </P> <P> Griffin said: "You can't mess up rundowns. You can't. The guy can't outrun the  ball. I hate messing up rundowns."  </P> <P> And as much as Hershiser hates throwing wild pitches, he said he would throw  that game-losing pitch again.  </P> <P> "In fact, I threw that same curve on the next pitch and it bounced, and Mike  got it," said Hershiser, who gave up three runs on six hits in his eighth  complete game but fell to 14-9.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to look at it like a pitch I'll never throw again."  </P> <P> "I've got to block that ball," Scioscia said. "It took a bad bounce and went  farther than I thought. There wasn't a heckuva lot I could do about it.  </P> <P> "When these things happen, you just have to keep your head in the game and go  on with things."  </P> <P> For the Dodgers, those two simple tasks are growing ever harder.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Franklin Stubbs, who left Thursday's game in Philadelphia because of a twisted  knee, has a sprained ligament in the knee and might be put on the disabled list  today, after being examined by Dr. Frank Jobe, Dodger medical director. Stubbs  probably would be replaced by Mickey Hatcher, who has nearly recovered from a  strained left hamstring and is due off the disabled list next week. . . .  Hatcher, a potential Dodger free agent this winter, said he is seriously  considering playing in Japan next year if he can't reach agreement with the  Dodgers. "My wife would love to go to Japan, it would be a good learning  experience for my children, it's something we really will look at," said  Hatcher, who in Japan could earn substantially more than his current $450,000  salary. "I would love to stay with the Dodgers, but when it comes to money, I  have to look out for my family." Hatcher said his agent, Willie Sanchez,  contacted several Japanese teams before Hatcher originally signed with the  Dodgers in 1987. . . . Infielder Lenny Harris has been taking fly balls in the  outfield, and could play there before the end of the season. Harris could even  be a center-field candidate next spring.  </P> <P> The official figure for Mike Scioscia's new three-year contract, according to  league sources, is $5.55 million. Scioscia, who received an $800,000 signing  bonus, will be paid $950,00 in 1990 and $1.9 million in both 1991 and 1992. . .  . Dodger reliever Tim Crews met with National League President Bill White  Friday to protest his $200 automatic fine levied for hitting Pittsburgh's Gary  Redus July 24. The protest was denied. "He was polite, but he told me that  because I was given a warning after hitting him, the fine was mandatory," Crews  said. "But he also said he couldn't change the fine because Gary (Redus)  thought I hit him intentionally. Now that's crazy."  </P> <P> Outfielder Chris Gwynn, in triple-A Albuquerque to rehabilitate a broken right  foot, suffered a sprained right knee in a home-plate collision Aug. 10. He will  be out at least two weeks. . . . Pitcher John Tudor and outfielder Kal Daniels  have rejoined the team after short absences. Tudor returned from a scheduled,  and then postponed, shoulder examination in Boston by Red Sox physician Dr.  Arthur Pappas. Pappas missed the exam because of illness and then a vacation.  Jobe will examine Tudor in New York today. Daniels returned from Aug. 11  surgery on his right knee and hopes to be back in the lineup by the final weeks  of the season.  </P></p>

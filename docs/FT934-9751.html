			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese shipping firms' profits fall JAPAN'S two largest shipping companies, Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Mitsui OSK Lines, blamed their latest profits declines on a fall in imports to their economically depressed domestic market, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. Nippon Yusen's revenue fell by 10 per cent to Y268bn (Dollars 2.47bn), in the six months to September, on which pre-tax profits collapsed by 49 per cent to Y3.61bn. Mitsui OSK's taxable profits fell by 23.8 per cent to Y2.72bn over the same period, on turnover down by 8.2 per cent to Y223bn. Both shippers also cited as factors currency losses on the translation of their dollar fares and freight charges into appreciating yen.</p>

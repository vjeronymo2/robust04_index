			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Schwaetzer emerges from shadow of mentor MRS Irmgard Schwaetzer, nominated yesterday to succeed Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher as German foreign minister, is thus designated to occupy the most powerful political post ever held by a woman in Germany, agencies report from Bonn. Mrs Schwaetzer, aged 50, spent four years as state secretary in the foreign ministry before she became construction minister in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition cabinet in January 1991. Mr Genscher was her mentor in the Free Democratic Party (FDP), junior partner in the coalition, whose leaders have nominated her to succeed the veteran minister when he steps down in mid-May. The FDP executive and parliamentary delegation is to approve the choice at a meeting today. Mr Kohl also has a say in the matter, but the chancellor said it was the FDP's right to pick a successor under the terms by which the coalition operates. Mrs Schwaetzer first rose to national prominence as FDP general-secretary, a post she took after the party had quit a federal coalition with the Social Democrats in 1982 and formed a cabinet with Mr Kohl. However, her nomination to the foreign ministry was a surprise after several setbacks for her within the party in recent years, including losing to Mr Otto Lambsdorff in a bid for the FDP national presidency in 1988. She had quit as general-secretary in 1984. Mrs Schwaetzer had campaigned for the party's top job as a reformer who wanted to bring in younger blood and give the strongly pro-business party more of a social conscience. As construction minister, Mrs Schwaetzer has faced a national housing shortage and steep rent increases in east Germany. Last October, she was brushing off suggestions that she was seeking to succeed Mr Genscher. 'I have my own profile in the FDP, involving social issues,' she said. Mrs Schwaetzer favours a liberal abortion law, contrary to Mr Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and his right-wing Bavarian allies in the Christian Social Union (CSU). The minister-designate is a trained chemist and a stylish dresser who likes to wear large tortoise-shell glasses. She is married to Udo Phillip, her second husband and a television reporter. She has no children.</p>

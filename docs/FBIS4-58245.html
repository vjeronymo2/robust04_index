			<p>BFN     [Text] A short while ago, the Knesset defeated the three  motions of no confidence in the government submitted by the  opposition. A majority of 52 members of the coalition voted  against the motions, while 41 members of the opposition voted  for them.    Knesset Member [MK] 'Azran of SHAS [Torah Observing  Sephardim] abstained. Before the vote took place, Moledet MK's  Ze'evi and Ba'gad raised black umbrellas, pointed them at  Foreign Minister Peres, and chanted Chamberlain, Chamberlain.  They were removed from the plenum upon the order of the Knesset  speaker, but were allowed to return for the vote.</p>

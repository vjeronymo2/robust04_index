			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> AH, WILDERNESS! RESERVATIONS NEEDED EVEN IN REMOTE NORTHWEST  </P> <P> These sparkling alpine lakes live up to their name. Hikers often say they half  expect to see an elf behind the next granite boulder or a gnome crouched under  a lakeside larch.  </P> <P> Wilderness ranger Elizabeth Goulet knows better. There is more likely to be  another hiker behind that boulder, she says, and pile of trash under the tree.  </P> <P> At the moment she's inspecting one careless camper's jetsam: 10 wrappers from  freeze-dried meals, a penlight battery, a jar of instant coffee, an empty  sardine can, a stove burner and a tube of bug repellent.  </P> <P> Usually Goulet would be fuming, but today she's all smiles. The litterer also  left an envelope with his name on it, so a Mr. Martinez soon will be getting a  package in the mail -- his own trash, sent C.O.D.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Small Victory  </P> <P> Rangers here in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness of the Cascade Range savor such  small triumphs as they try to keep visitors from loving the wilderness to  death. Few are as inconsiderate as Martinez, but sheer numbers take their toll.  </P> <P> "It's becoming almost what we call urban wilderness," Goulet said. "We manage  it so much for people that we sometimes lose sight of managing it for its  wilderness value."  </P> <P> The U.S. Forest Service has resorted to a permit system here to limit the  number of campers in the Enchantments.  </P> <P> It's part of a trend. National parks, which are managed for the benefit of  visitors, have struggled for years with the balance between letting sightseers  in and maintaining a place worth seeing. Wilderness areas, which have less  human traffic and are managed less intensively, are catching up fast.  </P> <P> A Colorado State University survey found that 28% of the 474 U.S. wilderness  areas already limit recreational use via entry permits or time limits on  camping, and others are considering such moves. Recreational use was declining  at only 3% of the wilderness areas.  </P> <P> In Washington, the growing Seattle area promises more pressure on the Alpine  Lakes Wilderness, which already sees more visitors annually than Mt. Rainier  National Park.  </P> <P> "We have a very high outdoor ethic," Ron DeHart of the Forest Service in  Seattle said. "People want to do more than look at the mountains. They want to  get out in them."  </P> <P> Many choose to do it at Enchantment Lakes, a small corner of the 306,000-acre  Alpine Lakes Wilderness where a dozen crystal-clear lakes adorn a basin of  glacier-scoured granite, all hemmed in by jagged peaks. In the basin's lower  reaches are trees gnarled by the elements, meadows of heather and tarns with  names like Talisman and Leprechaun. The upper basin is a haunting landscape of  rock and snow.  </P> <P> No one knows the area better than Bill Stark, 78, and his wife, Peggy, 72. They  named many of the lakes and have come here every year since 1959 from their  home in nearby Leavenworth.  </P> <P> "When we first went up, it looked like nobody had ever been there," Bill Stark  said. "Then we started seeing subtle signs of use. Then, not-so-subtle signs."  </P> <P> Hikers tramped out a network of foot trails across the basin. Lush beds of  heather were flattened and wads of toilet paper blossomed everywhere. "People  are pigs," Stark said.  </P> <P> By the late 1970s, a summer weekend could bring as many as 300 people into the  basin, a less-than-enchanting situation for everyone.  </P> <P> The Forest Service tried to minimize damage. Toilets were installed in 1966 and  use of horses was restricted in 1972. Guided tours were banned in 1976 and  dogs, which might chase wild animals or disturb other campers, were prohibited  in 1982.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Booked Solid  </P> <P> A permit system established in 1987 limits the number of campers to about 60 on  any given day. The season runs from June 15 to Oct. 15, and summer weekends are  booked solid within a few weeks after permit applications are accepted March 1.  </P> <P> The permits detract from one value of having a wilderness: the opportunity to  escape the regimentation of everyday life.  </P> <P> "Wilderness implies freedom, and you can't get that freedom with the permit  system," Goulet conceded. "But you couldn't get it here anyway, because without  the permits, there would be crowds of people."  </P> <P> A few campers each week sneak in without permits, risking $50 citations from  one of the five rangers who patrol the Enchantments, but most visitors seem to  respect the aim of the permit system.  </P> <P> "This is a really special place. Whatever it takes to keep it special is worth  it," said hiker Hal Zimmer, 39, who was on his seventh trip to the  Enchantments.  </P> <P> Jeff Merkel of Philadelphia said his partner waited in line two hours at the  Leavenworth ranger station to get one of the few permits reserved for "walk-in"  business.  </P> <P> But Merkel doesn't mind, considering the alternative: "There would be people  all around the place. You might as well be at the Jersey shore."  </P> <P> The permit system is working, Goulet said. The crowds are gone, so rangers have  a chance to start replanting some eroded, overused campsites.  </P> <P> It is still not Goulet's idea of true wilderness.  </P> <P> "The ultimate wilderness would be taking an unaffected area and blocking it off  to everybody," she said. "I wouldn't have to go see it -- just knowing it was  there would be enough, knowing that there was an area we haven't messed up."  </P> <P> But there is also value to an "urban wilderness" like the Enchanted Lakes, she  said, "a place where people can sense what the land was like before we got  here."  </P></p>

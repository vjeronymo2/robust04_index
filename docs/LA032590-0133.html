			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: BILLY BATHGATE BY E.L. DOCTOROW (HARPER &amp; ROW: $5.95)  </P> <P> In his latest best seller, E. L. Doctorow offers a diverting study of the  seductive power of evil. The title character, a boy from the Bronx slums,  weasels his way into a job as errand boy to a fictionalized version of mobster  Dutch Schultz.  </P> <P> Schultz escorts Billy through the vicious, corrupt world of organized crime in  the 1930s and shows him that a capacity for monstrous evil and genuine kindness  often coexist. But the impulsive, violent Schultz, who rose to power during  Prohibition, fails to realize that he has become an anachronism: The future  belongs to Billy and a more subtle generation of con men. Although the ending,  in which a thrill-seeking heiress returns from a long absence to present Billy  with their child, seems more than a little improbable, "Billy Bathgate" is a  skillful work by one of the country's most popular novelists.  </P></p>

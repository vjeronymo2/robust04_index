			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA)--A Yemeni delegation led by  'Ali Mansur Rashid, member of the standing committee of the  General People's Congress, arrived in Cairo from Sanaa this  afternoon. In his arrival statement, the Yemeni official said  that this visit is within the framework of efforts to implement  Security Council Resolution 924. He said: We are happy to  visit Cairo, which is the haven of all Arabs. He noted that he  is carrying a message from the Yemeni Government to Lakhdar  Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general to Yemen, who is  currently in Cairo. Rashid pointed out that the situation is  creating optimism and that they have come as representatives of  two sides of the coalition parties in the Republic of Yemen, in  addition to the Yemeni Socialist Party. [as received]    Rashid said that the delegations will discuss reviving and  forming a military committee to monitor the cease-fire, noting  that the delay in forming the committee is due to the south's  intransigence. Concerning the possibility of requesting Arab  forces to help monitor the cease-fire, he said that the  situation has not yet reached that point and that it is still  confined to the framework of the Yemeni state. He added that it  has not ruled out the possibility of the parties' seeking the  help of Arab forces.</p>

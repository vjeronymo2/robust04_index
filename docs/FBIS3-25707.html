			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lome 24, Feb (AFP) -- The Togolese opposition is  ready to withdraw its candidates if, as President Gnassingbe  Eyadema's supporters demanded, the Supreme Court should annul  the poll in five of the constituencies it won during the  legislative elections. This was stated by an opposition leader  to AFP today. "We are not ready to go to a third round. If  they impose it on us, we will withdraw," said the source, who  preferred not to be named.    The opposition, represented by the Action Committee for  Renewal, CAR, and the Togolese Union for Democracy, UTD,  unofficially won 43 seats -- 36 by CAR and seven by UTD -- which  is two seats over the number required for absolute majority.  The parties from the presidential camp obtained 37, and the  remaining one was won by Joseph Kokou Koffigoh, the transitional  prime minister, who is a centrist.    This opposition leader disclosed that the CAR and UTD  representatives this morning went to the International Followup  Committee, which comprises Burkinabe, French, German, Egyptian,  and American delegates, to denounce the "illegal attitude" of  the National Electoral Commission, CEN.    Yesterday evening, this commission transferred the entire  results of the second round to the Supreme Court, but refrained  from officially publishing those concerning the challenged five  constituencies. Waiting for the magistrates' decision -- to be  made on 13 March at the latest -- political consultations  continued in Lome yesterday.    UTD General Secretary Ata Messan Ajavon described as  "erroneous" the rumors that his party allegedly held contacts  with the Rally of the Togolese People, RPT, the pro-Eyadema  party.    From a reliable source within the UTD it was, however,  confirmed that many meetings had taken place since yesterday  with the CAR leader to "coordinate the attitude" of the two  opposition parties. "In view of the electoral results, which  force us to be a small party, we do not ask for anything. Our  condition does not allow us to do so," this source stated,  adding that the UTD intended to play its role as a  "buffer-party." Mr. Koffigoh, who is the only elected candidate  of the Convention of New Forces, also wants to play this role.  He reminded AFP that he was not an "RPT member" and that his  party represented "a completely different leaning."</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Co-chairman of Geneva conference on Bosnia fly to Zagreb MR CYRUS VANCE and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the Geneva peace conference on Bosnia, are due to fly to Zagreb today for talks with President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia on the mediators' proposed peace settlement, Robert Mauthner writes. Their meeting follows the surprise change of heart by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, at the Geneva talks earlier this week. He then accepted the Vance-Owen constitutional plan for Bosnia after first rejecting it. However, Mr Karadzic's endorsement of the proposals was conditional on their approval by the Bosnian Serb Assembly within seven days. The parliament is due to discuss the plan at the end of next week. Meanwhile, Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian foreign minister, said yesterday that there would be no end to the bloodshed in Bosnia until all heavy weapons were firmly under international control. Mr Silajdzic, who was on a private visit to London during which he has had talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said the monitoring of heavy weapons, as proposed by the international mediators in the Geneva peace talks, was not enough.</p>

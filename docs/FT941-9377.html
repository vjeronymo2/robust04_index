			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Lower interest charges boost WHC Pre-tax profits at Westminster Health Care, the nursing home group, jumped from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 5.2m for the six months to November 30, partly thanks to lower interest charges following the group's flotation last year. Net interest costs were Pounds 310,000 (Pounds 2.74m). Earnings per share were 8.6p (5.4p) and the interim dividend is set at 1.75p. Mr Patrick Carter, chief executive, said that after 10 months working with the new Community Care legislation, it was taking longer to fill beds in existing and new homes; but he said this had been anticipated, and WHC had held back opening new homes during the first half. The effect was marginal, with 57 per cent of revenue coming from non-social services budgets. The rule changes had led to differential pricing for state-funded residents, which now ranged from Pounds 280 a week - the old social security rate - to Pounds 400 plus in areas such as London. During the half year 186 beds were added, taking the total to 3,429, and with a further 581 due to come on stream in the second half there would be 4,010 by the May year end. Plans were in place to increase this to 5,000 by the end of its 1995 year. The group is testing a new business, running an acute surgery unit in Devon performing operations for the National Health Service. The unit had been acquired from the receivers in November and was being assessed to see whether returns would justify investment. Mr Carter said the changes in the nursing home business, which had increased the private sector's provision of beds, would probably be repeated in surgery. This could provide a growth area when nursing homes began to mature. Turnover rose 41 per cent to Pounds 23.9m (Pounds 17m) for pre-interest profits up 26 per cent to Pounds 5.48m (Pounds 4.34m). Mr Kent Phippen, finance director, said the squeeze on margins reflected higher costs associated with being a quoted company, the slower fill rate and an upgrading of the computer system needed to deal with a range of local authority purchasers rather than with the DSS. Mr Phippen said gearing at 23 per cent was lower than expected. Cashflow funded more than half the Pounds 10.4m spent on fixed assets. COMMENT The shares have performed well since the float at 260p last April. Since then a number of other operators have come to market fostering the idea that nursing homes provide a sure route for profit growth. But, as Sir Jimmy Goldsmith said, if you spot a bandwagon you have missed it. Greater stock selectivity is now creeping into the sector. WHC has proved itself to be one of the winners in operational terms, and it is encouraging to see it testing a related business without indulging in great expense. One concern might be that National Medical Enterprises, which retained a 42 per cent stake after the float, might one day want to sell just when WHC needs to raise further capital for expansion. Meanwhile, on forecasts of about Pounds 11.3m for the year, against Pounds 4.3m, the prospective p/e approaches 21. No longer a compelling buy, but unlikely to disappoint in the medium term.</p>

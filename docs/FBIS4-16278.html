			<p>BFN     [Text] Ceremonial meetings have been held at a monument in  Tbilisi to the Georgian language being the mother tongue every  year on 14 April. But today, the public garden and the monument  were controlled by Tbilisi police forces. Zviadists planned to  hold a rally there in the customary way but the police did not  permit them to gather. A column of people then moved toward the  Russian Embassy to hold a protest action but the police also  blocked it. Several people have been detained. At the moment  the police control the area adjacent to the Marjanishvili metro  station.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Profile of Kim Chong-il </H5>   PERSONAL HISTORY    Name: Kim Chong-il (Prior to 1980 the Chinese spelling of  "il" of Kim Chong-il was [0001], not [2480]).    Blood type (unknown).    Date of birth: 16 February 1942 (Some say he was born in  1941).    Place of birth: The 88th Special Regiment's base in (Yangoe)  village in Khabarovsk Oblast, the Russian Soviet Federative  Socialist Republic. His name was registered as (Ilusenovich  Kim). His childhood name was "Yura." * The official Kim  Chong-il biography published in the early 1980's does not give  his birthplace. In 1980 North Korea named a peak in Mt. Paektu  as Chongilbong after his name and began to claim that Kim  Chong-il was born on Mt. Paektu.    Present address: The Central Party building in Namsan-tong,  Chung-ku, Pyongyang Special City. The location of his private  residence is not known, and reportedly, he changes his residence  from time to time.    PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS    Height: 158-162 centimeters. Weight: 85 kilograms. Head:  Slightly bald near the forehead; the hair on the front part of  his head is permed. Spectacles: Eyesight, 0.1/0.2, nearsighted;  wears glasses; is fond of wearing sunglasses. Attire: Wears a  brown or gray shirt in the summer, a blue and gray people's  uniform in the winter, and occasionally a sweater; wears a suit  just once [interval not specified]. Shoes: Wears high-heeled  shoes matching the color of clothing he wears. * Earned the  nickname "kodo" [altitude] thanks to his habit of wearing  high-heeled shoes.    FAMILY RELATIONS    Kim Hyong-chik married Kang Pan-sok. Kim Il-song was born  to them in 1912. He married Kim Chong-suk (born in 1917), and  Kim Song-ae (born in 1924).    With Kim Chong-suk, he had Kim Chong-il (born in 1942),  Syu-ra, and Kim Kyong-hui (born in 1946). The latter married  Chang Song-taek (born in 1946) and that union produced Chang  Kum-song (born in 1977). Kim Chong-il married Hong Il-so and  that union produced Kim Hye-Kyong (born in 1968). Kim Chong-il  married Song Hye-rim (born in 1937) and that union produced Kim  Chong-nam (born in 1971). Kim Chong-il also married Kim Hye-suk  and that union produced Kim Un-song (born in 1974).    Kim Il-song's marriage to Kim Song-ae resulted in the births  of Kim Kyong-chin (1952), Kim Pyong-il (1953) and Kim Yong-il  (1955). The latter is listed as having an offspring named Kim  Song-kang (born in 1983 with no mother listed). Kim Kyong-chin  married Kim Kwang-sop (born in 1952) and the union produced two  children (Kim Chung-min, born in 1981 and Kim Tong-min, born in  1983). Kim Pyong-il married Kim Sun-kum (born in 1956) and that  union produced two children (Kim Un-song born in 1981 and Kim  In-kang born in 1983).    EDUCATION &amp; CAREER    Sep 1948: Entered elementary school at Namsan School,  Pyongyang Jun 1950: Transferred to the Jilin  Institute in Jilin, Jilin Province, China Nov 1952:  Transferred to the fourth grade at the elementary school in  the Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute 1953:    Graduated from the Mangyongdae Revolutionary Institute  (the fourth graduating class) 1953: Transferred  to the fifth grade at Pyongyang No. 4 Elementary School from  Samsok Elementary School Sep 1954: Entered Pyongyang  No. 1 Middle School; served as chairman of the Young  Pioneers Sep 1956: Entered Namsan Higher Middle School  (senior middle school level) Sep 1960: Entered the  Political Economics Branch, the Economics Department, Kim  Il-song University May 1964: Graduated from Kim  Il-song University Apr 1964: Joined the Department of  Organization and Guidance, the WPK Central Committee  1965: Party organizational guidance worker at the North  Hamgyong Province WPK Committee 1967: Guidance worker  at the Department of Propaganda and Agitation, the WPK Central  Committee 1969: Deputy director of the Department of  Organization and Guidance, the WPK Central Committee  1971: Deputy director of the Department of Culture and  Art, the WPK Central Committee Dec 1972: Member of  the Sixth Plenum of the Fifth WPK Central Committee Sep  1973: Secretary of the WPK Central Committee for  organization and propaganda Feb 1974: Member of the  Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee Oct 1980:  Elected to the Party Military Affairs Committee at the  Sixth WPK Congress May 1990: First vice chairman, the  National Defense Commission Dec 1991: Supreme  commander, the Korean People's Army Apr 1993:  Chairman, the National Defense Commission Feb 1975:  Hero of the Republic Apr 1979: The Order of Kim Il-song  first class Feb 1982: The title of Hero and the Order  of National Flag first class Apr 1992: The title of  Marshal of the Republic    Never in Military Uniform    Unlike his half brother Kim Pyong-il, Kim Chong-il has no  military experience. But he is currently the KPA supreme  commander and holds the title of marshal. He is also the  chairman of the National Defense Commission.    But he was never, not even once, shown up in military  uniform. Even when he reviewed troops during the 60th  anniversary of the North Korean army (on 25 April 1992), he was  in people's uniform, not in military uniform. [passage omitted]    Little Experience Abroad    He was born in the Soviet Union. During the Korean War, he  took refuge in Jilin in Jilin Province, China. He never  stayed longer in any one place abroad than he did in Jilin.    (North Korea claims that Kim Chong-il took refuge in Mt  Changsa in Kanggye where he engaged in logistic support for the  KPA.)    Subsequently, accompanying Kim Il-song, Kim Chong-il visited  Moscow in 1957 and East Germany and Romania in 1959. That is  about all of his travel experience abroad. There is an  unconfirmed report that Kim Chong-il attended an East German  air force academy, but he left the academy and returned home  shortly afterward probably because he did poorly at school.    Kim Chong-il toured various places in China in 1983 and  1984. There is no further information on his foreign experience.    Maybe that is why he likes movies and music. Reportedly, he  likes Russian, American, and Japanese movies and Korean folk  songs. He likes to drink cognac while boasting of North Korean  wine, and smokes British Dunhill cigarettes, probably to  vicariously sample a foreign experience.    As for his known foreign language ability, he can say only  such rudimentary expressions as "Thank you" and "How are you?"  in Japanese. Presumably, he may speak some Chinese and German  also.    Perhaps he may be having some other foreign travel  experiences in secret.    Kim Chong-il's Nicknames    The more closed a society is, the more secret language it  produces. An examination of argot associated with Kim Chong-il  or his nicknames will be of great help in understanding his  personality.    Some of the derisive expressions used to describe his  appearance are: "oppossum hair" and "chuche hair" for his curly  hair; "squint eyes" or "cross- eyed," "midget," "greenhorn," and  "little bear" for his eyes and diminutive stature. Expressions  deriding his behavior include: "womanizer," "pervert," "brat,"  "hedgehog," and "chestnut burr." "Altitude" is slang deriding  his habit of wearing elevator shoes to appear taller than he is.

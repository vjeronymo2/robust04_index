			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Currency pressure excites Copenhagen MONEY market pressure switched from the French franc to the Danish crown yesterday, leaving Paris wary, and Copenhagen a little excited, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS offered conflicting views. Some observers believed that if the krone were forced out of the ERM, the assault on the franc would be renewed with added vigour. Others said that the franc will resist all attempts by speculators to break the ERM, given the publicised support of the German and other European monetary authorities. The CAC-40 index ended 11.85 higher at 1,974.93, a week's gain of 0.5 per cent, in turnover estimated at FFr2.5bn. A strong rise was noted in Matra-Hachette, up FFr6.40 or 5 per cent at FFr133.4, partly on rumours that the group had won a defence contract. Elsewhere Michelin gained FFr5.10 to FFr173 and Peugeot by FFr10 to FFr630. COPENHAGEN climbed higher on speculation about a possible devaluation of the krone as the currency came under attack from speculators in the money markets. The KFX index closed up 0.55 at 90.62 in turnover of DKr430m. Den Danske Bank closed up DKr6 at DKr327 while Unidanmark climbed DKr4 to DKr184. As options and futures contracts expired on the Deutsche Terminborse, FRANKFURT expected selling from the DTB in an attempt to push the DAX index down to 1,800. Instead, it got late buying from the same source, said Mr Jurgen Rossa at B Metzler, and the DAX closed 5.80 higher at 1,813.46. Turnover eased from DM8.4bn to DM7.7bn. There were contrasts in carmakers where worries over the future of the Volkswagen director, Mr Iganacio Lopez, sent the shares down DM5.20 to DM360.50 as Daimler rose DM5 to DM677.50. DB Research yesterday reconfirmed the buy recommendation it made for Daimler in mid June. That got into the post-bourse where Daimler was bid up to DM693.50, more than DM100 ahead of its price on June 14. The Ibis-indicated DAX responded with a rise to 1,829.43 in the afternoon. AMSTERDAM rose on the expiry of options, the CBS Tendency index closing up 1.0 at 118.0, but off the day's high of 118.6. The index has gained 1 per cent on the week. Nedlloyd ended at a 12-month high on speculation that a US group was seeking a merger with the shipping division. The shares put on Fl 1.50 to Fl 38.10. KLM closed off 10 cents at Fl 33.30 after earlier seeing Fl 34.20 as it said that it would match the fares of a US competitor on transatlantic routes. Hoogovens rose Fl 1.30 to Fl 41.10 after Thursday's news that the city of Amsterdam had sold its 5 per cent stake. MILAN was pleased at the performance of the enlarged screen trading system which came into operation yesterday. Most of the major stocks are now available on the telematic, which accounts for some 80 per cent of total market capitalisation. The Comit index finished 1.84 higher at 556.41, a rise of 2 per cent on the week, in good volume. Telecommunications issues fell back after Thursday's news of delays in the privatisation programme: Stet slipped L149 to L3,776 and Sip lost L74 to L2,736. However, losses in this sector were the exception with the other blue chips picking up gains across the board. Fiat put on L134 to L6,604 and Pirelli L80 to L1,589. Generali continued its rally and broke the L40,000 level with a rise of L258 to L40,008. Benetton, another popular stock at the moment, ended L302 higher at L20,562. ZURICH saw most interest in special situations as the SMI index eased 2.7 to 2,396.4, 0.3 per cent down on the week after Wednesday's 1993 closing high of 2,419.0. SMH, the watchmaker, fell SFr4 to SFr234 after SFr222, down SFr31 on the week after a Goldman Sachs downgrade on Thursday. Meanwhile, Saurer, the textile machinery and technology group, recovered another SFr50 to SFr2,150 as Mr Vittorio Ghidella, who resigned as board chairman on Thursday, handed himself over to Italian authorities, as the group appointed the former Volkswagen chief, Mr Carl Hahn, to replace him and as it forecast higher earnings for 1993. STOCKHOLM closed higher for the ninth straight session on gains in selected blue chips and in the forestry sector. This helped offset a decline in Ericsson, which has led the market's rally this week, as its B shares lost SKr3 to SKr380. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 3.1 to 1148.0, up 3 per cent on the week. Turnover was SKr869m. OSLO rose to a new 22-month high, led by strength in shipping stocks. The All-share index rose 3.13 to 521.72 and the shipping index 15.82 to 571.99. Bergesen put on NKr5.50 to NKr152. Hafslund Nycomed went against the trend, losing NKr5.50 to NKr120 following downgrades of pharmaceutical shares in the US on Thursday. ISTANBUL closed the week on a positive note although some sporadic profit-taking was noted throughout the day. The composite index gained 173.6 to 10,617, for a rise of 3.3 per cent on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- July 16                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes           Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1229.71   1228.95   1228.95   1229.22 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1275.43   1276.15   1275.67   1275.84  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1230.13   1231.13   1232.52   1234.37 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1276.72   1278.74   1279.94   1281.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jul 15    Jul 14    Jul 13    Jul 12    Jul 9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1229.70   1237.14   1235.91   1232.90   1230.56 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1278.79   1283.38   1279.32   1274.63   1274.12  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1234.69 ; 200 - 1282.16 Low/day: 100 - 1228.39  200 - 1274.62 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

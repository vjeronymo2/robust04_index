			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PESKY FLU BUG RETURNS IN ANNUAL VISIT; NO EVIDENCE OF EPIDEMIC  </P> <P> It's that time of year again. Influenza, a contagious disease characterized by  fever, muscle pain and an inflamed respiratory tract, is making its rounds in  San Diego.  </P> <P> In the past 30 days, five reported cases of influenza were confirmed by  laboratory analysis, county health officials said. But, because most doctors  don't confirm influenza by sending samples to a lab, "That's only the tip of  the iceberg. . . . If there are five, there are literally dozens, maybe  hundreds, more," said health official Dr. Donald Ramras.  </P> <P> However, health officials say there is no epidemic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> School Absenteeism  </P> <P> School absenteeism rates -- used by the County Health Services Department to  determine whether there is an influenza outbreak -- are not yet available  because students have only just returned to classes after the holidays.  Absenteeism rates before Christmas were "normal," Ramras said.  </P> <P> Judy Beck, school nurse supervisor for the San Diego Unified School District,  said she had no indication of large numbers of students catching influenza.  </P> <P> District figures show 96,659 absences because of illness or other personal  reasons from Nov. 7 to Dec. 2, contrasted with 89,549 absences from Oct. 10 to  Nov. 4. These figures do not include absences because of truancy.  </P> <P> The two other indexes the county uses to determine epidemics, the number of  laboratory tests and emergency room admissions, do not indicate an epidemic  either, Ramras said.  </P> <P> "Influenza is not a reportable disease; there's no way of getting a firm feel  of what's going on . . . there's no question we have some," he said. "The  extent is just hard to put a finger on." The disease, he said, is "very common  for this time of the year. We're probably going to continue to have it for the  next couple months."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slight Increase  </P> <P> Laura Avallone, a spokeswoman for Mercy Hospital, said the emergency room had  seen a "slight increase" in people coming in with colds and influenza.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for UC San Diego Medical Center's Family Practice said more  people have been coming in with viruses, coughs and sore throats and more have  been requesting flu vaccinations.  </P> <P> Dr. Michael Berger at Palomar Hospital's emergency room said he has not seen  anything indicating an outbreak of influenza, but he said more people are  likely to catch it at this time of year. "The cold weather doesn't bring it on,  but people are indoors more and the infectivity is enhanced," he said.  </P> <P> Ramras said influenza can kill people in "high risk" groups -- in particular  older people with chronic heart or metabolic problems and kidney and lung  complications.  </P> <P> The best protection from the disease is immunization, he said.  </P> <P> "Other than that, just keep generally in good health," Ramras said. "There's no  way to prevent exposure unless you live in a closed box. . . . It's just plain  old common sense, not abusing your body."  </P></p>

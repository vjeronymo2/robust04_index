			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Interior Minister Ramon Escovar </F> Salom by Luis Vallenilla; place and date not given]    [Text] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom said: "No  political big stick has been used against Carlos Andres Perez."  Thus, he replied to Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who claimed he was  a personal friend of the jailed former president and attributed  Perez' current situation to maneuvers by his enemies.    "I acknowledge and respect the opinion of a man like Gabriel  Garcia Marquez, but I do not think he has been adequately  informed about what has happened in Venezuela," the interior  minister curtly replied.    Escovar argues that Perez was tried with all the appropriate  guarantees. That trial, he notes, was for embezzlement and  misappropriation of funds. "It is not at all true that he was  tried because he is a champion of democracy in America. He has  not been jailed for the good he has done for democracy but for  the harm he has caused the nation," Escovar said.    Escovar believes this trial "stimulates the moral recovery  of  Venezuela and strengthens democratic institutions."    Remarking that it was the first time that a president in  office has ever been tried, Escovar recalled that when he  initiated his action against Carlos Andres Perez (11 March  1993), "no one believed it was possible."    "Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the action I  undertook had a solid basis, as evidenced by the fact that the  Senate unanimously suspeded Carlos Andres Perez from his post.  Now, an arrest warrant has been issued against him with 10  votes in favor of the decision and five against."    The interior minister believes what some are saying, that  is,  that Carlos Andres Perez accepted his arrest while apparently  rejecting privileges as a maneuver to regain credibility and  popularity.    "The polls indicate that public opinion is against the  former  president even while he tries to portray himself as a victim to  see if he can generate some support. The Democratic Action  Party National Directorate has just excluded him from the party,  thereby announcing that his strategy will not work," Escovar  noted.    In Escovar's opinion, Perez is not anyone's victim, much  less  a victim of Escovar's alleged rage. "He is the victim of his  own actions. He is only targeting himself for serious abuse  when he attempts to personalize the matter by saying that this  is a hateful conspiracy against him, not a legal action for  embezzlement and misappropriation of funds.  <H5>  Relations With Colombia </H5>   In response to insistent reports that certain Colombian  sectors support an armed aggression against Venezuela because  the new president will not fulfill Perez' exaggerated promises,  especially those involving the Gulf, the interior minister  affirmed that relations with the neighboring country "are  excellent."    Contrary to the popular opinion that Gaviria's visit was  highly untimely (among other reasons, because he is about to  leave office), Escovar said: "It was one of the best  presidential visits I have seen because it was not an encounter  of protocol, rhetoric, or pomp and circumstance; it was a  working meeting."    Escovar reiterated that the visit was significant: "Mainly  because it stimulates a new climate of trust in the mutual  affairs that demand our attention."    In terms of the new climate of trust, the interior minister  explained that some people in Colombia believed relations  depended on Perez. Perez, he noted, did more harm than good to  those relations. Why? Escovar responded: "Because no one in  Venezuela trusted the way Perez managed relations between the  two states and the two peoples. Now relations are better  because no one doubts that the president will manage them  skillfully and impartially."    Nevertheless, we told Escovar that the Venezuelan media  reported that the meeting with Gaviria concluded with the  signing of a document of no importance.    To this Escovar replied: "There is one point which refutes  that. The joint declaration signed by the two presidents  acknowledged the importance illegal aliens have for Venezuela.  It recognizes that Venezuela is absolutely sovereign on  deciding who can remain in Venezuela and who cannot."    He added that the importance of cooperation between the two  governments in the immigration problem was stressed. "This  issue alone justifies the visit by President Gaviria and his  team. By the way, there are some very brilliant, top-notch  people on that team."    We then mentioned Decree 1911, which allows the  registration of children born to illegal aliens. Escovar Shalom  commented: "This was a serious, disturbing problem. I have the  authority to speak on this because I opposed the decree. I  asked the Court to annul it, and I asked President Velasquez to  repeal it, which he did."    The interior minister mentioned the ambiguities of the  decree. The decree granted more privileges to illegal aliens  than to Venezuelans, who, without proper identification, cannot  register their children with the vital statistics registrar.  "It is not a matter of being against Colombians or anyone from  another nation, it is against illegal aliens," he noted.    Escovar was then asked if this irregularity was corrected by  repealing the decree. The interior minister appeared somewhat  surprised by the question. Although the legal amparo no longer  exists, it is still possible that exceptions continue in some  cases.    He jots this down in a notebook and says that a memorandum  will be sent on the matter, although he does not doubt that  children continue to be illegally registered as Venezuelans  through irregular procedures such as forging documents.    "Is this one of this government's and the nation's biggest  problems?"    Escovar says he has a great interest in confronting this  challenge efficiently but that he does not expect miracles. He  refers to how from the beginning this government was able to  reduce the number of people killed by firearms over the weekend.    "When the Metropolitan Police relaxed, there was a rise in  the number of deaths. That is now being corrected.... As  interior minister, I have insisted that the police remain  deployed on the streets. This means breaking the culture of  police inertia and bureaucracy.... If the action is not  consistent, the results won't last," the interior minister  observed.    But what about poverty and the forgotten neighborhoods where  there is not even a training facility for young people?    The interior minister replied: "The problem lies deeper and  requires coordinated action in the needy neighborhoods with  neighborhood associations and other organizations. We are  already doing some of this, but not with the required intensity.  There are still many setbacks in coordination. The problem  goes far beyond what statistics and the formal appearances  disclose. We must get to the bottom of the matter. True  progress cannot be achieved without prevention and improvement  in the social conditions and without counting on a new, more  highly trained police force that is better equipped and has  ethical values."    He was then questioned on how the student bus fare issue was  finally resolved. He recognized that the subsidy must be  maintained but administered in another way. "It must not  generate corruption or conflicts," he remarked.  <H5>  Caldera's Apparent Inertia </H5>   Caldera appears to have fallen into inertia. Some say he  seems to be playing a solitary game of chess. He is neither  seen nor heard, despite what one would expect of him in a  situation as difficult as the one the nation is experiencing.    Escovar stated: "The president is attentive to the  government. Just because he does not make many public  appearances does not mean he is inactive. He is focused on his  main obligation; that is, to govern..."    The minister noted that besides, "his attitude contrasts  with the verbal hemorrhage [hemorragia verbal] of previous  years."    The interior minister denied Antonio Ledezma's charges that  now he combats the same hooded individuals he protected as  prosecutor general. "I always fought them as prosecutor  general. I have told the students this both privately and  publicly. As interior minister, I have instructed the police  throughout the nation to arrest hooded individuals. The law  should be applied to those of legal age and the provisions in  the Law on Protection of Minors to minors.    Escovar noted that on several occasions he has spoken with  students in his office. Their leaders have been asked to reject  the presence of hooded individuals and violence in general.    The students say these people are a minority without any  roots, at least not in the university. They claim that they are  small groups removed from the student body. At times they are  joined by high school students.    "This is the only time that students have come to this  office  to drink coffee and talk with the minister. I told them a few  days ago they should have rejected the people shooting at the  police cars just like the government rejected the police officer  who killed the student from Fermin Toro school."    Nevertheless, Escovar acknowledged that in the past, the  pressure of student and other types of demonstrations had  lessened. He believes that if the police have put away their  weapons and adopted a tolerant attitude, the students should  moderate their impulses and demonstrate in a civilized manner.    Returning to hooded individuals, he again insisted that  there  is no contradiction between his policy as prosecutor general and  his policy as minister.    "The Presidency has regained its majesty with Dr. Rafael  Caldera and that is noteworthy. Besides, only three months have  gone by, and a government cannot be judged after 90 days, much  less amid a crisis as traumatic as this one."    Are changes in the works?    Escovar replies that it is not his place to discuss that. He  mentioned, however, a maneuver to generate friction among the  ministers and a conspiracy among public office aspirants whose  expectations were not fulfilled or who were not chosen for the  positions they sought.    "Their goal is to spread all sorts of rumors about the  ministers."    He recommends looking at this "conspiracy" from the  viewpoint  of the local culture, as part of the tropical folklore.    He adds: "Now, the possibility of change always exists."    Rumors (we tell the minister), which recently constituted a  very popular and exploited tool, were always a recourse, a  weapon of the population.    Escovar notes: "Rumors and gossip are part of  communication... Sometimes they are free information bulletins."    Escovar added that the popular media have become more  sophisticated. Rumors are not just spread orally, by idle talk,  anymore. "Now there is the anonymous fax, a vicious tool being  used to publicize all sorts of maneuvers and which does not  require many people."    Escovar relates how the so-called "Operation Centaur" was  extensively publicized in this way. Those behind "Operation  Centaur" claim that Escovar, Jose Vicente Rangel, Rafael Poleo,  Radical Cause, and others plotted to destabilize bankers and  businessmen to set up a communist regime in Venezuela.    And what is the source of that campaign and those strange  charges?    "Rumors such as those circulated by `Operation Centaur'  preceded the arrest warrant against Perez. It is obvious that  there are certain interests and persons who dislike my being  interior minister."  <H5>  That Cancer Called the Sectorial General Directorate of </H5> Identification and Control of Foreigners [Diex]    Escovar said that as for the Diex, strict measures are being  taken. "We need to clean house, to begin and conclude a clean  operation." With this goal in mind, he has given specific and  categorical instructions to the new Diex directors.    The operation has begun with immigration officials and  includes an investigation to determine the origins of several  falsifications and the forgery of documents used to legalize  visas, residence permits, and other transactions.    "The Diex, as it currently operates, does not defend  Venezuela's national sovereignty." Escovar adds: "I am willing  to take action against all those people." He explains that it  is not an easy task, but it will be undertaken, even if most of  the staff has to be changed." [no opening quotation marks as  published]  <H5>  Presidential Aspirations </H5>   Ramon Escovar Salom, who has been minister four times (twice  under Carlos Andres Perez himself) and former ambassador to  France, was constantly mentioned as a presidential hopeful while  he was prosecutor general.    "When some groups offered to promote my candidacy, I  understood that the time was not right. I did not agree to run  for first senator of the Federal District, either, and decided  to remain as prosecutor general."    He recalls that many insisted he was doomed to fail when he  became prosecutor general. His opponents now make similar or  worse predictions, perhaps because people know he acts  independently and fear he will unveil a few crimes.    Let me remind you of the failure of many other interior  ministers. Right now, one of them is in prison with Carlos  Andres Perez. "But I am not the executor of other people's  failures... Those who are dying to see me fail as interior  minister will be disappointed. This applies to those I call the  authors of the bogeyman."    Does that mean you are not afraid that the position will  wear  you out?    "Before they claimed I was preparing my presidential  campaign, now they say I am burying it because I accepted this  ministry."    What do you think?    "Conjectures do not always match the facts. The well-worn  expression neither one nor the other but quite the opposite  comes to mind."    He recalled that in addition to the offers to run for  president or senator, he was offered the post of international  prosecutor (the equivalent of UN under secretary general, with a  $14,000 salary) to try Yugoslavian war criminals.    "It was not like I did not have anything better to do, but I  believed my duty was to stay here and accept President Caldera's  offer.    What is your goal?    "That is unpredictable. Just remember how Christopher  Columbus sailed for the East and ended up reaching the West."    But is that the way to reach the presidency?    "It is not necessarily a way, but it is not an obstacle,  either."</p>

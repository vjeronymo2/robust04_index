The opposition to  President Gnassingbe Eyadema, who has ruled the small West  African country for 27 years, claims to have won the poll,  taking 43 of the 81 national assembly seats, which would entitle  it to form a government. But Eyadema's supporters have alleged  irregularities and stated that they want the results annulled in  five of the constituencies the opposition declared it has won.    The Supreme Court, which received the results from the  National Electoral Commission on Monday, now has two weeks  officially to release them and rule on any eventual annulments.  The poll came after years of unrest, which claimed scores of  lives and saw thousands of people flee the country, following a  national conference in 1991 to pave the way for multi-party  politics.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / International Company News: TNT fills two board positions TNT, the Australian transportation group, has filled two of the boardroom vacancies created by the resignation of six directors last year. The company said yesterday that Professor Fred Hilmer and Mr Ian Salmon had been appointed in a non-executive capacity. The large number of vacancies occurred after Sir Peter Abeles, who played a major part in building up TNT, resigned from the board after policy differences. Other directors in the Abeles camp followed suit. TNT subsequently indicated that all seats might not be filled, and that the board size would probably shrink. Professor Hilmer is Dean of the Australian Graduate School of Management in the University of New South Wales, and also an MBA from the Wharton School of Finance in the US. He is a former senior partner of McKinsey &amp; Company, the consultancy firm. Mr Salmon is managing director of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, one of the country's largest financial institutions.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (2): Domestic orders have fallen off - Andrew Fisher reviews the state of manufacturing industry For a country of less than 7m people, Switzerland has some of the most internationally-oriented companies in the world. Many of them sell more abroad than at home and some - notably in the textile machinery sector - even produce more outside than inside their own country. In the mechanical and electrical engineering industry, exports account for nearly 70 per cent of total turnover. Yet there is a worrying aspect to this success in foreign markets. It is not that companies' performance is so closely tied to growth elsewhere, notably in Germany. That is the overall competitive and economic environment in which companies are used to operating. What concerns the industry is that domestic orders have fallen so sharply in the past few years. Last year, according to the Swiss association of machinery manufacturers (VSM), new domestic orders fell by almost 10 per cent after a near 17 per cent collapse in 1992. Foreign orders rose by 3 per cent, producing an overall decline for 1993 of 1.2 per cent. Although domestic business picked up strongly in the fourth quarter, that was only because of some large orders from the army and Swiss railways. With a quarter of its home market having disappeared since 1991, Mr Thomas Gasser, the VSM's president, is arguing strongly for a political decision to prevent capital investment being postponed until the introduction of value-added tax in 1995. The VSM estimates that at least 10 per cent or some SFr1bn of investment which would benefit VSM companies could be delayed. The reason is that VAT will not be levied on such investments, unlike the previous indirect tax system. Whatever the outcome of this issue, the VSM does at least see the chance of an overall improvement in its members' business this year. 'I'm moderately optimistic about 1994,' says VSM's director Mr Martin Erb. 'I expect more orders from abroad and I hope domestic orders will stabilise.' Much, of course, depends on what happens in Germany, by far the biggest customer. The European Union accounted last year for just under 60 per cent of the industry's exports, which were down slightly to the region overall. Mr Gasser is not over-optimistic about the immediate prospects for the German economy and thus for the rest of Europe. Helping to counter this trend near to home has been an explosive growth in Asian markets. Leading these last year was China where exports by the Swiss machinery and electrical sector rose by 59 per cent. China thus overtook Japan as the industry's largest customer in Asia. Altogether, exports to Asia rose by more than 9 per cent, with steep rises also recorded in Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Yet such successes could not wholly compensate for the problems elsewhere. The turnover of VSM companies last year fell by 6.6 per cent to SFr24.1bn. Mr Gasser, also deputy chief executive of ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering concern, has no doubts about the innovative abilities of Swiss companies as they strive to reverse this trend. 'We're as good as anybody else,' he says. 'Large countries have all been decentralising. This will spur innovation.' Also, he stresses that Switzerland's traditional attributes of quality, efficiency and peace on the labour front will continue to stand industry in good stead. 'From the competitive point of view, I feel fairly strongly that there's nothing wrong with industry.' Where he does see a problem is in the structural rigidities which have developed in the Swiss economy. The Swiss are used to living well and cartels and monopolies have been allowed to prosper. Mr Gasser does not think there is enough urgency, either in the government or among the population, in pursuing this issue. 'We're too happy with ourselves,' he says. Cartel groupings and local curbs on public purchasing in other areas - both of which the government is now trying to combat under its 'revitalisation' programme - affect industry's costs, he points out. Because of Switzerland's high productivity and longer working hours, unit labour costs are actually lower than in neighbouring Germany - a big competitor as well as customer. However, this advantage will not necessarily last. 'Next year, unit labour costs in Germany are likely to stagnate, as in Switzerland this year,' says Mr Alois Bischofberger, economic research head at Credit Suisse. 'The competitive advantage against Germany is likely to disappear.' Like other economists, he is not dismayed by the strength of the Swiss franc against the D-Mark and other currencies. 'Experience shows that currencies are not the most important factor,' says Mr Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss research at Bank Julius Baer. 'More important is the recovery in other economies.' As yet, the signs from world markets are mixed. Mr Fritz Fahrni, chief executive of the Sulzer engineering group, sees slight indications of a recovery in North America but does not expect much growth in Europe. 'I'm afraid there is no boom around the corner.' Sulzer is one company which has been rationalising its production and management to stay competitive. Like ABB, it has been encouraging older managers to retire and striving to bring on new products - as in its fast-growing medical technology division which accounts for 36 per cent of R&amp;D - as rapidly as possible. However, this streamlining trend in industry has further to go. 'Not all plants have been rationalised,' notes Mr Kaufmann. Some of the smaller ones failed by under-estimating the amount of re-organisation and investment (both in money and effort) needed in new computer systems and software. 'If you want to compete with the Far East, you have to be very modern these days,' he adds. As the export figures show, many companies have taken advantage of the prospects in Asian markets. But there is a social cost to this process of steady improvement: job losses. The VSM says 10,000 jobs have been lost in the industry in each of the past three years. While this is not dramatic in an industry employing some 340,000 people, it is certainly an unwelcome change for a country where unemployment used to be virtually unknown.</p>

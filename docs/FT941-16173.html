			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Maxwell liquidators recover Pounds 27m from Lehman Pension schemes formerly controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, were boosted by a further Pounds 27m when Lehman Brothers, the US-based investment bank, yesterday returned disputed shares - the second such refund of contested securities within the past week. Last week, Bank of America agreed to return Pounds 25m to the Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Scheme, settling a claim which had been the subject of a writ. The Lehman holdings, units in a Lazard Property Unit Trust and shares in the Daily Telegraph, were part of a Pounds 100m writ filed against Lehman Brothers last September by Robson Rhodes, liquidator of the Maxwell-controlled fund manager, Bishopsgate Investment Management. Lehman Brothers said it intended to defend its claim to the remaining Pounds 73m. However, it said it continued 'to support initiatives designed to achieve an early resolution of the disputes surrounding the collapse of the Maxwell empire'. The shares were actually returned last November, but Lehman Brothers and Robson Rhodes delayed announcing the development while both parties discussed a possible settlement of the entire claim. The refund was made after Robson Rhodes informed Lehman Brothers it would seek a so-called summary judgment in respect of that portion of its writ. 'Our claim to these shares was so good it was not even a triable issue,' said Mr Neil Cooper, partner at Robson Rhodes. Among other things, the Lazard Property Unit Trust could only be owned by a tax-exempt entity such as a pension scheme and Lehman Brothers could not legally have taken title to them, the writ alleged. Robson Rhodes has been seeking return of the securities from Lehman Brothers since December 1991, and has in the past accused Lehman Brothers of trying to obstruct its efforts to trace assets claimed by pensioners. Yesterday, Lehman Brothers said: 'Having satisfied ourselves of the facts of the claim and that the securities belong to the Common Investment Fund (of the Maxwell pension schemes) and not to any other party, we were very pleased to make this move.' Meanwhile, Sir Peter Webster, appointed as a government mediator to seek a 'global solution' to the myriad claims by the pension schemes against banks, insurance companies and advisers, is said to be making progress. Mr Frank Field, chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Social Security, which has held extensive hearings on the Maxwell pension scandal, said the recent refunds to the schemes are a good sign.</p>

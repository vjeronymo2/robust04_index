			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Women's pensions bill main casualty of legislative line-up POLITICALLY sensitive plans to raise the state retirement age for women were postponed by Cabinet ministers yesterday as they agreed a programme for next year aimed at calming Tories with populist measures on crime and deregulation. The pensions equalisation bill was the biggest casualty as agreement was reached on the legislative programme for the parliamentary session starting in November. A white paper, expected to recommend raising the state pension age for women from 60 to 65 sometime next century, is now not likely until autumn. Also delayed until the 1994-95 session at least is legislation on privatising the Post Office. But Cabinet ministers gave the go ahead to three Home Office bills  - on Sunday trading, tougher penalties against juvenile and other criminals, and restructuring the police service. Mr John Major will today try to restore an impression of stable government after the serious buffeting of the last week following disastrous by-election and local election results. In spite of government U-turns this week on schools testing and yesterday on the unit fines system, the prime minister will seek to assure party activists at the Scottish Tory party conference that he is determined to carry through the policies to which Tories are pledged. Mr Major will claim that a commitment to combat crime is an enduring strength of the Conservative party and will promise all policies will be geared towards a sustainable economic recovery. The prime minister's office rebuffed suggestions the government had slimmed down its legislative plans in the face of growing dissent within Tory ranks. Adding to government difficulties was the death yesterday of Mr Robert Adley, Tory MP for Christchurch, cutting the party's majority to 18. The swing Liberal Democrats need to overturn his 23,000 majority is less than the party achieved in last week's Newbury by-election. Between 15 to 20 bills are expected for the parliamentary session beginning in November. A bill on banking supervision promised after the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International has been suspended. But measures agreed for next year include a deregulation bill, drawn up by the Department of Trade and Industry, but including the deregulation of London buses. The Foreign Office has won space for a bill to put the overseas security service MI6 on a statutory basis. But the government has yet to decide on whether to increase the accountability of MI6 and its domestic counterpart MI5 to parliament. A bill is expected on restricting media use of bugging and telephoto lenses  - although ministers will deny it has been approved in response to claims that the Royal family has been bugged. Certain to be included, however, is legislation restricting the availability of invalidity benefit, restructuring of Scottish and Welsh local councils, privatising British Coal, setting up an environment protection agency, reforming teacher training and ending the monopoly of the National Union of Students.

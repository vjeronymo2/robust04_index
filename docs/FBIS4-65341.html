			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Philip Johnson and Colin Randall: "Mayhew Warned </F> of Trap in Ulster"]    [Text] Belfast -- Ulster Unionists warned the Government  yesterday against being drawn into talks with Sinn Fein about  the Downing Street declaration on the future of the province  after ministers agreed to answer questions seeking to  "clarifying" the document.    Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland Secretary, is  considering a response to questions put by Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn  Fein president, and channelled to London through Dublin.    He will publish his answers this week, but is expected to  regard many of the points as matters for negotiation once the  IRA gives up violence.    Official sources made clear that the reply would be  determined by an assessment of whether the list amounts to a  genuine attempt to clear up misunderstandings or ambiguity.    The move has rekindled hardline Unionist suspicions that the  Government is prepared to engage in dialogue with the  republicans before they have agreed to a permanent end to  violence. The Government denies this.    Since the declaration was signed five months ago the  Government has refused repeated Sinn Fein requests for formal  clarification though some ministerial speeches have been  interpreted as attempts to address republican concerns.    Anger among some Unionists that the Government should even  contemplate answering Sinn Fein's points will have added to Sir  Patrick's determination to give no impression of succumbing to  republican demands for detailed amplification of the  declaration. He will argue that some of the issues raised have  already been amply dealt with in ministers speeches and  statements.    Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist  Party, said: "Once again we have a Government that lies and  deceives, a Government that tells us one thing and does another."    More moderate Unionists were prepared to back the  Government's willingness to respond to the questions, provided  the answers made clear that there would be no further  accommodation of Sinn Fein without a permanent cessation of  violence.    Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionists, said  that  while the IRA was merely engaging in a further ploy with no real  intention of ending terrorism, it was "a good thing that their  bluff will be called and all will be revealed."    Mr Ken Maginnis, MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, said:  "The Government should indicate to Sinn Fein one overriding  pre-condition -- an unconditional end to violence."    But with progress on the declaration held up and the  separate  political process suspended until after the European elections,  some Unionists fear that frustration at the lack of progress  will bring overtures to Sinn Fein from London and Dublin.    Mr John Taylor, MP for Strangford, accused the Government of  "playing the tune" of the IRA and said the province had lost  confidence in Sir Patrick.    The Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, told Irish  radio from America where he briefed President Clinton at the  weekend: "There is a price to be paid for peace and all parties  to the conflict in Northern Ireland should see it that way and  make their contribution towards removing all the blocks."    Mr Adams told a meeting in Dublin that he wanted an end to  the clarification debate "so we can all move the peace process  on to the next stage."</p>

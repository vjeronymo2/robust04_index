			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> DESIGN;  </P> <P> ROMANCING THE TABLE  </P> <P> While looking for finishing touches for the elegant homes she designs, Winkler  discovered that she could never find just the right table, bed and bath linens  and accessories. So she decided to create her own.  </P> <P> The result is Bebe's Home, a collection of rich, romantic items for the home.  </P> <P> All the pieces of the collection -- which comprise English manor, French estate  and New York pied-a-terre styles -- are perfect for eclectic California. And  all complement one another: Bed treatments, cushions and sofa throws echo the  fabrics and trims of the table linens.  </P> <P> Bebe's Table includes what Winkler calls table "shawls," in rich damask and  lush cotton fabrics trimmed with fringe, which are layered over tablecloths;  the "palettes" (place mats), made of damask and trimmed with braid are  available in round and rectangular sizes. The matching napkins come in 22- or  24-inch sizes, and there are also smaller "aperitif" napkins in a variety of  fabrics, trimmed with braids and fringes. Perhaps the most unique of the table  collection are what Winkler calls "Fashion Wraps," an innovative approach to  napkin rings: elegant tasseled cords, ruby- and ivory-lacquer "signature  bracelets," ivory-and-onyx-toned wood rings and a brass-buckle knife rest that  can also be used to encircle a napkin.  </P> <P>  Bebe's Home items are available at Terra Cotta, 11925 Montana Ave., Brentwood;  (213) 826-7878.  </P> <P> ROBIN TUCKER  </P></p>

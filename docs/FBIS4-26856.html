			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Yang Yuanhua (2799 0337 5478): "The New </F> Development of Relations Between NATO and Russia"]    [Text] NATO and Russia announced on 17 June that Russian  Foreign Minister Kozyrev would hold talks at NATO headquarters  in Brussels with the U.S. secretary of state and the foreign  ministers of some other NATO countries on the issue of security  in the modern world, would sign the framework document on  Russia's participation in the "partnership for peace" plan, and  would then make public the documents about the consultations  between the two sides. This shows that relations between the  two sides have eased further, reflects Russia's strategic  conception of fully participating in world affairs, and also  indicates that bilateral relations will enter a new stage of  development.    Since the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the  Soviet Union, NATO and Russia readjusted their respective  strategies and foreign policies and have reestablished their  basic principles. In January this year, NATO put forth the  "partnership for peace" plan to ensure its continuing existence  and development in an attempt to play a central role in Europe's  future security pattern so that it could build up closer  political and military cooperative relations with all European  countries, including the former USSR republics and neutral  countries. Russia's participation in the "partnership" is an  important element of its general plan for fully participating in  European affairs.    The Russian president will attend the European Union summit  meeting on Greece's Corfu Island on 24 June and will initial a  partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union.  Between 8 and 10 July, he will attend the G-7 summit meeting in  Naples of Italy and will play a full role in political  consultations for the first time at the "seven plus one" meeting.    In order to satisfy Russia's demands, the NATO foreign  ministers meeting in Istanbul, Turkey on 9 June agreed with  Russia's proposal for expanding the scope of cooperation  consultations beyond the "partnership for peace" scheme to cover  issues such as the settlement of the local conflicts in former  Yugoslavia and the prevention of nuclear proliferation. NATO  also accepted the principle of "no veto and no surprise attack"  and agreed to make public the documents related to the bilateral  consultations on comprehensive security relations. However,  NATO only admitted that such consultations were informal and not  automatic and required that the relevant issues be discussed  individually. It also insisted that Russia cannot veto NATO's  decisions but can be notified beforehand of NATO's major  decisions.    On 17 June, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin arrived  in Brussels and held talks on the details of Russia's full  security cooperation relationship with NATO. Reportedly, the  Russian side put forth a draft version of the cooperation  agreement, including the point that the main objective of the  "partnership for peace" is to cooperate to solve crises, calm  down conflicts, arrange peace-keeping actions, and establish an  effective mechanism for maintaining European security and  stability, with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe playing a major role. Russia also proposed that  cooperation be carried out in the fields of preventing nuclear  proliferation, preventing possible new nuclear threats, shifting  the war industry to civilian production, coordinating the  production of new weapons, fighting terrorism, and advancing  disarmament and arms control. This showed that the new  developments in NATO-Russian relations would have a far-reaching  influence on the security pattern in Europe -- and in the world  as a whole -- as well as on relations between various countries.</p>

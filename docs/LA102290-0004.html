			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN IN MEN'S LOCKER ROOMS  </P> <P> There appear to be three logical alternative to resolve the current controversy  over women reporters conducting their interviews in the men's locker room.  </P> <P> 1. Provide an interview room for all reporters; 2. Install a communications  system that women can use from outside of the locker room, or 3. Require all  reporters to disrobe before entering the locker room.  </P> <P> Hopefully, a compromise will be reached before we find Barbara Walters  interviewing Mike Tyson in the men's room at Los Angeles International Airport!  </P> <P> RICK MEASE, Carpinteria  </P></p>

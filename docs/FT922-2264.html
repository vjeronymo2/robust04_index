			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Gatt talks on tariffs fail to make progress TRADE officials from about 40 countries taking part in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks yesterday admitted defeat in their attempt to move forward in the stalled tariff negotiations. Officials are looking to next month's Munich summit of the seven leading industrialised nations for progress in the transatlantic wrangle over farm trade reform, the critical issue blocking the round. Smaller rich and poor countries had hoped that the United States and the European Community would agree to reveal enough about their bilateral tariff negotiations to enable the detailed country-by-country bargaining on market access to restart. The US/EC tariff deal, when complete, will set the pattern for others, under the non-discrimination rule of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). But at a meeting called yesterday by Mr Germain Denis, the Canadian chairman of the market access negotiations, the US and EC again refused to show their hands. Both regard the outstanding tariff issues as too sensitive to display in a wider forum, while admitting that these issues are unlikely to be resolved without an accord on farm trade. The tariff negotiations are intended to produce an overall one-third cut in customs duties on farm and industrial goods.</p>

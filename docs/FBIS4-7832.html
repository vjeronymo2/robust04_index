			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Marica Lalovic from Pale] </F>   [Text] Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic,  held talks with Yasushi Akashi, special envoy to the UN  secretary general, in Pale today. Akashi said afterwards that  the talks mainly focused on the situation in Gorazde and the  corridor leading toward the town. He expressed the hope that  the United Nations Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] will visit the  town soon in order to acquaint themselves with the real  situation in the field and the (?possible) level of damage that  was caused in the most recent battles. At the same time, he  said that UNPROFOR will strive to do everything with a view to  establishing a cease-fire [words indistinct] of the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. For a complete and whole peace in this  region, the agreement between the Croats and the Muslims will  not suffice. The third -- Serbian side -- must be included with  a view to establishing a lasting peace and a lasting solution.  On the basis of an agreement of all three sides, one should  build peace and demilitarization of the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Akashi said.    Radovan Karadzic pointed out that Gorazde and the territory  surrounding it is only a small part of the front and the great  Muslim offensive that is taking place on all sections of the  line of separation with the Serbian forces. The Serbian side  offered to the Muslims peace and to have the battles stopped on  all sections of the battlefield, as one cannot solve the  conflict partially -- that is, where it suits the Muslims. We  are ready, Dr. Karadzic said, to make it possible for military  observers to enter Gorazde so they can see for themselves that  the town is not endangered and that battles are waged only where  Muslims attacked the Serbian forces. At the same time, he  stressed that the Serbian side does not want any more  territories, that it is ready to concede certain percentages of  what it currently has under control, and one should believe the  Serbs when they say that offensives and war are not in their  interest. However, if the Muslims attack, they run the risk of  gambling with their own territory and their lives. They may  lose much more than they could win with peace, Dr. Karadzic  said. At the same time, he demanded that the international  community not help the Muslims feel secure in regions where they  do not have a military advantage or to help them where the Serbs  have a military advantage so that they may again feel more  secure there.    Therefore, one needs an equal treatment and warning sign to  the Muslims that through gambling and war, they could lose a  lot. When such large-scale battles are being waged, percentages  do not mean anything, Karadzic said, and reiterated that we are  ready to give a part of the territory, but only in exchange for  a lasting peace. He demanded that members of the peace forces  pay attention to the possibility of survival of the Muslim-Croat  federation and the Serbian entity on these regions. The Serbian  side has nothing against this federation, as long as it is not  directed against them. We have our own territory; we have our  republic, which is a reality, and we should be allowed to  survive. With time, these two states -- the Srpska republic and  the Muslim-Croatian federation -- will establish some kind of  relations to the extent that the peoples would want and would  allow.</p>

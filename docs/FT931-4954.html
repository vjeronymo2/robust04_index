			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: The story of three men in a vote SCARCELY HAD the echo died from a chorus of ministers calling at the weekend for loyalty in Tory ranks yesterday than the divisions, and plotting, re-opened over Maastricht. Conservative MPs divide into three broad camps: the die-hard Euro-rebels to whom defeating Maastricht is top priority and who want to exploit every chance to de-rail the bill; the government loyalists who want Maastricht approved and are prepared to fight for it; and the frustrated MPs in the middle - who want most to turn parliament's attention to other business. THE DIE-HARD: MR Michael Spicer, MP for Worcestershire South, voted against the government last night. The unofficial whip for Tory Euro-sceptics was far from repentant yesterday - in spite of the appeals for party unity, from the prime minister downwards, ringing in his ears. 'Some of the speeches have actually exacerbated the matters,' he said. 'The attempt to denigrate, to belittle and in some cases to even misinterpret what is a very sincerely held belief - and also highly representative of public opinion - is in itself damaging to party unity.' He will not identify individuals but it is clear that personal antagonism remains. 'Certainly there are ministers and party functionaries who are going beyond what is sensible in terms of the rhetoric they are using - it is counter-productive.' The Euro-sceptics still be-lieve opposition to Maastricht is increasing, in spite of signs of frustration in their ranks. There is a defensiveness, however. Mr Spicer, a former minister, voted for the 1986 Single European Act, which increased the powers of Brussels. In retrospect he would want changes to that legislation. But, he says: 'There is a very great distinction between a treaty and piece of legislation which aims at trying to strengthen a common market - the single European act - and one which overtly sets out to set up a united states of Europe.' THE LOYALIST: Mr Ian Taylor, MP for Esher, voted with the government last night. A leading member of the 'positive Europeans' group of Tory MPs, he blends strong support for the treaty with frustration at the activities of Euro-sceptics in his party. 'I think their collective behaviour is absurd. The only beneficiaries are the Labour party and the Liberals, and the damage inflicted to the government and the chances of economic recovery are very considerable,' he said yesterday. 'The case can be made for its being honourable to oppose the government on a point of principle, but to attempt to undermine the government on a point of procedure, when the effect is to delay other measures the government wants to bring forward and to give satisfaction to Labour, is inept.' The commitment to the treaty from government and from business leads him to emphasise how vital ratification is. He has not only voted for the government throughout, but has occasionally intervened in the extended debates to make the pro-Maastricht argument and contrast Labour's readiness to prolong discussion with its professed support for the treaty. So far, he says, the government has handled the bill 'fairly well', but he believes that the time has come to force the pace of parliamentary discussion. THE SIMPLY FED-UP: Mr Michael Clark, MP for Rochford, also voted with the government. He opposes the Maastricht treaty but by yesterday, his exasperation at the hours devoted to its ratification were surfacing publicly. 'The government will win slowly and if the government is going to win, well, let's for God's sake get this thing out of the way as quickly as possible,' he said. So he would not vote to stop the government getting its business - and would not back an amendment like Labour's last night on the Committee of the Regions, because of the extra delay it would cause. Yet his sympathy for Euro-sceptic colleagues is still strong. 'They have been consistent and they have been honourable and they believe strongly what they are doing. I don't have any derogatory thoughts about them at all.' Appeals to loyalty may have had an impact, Mr Clark hinted - but he denied that lay behind his latest decisions. 'The prime minster has a right to a certain amount of loyalty from people who stood on the Conservative ticket at the last election. It doesn't please me at all not to have given him support these last two or three months. The government has a right to get its business.' He promised: 'I'm not sniping on the sidelines, I wont take part in guerrilla tactics.' Mr Clark, who has backed the principle of greater free trade in Europe, listed all the other problems still facing the government - the recession, privatisation of British Rail, British Coal and Post Office to name but some. 'All this is being pushed back and it is being pushed further and further. This time next year we will be half way through this parliament and all we will have done is Maastricht, Maastricht, Maastricht.'</p>

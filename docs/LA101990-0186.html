Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> LAWSUIT AGAINST TYSON ADVANCES  </P> <P> Kevin Rooney, former trainer of Mike Tyson, won the first round of his  breach-of-contract lawsuit against the boxer when a federal judge today denied  a motion for dismissal of the case.  </P> <P> U.S. District Court Judge Con Cholakis denied the motion for dismissal, meaning  the suit will go to a jury trial in early 1991, according to Megan Kuntze,  Rooney's spokeswoman.  </P> <P> Rooney filed the suit a year ago, claiming that Tyson broke a contract that  said Rooney would train Tyson for as long as the heavyweight remained in  boxing.  </P> <P> Rooney was Tyson's trainer from 1981-88 and was in his corner for the first 35  of his 39 fights. Tyson, 25, fired Rooney in December, 1988.  </P></p>

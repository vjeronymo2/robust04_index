			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by To Chun-ho, chief of the Department of the North </F> Korean Affairs of CHOSON ILBO, from "The Road to Reunification"  column: "Kim Chong-il?"]    [Text] In an interview for the March edition of WOLGAN  CHOSON, ROK Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae -- who returned  to Seoul in early February to participate in a meeting of  overseas heads of Korean diplomatic and consular missions --  made shocking remarks regarding the North Korean power system.    He said: "There would be no difficulty for the Kim Il-song  and Kim Chong-il system to last more than 30 or 40 years. In  South Korea, the Pak Chong-hui system, which was established in  the early sixties, lasted more than 30 years. The North Koreans  are intelligent people."    It is unclear on what grounds Ambassador Hwang makes such  remarks, but his remarks are very different from the previous  view of ordinary people. In fact, new assessments of Kim  Chong-il have recently been reported one after another.    Professor Kim Il-pyong, professor of the U.S. University of  Connecticut, and Yi Hang-ku, author of the book "Kim Il-song"  and an expert on North Korean affairs, have a positive view of  Kim Chong-il's leadership ability.    Professor Kim said: "Kim Chong-il's succession to power in  North Korea is just like a son of a businessman taking over  management of the business. The Kim Chong-il system could be  turned into a very different system, even though it inherits the  Kim Il-song system. Therefore, it is highly possible that Kim  Chong-il would maintain the stabilization of the system by  creating his unique power system through political system  reforms or economic system opening."    The professor reports several cases to prove his point: Kim  Chong-il, who graduated from Kim Il-song University -- a  necessity for North Korean elites -- has been interested in  North Korean administrative reform since his campus days; has  outstandingly developed the chuche idea "created" by his father;  and has established legitimacy to his inheritance of power  through a "symbolic fabrication," even though it represents a  distortion of the truth.    He also added: In particular, Kim Chong-il has overcome  several throes in the course of his study of power succession.  These throes include his depression caused by his mother's  death; his refugee life in Jilin, Manchuria during the 25 June  Korean War; his feeling of uneasiness caused by his Oedipus  complex due to his sister's death from drowning; his roughness;  and his cruelty. (See HANGUK NONDAN, April Edition of 1992, p.  96-107)    Author Yi said that Kim Chong-il's habits of working until  midnight, sleeping late, and receiving enjoyment from a  "pleasure- giving team" do not truly represent his "basic  character." Many experts, however, still have negative views of  him.    Professor (Scalapino) said: "It is true that there are many  rumors that he lacks knowledge, ability, and experience. It is  a problem that although he can inherit power from his father, he  cannot inherit a charismatic character from him." Ms. Choe  Un-hui and her husband Sin Sang-ok, who observed Kim Chong-il  for a long time in North Korea, worry that he might take any  action because he is very self-righteous and because of his  negative character, his brutality, and his desire to become the  best one in the world.    There have been rumors that he has been "in an accident." I  believe that these rumors are rooted in the people's assessment  of his abnormal character.    None of these different assessments of Kim Chong-il have  ever  been verified. However, it is a self-conceit to downgrade the  North Korean power structure by regarding Kim Chong-il as a  rowdy boy who knows nothing.</p>

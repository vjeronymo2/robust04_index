			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Action by Lloyd's Names: Victory that will spark more action  -Pounds 116m Outhwaite settlement is significant triumph for those who acted to recover heavy losses YESTERDAY'S Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement in the Outhwaite case is a clear victory for the Lloyd's Names who backed the suit. It is bound to encourage further legal action by other Names - the individuals whose capital backs the market - who face some of their worst losses in the 300-year history of the insurance market. One Outhwaite Name said: 'The message for other action groups is that if you've got a good legal team you've a chance of getting your money back.' The settlement ends the biggest legal action at Lloyd's, which has been dogged by controversy over the last 10 years. With losses from US court awards to the victims of asbestosis and a wave of natural catastrophes mounting, relations between Names and their agents, who handle the affairs of Names and manage syndicates, have been troubled. In the Outhwaite case, Names took action to recover more than Pounds 125m in insurance losses stemming from 32 reinsurance contracts assumed in 1982 by the underwriter of Lloyd's syndicate 317/661, Mr Richard Outhwaite. Overall losses for the 1,614 Names on the syndicate amount to more than Pounds 200m and are rising. The contracts reinsured the exposures of other insurers, mainly other Lloyd's syndicates, to US liability risks and particularly asbestosis awards. The Names alleged negligence and breach of contract by the RHM Outhwaite Underwriting agency, which managed syndicate 317/661, and by 80 other agents who funnelled them on to Mr Outhwaite's syndicate. The Outhwaite action is one of six legal cases in which Names have alleged their losses arose because of negligence of agents in four cases, and the Corporation of Lloyd's in the other. Four of these cases involving Pulbrook syndicates 90 and 334, Poland 105 and 108 and four Oakeley Vaughan syndicates, are unsettled. Names who have not yet joined those actions are bound to note that Outhwaite Names who followed advice against joining the Outhwaite suit now find themselves left out in the cold by the settlement. Moreover, the success of the Outhwaite Names' settlement contrasts sharply with that achieved last week by more than 500 members of Warrilow syndicate 553 who sued their agents for losses of more than Pounds 60m. Their campaign ran out of steam, forcing the Names to accept a settlement which met about 10 per cent of losses. Mr Peter Nutting, a Name in the Outhwaite syndicate and the leader of the campaign to recover losses, said yesterday: 'The size of this settlement may have the effect of encouraging some people who were hesitant about joining action groups to to join them.' His assertion is supported by the experience this week of Mr David Tiplady of solicitors DJ Freeman, who is acting for about 1,000 Names in three actions involving Pulbrook and Poland Names. At the end of last week 280 of the 570 Names on Pulbrook 334 in 1985 were party to an action against Lloyd's agents. In addition, 330 of the 478 members of Pulbrook 90 and only about 350 of more than 900 Names who were members of Poland syndicates were backing actions. Mr Tiplady says he has been 'flooded' with calls in the wake of the Outhwaite settlement. One managing agent at Lloyd's said yesterday writs were going to fly 'like confetti'. The main concern for authorities at Lloyd's must be the position of several thousand Names on syndicates managed by Feltrim, Gooda Walker, Devonshire and Rose Thomson Young. These specialised in catastrophe reinsurance and face losses of more than Pounds 500m as claims roll in from natural disasters between 1987 and 1990. Although no liability was apportioned in the Outhwaite settlement, expert evidence on Mr Outhwaite's behalf by Mr Richard Hazell, a fellow Lloyd's underwriter and deputy chairman of Lloyd's, may have influenced the defence to opt for a settlement. Mr Hazell defended Mr Outhwaite from charges of negligence but accepted that the underwriter had been 'imprudent in some respects'. He accepted that Mr Outhwaite had not foreseen the scale of potential losses when he underwrote 32 run-off reinsurance contracts. Mr Hazell admitted that many of the alleged shortcomings of Mr Outhwaite's underwriting - such as poor record-keeping - were typical of the market at the time. 'If Mr Outhwaite was living in a cocoon we all were,' Mr Hazell said.</p>

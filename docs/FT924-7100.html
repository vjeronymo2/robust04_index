			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Letter: Wage bargaining should ignore devaluation-induced inflation Sir, The prime minister's speech at Guildhall this week strongly supports the view that the government, if only by jaw-boning, has a role to play in holding down wage increases in the private as well as in the public sector. One useful contribution would be to seek to diffuse among all engaged on either side of the bargaining table an idea which has been commonplace in countries such as Sweden for a decade, but has little currency in British discussions. It is this: RPI-plus is a perfectly reasonable starting point for wage bargaining in an economy with cost-plus-mark-up pricing. But there is inflation and inflation. The increase in the cost of imports brought by devaluation is something which makes the nation poorer. The fairest way of sharing that loss around is not to compensate in wage packets for that part of current inflation which can be ascribed to higher (sterling) import prices, and to confine compensation to the other part produced by the 'spiral of justice' of ratcheting wages and prices. To make the distinction is not only fair; it also prevents devaluation giving a kick-start to inflation acceleration which will eventually require a more swingeing deflation to halt. Of course the dread words 'incomes policy' cannot be mentioned. NEDO is no more. We have no national forum as the Swedes have where principles such as this could be hammered out and exert some effect, however marginal, on fragmented bargaining outcomes. But might not a chancellor capable of nationalising 20,000 houses be bold enough to think of some modest initiative towards creating one?

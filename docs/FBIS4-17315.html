			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vyacheslav Khodosovskiy: "Treaty Signed, </F> Different Monetary Systems Remain In Place"]    [Text] Minsk -- The text of the treaty on the unification  of the Belorussian [Belarusian] and Russian monetary systems,  signed in Moscow, contains a number of problems which were not  resolved during the talks and which could have an adverse effect  on the future of the Belorussian economy. So said Stanislav  Bogdankevich, chairman of the National Bank of Belorussia  [Belarus], in an interview with a RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent.    "The rate of exchange for `hares' [popular term for  Belarusian currency] and rubles has not yet been agreed," S.  Bogdankevich said. "Belorussia would like it set at purchasing  power parity for the Russian and Belorussian monetary units plus  the market cross-rate for these currencies against the U.S.  dollar. The ratio then would be 3:1. But according to the  Russian `arithmetic mean' method, the rate would be seven  `hares' to the ruble." S. Bogdankevich believes this option  would be lethal for the Belorussian economy, because it would  then be necessary to reduce real pay accordingly, so that the  prime cost of products did not rise.    Stanislav Bogdankevic continues to insist on the amendment  of  Article 5 of the treaty, whereby all Belorussian assets and  liabilities are to be transferred to the Central Bank of Russia  and the National Bank of Belorussia is to be abolished, becoming  a branch of the Central Bank. The chief of the National Bank of  Belorussia believes that questions of coordination of the  issuing of money, the budget deficit, credit rates, and the rest  can be decided on agreement between the two sovereign banks. At  the same time, Stanislav Bogdankevich was positive about the  agreement that had been reached on lifting customs barriers  between the two countries. "As a result of this point," he  said, "our states will now be spared lengthy talk about who owes  whom more and they will bring their trade balances closer  together."    As the text of the document says, the treaty will come into  force "on the date of the final notice by the contracting  parties to one another of the implementation of the intrastate  procedures necessary for its coming into force...." What this  implies for Belorussia is approval of changes to the Belorussian  Constitution by an extraordinary session of the Supreme Soviet  before the end of April. S. Bogdankevich's theory is that the  requisite two-thirds parliamentary majority will not be  obtained, so the question of unifying the monetary systems will  be postponed until a referendum. At the same time, the chief of  the National Bank of Belorussia believes that the treaty will  not actually be implemented by Russia until the outcome of the  presidential election in Belorussia is known. And even after  the election certain treaty provisions may not come into force  before next January. This applies, in particular, to the  extension to Belorussia of Russian domestic prices of energy  sources and basic types of products from Russian enterprises.  Otherwise, Russian enterprises could find themselves on the  verge of collapse.</p>

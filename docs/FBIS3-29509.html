			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- A member of the House of  Reprsentatives on Friday [18 February] accused the agricultural  group Zenno of what she sees as dubious accounting on its trade  in rice used to make miso (bean paste) and rice crackers.    Sumi Fujita of the Japanese Communist Party presented to the  government a report which said that Zenno (the National  Federation of Agricultural Cooperative Associations) failed to  properly return to farmers its profits from sales of such rice.    Zenno is entrusted by the government to market non-table use  rice. It buys the rice from growers at prices about 40 percent  lower than those the government pays them.    Fujita said in the report that Zenno spent 28,627 million  yen  during the eight years from 1984 through 1991 as "costs for  boosting demand" and "collection expenses."    She said these expenditures are "beyond a level the food  agency permits, and should be returned to farmers as sales  profits."    She also accused the government of neglecting to oversee  Zenno's accounting.    Admitting that it has not monitored the transport and  management costs involved in Zenno's sales activities, the food  agency said it will investigate the accusation.    Zenno said, meanwhile, the problem has already been resolved  and defended its accounting as being appropriate.    After a similar complaint made by Fujita in February last  year, Zenno was eventually prompted to return 4,281 million yen  to farmers.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Balladur wants shorter presidential terms Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who is expected to stand in presidential elections next year, yesterday suggested shorter terms for French presidents. He also proposed greater use of referendums in a programme to make France 'more democratic'. In a long article in yesterday's Le Monde - the nearest he has come to producing a manifesto in his undeclared candidacy for the Elysee - Mr Balladur suggested suspending corporate contributions to political parties and politicians for a three-year trial period. However, speaking later before the National Assembly, he ruled out suggestions, even within his own government, of a government reshuffle to forestall further resignations. In the past four months, three ministers have been forced to resign just before magistrates placed them under formal investigation in political funding scandals. 'In the present climate, any minister leaving the government would be suspected of doing so for reasons connected with ..the law,' he said. 'I do not have the right to inflict such a moral penalty.' In his article, Mr Balladur disclaimed the idea that he was suggesting constitutional and political reform purely because France was entering its presidential election year. Such issues should be discussed more than just every seven years, he said. One reason for shortening the seven year presidential term was to 'allow the people to arbitrate more frequently on the great national questions'. The ill health of 78-year-old President Francois Mitterrand, in the last year of his second seven years, has underscored a widespread desire for reform. But Mr Balladur reflected the division of opinion among politicians in saying that he was open to either reducing the term to five years or limiting presidents to a single term.</p>

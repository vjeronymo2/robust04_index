			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jose Eduardo dos Santos, chairman of the Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT],  yesterday showed clearly that he is the main obstacle in the  advancement of the Lusaka talks. Dos Santos even declared that  he dictates laws to his negotiators in Lusaka from the time  these laws are in the Ministry of State Security laboratories  until their implementation at the negotiating table.  International mediators are not immune either. In an interview  with the ANGOLAN PRESS AGENCY he said:    [Begin dos Santos recording] In my capacity as president of  the Republic and commander in chief of the Angolan Armed Forces,  FAA, I have a rather important interventionist role to play.  So, I have intervened in the process since its preparation  stage. I have intervened in the assessment of strategies and  tactics, and my intervention has also had to do with the details  of negotiations in Lusaka, the observers, and so forth. So my  intervention is rather extensive. [end recording]    Eduardo dos Santos is still advocating a military solution  for the Angolan conflict, urging his troops to be ready to fight  once more. The MPLA-PT chairman, however, said his government  is unable to solve the critical economic problems faced by  Angola.    [Begin dos Santos recording] Poverty is a problem.  Obviously, the state does not have the necessary conditions to  deal with the fundamental problems of food, medical assistance,  education, and so on. I believe all adopted measures were  palliative. [end recording]    The Luanda government is unable to solve the basic problems  of the Angolan people, particularly regarding food aid. It is  the Futungo leading class, however, that benefits most from the  war--in which it is bent on investing all Angolan funds [word  indistinct] because it gets profits from the purchase of weapons.    Questioned about corruption in his government, with three  ministers at the top of the list, Eduardo dos Santos did not  deny or acknowledge the fact, but he admitted that there is  corruption in the party and government he leads without,  however, having discussed the issue in the MPLA-PT Central  Committee meetings.    [Begin dos Santos recording] We do not deny or confirm this.  These issues were not discussed in the Central Committee  meeting (?I presided at). I believe there is generalized  corruption in the current government and the party that won  elections. [end recording]    Eduardo dos Santos neither knows nor ignores the anachronic  corruption in the leading class of his organization but knows  that it exists. The case has never been mentioned in the  meetings of the regime's high hierarchy. Here is the main cause  for the prolonged suffering of the Angolan people.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Labour 'would have devalued sterling' Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, has said that he would have devalued sterling in the exchange rate mechanism had his party won the last general election. In an interview for Channel 4, to be broadcast on Wednesday, Mr Kinnock says Labour had to maintain 'an impression' during the 1992 campaign that it would not devalue. But it would have abandoned the commitment because of the need to pull Britain out of recession, he says.</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: The Telegraph reports 60% rise to Pounds 34.6m - Pounds 6.5m sale and boost from associates help results THE TELEGRAPH newspaper group, which publishes The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph, boosted interim pre-tax profits by 60 per cent and lifted the dividend by 22 per cent. The group attributed the rise to strong circulation levels, a satisfactory advertising performance, and a slight fall in the price of newsprint. Mr Conrad Black, chairman, said that the directors had had sufficient confidence in the results to boost the dividend to 5.5p (4.5p) 'despite inconclusive evidence that the recession is ending'. Pre-tax profits for the six months to end-June rose to Pounds 34.6m, against Pounds 21.6m previously, while turnover improved from Pounds 119.9m to Pounds 128.1m. Earnings per share advanced to 16.6p (11.1p). The shares closed up 29p to 418p. At the operating level profits rose from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 23.8m. Included in the pre-tax figure was Pounds 6.5m from the sale in February of the group's stake in Trinity International Holdings, and Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 1.8m) in income from associates. The latter rise reflected a strong performance at Fairfax, the Australian publishing group, which saw circulation revenues expand 12 per cent and advertising revenues improve by 5 per cent. The Telegraph had 18.1 per cent of the Fairfax voting stock at the end of June, and now holds 19.9 per cent with options and convertible notes to take its stake up to 25 per cent. By the end of the year a further Pounds 28m will be needed to complete the investment programme, taking the total investment to Pounds 115m. Revenue from circulation was up 9.4 per cent at Pounds 56.8m. Circulation of The Daily Telegraph, which increased its cover price in February from 45p to 48p, fell by 1.8 per cent to 1.02m copies in the first half of the year, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. In the same period average quality newspaper circulation fell by just over 3 per cent. The group said that the Saturday edition of The Daily Telegraph had maintained sales of over 1.2m in the first half, while The Sunday Telegraph had increased sales by more than 16,000. Overall advertising revenue was ahead 4.3 per cent at Pounds 67.9m, with a rise of 10 per cent in display offset by a fall of 3.6 per cent in classified. Classified recruitment advertising was half the 1989 level. Advertising made up 54 per cent of the total newspaper revenue and circulation contributed 46 per cent, compared with 56 and 44 per cent respectively in the corresponding period. Mr Black said that the outcome for the next six months would 'depend largely on any level of upturn in the advertising market'. In addition to the expansion of the stake in Fairfax, The Telegraph invested Pounds 67m to take an effective 9.36 per cent increase in Southam, the Canadian newspaper group.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Apparent Suicide Leads to Talk Show Host's Firing: A New Orleans radio talk  show host, whose wife apparently killed herself just hours after calling his  show to complain about their marital problems, has been fired. Ron Hunter, 51,  said: "I was expecting the sympathy of my management and my listeners.  </P> <P> And what I ended up with was being fired . . . eight days after the death of my  wife." Hunter's wife, Marilou, called his show a little more than a week ago  and told a guest marriage counselor that they had a troubled marriage. Hours  later, she was found shot to death in bed, next to Hunter. Authorities say she  apparently committed suicide. Station officials said Hunter's dismissal had  been in the works for several weeks, but the final blow was the way he handled  the call from his wife -- specifically his decision not to cut her off the air  as soon as he recognized her voice.

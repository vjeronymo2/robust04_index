			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECYCLING  </P> <P> It is interesting to note that a country so advanced in technology is so behind  in such practical matters as recycling. We can no longer afford to close our  eyes to a problem of this magnitude.  </P> <P> Thank you for addressing this issue (Part I, June 3). In the meantime I will  continue to use cloth diapers to rid myself of a guilty conscience.  </P> <P> ELIZABETH BAKKER  </P> <P> Lakewood  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLANS FOR UNDERGROUND MOTEL GARAGE DENIED  </P> <P> In a victory for Encino homeowners, a Los Angeles city zoning official has  ruled that the owner of a Ventura Boulevard motel may not replace a parking lot  with an underground garage when he rebuilds.  </P> <P> The decision, issued April 6, affirmed the motel owner's announcement at a  public hearing that he would change his plans because of neighborhood  opposition and the cost of delays, Associate Zoning Administrator William  Lillenberg said.  </P> <P> King You Chai of Santa Monica, owner of the deteriorating 28-unit, two-story  Encino Inn at 17448 Ventura Blvd., plans to tear the building down and replace  it with a three-story, 60-unit motel. The front of the property is on  commercially zoned land, Lillenberg said, but the back, which for years has  included a surface parking lot, is zoned for residential use.  </P> <P> Homeowners objected to Chai's plans to replace the surface lot with a  two-level, underground parking deck, arguing that it would set a precedent in  the boulevard's residential zones and enable Chai to later enlarge the motel.  </P> <P> Chai could not be reached. According to Lillenberg, the new motel will include  62 parking spaces -- 22 beneath the building in the commercially zoned area and  40 above-ground in the area zoned for residential use.  </P> <P> Kathy Lewis, a spokeswoman for the Encino Property Owners Assn., called the  ruling a victory in her group's continuing battle to curtail development along  Ventura Boulevard and preserve the quality of life in adjoining neighborhoods.  </P></p>

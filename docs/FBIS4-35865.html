			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Text] Israel has asked the United States to deliver a  harsh message to Saudi Arabia so that the latter will change its  negative behavior regarding the peace process and primarily the  multilateral talks. Senior political sources in Jerusalem said  yesterday that the United States has relayed the message to  Riyadh, calling on it to change its position.    Israel presented its complaints regarding Saudi Arabia to  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and made an official  appeal to the State Department in which Israel detailed the  negative steps Saudi Arabia has taken. Israeli representatives  have said that the Saudis have become an obstructive element in  every regional or multilateral forum, placing obstacles in the  way of decisions on easing the Arab boycott and normalizing  relations between Arab countries and Israel. Another claim  Israel has made is that Saudi Arabia refuses to aid the  establishment of the Palestinian autonomy.    Israeli sources have said that according to information  obtained in Jerusalem, Saudi Arabia pressured Oman and Qatar to  slow down their normalization with Israel. The two emirates  which neighbor on Saudi Arabia had agreed to host Israeli  delegations in multilateral talks and started economic talks  with Israeli elements. The foreign ministers of both countries  met with Foreign Minister Peres.    The charges against Saudi Arabia emerged against the  background of its conduct at the multilateral talks on arms  control, held in Qatar last month. Unlike in the previous  rounds of talks, the Saudis dispatched a rather high-level  delegation to Qatar, but the delegation foiled every attempt to  make progress in ratifying a declaration of principles and  establishing confidence-building measures.    "The Saudis have become the pawns of the Syrians,  representing them in the multilateral talks," political sources  said last night in Jerusalem. "They have been torpedoing every  proposal and preventing progress, claiming that regional  cooperation is unattainable without the participation of Syria  and Lebanon. That means that Saudi Arabia has been granting  Syria a right to veto every step of the talks."    Israel and Saudi Arabia had attempted to establish a direct  channel of contacts between them through their ambassadors in  Washington. Last year, Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's  ambassador to the United States, held a series of secret  meetings with the Saudi ambassador, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan.  The meetings were held in the private residences of U.S.  officials and Jews who are the prince's acquaintances.  Rabinovich reported the content of the meetings to the highest  political echelons in Jerusalem.    The meetings between the two stopped several months ago, but  Israeli sources have claimed that there is no link between the  termination of the talks and the current Israeli charges against  Saudi Arabia.    Foreign Ministry working papers regarding the future of the  political process say that Saudi Arabia, as a major  representative of the Gulf states, should be given a leading  role in the process.</p>

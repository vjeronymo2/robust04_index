The president arrived in Moscow on Sunday [27 March] for his  first official visit to Russia.    In Moscow, Nazarbayev held a one-to-one summit meeting with  Yeltsin and met with Russian parliament leaders Vladimir  Shumeyko, the speaker of the upper house, and Ivan Rybkin, the  speaker of the lower house.    The two countries signed 23 bilateral documents including  agreements on cooperation in political, economic and military  areas. The most important was the signing of the agreement on  the disputed Baikonur Cosmodrome, a major missle-launch site of  the former Soviet Union, now located in Kazakhstan.    This document provides for leasing the cosmodrome to Russia  for 20 years, with provisions for a 10 year extension. Russia  will pay Kazakhstan 115 million U.S. dollars a year, and the  cosmodrome will be considered Russian territory and Russian laws  will be applied exclusively for the full duration of the leasing  period.    The accord is generally viewed as beneficial to both sides.  Kazakhstan cannot afford to operate Baikonur alone, because it  has neither the money nor the specialists to do so. For Russia,  it will be years before its new cosmodrome is operational for  manned missions.    The Baikonur, also the largest space center in the world,  was  jointly built by the former Soviet republics. The first launch  was made there on October 4, 1957. Four years later, on April  12, 1961, the space center sent the first manned spaceship into  orbit.    Dispute over the future of Baikonur began in earnest last  summer, when Kazakhstan expressed its readiness to transform the  cosmodrome into an international space port. This idea left no  room for Russia to service and maintain the complex for all  space launches.    In a speech in Moscow, Nazarbayev also urged the CIS nations  to create a "Euro-Asian Union" with a single currency and  supra-national bodies to coordinate economic, defense and  foreign policy.    "If this fails to gain broad support within the CIS, it  could  be formed by Russia and Kazakhstan," he said in a veiled warning  to other CIS members not to dismiss his initiative out of hand.    Nazarbayev, whose huge country is one of the most powerful  in  the CIS because of its vast untapped energy reserves and its  political stability, fist floated the idea of a Euro-Asian Union  two years ago when the CIS was in its infancy.    Observers here believe his revival of the idea now, just  over  two weeks before a scheduled CIS summit in Moscow on April 15,  assumed greater weight given Kazakhstan's growing profile and  the CIS's failure to forge any common policies.    However, Russia's attitude towards the proposal was not  immediately known. Up to now, most former Soviet republics have  rejected any proposal for creating supra-national bodies.    The Kazakh leader told reporters on Tuesday that Yeltsin had  responded "positively" to the idea of a Euro-Asian Union during  their talks.    Commenting on the results of Nazarbayev's Moscow trip, a  Kazakh diplomat working in Moscow said that "both presidents  expressed their satisfaction" over the visit.</p>

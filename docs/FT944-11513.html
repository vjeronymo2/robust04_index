			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Inflation aggravation Yesterday's US jobs data will keep the pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. True, October's rise in non-farm employment was lower than expected. But hourly earnings increased sharply and there was a jump in the length of the working week. The message is that strong economic growth is finally showing up in wage inflation. Currency and bond markets will be sorely disappointed if the Fed does not take action to counter inflation at its meeting on November 15. A half-point rise is already widely discounted; only a full point will convince the markets that the Fed is in control. This week's intervention in currency markets by the US authorities has bought a breathing space for the dollar. Traders were caught with short dollar positions and scrambled to cover themselves. But sentiment could easily be knocked again. One trigger would be a particularly strong performance by the Republicans in Tuesday's mid-term elections: the party has campaigned on a tax-cutting agenda and markets will worry if budgetary discussions look like becoming even more deadlocked than usual. Another trigger would be lack of enthusiasm in next week's Dollars 29bn refunding exercise by the Treasury. Meanwhile, European bond markets are finally showing signs of thinking for themselves. Since mid-September most have outperformed Treasuries, with gilts doing especially well. Yesterday was another good day for European bonds. A complete decoupling from the US - with European bonds rising while Treasuries collapsed - is unlikely. But further outperformance would be justified.</p>

According to the service's preliminary conclusions,  state-run  stations are given priority in using transmitters and  rebroadcasting lines, they are subsidized from the state budget,  while private stations can rent equipment only by way of contest  and can earn money only by selling commercial time.    Besides, state TV and radio charges considerably less for  commercial time and thus limits the ability of private stations  to compete on the market.    The competition service intends to submit its final  conclusions to the parliament and the government when additional  information about the situation on the TV and radio market is  obtained. Supposedly, state TV and radio will have to reduce its  commercial time, while the government will be recommended to  take into account the income for commercials when allocating  subsidies to state-run stations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 14 KYODO -- Economic discussions at the  Group of Seven (G-7) summit to be held in Naples, Italy, in July  will focus on ways of securing economic growth and employment,  government sources said Saturday [14 May].    The agenda will also include aid to South Africa and Russia,  ways of controlling money laundering in connection with drug  trafficking, and trade and the environment, the sources said.    The agenda was agreed on at a recent meeting of  representatives for leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany,  Italy, Japan and the United States, who will take part in the  July 8-10 summit.    The sources said Japan is likely to face intense pressure  during the discussions to expand its domestic demand and reduce  its trade surplus.    To help mitigate the pressure regarding the trade surplus,  Japan's ruling minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata will have to make a hard political decision before the  summit on proposed tax reforms as a pillar of measures to expand  domestic demand, the sources said.    Specifically, the discussions are likely to center on  additional fiscal measures and a relaxation of monetary  restraints in Japan and Germany, where economic recovery has  been slow, the sources said.    The U.S. will also be asked to cut its fiscal deficit as  part of efforts to control inflation, they said.    Concerning employment, U.S. President Bill Clinton is  expected to propose a global jobs creation program at the summit  to deal with structural unemployment.    Regarding foreign aid, the summit is likely to agree to give  coordinated aid to South Africa, now under black President  Nelson Mandela, for its political stability, the sources said.    They also said the meeting is expected to agree on increased  G-7 aid to Russia to help its transition to a market economy.</p>

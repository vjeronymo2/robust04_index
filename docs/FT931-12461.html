			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Arts: Handel's Ottone To judge from the recent Handel operas in London the age of lavish Baroque splendour has long gone. The only way that this production of Ottone reached the stage was with generous funding from a concert hall in Tokyo, where it had already been presented, and even then the organisation which was promoting it expects to make a loss of about Pounds 5,000 on its single performance at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Monday. In these circumstances some indulgence may be exercised over shortcomings in the staging. In fact, Patrick Garland's production, consisting of little more than a throne and a bench under the watchful eye of a Roman imperial eagle, only just deserved to be called that, rather than a concert performance in costume. (One does wonder where the money went.) But at least it had the virtue that it did not often distract from the music. The opening night of Ottone in January 1723 must have been a splendid affair. Handel was writing for an all-star cast, including the famous castrato Senesino, who took the title-role, and a soon-to-be-equally-celebrated soprano, Francesca Cuzzoni, arriving from Italy for her first London appearance. The work may lack the individual flair of the great Handelian operas, but it does have its fair share of memorable solo arias. At this performance the Senesino role was taken by James Bowman, for whom the present revival was largely undertaken. It is difficult to imagine what an impact a castrato might have had in this music, but Bowman, even these days when his counter-tenor is less malleable than in his youth, makes the music come alive with a fine sense of spontaneity. His most moving aria, 'Tanti affanni', was sung with both force of expression and intimacy. In Cuzzoni's role, Claron McFadden was beautifully lyrical, rather than dazzling. (This was the original 1723 version of the score, before Handel added extra arias to show off his soprano's brilliance.) Jennifer Smith played the ambitious mother, Gismonda, and Dominique Visse the son she tries to push on to the throne, his piercing counter-tenor making the pretender sound a spoilt child. Linda Ormiston sang the fighting mezzo role of Matilda and Michael George, in firm bass voice, the pirate Emireno. All round there was some want of personality in the singing, although that may have derived from the playing of the King's Consort under Robert King, which was always admirably stylish, but less keen to probe far below the music's surface. I note, incidentally, that Cuzzoni's fee was Pounds 1,500, which must have been a vast sum in 1723, and yet the season made a profit. Clearly, the economics of putting on an opera have changed since then.</p>

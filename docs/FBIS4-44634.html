Green </F> Light From Brussels"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database]    [Text] Brussels 10 Mar (ATS) -- On Thursday, the European  Commission authorized the creation of a joint venture between  Asea Brown Boveri [ABB] and Renault Automation in the field of  robotics and systems for the automobile industry. The operation  does not create or reinforce a dominant position in the common  market, according to the executive of the Twelve.    The operation contemplated by ABB and Renault is of a  two-fold nature. On the one hand it comprises the creation of a  new joint venture, Newco, equally controlled by both companies.  On the other hand, ABB Robotics obtains the entire control of  the robotics division of Renault.    The investigation by the European Commission only related to  the joint venture. The other part [of the deal] has no communal  dimension, since the turnover does not reach the threshold [40  million Swiss francs] from which the EU starts controlling  mergers.</p>

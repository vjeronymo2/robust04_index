			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Germany and France cast their shadows In spite of a continued rally in the Scandinavian markets, weakness elsewhere in continental Europe depressed the region's overall performance. Investors were unnerved by uncertainty over the Bosnian crisis which threatens economic and political stability in Europe, and continued gloom over the economic outlook. Germany moved lower amid a spate of corporate earnings announcements, while France was depressed by poor economic statistics. The FT-Actuaries World index was virtually flat on the week, offset by the relative strength in the US, which itself was helped by a firm bond market. Lower interest rates and hopes of a 'yes' vote in the second Maastricht referendum lifted Denmark. Mr Yngve Ness, manager at Unibank Securities, believes that the market will be the best European performer this year. A further cut in interest rates is expected after the May 18 referendum and the bond yield curve is expected to normalise in the near term. An increase in liquidity due to lower domestic interest rates has also helped Finland and Sweden. However, among the Scandinavian markets, Sweden remains vulnerable to the domestic political situation and a large budget deficit, and may face profit-taking in the short run if interest rates fail to decline further. Mr Paul Brunker, strategist at Robert Fleming, reckons that dull trading in France and Germany will continue in the near term. Among strong performers in Europe, he selects Spain, which is likely to resolve the currency crisis in the near term, and Italy, where investor confidence seems to be returning. Hong Kong was subdued on cautiousness over the Sino-British talks. However, Mr Peter Lyon, strategist at Smith New Court, believes that due to the close links between the colony's interest rates and US rates, the easing on US bond markets will help Hong Kong.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     % change   % change                    % change in local currency*     sterling* in US Dlrs*             ------------------------------------------------------------              1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year   Start of   Start of   Start of                                              1993       1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +0.77     -2.37   -16.82      +0.12      -1.50      +2.46 Belgium       -1.17     -5.69    +1.13      +8.19      +6.24     +10.52 Denmark       +4.86     +7.40    -9.26     +17.47     +16.06     +20.74 Finland       +2.04    +14.77   +49.16     +48.59     +38.68     +44.28 France        -2.57     -4.83    -7.26      +3.77      +3.35      +7.51 Germany       -0.91     -2.57    -9.03      +5.73      +4.02      +8.21 Ireland       -2.62     -3.10    +4.01     +23.47     +12.83     +17.37 Italy         +2.77     +6.41   +17.78     +27.38     +23.66     +28.63 Netherlands   +0.96     -1.48    +4.51      +9.42      +7.72     +12.07 Norway        -1.46     +2.05    -9.92     +13.80     +13.12     +17.67 Spain         -1.70     +1.83    -2.99     +12.67      +7.15     +11.47 Sweden        +3.07     +5.94   +14.91     +10.89      +3.20      +7.36 Switzerland   +1.52     -0.74   +11.44      +5.50      +4.12      +8.31 UK            -0.69     -0.52    +4.49      -0.37      -0.37      +3.64 EUROPE        -0.37     -0.86    +1.47      +4.86      +3.63      +7.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia      0.00     +0.05    -2.44      +6.94      +5.90     +10.17 Hong Kong     -0.07     +9.53   +17.93     +24.09     +19.48     +24.30 Japan         -0.30     +3.30   +18.79     +23.03     +33.87     +39.26 Malaysia      +0.09     +9.40   +34.41     +20.92     +18.53     +23.31 New Zealand   -2.72     +1.23    +4.95      +4.27      +6.71     +11.03 Singapore     -1.60     +3.72    +8.03     +10.54      +8.17     +12.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        -0.70     +4.78    +6.50      +9.71      +5.50      +9.75 USA           +0.53     +0.14    +6.49      +1.43      -2.50      +1.43 Mexico        +1.84     -7.77    -8.21      -7.72     -12.09      -8.54  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  +0.91     +6.03    +3.83     +19.49     +21.23     +26.11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +0.01     +1.14    +8.46      +8.90      +9.11     +13.51  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on May 7th 1993.

			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: IN THE END, THE CUBS ARE STILL THE CUBS  </P> <P> A week ago, we all felt great. Now we've got 24 to 30 guys who feel like they  want to throw up. -- Rick Sutcliffe, Cub  </P> <P>  Hey, I didn't give up a hit to Mario Mendoza, you know. I gave up a hit to  Will Clark. -- Mitch Williams, Cub  </P> <P>  There's not a man among us who blames Andre Dawson or Mitch Williams or myself  or anybody else for us losing the game. Will Clark won the game. San Francisco  won the game. We lost the game. The Chicago Cubs. All of us. -- Ryne Sandberg,  Cub  </P> <P>  I've had ups and I've had downs. This is a major down. -- Andre Dawson, Cub  </P> <P>  I don't think Andre wants anybody to feel sorry for him. -- Mark Grace, Cub  </P> <P> Cub means always having to say you're sorry.  </P> <P> They wear the baby bear on their sleeve; you wear your feelings there. They  play; you pay. They live, they die; you laugh, you cry. They win; you grin.  They lose; you bruise. They come from Chicago; you get the wind knocked out of  you. Either they leave you in stitches or coming apart at the seams.  </P> <P> For 113 years, they have been playing baseball professionally -- well, playing  professional baseball -- and, to this day, they have never won a postseason  game west of their city limits. Monday, they concluded a five-game series in  which they outhit the San Francisco Giants in Games 2, 3, 4 and 5 -- and still  won only once. Ladies and gentlemen, we give you the Chicago Cubs, a team from  the National League that belongs in the National Lampoon.  </P> <P> Their clubhouse was so quiet, you could hear a pennant drop.  </P> <P> "Call it a crummy ending to a wonderful year," said Mark Grace, who may go down  as the only man in baseball history to bat .647 in a playoff series and still  be outperformed at his position. The only reason Americans today are not  talking about the spectacle of Grace under pressure is because of this other  guy, this Will Clark character, this dangerous man who clubbed the Cubs with  his stick as cruelly as though they were baby seals.  </P> <P> Asked what would be the most memorable memory of his first National League  championship series, Grace gave thought for only a few seconds.  </P> <P> "Will Clark," he said.  </P> <P> As your greatest memory?  </P> <P> "Well," Grace had to admit, "he kind of made himself tough to forget. You  know?"  </P> <P> They were the stars of this show, these two first basemen. Together they  cranked out 24 hits in five games, each man posting staggering slugging  percentages of 1.100-plus, while fielding flawlessly. Herb Caen, a San  Francisco columnist of note, summed things up perfectly for posterity, writing:  "Will played with grace, and Grace played with will."  </P> <P> It finally got to the point where the Giants did everything in their power to  avoid pitching to Grace, walking him deliberately and daring Andre Dawson to do  something about it, while the Cubs made the monumental mistake of walking so  many Giants unintentionally that they had to pitch to Clark, who did do  something about it.  </P> <P> Mitch Williams was assigned -- forced -- to pitch to Clark. NBC, for its final  baseball telecast of a golden era, was rewarded with a stare-down between  Chicago's finest relief pitcher and San Francisco's finest hitter with the  score 1-1, the bases loaded and two out. How much more color could any peacock  ask for?  </P> <P> By coincidence, at this very hour on another West Coast television channel,  Williams' wife was talking to Joan Rivers on a previously taped talk show about  the hardships and heartbreaks of being married to a ballplayer, of how when her  husband was traded from Texas to Chicago, she "cried for two weeks." Little did  Dee Williams know that when it comes to Cubs, you usually end up crying twice,  coming and going.  </P> <P> Mitch Williams never was so sorry not to have to face Mario Mendoza in his  life. He got two strikes on Clark but couldn't find a third. Clark's single  through the box scored two runs, knocked Williams from the box after only one  batter and left two lefties acquired from Texas, Williams and Steve Wilson, the  pitching staff's guilty parties of Chicago's final two games.  </P> <P> Yet, don't feel sorry for them.  </P> <P> Feel sorry for Andre.  </P> <P> Don't take Grace's advice. Go right ahead, feel sorry for Andre Dawson. Feel  sorry for this stand-up guy whose knees ache so badly that he can barely stand  up. Feel sorry for this 35-year-old Ernie Banks-to-be who has never been to a  World Series without a ticket. Feel sorry for this handsome, heroic figure who  once put his signature on a blank contract and left the salary line blank, he  wanted to play for the Cubs so badly. Feel sorry for him because he played so  badly.  </P> <P> "I thought Dawson was gonna burn 'em," Grace said.  </P> <P> Instead, Dawson stranded 19 baserunners in five games. He hit .105. He struck  out with the bases loaded for the final out of Game 4. He tapped out to the  pitcher with two runners on base in the eighth inning of Game 5. He misplayed  Clark's drive in right field that led to the Giants' game-tying run. Only a Cub  could be the league's most valuable player (in 1987) when the club finishes in  last place, then become their least valuable player after the club finishes in  first place.  </P> <P> Dawson folded his arms, took a deep breath, took on all comers.  </P> <P> "It's not eating me up inside. It's not tearing me up inside," he said at his  locker, assessing the damage. "But of course, it hurts. Of course, it hurts.  </P> <P> "I wasn't there when they needed me. I didn't do what I get paid to do. I was  over-aggressive. A lot of things go through your mind, but all I can do is  accept it. Maybe this will be the last chance I'll ever have. I'm trying to  stay on an even keel because, well, what else can I do?"  </P> <P> You live with the Cubs, laugh with the Cubs, love the Cubs, loathe the Cubs,  laugh at the Cubs. Whatever. You wait for next year. You wait for the year  after that. You wait and you wait and you wait. What else can you do?  </P></p>

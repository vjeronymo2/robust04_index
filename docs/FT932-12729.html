			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Willis likely to be succeeded by deputy as head of TUC MR Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, yesterday announced he would take early retirement after the TUC's annual congress in September. Mr Willis, aged 60, has held his post for nine years. Although tributes to his past work came from both inside and outside the union movement yesterday, there has been criticism over the years of his leadership style and, in particular, his lack of impact as a public speaker. The next TUC general secretary is likely to be Mr John Monks, aged 47, the current deputy general secretary. Nominations from affiliated unions for the post will be open until mid-July and an election at this year's congress in Brighton will follow if more than one candidate stands. Mr Willis said he had considered retiring last year but had postponed the decision because of the TUC's campaign to save miners' jobs. One factor which may have persuaded him to announce his retirement at this point was the recent vote by members of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union to affiliate to the TUC. The vote came five years after members of the EETPU electricians' union, now a section of the AEEU, was expelled from the TUC for breaking its rules over poaching members from other unions. Mr Willis said he had been 'greatly encouraged' by the vote which had paved the way for the organised unity the TUC needed. 'However, given that other serious problems and challenges may persist, I believe that the new thrust of trade union drive and leadership can best be sustained by electing a new general secretary now to carry out those responsibilities for some years ahead,' he said. Mr Alan Tuffin, TUC president, said Mr Willis had 'led the TUC through a period when the trade union movement has come under unprecedented and sustained attack'. Under his leadership the TUC had 'still found positive ways of moving forward', Mr Tuffin added. Mr Neil Kinnock, former Labour leader, said: 'In destructive times Norman Willis has never stopped being constructive. Norman's sense of justice and his sense of humour have both been irrepressible.' Mr Geoff Armstrong, director general of the Institute of Personnel Management, said Mr Willis's unfailing good humour probably did much to hold the movement together and avoid disaster. Trade union membership has fallen by more than 25 per cent to 7.7m since Mr Willis first took office, creating severe financial problems for the TUC - both staffing levels at headquarters and activities have been reduced.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lao Niu (5071 3662): "The Internal </F> Contradictions Between Public Security and State  Security"--first paragraph is editor's note]    [Excerpts] The author Lao Niu is a former Beijing  high-level political insider. This article delves into and  exposes the two main dictatorial systems of the Chinese  Communist Party: It looks at the mutual contradictions, use of  power, and evolution of the Ministry of Public Security (MPS)  and the Ministry of State Security (MSS) in the period of  opening up. It points out that the state security apparatus  already constitutes the power behind Li Peng's clique, and is  responsible for controlling and countering political  dissidents.    [passage omitted] The Border Control Department is called  the  Sixth Department within the CCP Ministry of Public Security,  with its two trademarks being the External Border Crossing Usage  Management Department and the Foreigner Management Department.  In the more than 40 years since the CCP came to power, it has  often had the formulations of "public security elders." This  points to its real position in the political and legal system as  a public security organ, procurate, law court, and judicial  department. From a legal point of view, the MPS should only be  subordinate to one arm of the State Council, and despite the  fact that its name comes after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  it still receives the supervision of the highest law court, and  the highest procurate. In reality, the law courts and procurate  in fact do not control the MPS. For example, Zeng Qinkou [2582  6024 0656], of the highest procurate's Court of Law and  Discipline, told this reporter that within the public security  system there is widespread extortion of confessions through  torture and cruelty, and some cases are passed through other  channels to the procurate, but the Court of Law and Discipline,  though it sends people to the public security organs for  investigations, they are without exception turned away, and at  every turn are told threateningly: Aren't you going to allow us  to work? After the National People's Congress passed an  administrative procedural law, a large amount of cases of  "people versus government officials" came before law courts, and  the CPC immediately allowed the highest people's law court to  issue a top secret document, which went so far as to require  that various local law courts, in cases of hearing complaints  from the masses against the public security police, and cases  where public security police refused to accept punishment, as  far as possible should maintain the original sentence of the  public security officials, and preserve their "law enforcement"  image.    To not bring a lawsuit, is to have already lost a lawsuit,  and this explains why the "public security elders" do not have a  weakness that lends wings to rumors. It has been like this for  many years.    However, this situation began to change in the early 1980s.  The Ministry of Public Security altogether has more than 20  departments, but there are only five or six that are directly on  the front line of enforcing the law. Before the establishment of  the MPS, the so-called "anti-revolutionary cases," including  espionage and special cases, were the responsibility of the  First Department, and this was a very mysterious organization.  After the establishment of the MPS, a very large number of core  cadres transferred from the First Department, and the CCP's  Department of Investigation in Beijing's Western Gardens area  attracted some of the People's Liberation Army's Second  Department of the General Staff Headquarter's to form this type  of special organ for uncovering spies, providing special  services and handling cases of "subversion of the state." In  this way, the MPS First Department became a political public  security body, the Second Department became an economic and  cultural public security body, the Third Department became a  public security department, and the Fourth Department became a  frontier defense unit, the Fifth Department became a punishment  and investigation department, while the Sixth Department became  a border administration body. Among these, the bodies with the  most work load besides the Third, Fifth and Thirteenth  (Preliminary Investigation) Departments, are some sensitive and  the most mysterious departments separated from the MPS, but at  the same time public security has lost a considerable portion of  its special privileges. While in later name listings the  Ministry of State Security (MSS) was listed after the MPS, in  reality in terms of its funds, power and scope of activity, both  were in position to override public security.    The MSS was established in 1983, at a time when Hu Yaobang  was headed the government. Hu, in order to make political and  legal work gradually adapt to the circumstances of reform and  opening, chose former Shanghai Deputy Mayor Ruan Chongwu [7086  1504 2976] to serve as Minister of Public Security, and Jia  Chunwang [6328 2504 2489] from the Central Committee system to  serve as Minister of Security. Ruan had once studied abroad in  the then Soviet Union, and served in the CCP's Embassy in West  Germany as a science and technology counselor. This experience  enabled him to tackle solution of the reform of public security  work, increase the level of transparency, and within a certain  period to hold news conferences. In early 1987, Hu Yaobang had  left the scene, and soon after Ruan was transferred from the MPS  to serve as the Deputy Director of the State Science and  Technology Committee. It was clear that he had not reduced the  level of secrecy. But during the period Ruan served, the work  style at the MPS had become more enlightened, and outstanding  achievements were noted, and there was a marked improvement in  the appearance and attitude of individuals, which had a lasting  and profound effect on people. In particular, for a certain  period he met with foreign journalists, and answered questions  with wit and consideration, in an internationally accepted show  of good form. Since this time, many officials of the MPS, in  particular young ones, still cherish the thought of Ruan Chongwu.    However, comparatively speaking, when it comes to the MPS,  the CCP views the Ministry of State Security as its own  confidential security organ. For this reason, after Ruan Chongwu  was transferred as the result of Hu Yaobang's departure from  power, Jia Chunwang has been retained to run the Ministry of  State Security. Still, because the MSS is favored and has formed  a arrogant attitude, in terms of the allocation of power,  especially in the case of overlapping of MSS responsibilities  with certain tasks of the MPS First Department, the  contradictions between the two ministries are steadily growing.  Here are just two examples to illustrate this situation:    1. The MPS at present is located on the north side of  Beijing's Changan Avenue, and on the gate of the MPS there hangs  not only an MPS sign, but at the same time, there is also an MSS  sign. In fact, the MPS offices are primarily located at the  Western Gardens supreme headquarters of the former Central  Investigative Department. However, since relations between the  two ministries have become strained, they do not mutually settle  accounts. For example, normally government personnel and  professional contacts outside the MPS, provided they go through  the simple formalities of registering, are able to directly  enter the MPS main compound, and even some journalists also hold  credentials and can come and go as they please. But for MSS  personnel, even if they display credentials, those at the gate  often make up various reasons for them to be refused entrance.    2. Contradictions between the public security organs and  state security organs are even more acute at the grass-roots  level. Shenzhen City's Shatoujiao zone contains the  investigative strongholds of a number of intelligence organs,  including the Second Department General Staff, the MPS, and the  MSS. However, the contradictions between the MPS and MSS are the  most deep-rooted. One Shenzhen City MPS friend told the author  about how they handle MSS organ personnel. Between Hong Kong and  Shenzhen there is a forbidden zone, and by and large personnel  from the MPS, and Peoples' Armed Police (PAP) are responsible  for inspecting and controlling this zone. Normally, MPS  personnel, and PAP cadre, General Staff Intelligence personnel  are able once in a while to enter the forbidden zone to carry  out tasks, but when it is discovered that there are MSS organ  personnel entering the forbidden zone, often indiscriminately  MPS personnel will first "arrest and bring them to justice,"  interrogate them and them suddenly release them. Allegedly, this  is done on instructions from senior officials. From this it is  evident that bad blood has been accumulating between the MSS and  MPS. [passage omitted]</p>

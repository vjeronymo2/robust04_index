			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Baba, deputy state secretary for </F> foreign affairs, by unidentified announcer in the studio -- live]    [Text] [Announcer] The weekend was quite tense in Slovakia.  Some of the Slovak press in Pozsony [Bratislava] wrote that the  Hungarians are expected to declare autonomy, that they want to  secede, and thus, so to speak, created tension. It seems that a  very moderate viewpoint came out at the meeting of Hungarian  mayors in Rev-Komarom [Komarno]. In your view, to what extent  can this have a positive effect on Hungarian-Slovak relations in  the coming months?    [Baba] First of all, I wish to stress that the Rev-Komarom  meeting was a warning meeting of the Hungarians of Slovakia, the  Hungarian political forces of Slovakia. Its aim was to call the  attention of the Slovak Government and political circles to the  fact that Slovakia has not done what it undertook to do when it  was accepted into the Council of Europe.    I believe that this warning was successful, and certain  political and press circles did indeed create tension  artificially, since the political parties of the Hungarians of  Slovakia have so far phrased their views and ideas, which are  fundamentally important for the existence and future of the  Hungarians of Slovakia, quite clearly, and I presume they will  continue to do so.    For example, education. Everyone speaks of the use of  [Hungarian] names, but this is not the only issue; the issues  are a proper school system, and the dangers of the  reorganization of the administration. This was expressed in  Rev-Komarom very moderately, and in a very acceptable tone. I  hope that the Slovak Government and the moderate Slovak  political circles will receive it that way, too.    [Announcer] Thank you, Deputy State Secretary Ivan Baba, for  coming to the studio.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Russians caught between the extremes Russia is caught between two extremes: the message from elections last weekend to slow down or abandon reforms - and demands of Russian reformers and the international community for faster progress towards the market. In Moscow yesterday, US Vice-President Al Gore appeared aware of the strength of the message from the electorate when he criticised the International Monetary Fund for being insensitive to results of harsh economic measures with which it is associated. He spoke movingly about the effect of vast and rapid budget cuts (implemented, it should be said, not by the IMF but by Russian governments) on defence industry jobs. Mr Gore's intervention, appeared at odds with a Russian White House briefing on on Wednesday afternoon and surprised financial officials in Moscow and his own entourage. At the very least it reflects uncertainty in the US and among other Group of Seven countries about how to assist Russia in the changed political climate. 'The whole thing is on hold,' said one official. 'We have a changed situation here, in which it will be much more difficult for the government to go forward with anything approaching austerity. The west will have to try to look at how to reorganise its programmes to be more responsive to current concerns.' The reformers have not given up: Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister in charge of finance, called on President Boris Yeltsin to speed up reforms - and repeated his threat to resign if Mr Viktor Gerashchenko is reappointed head of the central bank. But if Mr Gore's line is followed internationally, the reformers may find they have lost support not just in the country, but in the west. Dr Andreas Gummich, Deutsche Bank's expert, said: 'The reformers must address the problems raised by (the nationalist) Vladimir Zhirinovsky - especially the law and order issue. And the IMF must take some lessons from this too.' For the World Bank and IMF the dilemma is acute. The Bank has an ambitious programme of lending more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) to energy and other sectors in the coming year; the Fund has to decide whether to proceed with the second, Dollars 1.5bn tranche of its 'systemic transformation facility', crafted to give immediate support to the reformers. Even before the elections, these were in doubt. Curbing the budget deficit to 10 per cent of gross national product for the year and to Rbs5,500bn in the fourth quarter has been achieved only by deferring necessary payments of an estimated Rbs5,000bn which will have to be met early in 1994. The year will thus begin with a vast deficit. The strategy, so far followed by the institutions and the G7, of agreeing with Mr Gaidar's priority of bringing down inflation and restraining the budget, is likely to be reviewed, especially in countries such as Japan that have been sceptical about rapid reform. What may gain favour is specific aid to certain sectors, that can be restructured with an assumption of continued inflation. In the past months, there have been indications that western business is more interested in Russia. Fewer than 100 US companies had offices in Moscow 18 months ago; now at least 500 have. But Mr James Tilley, vice-president of Conoco - whose Dollars 200m investment in the Polar Lights oil project and plans for a further investment of Dollars 3bn represent the largest western commitment to Russia  -said: 'There will be a period of 2-3 months where people will think very carefully about what is happening here. It will be difficult to get things done with the government. If parliament and the people clearly indicate they don't want foreign investment here, then we can't do business. But we don't think that is the case. We think things have progressed to the point where westerners can do business here.' Mr Bruce MacDonald, whose BBDO advertising agency was one of the first in Russia, said foreign businessmen had feared three things - a non-convertible currency, a population with little money and political instability. 'The first of these has been removed; second, spending power has greatly increased; and the third is a function of a democratic vote.' Mr Joseph Condon, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow, said all foreign businesses wanted rapid action on a number of fronts - taxes, duties on imports, licensing and finance and banking and the lack of a commercial legal code. 'Russia is going through a profound transformation. That transformation does not come easily and in my view will not come quickly. It will probably take a generation.' David White, Defence Correspondent, adds: Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British defence secretary, warned yesterday of the risk of 'a resurgent, aggressive Russia'. Although Russia's goals differed from the former Soviet Union's, Nato had to face the possibility in future of an expansionist and anti-democratic government in Moscow, he told the Royal Institute of International Affairs.

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: General Cinema lifted by gain GENERAL Cinema, the retailing, publishing and theatre group that last year acquired Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (HBJ), the Florida-based publisher, said net earnings in the quarter to January 31 were lifted by a Dollars 419.6m after-tax extraordinary gain. The one-time benefit was due mainly to the purchase of HBJ debt at a discount as part of the acquisition. Net income for the first quarter was Dollars 27.7m or 35 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 11.1m and 14 cents in the three months to January 31, 1991. With the extraordinary item General Cinema's net profit was Dollars 447.2m. Revenues declined to Dollars 883m from Dollars 886.6m a year ago. Operating profits were Dollars 44.3m against Dollars 45.9m last time. Mr Robert Tarr, chief executive, said the results were the first indication of General Cinema's earnings potential following the HBJ acquisition. Interest expenses fell to Dollars 22.4m from Dollars 87m a year ago. Operating earnings from the 63 per cent-owned Neiman Marcus department store chain were Dollars 10.8m, against Dollars 13.2m - these earnings will be consolidated into General Cinema's second quarter. Operating profits from General Cinema's retail division were Dollars 25.6m, down from Dollars 30.5m. Publishing income increased to Dollars 9.9m from Dollars 5m while theatre income dropped to Dollars 6m, from Dollars 8.3m. On Wall Street, General Cinema rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 21 3/8 .</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Commission upsets bankers The Luxembourg Bankers' Association (ABBL) has complained to the European Commission that it tarnished Luxembourg's reputation as a banking centre by releasing information prematurely about a probe into interest rate-fixing, write Andrew Hill and Reuter in Brussels. The Commission said last month it was 'urgently investigating' one unnamed national banking association which recommended a level of commercial interest rates to its members. Brussels cleared all other national associations of illegal collusion. Mr Charles Ruppert, the ABBL president, has complained to the Commission that journalists received the information before they did.</p>

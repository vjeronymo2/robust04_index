			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Suspended president plans to appeal in Venezuela MR Carlos Andres Perez, Venezuela's suspended president, said yesterday he would appeal to the Supreme Court against Congress's decision to block him from returning to office even if he is acquitted on corruption charges, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas. A joint session of the Congress voted on Tuesday night to make permanent last May's suspension of Mr Perez from the presidency following allegations of embezzlement and misuse of public funds. Congress also voted to ratify the interim chief executive, Mr Ramon Jose Velasquez as interim president, and authorised him to serve out the remaining five months of Mr Perez's term. Earlier in the day the high command of the Venezuelan armed forces restated their support for President Velasquez. Mr Perez, who began his five-year term as president in February 1989, was suspended from office on May 21 after the Supreme Court and the Senate voted that there was just cause to try him for alleged mishandling of Dollars 17m in funds from a secret government account used for security and defence operations. Mr Velasquez took over as interim president on June 5. Tuesday's voting broke down along party lines, with Mr Perez's Democratic Action party (AD) voting against the move. A group of small political parties joined forces with the Christian Democrat party (Copei) to oust Mr Perez, who must still face the corruption charges. The unprecedented congressional action raised questions about the constitutionality of permanently removing an elected president from office before judicial proceedings against him are completed, and could set a precedent for a similar action in the future. Supporters of Mr Perez called the congressional decision unconstitutional and an act of political revenge.</p>

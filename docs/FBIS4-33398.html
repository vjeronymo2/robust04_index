			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Excerpts] [Announcer] According to Finance Minister Julio  Sosa Rodriguez, the government will definitely increase the  price of gasoline by the end of 1994. This measure will be  implemented progressively to prevent adverse effects on the  collective transportation system. According to budget estimates  for 1995, this increase will reach an average of 12 bolivares.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] This statement was made by  Finance Minister Sosa Rodriguez during the forum: "How to Have  Confidence in Venezuela." Sosa Rodriguez confirmed that on  several occasions, the need to increase the prices of  hydrocarbons had been discussed. However, this increase will  have to be implemented after a register of vehicles used for  collective transportation is drafted so that any possible  problems are averted. He added that revenues earned from such an  increase have not been calculated yet.    [Sosa Rodriguez] I have said it about three or four times.  We  need to make a register of all vehicles used for collective  transportation. I have said that eventually, the collective  transportation sector must receive a subsidy so that whenever  the increase is implemented--probably by the end of this  year--this sector, which is widely used by the population, will  not be adversely affected.    [Reporter] Sosa Rodriguez also indicated the fiscal deficit  has been reduced since 12 February from 650 billion bolivares to  a current 120 billion bolivares. This signifies an 80-percent  reduction or the equivalent of 12 percent of the GDP. He added  that after May and June, additional price increases will not be  justifiable. He reiterated that estimates predict inflation  figures of 50 percent for the end of 1994 and 25 percent for  1995. As for the exchange rate, he said the true rate varies  between 140 and 145 bolivares.    [Reporter] Nevertheless, the country's leading labor  organization hopes to learn more about the government plans in  this regard since past experience shows that increases in  gasoline prices are accompanied by discontent and inflation.    [Jose Beltran Vallejo, president of the Confederation of  Venezuelan Workers] We have some documents and problems we will  be submitting to the government very soon. We have told them  that people cannot continue paying for the crisis. [passage  omitted] [end recording]    [Announcer] Edgar Valle Valle, chairman of the Senate Energy  and Mines committee, expressed his agreement with the increase  in gasoline prices.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] Valle Valle believes this  increase is fundamental because the oil sector cannot continue  registering low profit margins.    [Valle Valle] Gasoline profit margins are negative, which  means costs are greater than revenues. This situation cannot  continue in an organization such as Petroven and its  subsidiaries. Petroven is a business and no business exists to  generate losses. In addition, Petroven has the responsibility of  generating greater benefits than other companies in order to  fulfill the needs of the productive and social sectors of the  country.

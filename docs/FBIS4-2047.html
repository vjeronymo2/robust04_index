			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Yue Qifeng, deputy secretary of the Liaoning </F> Provincial CPC Committee and governor of the province, at the  provincial rural work conference on 26 December: "Clarify Ideas,  Make Earnest Efforts To Do Solid Work, and Strive To Enable  Rural Areas To Achieve a Fairly Comfortable Standard of Living  Ahead of Schedule"]    [Text] Comrades:    This provincial rural work conference is based on the  decision of the provincial party committee and government to  comprehensively implement the guidelines of the central rural  work conference, correctly analyze Liaoning's rural economic  situation, summarize and exchange experiences, define the goals  to be attained, and accelerate Liaoning's pace of achieving a  fairly comfortable standard of living. Based on the opinions  discussed at the meeting of the standing committee of the  provincial party committee and the executive meeting of the  provincial government, I will speak on four issues.  <H5>  1. A Historical and Fundamental Change Has Taken Shape in </H5> Liaoning's Agriculture and Rural Economy    Since the beginning of the nineties, party committees and  governments at all levels in the province have led the vast  number of cadres and people on the agricultural front to  thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, implement the guidelines  of the 14th party congress, conscientiously carry out the  party's series of rural principles and policies, adjust the  unitary ideas for economic work, bring into better balance the  relationship between urban and rural areas and between industry  and agriculture, adhere to the strategic idea of promoting urban  areas to lead rural areas and achieving integrated and common  development of urban and rural areas, strengthen and extend  leadership over rural work, continuously deepen rural reform,  and strive to improve production conditions, thus effecting a  historical and fundamental change in Liaoning's agricultural and  rural economy. This year, in particular, the province has again  reaped a good harvest in agriculture, achieved a new  breakthrough in township enterprises, and effected a new change  in the rural economy. A bumper harvest was won in farming, with  grain output totaling 16.96 million tons, up 8.1 percent from  last year when a bumper harvest was registered; and the output  of oil-bearing crops 204,000 tons, up 15.7 percent. Vegetable  output exceeded 10 million tons, the output of fresh and fine  vegetables increased greatly, and the greenhouses for growing  vegetables exceeded 550,000 mu, up 250,000 mu compared to last  year. Fruit output came to 2.1 million tons, up 23.5 percent,  and orchards exceeded 10 million mu. Animal husbandry grew  steadily. Despite the serious influence of the No. 5 disease of  livestock and the decline in the production of the major  producers in the country, meat output is expected at 1.295  million tons, up 10.9 percent from the previous year; the  year-end number of pigs in stock may reach 11 million heads, the  same as in last year, and the number of pigs slaughtered was 10  million heads, up 5.8 percent; the number of the cattle in stock  was 1.65 million, and that of the cattle slaughtered was  540,000, up 6.2 and 29.5 percent respectively; the number of  sheep in stock was 2.4 million, and that of the sheep  slaughtered 1.23 million, both a slight increase; and the output  of poultry and eggs was 710,000 tons, up 10.4 percent.  Liaoning's output value of animal husbandry is expected at 10.6  billion yuan, exceeding 10 billion for the first time.  Aquiculture has made new headway. The output of aquatic  products is expected at 1.46 million tons, up 10.4 percent, of  which 620,000 tons will come from ocean fishing, up 8.6 percent.  Prawn breeding was seriously affected by disasters. Despite  this, sea water cultivated aquatic products reached 730,000  tons, up 11.1 percent, and fresh water cultivated aquatic  products 110,000 tons, up 14.6 percent. The increase of  good-quality varieties has led to substantial increase in output  value, which is expected at 7 billion yuan, up 18.6 percent.  New progress has been achieved in forestry. Up-to-standard  afforestation totaled 2.04 million mu, up 22,000 mu from last  year; forests of economic value have developed rapidly to reach  650,000 mu, up 300,000 mu; 160 million trees were planted by  people voluntarily, 177,000 mu of saplings were cultivated, and  943,000 cubic meters of timber were produced. Production  related to forestry has developed rapidly, with the output value  of forestry expected at 1.2 billion yuan this year, up 23.7  percent from last year. Rural infrastructural construction has  been expedited.    At present, the whole province has  developed 1,417 country trade fairs in rural areas with 1,079  comprehensive markets and 392 special markets, expanded the  scale of the markets, and promoted the circulation of  commodities. During the year, we sent 140 million laborers to  participate in the construction of farmland and water  conservancy projects, completed 410 million cubic meters of  earth and stone work, harnessed rivers and repaired dikes  totaling over 2,100 km, increased 2.65 million mu of water and  soil conservation areas, developed 780,000 mu of water irrigated  land, improved conditions for agricultural production, and  raised the comprehensive production capacity; we accelerated the  rate of building a network of highways, increased 2,375  kilometers of asphalt road surface, and improved 2,228 km of  road beds of highways at and above the county level. Fairly  great improvements were seen in telecommunications work, and a  new leap forward emerged in township enterprises. It is  expected that the total output value of township enterprises may  reach 146.4 billion yuan, an increase of 71.1 percent over the  previous year; the total output value of township industry may  exceed 100 billion yuan, an increase of 65.7 percent; 6.9  billion yuan of export products may be delivered, up 36 percent;  the total amount of profits and taxes may reach 10.6 billion  yuan, up 47.3 percent; and the total amount of taxes may reach  5.06 billion yuan, up 35.1 percent. It is expected that the  whole province will have 19 counties (cities and districts) each  with a total output value of township enterprises exceeding 2  billion yuan, an increase of nine counties over the previous  year; 360 townships and towns each with a total output value of  township enterprises exceeding 100 million yuan, an increase of  95 townships and towns, of which, 10 may exceed 1 billion yuan;  and 1,600 villages each with a total output value of township  enterprises exceeding 10 million yuan, an increase of 535  villages. The "221" township enterprise project had been  realized two years ahead of schedule. County-level financial  revenues and the income of peasants have increased. The  financial revenues of 65 counties (cities) of 14 cities across  the province may reach 3.903 billion yuan, an increase of 28.13  percent over the previous year. Of these, the number of counties  each with a financial revenue of over 100 million yuan increased  from 6 last year to 13 this year; and the number of counties  each with a financial revenue of over 50 million yuan increased  from the 23 last year to 30. The average per-capita net income  of peasants across the province may reach 1,100 yuan, up 105  yuan over the previous year.    Thanks to sustained and rapid development in agriculture and  the rural economy during recent years, the whole province has  become self-sufficient in the total grain output with an average  per-capita amount of over 400 kg, of which, the output of rice  and wheat exceeded 120 kg. This year, we delivered 25,000 tons  of paddy to the southern provinces for the first time. With the  approval of the state, we began to export 300,000 tons of rice  to Japan in December. We became self-sufficient in major  nonstaple foods with a small surplus. The average per-capita  amount of such nonstaple foods as meat, eggs, eggs, milk,  aquatic products, vegetables, and fruits was higher than the  national average. Liaoning began to deliver pork to Shanhaiguan  during the fourth quarter of this year, and 150,000 hogs were  delivered; the average per-capita net income of peasants was  maintained at above the national average, and the problems of  food and clothing have been basically solved. In view of our  province's tremendous changes in agriculture and rural economy  and recalling the past situations, we heartily felt the pride of  our province's major breakthroughs in rural economy under the  guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism  with Chinese characteristics. Our province's agriculture was a  weak feature for a long time. Agriculture with a weak  foundation had to support the large industrial setup in the  urban areas, thus giving rise to a pattern of "big industry and  small agriculture." In order to guarantee industry and urban  supply, the broad masses of peasants have made tremendous  contributions and sacrifices, undertaken the grain purchasing  task that was higher than the national average by 200 percent,  provided meat, eggs, vegetables, milk, and fish to the urban  areas at very low prices, and some localities even had to buy  hogs at a high price in order to fulfill the assigned purchasing  tasks. Even under such circumstances, residents in cities and  towns can only lead a life of sharing 2 kg of rice, 1.5 kg of  flour, 0.15 kg of oil, and 0.25 kg of meat monthly. Because the  people of Liaoning traveled to Shanhaiguan to buy pork, they got  the name of "tigers of northeast China." Comrades living in  Liaoning have experienced this personally.    Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, our province  reaped bumper grain harvests for four consecutive years from  1990 and set historical records every year. Our province not  only ensured self-sufficiency in grain and such main foodstuffs  as meat, eggs, vegetables, milk, fish, and fruit and made the  dreams of the people of several generations come true but also  started to distribute its rice and pork to other places. This  could not be imagined in the previous planned economy era. What  inspires us more is that town and township enterprises, as new  forces, are suddenly coming to the fore with a tendency of  developing vigorously. The net increase in the output value of  town and township enterprises totaled 100 billion yuan from 1991  to 1993. Simultaneously, the state did not make any investment  in town and township enterprises. These enterprises even used a  mere 2 billion yuan of bank loans annually. Such development  speed could not be expected and understood from the viewpoint of  the unitary planned economy. The rapid development in town and  township enterprises not only helps slow the province's  regression rate in industrial output value ranking in the whole  country but also helps noticeably change the long-term situation  of unbalance in industrial structure, product mix, enterprise  structure, and ownership structure and also affects the  province's economic development. According to calculation and  analysis by relevant departments, from 1989 to 1993, the  proportion of the rural output value in the total social output  value rose from 28.9 percent to 36.8 percent, the ratio of the  output value of the industries at or above the county and  township levels to the province's total industrial output value  rose from 75:25 to 69:31, the ratio of the output value of the  state-owned and non-state-owned industrial enterprises to the  total industrial output value rose from 68:32 to 52:48, and the  ratio of the output value realized by large, medium-sized, and  small enterprises to the total industrial output value rose from  53:47 to 47:53. The proportion of the export value of town and  townshp enterprises in the local foreign exchange earnings from  exports rose from 13.9 percent to 28 percent. The proportion of  the profits and taxes of the non-state-owned industrial  enterprises in the total profits and taxes of the industrial  enterprises rose from 25.4 percent to 27.8 percent. Along with  the changes in these several structures, not only some old  economic patterns have been or are being changed but also the  province has upgraded its economic capability for bearing the  state macroeconomic regulation and control. In the latter half  of 1993, the state strengthened macroeconomic regulation and  control. Thus, the increase rate of the state-owned industrial  enterprises began to fall after a rise. In a situation where  the state-owned industrial enterprises registered a negative  increase in output value in the fourth quarter, the province  still kept the increase in the industrial output value within 21  percent this year. Of the newly added industrial output value  totaling 50.1 billion yuan, the output value realized by  state-owned industrial enterprises increased by 5.5 billion  yuan, accounting for 11 percent; and that by non-state-owned  industrial enterprises increased by 46.6 billion yuan,  accounting for 89 percent. Of this, the output value realized  by town and township enterprises increased by 38.54 billion  yuan, accounting for 76.9 percent of the total increase value.  Without big development in non-state-owned sectors of the  economy, such as town and township enterprises, the situation in  the early 1980's when the national economy was readjusted may  emerge again in a situation in which the state-owned  enterprises' growth rate fell after a rise and the GNP increase  rate suddenly dropped from 8.9 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent in  1981. It may be like the situation in the three years of  improving the economic environment and rectifying the economic  order when the GNP growth rate was reduced from 11.3 percent in  1988 to 0.3 percent in 1990.    Agriculture and the rural economy, as the most vigorous  growing points, have played a decisive role in Liaoning's  economic development. They have made contributions to  Liaoning's rapid economic development. We should fully appraise  and greatly praise this. Therefore, it is appropriate and  natural for us to say that agriculture and the rural economy  have effected a historical breakthrough and a fundamental  change. These achievements were a result of the hard work of  the cadres and the masses on the agricultural front, but they  could not be separated from the great support provided by all  trades and professions. Here on behalf of the Liaoning  Provincial CPC Committee and the Liaoning provincial government,  please allow me to extend the most sincere gratitude and high  respect to the cadres and peasants who have made tremendous  contributions to Liaoning's rural economic development and the  comrades from all trades and professions who have shown concern  for and supported rural economic development!    Witnessing the tremendous change in Liaoning's agriculture  and rural economy and studying again volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping have enabled us to  understand better the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Since the third plenary session of the 11th  party Central Committee, the vast rural areas have eliminated  the restrictions imposed by the "two whatevers," changed once  and for all the people's commune system of "three-level  ownership by the commune, the production brigade, and the  production team, with the production team as the basic  accounting unit, without change for 30 years," and instituted  the household-based output-related contract responsibility  system, which, as peasants said, has enabled peasants to "keep  all they produce for themselves as long as they turn in  sufficient amount to the state and set aside sufficient amount  to the collective." As a result, peasants' enthusiasm has been  fully boosted, and rural productive forces have been greatly  liberated and developed. Meanwhile, in agricultural production,  we eliminated the "leftist" stuff, such as "taking grain as the  key link and wiping out all others" and eliminating chicken and  duck breeding and vegetable planting as the "capitalist tails,"  and greatly developed diverse production while never slackening  efforts in grain production. In this way, we have rationalized  rural economic structure. What is more eye-catching is the  rising of township enterprises as a new force. In the past  decade or so, the output value of the township enterprises of  the country has increased from 160 billion yuan to over 2,000  billion yuan. Such a growth rate is a miracle. Although some  people frown upon and do not understand such remarkable  development, it is indeed a reality that cannot be refuted or  negated. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "rural reform has  yielded good results in three years," "the true change is in  rural areas," and "some changes are unexpected." Speaking on  the changes in rural areas with Chinese characteristics,  township enterprise development is the most evident  characteristic of the endeavor to build socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The reason for this is that rural areas,  through reform, have established new mechanisms full of  vitality, and that such mechanisms have a large capacity for  self-development, self-regulation, and self-compensation. Early  this year, information from all localities told us that peasants  would no long grow grain, and that land would lay wasted. We  firmly believed at that time that as long as we conscientiously  implemented the party's series of principles and policies,  adhered to the household-based output-related contract  responsibility system, and gave full play to the role of the new  mechanisms of rural areas, such a situation would never occur.  Facts have fully proved this. Therefore, the vigor brought by  the new mechanisms cannot be estimated with ordinary rules, and  the mechanisms have opened up broad prospects for peasants to  march toward a fairly comfortable standard of living. Comrade  Xiaoping said: "Whether Chinese society is stable and whether  China's economy can be developed should be judged, first, by  whether rural areas can develop and whether peasants' life can  be improved. To attain the 700-percent increase, an important  thing is to see whether the 80 percent of our population can  attain it. Judging from the current situation, the series of  new rural policies have been successful." As has been proven in  practice, Comrade Xiaoping's theses are totally correct. We must  arm our minds with Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, persistently emancipate  our minds, seek truth from facts, and consolidate and develop  the excellent rural situation.    Comrades, why can such noticeable changes take place in our  province's agriculture and rural economy in a short span of a  few years after we have entered the 1990's? In addition to the  correct leadership of the party Central Committee and the State  Council and the adoption of measures, such as deepening reform,  developing science and technology, and increasing input, we also  have many work experiences worthy of summarizing.    First, we persisted in combining the urban efforts with the  rural efforts to seek common development. For a long time,  owing to various reasons, our province's priorities were mostly  placed in industry in urban areas, failed to sufficiently attend  to agriculture and rural economy, lacked a dialectical and  united concept in handling the relationship between the urban  and the rural areas and between the management of state-owned  large and medium-sized enterprises and the development of  township enterprises, always set them against each other, and  even placed the development of agriculture simply in a  subordinate place of guaranteeing urban supply and serving the  urban areas, and believed that township enterprises would  scramble for energy, raw materials, and markets with large and  medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, when the state adopted the  macroeconomic regulation and control measures, we always set  restrictions on township enterprises in the first place. As a  result, we failed to develop the rural economy and successfully  run state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. We  summarized these experiences and lessons, proceeded from  Liaoning's reality, made full use of our province's advantages  of having many large and medium-sized cities, state-owned large  and medium-sized enterprises, a big proportion of raw material  industrial units, many colleges, universities and scientific  research units, and strong city functions, upheld the road of  using the urban areas to bring along the rural areas, large  projects to bring along small ones, heavy industry to promote  light industry, and combined the efforts of urban areas with the  rural areas to seek common development. Thus, we succeeded in  effectively promoted a sustained, speedy, and sound development  in our province's urban and rural economies as well as in  industrial and agricultural production. Practice showed that  combining the efforts of the urban areas with that of the rural  areas to seek common development is conducive to enabling the  rural areas to use the advantages of funds, technology, and  trained personnel of the urban areas to transform traditional  agriculture, develop township enterprises, and expedite the  process of modernization; enabling the urban areas to use the  favorable conditions of the rural areas to guarantee the supply  of staple and nonstable foods to the urban areas, solve the  contradictions of the shortage of raw materials and work sites,  break the barriers of urban and rural areas, actively develop  urban and rural markets, and realize the goal of optimum  distribution of essential production factors and taking  advantages of each others' strengths; enabling large industrial  enterprises in the urban areas to realize product and  technological transfer and spread in the course of  transformation and readjustment, concentrate efforts on  intensive and precision processing industry, develop high-tech  and value-added products, and raise competition ability;  enabling rural areas to be influenced by large industrial  enterprises in the urban areas, to develop rural industry, break  the old pattern of having the urban areas to run industry and  rural areas to engage in farming, and accelerate the  readjustment of industrial, product and ownership structures and  distribution of productive forces; enabling the urban areas to  exchange materials with the rural areas, promote cultivation and  formation of markets, and accelerate the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure; and enabling the urban  areas to merge their economy with the rural areas, maintain a  close relationship between industry and agriculture, and narrow  the difference between the urban and the rural areas.  Therefore, we may say that regarding the development of  high-yield, fine-quality and highly-efficient farming, township  enterprises as well as individual private economies as an  important growing point of Liaoning's economic development is an  inevitable choice. Liaoning is the first province to implement  the system of "placing counties under city administration." It  has experiences and gained lessons in combining the efforts of  urban areas with that of the rural areas to seek common  prosperity. Facts showed that in the condition of developing  the socialist market economy, it is a general trend for the  urban and rural areas to effect economic infiltration and  amalgamation to become an integral whole, and a necessary path  for invigorating Liaoning's economy by combining the efforts of  the urban and rural areas to seek common prosperity.    Second, we persisted in the principle that "two results  must supplement each other." The practice in the past few years  told us that to accelerate the development of agriculture and  the rural economy, we must persist in the principle of never  ignoring grain production; positively develop a diversified  economy; follow the path of agriculture; promote the overall  development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline  production, and fishery; and promote coordinated development of  the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. We used to  grasp agriculture as it stands and to lay undue emphasis on  "taking grain as a key link" in the rural work. As a result,  the grain output did not increase, the foodstuffs were in short  supply, and the peasants were still poor. This historical  lesson was extremely profound. Grain is a special commodity  linked to the national economy and the people's livelihood.  Therefore, grain production should increase steadily. However,  at present, the comparable results of grain production are  reduced and the grain production areas and the peasants do not  have high enthusiasm for growing grain. To maintain sustained  and stable agricultural development, not only should the  government strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control and  carry out the policies to protect and support agriculture and  the peasants but we should also bring into full play the  functions of the new mechanism characterized by  self-development, self-accumulation, self- regulation, and  self-compensation, that has taken shape through rural reform;  and carry out the principle that two results must supplement  each other. First, at the time of stabilizing grain production,  we should vigorously develop high-yield, high- efficiency, and  good-quality agriculture; positively develop a diversified  economy; and use the high income from the diversified economy to  make up for the deficiency due to the low income from grain  production so as to have the internal sectors of the large-  scale agriculture supplement one another. Second, we should  vigorously develop town and township enterprises, rely on these  enterprises to "feed agriculture back," and supplement and  develop agriculture with industries. This is the most realistic  way for us to develop agriculture under circumstances in which  our country is unable to follow the way taken by the western  countries where a portion of money is drawn from the high  profits realized by the industries to subsidize agriculture.  This is just like what Comrade Xiaoping has said: "Conversely,  the development of town and township enterprises is very helpful  to agriculture and helps promote agricultural development and  solve problems of comparatively low results of farm products and  dampened enthusiasm of peasants. Over the years, we have  persisted in this way and mainly relied on rural forces to  develop the rural economy, maintained proper input to  agriculture, better solved the contradictions due to the state's  insufficient input to agriculture, and ensured sustained, fast,  and sound development of agriculture and the rural economy.    Third, we persistently protected and mobilized the  enthusiasm  of both the peasants and the rural grass-roots cadres. This is  a principle that we have constantly persisted on when developing  agriculture and the rural economy. Over the years, we have  repeatedly stressed that the peasants are the main body of  agriculture and that their enthusiasm should not be hurt. If  their enthusiasm is hurt, the people may have to go without  food. Even social and political problems will be created when  the situation becomes serious. We also adopted policies to  control the situation where the prices of production factors  rose at an excessively faster speed, carried out the grain  protective prices, implemented various aid-agriculture policies,  made up our minds to carry out the measures for reducing the  unreasonable burdens on the peasants, and effectively mobilized  and protected the enthusiasm of the peasants. Simultaneously, we  also stressed the necessity to protect and mobilize the  enthusiasm of the rural grass-roots cadres. The rural  grass-roots cadres are the links through which the party and the  government establish contacts with the broad masses of the  peasants. We should rely on the grass-roots cadres to  specifically organize forces to implement various rural tasks.  If their enthusiasm is dampened, the party's policies and  principles and the government's political decrees will become a  mere scrap of paper and will be implemented to the letter with  difficulties. At the beginning of this year, in the course of  implementing the party Central Committee and the State Council's  policies on strengthening agriculture and the rural work, some  localities shifted the responsibility of adding to the peasants'  burdens on to the grass-roots cadres. This is unfair. They are  only enforcers. If we set them against the broad masses of the  peasants, their enthusiasm will be dampened.    In light of this situation, we definitely pointed out at  the first plenary session of the eighth provincial government:  There is no denying the fact that a few cadres at the  grass-roots level have violated laws and discipline and even  bullied and oppressed the common people. The overwhelming  majority of cadres, however, have been diligent and  conscientious in serving the people. Their work is very hard.  Without the arduous struggle of the vast numbers of cadres at  the grass-roots level and without their faithful practice of the  line, principles, and policies laid down since the third plenary  session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the tremendous  changes in agriculture and rural economy today could not be  explained. We must completely comprehend them. Pertinent  departments of the state and provincial, city, or county  authorities are responsible for some of the excessively heavy  burdens on peasants. Not all of them are caused by cadres at  the grass-roots level, and we should not shift all the  responsibilities onto cadres. Leaders at all levels should  assume responsibilities for the heavy burdens on peasants and  should strive to protect and mobilize peasants' enthusiasm.  Practice shows that our attention to protecting and mobilizing  the initiative of both cadres and the masses has made the  government function well and the people enjoy peace and has made  cadres and the masses unite with each other to march towards the  goal of having the people become relatively well- off. This is  an important guarantee for the rapid development of agriculture  and the rural economy.    We should persist in combining cities with the countryside  to  effect common development, should make cities and the  countryside complement each other, and should mobilize the  initiative of both. This is not only a successful experience  gained by our province in accelerating the development of  agriculture and the rural economy but also the principle we must  uphold in the future. We should strive to improve it  continuously through new practices.  <H5>  2. The Position of Agriculture as the Foundation Should Be </H5> Strengthened Rather Than Weakened in Establishing a New  Socialist Market Economic Structure    Agriculture has always been the stabilizing trade of the  state and has been the foundation of the entire national  economy. The third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee adopted the "Decision on Some Issues Concerning the  Establishment of the Socialist Market Economic Structure." In  establishing the socialist market economic structure, is it  necessary to strengthen agriculture and persist in the position  of agriculture as the foundation? The answer is yes, of course.  Just as Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out repeatedly: "In the  process of building the socialist market economic system, we  should continue to firmly and unswervingly implement the  principle of considering agriculture as the foundation and  firmly and unswervingly put agriculture in the most important  position in economic work." Comrade Jiang Zemin called on the  whole party to "strengthen the position of agriculture as the  true foundation internally rather than externally, in deeds  rather than words, and wholeheartedly rather than  half-heartedly." Premier Li Peng also pointed out at the  national rural work conference: "Today, in establishing the  socialist market economic structure, the position of agriculture  as the foundation cannot waver in the slightest degree, and  agriculture should be strengthened rather than weakened." These  important instructions of the central leading comrades have  clearly pointed out the orientation for us to further strengthen  the position of agriculture as the foundation and continue to  attend to the rural work under the new situation.    We should fully understand that the establishment of  socialist market economic structure has not changed the reliance  relations between the entire national economy and agriculture.  Food is essential to the people, and all the people must have  sufficient food to eat. As far as the whole state is concerned,  the issue of feeding 1.1 billion population is the most  important issue that should never be neglected. As far as the  province is concerned, the proportion of industry is relatively  great, with a larger urban population, heavier peasants'  burdens, so that the issue of feeding the people can no longer  be neglected. In this aspect, we paid a big price and had  bitter experiences. Today, although the conditions have  changed, we are still required to draw a lesson from the bitter  experiences. In particular, under the condition of establishing  a socialist market economic structure, the degree of reliance on  agriculture by the entire society and the national economy has  not been weakened but has been strengthened. This has manifest  itself in the fact that the domestic and international markets  are continuously setting new demands on the quality, variety,  and quantity of agricultural products. More importantly, to  rapidly tackle the most conspicuous contradiction--the  unreasonable structures of industries, products, enterprises,  and ownership, we must further strengthen the position of  agriculture as the foundation and accelerate the development of  agriculture and the rural economy.    Of course, following  the development of the modernization drive and the adjustment of  the industrial composition, the proportion of the secondary and  tertiary industries in the GNP will increase, and that of  agriculture will decline. This is an unavoidable situation  after the improvement of productive forces and social progress.  However, this never means that agriculture is no longer  important. Besides, the development of secondary and tertiary  industries cannot be separated from agriculture; and only when  agriculture is developed and peasants become affluent, can they  provide a consumer market for the secondary and tertiary  industries. We should note all the more that China's broadest  market with the greatest potential for development lies in rural  areas. When the rural economy does not develop, peasants'  income don't improve, and the rural market is not opened up,  secondary and tertiary industries will not develop and will even  recede. Therefore, the endeavor to establish the new system of  the socialist market economy is in unity with the effort to  emphasize the fundamental position of agriculture in the  national economy, and we should understand them as such.    We should fully understand that the fundamental position of  agriculture should be strengthened continuously if we are to  solve the numerous problems in agricultural development.  Although Liaoning achieved historical breakthroughs in  agriculture in the past few years, the conditions for  agricultural production have yet to be fundamentally changed,  the foundation for agriculture is not solid, some localities are  still weak in their resistance cabilities against natural  disasters, and production fluctuates greatly. Meanwhile, some  conspicuous problems remain in the process of advancement. 1)  The price difference between industrial and farm products has  widened, the comparable interests of agriculture have declined,  peasants' income has increased slowly, and their enthusiasm for  grain production has been dampened. 2) Agricultural investment  is insufficient. This year, merely a small amount of the funds  for agricultural capital construction and the special funds for  supporting rural production was in place, and large amounts of  credit funds were used in non-agricultural trades, thus  affecting the construction of basic agricultural facilities and  weakening the capacity for sustained agricultural development.  3) The rural production setup was adjusted slowly, the quality  and variety of farm products did not meet market demand, and, in  particular, processing of farm and sideline products aiming at  increasing their value was stagnant, thus affecting the increase  of peasants' income. 4) In institutional reform, some localities  improperly stopped financial support to agrotechnical  dissemination organs or diverted their personnel to other fields  of work. As a result, the contingent of agricultural scientific  and technical personnel is not stable, and agricultural  scientific research and technology dissemination do not meet the  needs in developing high-yield, good- quality, and  high-efficiency agriculture. 5) Leading comrades of some  localities do not attach sufficient importance to agriculture  and rural work, nor exercise effective leadership over them. In  doing work, they gave more consideration to cities and industry  than to rural areas and agriculture and neglected agriculture.  Liaoning is a large industrial province, and half of its  population lives in cities. How its agriculture is developed  has a direct bearing on the entire economic situation. If we do  not continue to strengthen the fundamental position of  agriculture and adopt effective measures to address the  above-mentioned problems, agricultural development and even the  regular operation of the entire national economy will be  affected. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Agriculture is the  foundation, and we must not forget this." We should have a  thorough understanding of this, and implement this instruction  resolutely.    We should fully understand that strengthening the  fundamental  position of agriculture is an important content of and effective  guarantee for Liaoning's "second pioneering program." Carrying  out the "second pioneering program" and making the old  industrial base regain its vigor and magnificence is a strategic  policy decision made by the people across the province after  they conscientiously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important  speeches given during his south China inspection tour,  continuously enhanced understanding of the provincial situation,  and learned form the successful experiences of other localities.  To regain Liaoning's magnificence, we should not only develop  the original advantages of state-owned large and medium-size  exercise but, we should also greatly cultivate new growing  points of the economy, including developing high-yield,  good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture and township  enterprises, in order to form new advantages.    The  tremendous changes in agriculture and rural economy over the  past few years have created conditions for accelerating the  whole province's economic development, and laid a foundation for  conducting the "second pioneering program," and, in particular,  creating a favorable objective environment for invigorating the  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. As all people  are aware, state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises failed  to find a successful path in areas like the implementation of  the family-based output-related contracting in the rural areas  under the influence of factors of the unitary planned economy  and the urban economy, so that 70 percent of the enterprises  failed to be invigorated, so that even while some became good or  fairly good, they were extremely unstable, and thus became a  major and difficult point for our province's economic  development and structural reform. Our strenuous efforts are  needed to speed up the change of operational mechanisms through  deepened reforms and to expand investment strength to expedite  technological transformation. This requires not only an  exploration process, but also sufficient input of funds.  However, for a long time, the state has collected excessive  amounts of profits from state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises, reducing profits retained by most enterprises to  its lowest point. In 1990, the average per-capita profit  retention was only 217 yuan, making it difficult for enterprises  to maintain even simple production processes, not to mention  technological transformation. Therefore, we proposed a series  of policies to provide water for raising fish and to allow large  and medium-sized enterprises to rest and build up their strength  to accelerate readjustment and speed up transformation in an  effort to conserve financial resources, and tried our utmost to  put them into practice. In 1992 and 1993, we did not correct  even a single cent of the profits earned by budgetary industrial  enterprises across the province, and allowed enterprises to keep  all the profits. In addition to the implementation of the  input-output overall contracting system and tax refund, profit  retention was as high as some 7 billion yuan. Where can we get  the money under the situation in which the financial department  must gradually increase its annual rigid expenditure? Thanks to  the bid development of township enterprises and other non-state  economic sectors, we increased financial revenues in the  localities. Otherwise, it is impossible for us to achieve this.  Therefore, at the central economic work conference of eight  north China and northeast China provinces, cities and region, I  briefed General Secretary Jiang Zemin that this is called "not  digging a well until one is thirsty." If not, we have no money  for conducting technological transformation in state-owned,  large and medium-sized enterprises. If we fail to conduct  transformation, a considerable number of enterprises may fall.  Then, we will commit a historical mistake, be ashamed to face  our predecessors and to brief later generations. So, we can say  that developing agriculture and rural economy, township  enterprises, in particular, in no way contradicts the  invigoration of large and medium-sized enterprises. In a  situation in which most state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises have not been successfully managed, if we fail to  achieve great economic development in rural areas and still  depend on begging for food and meat from other places, it will  be difficult to maintain social stability, and the entire  national economy will suffer one disaster after another. We  should not simply pay attention to large and medium-sized  enterprises. We must study and consider the overall economic  situation of the whole province while correctly handling the  relationship between the urban and the rural areas and between  industry and agriculture, and trying by all possible means to  invigorate large and medium-sized enterprises, we should also  actively cultivate such new economic growing points as high-  efficiency farming, township enterprises, as well as individual  and private economic sectors in an effort to strengthen local  financial strength, reduce financial delivery pressure of  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, enable the  implementation of state- stipulated policies on supporting large  and medium-sized enterprises, and create conditions for  invigorating them. Therefore, it is impossible to conduct the  second pioneering program, rejuvenate the old industrial base,  and revitalize Liaoning without agricultural development,  invigoration of rural economy, and agricultural support.    We should fully understand that to deepen reform and open  wider to the outside world, we should stabilize agriculture all  the more so as to stabilize society. The third plenary session  of the 14th party Central Committee drew up the basic framework  for China to establish the socialist market economy system. The  "decision" it adopted is the program of action for us to deepen  reform in various fields. The implementation of the various  reform measures and opening wider to the outside world require  good external conditions and a stable social environment. This  depends on the steady development of agriculture and the  effective supply of farm products. Since the beginning of this  year, urban and rural markets as well as people's feeling have  been comparatively stable despite the rather large increase in  price index. This should be attributed to the good agricultural  situation, the ample supplies of farm and sideline products, and  the thriving urban and rural markets in addition to the increase  in people's income and their increased mental guard against  price fluctuation. Even a slight slackening of efforts in  agriculture and rural work will bring adverse influences on the  market, people's lives, social stability, and even the endeavors  of deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and  establishing the socialist market economy system. Therefore, we  must overcome the tendency of neglecting agriculture when the  agricultural and rural situation is good. The better the  agricultural and rural situation, the more we should remain  clear- headed.    3. Carry Out Work in a Down-To-Earth Manner and Facilitate  New Progress in Agriculture and Rural Economy    Next year will be the year for comprehensive implementation  of the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party  Central Committee to expedite the process of establishing the  socialist market economy system and also one to continuously  maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development.  What are the targets of Liaoning's rural work and how should we  attain the target? This is a question this conference should  clarify.    Based on the guidelines of the national rural work  conference  and the actual conditions of the province, the provincial party  committee and government decided, after study, that from next  year and until the end of their tenure, Liaoning's rural work  should aim at substantially increasing peasants' income and  county-level revenues. Increasing peasants' income is the core  of the current issues on agriculture, rural areas, and peasants.  Thanks to rapid agricultural development, peasants' net income  increased by 400 yuan in Liaoning from 1988 to 1993, showing an  average annual increase of 9.5 percent. Allowing for price  rises, however, the actual increase was merely 1.56 percent. If  peasants suffer a sluggish increase of income and lack  purchasing power, rural markets will not become brisk, it will  be difficult to expand the market capacity of industrial  products, and peasants' investment in production is bound to  decline. As a result, the target to achieve a fairly  comfortable standard of living will be difficult to attain.  Increasing county- level revenues is a key issue concerning  Liaoning's economic development and social progress. Last year,  among the 65 counties (cities) and suburban districts in the  province, those whose revenues exceeded 100 million yuan  numbered merely six, and those whose revenues were less than 20  million yuan numbered 15, including some whose revenues were  merely about 10 million or 8 million. Thirty of the 45 counties  and county-level cities in the province relied on financial  subsidies, which totaled 391 million yuan a year. Without  changing such a situation, it will be difficult to develop the  county-level economy and achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy  economic development of the province. Peasants' net income  should be increased to 1,800 yuan, an average annual increase of  over 5 percent within this government's tenure, thus achieving a  fairly comfortable standard of living ahead of schedule; and  one- third of the 65 counties (cities) and suburban districts  should increase their revenues to over 100 million yuan, and the  rest should double their 1992 revenue figures. This is another  grand objective in Liaoning's agricultural development in the  new situation to establish the socialist market economy system  and is an arduous historical task.    Next year is the first year to realize this magnificent  goal. It is extremely important to have a good beginning.  Major targets for next year's agriculture and rural economy  are: Gross grain output should be stabilized at 15 million  tonnes or more; total output of meat, eggs, milk, and aquatic  products should reach 4.04 million tonnes, up by 10 percent over  this year's figure; fruit output should reach 2.3 million  tonnes, up by 10 percent; total output value of township and  town enterprises should surpass 200 billion yuan, up by 42.9  percent; the net per capita income of peasants should reach  1,250 yuan, 150 yuan more than this year's figure; and financial  revenues at the county level should also have a substantial  increase. In line with this fighting goal, the general guiding  ideology for next year's agriculture and rural economic work is:  Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, we should profoundly implement the  guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary  session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; should energetically  develop the high-output, fine-quality, and high- efficient  agriculture, with the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure as the goal, with markets as the guidance,  and with efficiency as the central link, on the premise of never  neglecting grain production; and should positively develop  secondary and tertiary industries, with township and town  enterprises as the mainstay, and accelerate the modernization of  agriculture and the industrialization and urbanization of the  countryside in an effort to make the rural economy flourish in  all fields.    We may meet many difficulties in implementing the  above-mentioned guiding ideology and in materializing the  above-mentioned goal. We maintain, however, that favorable  conditions are more than difficulties. First, the development  of agriculture and the rural economy has already brought forth a  good mechanism, and this kind of mechanism will show an even  greater vitality in accelerating the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure. Second, the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council have recently adopted another  series of major policies and measures that are conducive to  developing agriculture and the rural economy, and these policies  and measures will surely further mobilize the initiative of the  vast numbers of peasants and the cadres at the grass-roots  level. Third, the train of thought concerning the development  of agriculture and the rural economy has been even clearer. So  long as we firmly and unswervingly march forward, we will surely  be able to win a new victory in developing agriculture and the  rural economy. Fourth, over the past several years, a good  foundation has already been laid for the development of  agriculture and the rural economy, bumper harvests have been  reaped in agriculture for four years running, five trades have  been brisk in the vast countryside, forestry, animal husbandry,  sideline production, and fishery have developed completely, a  historical breakthrough has been made in developing township and  town enterprises, the construction of infrastructure has been  accelerated in the countryside, financial revenues of counties  and townships have increased continuously, and the material  condition for accelerating the development of agriculture and  the rural economy has been better than that in any other period.  Fifth, market prices have good prospects, prices of all grain  and foodstuffs have been decontrolled, and, in particular, the  state will raise the procuring prices of grain next year.  Therefore, peasants' enthusiasm in production will be enhanced  further. Sixth, through the endeavor in the past several years,  the province has already witnessed a number of good examples  that we can learn from and use as a reference. So long as we  conscientiously summarize and energetically spread their  experiences, we can bring along the extensive development of the  rural economy throughout the province. Seventh, natural  conditions are better than those in previous years. Reservoirs  in the province have stored more water than in the past. Since  the beginning of this winter, the province has experienced many  successive snowfalls. The land of Liaoning is covered with  silver snow, promising a bumper harvest next year. So long as  we make full use of these favorable conditions and make great  efforts to surmount difficulties, it can be affirmed that our  province will have another excellent situation in agriculture  and the rural economy next year. For this, we should have full  confidence.  First, we should take markets as a guidance to vigorously  develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient  agriculture. New demands have been set on agriculture in the  course of setting up the socialist market structure. We should  conscientiously study the influence over the province's farm and  sideline products by the reform measures that will be worked out  by the state next year as well as the changes in the domestic  and foreign markets' needs for farm and sideline products.  Oriented by the macroeconomic policies and market demands and  closely in line with the target of increasing economic results  and increasing revenues, we should accelerate the readjustment  of the cropping, breeding, and farm and sideline product  processing industrial structures and vigorously develop  high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture.    On the premise of stabilizing grain production, we should  positively develop a diversified economy. To ensure "the supply  of sufficient food," our province should steadily turn out more  than 15 million tons of grain. This target must not be changed.  To stabilize grain production, we should mainly follow the way  of increasing per unit yield and increasing total output. We  should gradually increase the overall grain production  capability by strengthening farmland capital construction,  developing water irrigated areas, popularizing plastic-film  covering techniques, improving soil quality, standardize the  farm work with improved varieties, and rising multiple cropping  targets. We should widen the field of vision to develop a  diversified economy; persist in the overall development of  agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery as well as  the overall management of the primary, secondary, and tertiary  industries; link science with industry and trade; and follow the  path of large-scale agriculture. It is necessary to readjust  the farm cropping structure and reform the cropping system.  Particularly, the areas in the southern and western parts of the  province should fully use the favorable conditions created by  this winter's increased snowfalls to appropriately control and  reduce paddy rice sown areas, to expand wheat sown areas, and to  intercrop wheat and soybeans. By so doing, will we not only  reduce water consumption and alleviate the southern areas'  strain on water supply but also regulate the province's grain  varieties, solve the problems of having surplus rice and  insufficient wheat and lacking soybeans, and avoid creating the  disasters due to "autumn drought." In this way, the peasants  will also increase their income. Next year, the province should  ensure 4 million mu of wheat sown areas and strive to reach 4.5  million mu. It is necessary to continuously develop the  production of protected areas, garden-based economy, and  ecological agriculture. To develop forestry, we should combine  long-term efficiency with short-term efficiency and gradually  increase the income of forest farmers. According to the market  demands and in line with the principle of planting different  trees on different types of areas, the areas with a slope of 25  degrees or below should develop economic forests, vigorously  develop fresh and dried fruit trees, replace forests by fruit,  and unify the social benefits with the environment benefits and  the economic efficiency. In particular, we should make  unswerving efforts to plant trees along both sides of the  mountain slopes of the Shenyang-Dalian Expressway. The areas  around cities should plant more coniferous trees and broad leaf  trees to make them green and beautiful. It is necessary to  quicken the pace of building "Liaoning on the sea." We should  fully use such natural resources as having long coastal lines,  more beaches, and vast sea areas to vigorously develop the sea  breeding industry and to positively and steadily develop the  deep-sea fishing industry so as to enhance the export and  foreign exchange earning capability. We should strengthen the  breeding, popularization, and import of famous, special, new,  and high-quality animals and plants; vigorously increase the  number of quality farm products; and quicken the development of  non-polluted foodstuffs. We should vigorously develop the  intensive and precision processing of farm and sideline products  and increase their value and economic results. Now, the  province's processed farm products account for a small  proportion, the quality of farm products is poor, and the  storage and fresh maintenance quality is low, and the package is  not exquisite. The primary products account for 70 percent of  the total farm products exported through foreign trade.  Therefore, we should change as soon as possible the situation  that only primary farm products are exported. We should  introduce foreign advanced techniques to upgrade the intensive  and precision processing of farm and sideline products and  enhance the ability in competition on the domestic and foreign  markets. It is necessary to further develop agriculture with  foreign exchange earnings. The foreign trade departments and  the enterprises for exporting farm and sideline products should  strengthen the contacts with the peasants, provide information  and technological service for the peasants, vigorously pioneer  foreign markets, and send increasingly more farm products to  international markets. We should strengthen the setup of export  bases and special plants, share risks and benefits with the  peasants, and develop the economy where trade, industry, and  agriculture are united as one.    Second, we should deepen rural reform and improve the rural  operating system. We should continue to stabilize and improve  the household-based output-related contract responsibility  system. We should encourage peasants to increase investment to  improve the productivity of land. The term of land contracts  should be extended another 30 years. Public bidding may be  adopted in developing the resources of wasteland, and the term  of the contract may be extended another 50 years. Within the  term of the contract, the contracted land will not be increased  or reduced no matter if personnel are increased. Compensated  transfer of land use right is permitted.    On the premise that the responsibility system with  household-  based output-related contract as the major form is stabilized  and improved, we should popularize the operations adaptable to  scaled economy in line with specific local conditions and as  long as peasants' desires are fully respected in the localities  where the secondary and tertiary industries are fairly developed  and labor forces have transferred and enjoy a stable income,  especially the southern area of Liaoning where township  enterprises are fairly developed. Localities where conditions  permit should greatly advocate the system of unified farming and  separate management. We should accelerate the reform of the  managerial system of state-run farms to meet the needs in  establishing the socialist market economy system. In livestock  breeding, we should actively popularize large- scale and  intensive management and support the development of large grain  and livestock growing households.    We should greatly develop the cooperative shareholding  system. We should make full use of Liaoning's advantage of large  amounts of rural savings deposits to guide peasants to increase  investment in production, especially in the secondary and  tertiary industries, and develop the cooperative shareholding  economy. Making use of their transportation, resources, and  human power advantages, many localities in our province have  accumulated considerable funds through development of the  diversified economy. We should actively guide peasants to  invest in the secondary and tertiary industries, with township  enterprises as the mainstay, to expand production. We should  encourage peasants to invest with the land, fruit trees,  mountain areas, and forests they have contracted as well as  their own labor service, funds, and technology to establish  cooperative shareholding farms, orchards, forest farms, and  enterprises with integrated trade, industrial, and agricultural  management.    Third, we should intensify construction of agricultural  basic  facilities, achieve success in comprehensive agricultural  development, and improve the conditions for agricultural  production. Intensifying construction of agricultural basic  facilities is a matter concerning the sustained development and  long-term stability of agriculture, and it should be carried out  successfully. We should put construction of agricultural basic  facilities in an equally important position as energy,  transportation, important raw materials, and other basic  industries and should continue to increase investment in it.  Water conservation is the basic industry of the national  economy, and we should attach adequate importance to it. We  should continue harnessing large, medium, and small rivers  successfully and accelerate the development of water resources  to meet the needs in agricultural development. Intensifying  construction of farmland capital construction is an important  part of the endeavor to improve the conditions for agricultural  production. We should continue the "Dayu Cup" emulation  activities in farmland capital construction. At present, we  should give particular attention to building the supporting  facilities for bridges, culverts, and sluice gate stations to  improve their drainage capacity. We should step up the  equipment renewal and technical transformation of large- and  medium-sized irrigation and drainage stations and the facilities  of irrigated areas and develop irrigated areas. Power  facilities for agricultural use are old and not safe, which not  only waste energy resources but also increase the burden on  peasants. We should adopt measures to replace their equipment  and technically transform them step by step and manage them  well. Developing rural communication and transportation is an  important guarantee for enlivening the economy and making  peasants prosper. We should continue to step up construction of  county and township road networks to build 2,488 km of asphalt  roads and transform 1,154 km of roadbeds next year to change the  backward transportation of Liaoning's rural areas, especially  economically less developed areas. We should speed up the rural  postal and telecommunications undertakings and accomplish the  "2127" project on schedule. We should continue to improve the  ecological environment focusing on tree planting and water and  soil conservation. We should make early preparations against  drought and floods next year and enhance our capacity for  resisting natural disasters.    We should do a better job in comprehensive agricultural  development. In line with the demand of industrialization, we  should engage in serial development of superior industries and  leading products, give priority to grasping integrated serial  development of seven superior industries and a batch of leading  products, including grain (animal feeds), animal husbandry,  aquatic products, forestry and timber, dried fruits and  medicinal herbs industries, and enable rural economy to become  more specialized, commercialized and socialized. Based on  comprehensive agricultural development, we should make overall  arrangements for all sorts of funds and use them in a  concentrated manner in an effort to raise the effect of the use  of funds. We should expedite the pace of comprehensive  agricultural development in Liaohe delta, and raise its  comprehensive production capacity. It is necessary to build  high-yield, fine-quality, and highly-efficient farming  demonstration zones, give priority to planting fine varieties of  crops that reflect the new achievements of agricultural science  and technology, and raise the scientific content of agricultural  products. We should select the best places for building  scientific and technological agricultural development parks and  develop new- technology agricultural industries through policy  guidance, input of science and technology, the support of funds,  and other measures in an effort to stimulate the transformation  of traditional farming, and promote regional economic  invigoration. We should unceasingly improve the service system  closely-related with agriculture, such as popularization of  technology, cultivation of fine strains, livestock inoculation,  vegetation conservation, meteorology, and farm machinery.    Fourth, we should actively implement the strategy of  invigorating agriculture through science and education, and  invigorate the rural economy. Relying on scientific and  technological progress, combining agricultural science with  education, and raising the quality of peasants is the  fundamental way for invigorating the rural economy. While  strengthening basic research, we should place the emphasis of  science and technology agricultural work on accelerating the  application of scientific and technological achievements. The  agricultural scientific research units should be eager to help  and meet the needs of agricultural production, and should  actively organize scientific research units to tackle difficult  problems and serve the development of production in line with  the difficult tasks in the course of production and  developoment. At present, we should concentrate energy on  popularizing high and new technology in the agricultural sector,  continue to implement the "123" project, the spark plan, and the  good harvest program, and raise the scientific and technical  level of the agricultural sector.    We should strengthen the building of agricultural technology  popularization and service system. The agricultural technology  popularization organs in townships and towns are a component of  the state agricultural technology popularization organs,  shouldering the heavy task of guiding agricultural development  and popularizing advanced technology; township agricultural  technology popularization personnel have been working on the  forefront to implement the strategy of invigorating agriculture  with science and education, shouldering the heavy responsibility  of directly disseminating agricultural technology to peasants  and raising the scientific and technical level of agriculture.  Therefore, in the course of organizational reform, we must not  simply "transfer them to other places," or make them "disconnect  their relations with agricultural organs." In line with the  agricultural technology popularization law, all localities  should make use of the winter slack season to do a conscientious  job in resuming, consolidating, and raising all agricultural  stations in townships and towns, and keep this contingent  stable. We must not reduce working fund in this aspect but  strive to gradually increase it if possible.    We should fully mobilize the enthusiasm of agricultural  science workers. It is necessary to award agricultural  scientific and technical personnel who have made achievements in  scientific research and popularization, and give handsome awards  to those whose achievement is outstanding. Regarding some  agricultural science and technology projects, we should clearly  define the method of collecting withholdings and giving awards  according to a definite proportion of economic results as soon  as the projects begin so as to raise the transparency of the  work, guarantee the implementation of the projects, and mobilize  the enthusiasm and creativity of scientific and technical  personnel to the maximum. We should continue to make overall  planning for agricultural science and educational work,  strengthen technical training for township and village cadres as  well as peasants, extensively conduct the "project of issuing  green certificates to peasants," raise the ability of township  cadres in leading the economy, and enhance the quality of  laborers. It is necessary to accelerate the readjustment of  rural education, optimize the distribution of schools, reduce  the number of above-quota teachers, increase educational input  through various channels, and be determined to solve the problem  of delaying the payment of wages for teachers prior to the end  of this year. Economically developed localities should encourage  prosperous peasants to invest in education.    Fifth, we should persist in increasing agricultural input  through various channels. Peasants are the mainstay of  agricultural input. We should continue to give play to the  vitality and role created by the "two mutual complementary  efficiencies" brought by the implementation of the new mechanism  of the family- based output-related contracting system since  rural reform, induce and encourage peasants to develop  diversified undertakings, develop township enterprises, and  increase agricultural input. Governments at all levels should  conscientiously implement the stipulation mentioned in the  "agricultural law" that the "increase of agricultural investment  from the state financial department should be higher than the  increase of regular income of the local financial department,"  and ensure that the financial budgetary funds for supporting  agriculture will increase annually. In capital construction  investment, we should gradually increase the proportion of  investment in agriculture; and in next year's loans, we should  ensure that the scale of agricultural loans will be greatly  increased over the previous year. The provincial, city and  county levels should further perfect and improve the system of  establishing agricultural development funds, and the relevant  provincial departments should step up efforts to formulate  methods for collecting and managing the funds. Meanwhile, we  should boldly use foreign capital, raise the level of  investment, and carry out developmental agriculture.    Sixth, we should continue to develop township enterprises.  From the aforementioned analysis of the rural economic  situation, we can easily discover that the rapid development of  the national economy of the whole province during the past few  years should be attributed to the rapid development of township  enterprises. Actively developing township enterprises has become  a major issue affecting the province's overall economic  situation and having a direct bearing on agricultural stability  and development. In the past, we summarized the status and role  of township enterprises from 10 aspects, such as promoting the  prosperity of peasants, accelerating economic structural  readjustment, urging large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises to change mechanism, improving the financially  difficult situation of counties and townships, and promoting the  building of spiritual civilizations, regarded these as a most  important growing point of our province's economy, and called on  township enterprises to take the lead in jumping to a new stage.  Practice has proved that this major move is absolutely correct.  We should uphold these major guiding thoughts, continue to  implement the principle of "paying attention to the advanced  units so as to make improvements and paying attention to those  lagging behind so as to promote an even development," and  implement the new "221" demonstration project on the basis of  completing the "221 project" ahead of schedule. This means that  we must devote four to five years to building 20 counties  (cities and districts) whose township enterprises each has a  total output value of more than 5 billion yuan, of which, 10  should exceed 10 billion yuan; 200 townships and towns whose  township enterprises each has a total output value of more than  300 million yuan, of which, 100 townships should exceed 500  million yuan; and 1,000 villages whose township enterprises each  has an output value of more than 50 million yuan, of which, 100  should exceed 200 million yuan. Counties, townships, and  villages which have been listed as demonstration projects should  simultaneously increase the development rate and economic  efficiency, and make the development rate, the profits, and tax  delivery show an average annual increase of more than 25  percent, 20 percent, and 15 percent, respectively. Areas where  township enterprises have a good foundation, and have rapidly  developed should exert efforts to readjust the structure, raise  the grade, and increase efficiency. 1) We should march toward  high and new technology. Comrade Feng Jiazhi from Xiaozhaizi  has proposed that it is necessary to shift the production of the  existing products of low technical content to other localities,  and concentrate efforts on developing products of high technical  content as well as high and new-tech products. This orientation  is correct. Nowadays, science and technology have progressed  and developed with giant strides. Township enterprises must  catch up with this situation. 2) We should march toward  economies of scale. Actively developing enterprise  associations, forming a new advantage of enterprise groups and  encouraging and supporting township enterprises with financial  strength to county seats or even to cities to merge with, rent  or buy medium-sized and small state-owned enterprises, or to buy  shares from large state-owned enterprises may help township  enterprises not only to open a vast world for development but  also to create a new path for state-owned enterprises to change  mechanism, so as to form a new pattern under which large  enterprises bring along small ones, small enterprises stimulate  large ones, and the urban areas and rural areas exert joint  efforts to develop themselves. 3) We should march toward the  international market, raise the level of township enterprises in  creating foreign exchange through exports. According to  analyses from relevant departments, our province's increase in  foreign exchange through export has not been swift this year. It  is lower than Shandong, Jiangsu, and Guangdong Provinces. The  disparity is mainly caused by the export of products of township  enterprises. So, we must exert strenuous efforts to develop  export-oriented township enterprises. 4) We should march toward  intensive management and combine township enterprise development  with construction of small cities and towns. Relying on small  cities and towns to develop concentrations of township  enterprises helps to reduce investment of resources, land, and  infrastructural facilities; to promote information exchanges,  material distribution, shaping of the market, technology  dissemination, and pollution control; and to produce  polyreaction to increase the competitive edges of products.  Meanwhile, it will also help to increase the economic strength  of small cities and towns, accelerate their development, and  facilitate the progress of the urbanization of rural areas. All  localities should make overall plans and reasonable arrangements  to develop the concentration of township enterprises and use  this to promote the construction of small cities and towns in  order to provide even better conditions and environment for the  development of township enterprises. Localities where the  foundation for township enterprises is poor and the development  is slow should pool the efforts of various sectors, adopt even  more flexible policies, and create a more relaxed environment to  accelerate development. They should emancipate the mind  further, remove obstacles, relax policies, and improve service  to develop private and individual sectors of the economy in  particular. Localities where township enterprise development is  sluggish must achieve a notable breakthrough and progress next  year.    We should deepen the reform of township enterprises. An  important reason for the unexpectedly rapid development of  township enterprises lies in their mechanism that meets the  needs of the market economy. In some township enterprises,  however, there are also confused relations in property right and  the "regression" of mechanisms. Some towns, townships, and  villages ask township enterprises for the money and materials  they need. If such a situation continues, township enterprises  are bound to collapse! We should resolutely change this  situation, never turn township enterprises into the subordinates  or private coffers of town and township governments, and never  change township enterprises' flexible operating mechanism and  turn them into "second state-run" enterprises. We should  conscientiously enforce the "regulations" on township  enterprises, strictly implement the regulations on the profit  distribution of township enterprises, and prohibit  indiscriminate transfer of township enterprises assets. We  should raise the level of enterprises' accumulation funds to  enhance their ability for technical transformation and  development and strictly enforce the regulations on subsidizing,  supporting, and developing agriculture.  <H5>  4. Conscientiously Strengthen Leadership Over Agriculture </H5> and Rural Work    In the new situation in which the socialist market economy  system is to be established, agriculture is the production  restricted by natural conditions and market risks. Such special  production requires that we conscientiously strengthen  leadership over agriculture and rural work.    We should include agriculture and rural work in our agenda  and extend leadership over them. Not only should the localities  where agriculture accounts for a large proportion attach  importance to agriculture, but also the localities where  industry accounts for a large proportion and large industrial  cities have more favorable conditions to and should make  agriculture and rural economy still better. Not only the  leaders in charge of agriculture but also top party and  government leaders should pay attention to the rural economy.  Not only should we make rural work successful when there are  numerous problems in agricultural production, but also we should  strengthen rural work when the agricultural situation is good;  and, when developing agriculture, not only should we develop  grain production, but also we should develop township  enterprises, the diversified economy, and the processing of  materials to increase their value, on the premise that grain  production is stabilized, so as to achieve high yield, good  quality, and high efficiency. In short, all localities and all  levels should, at all times, conscientiously put agriculture in  the fundamental position of the national economy, develop it  with unremitting efforts, and never, in the slightest degree,  slacken efforts in it. Counties and townships, in particular,  must devote major efforts to agricultural production and rural  economic work. As I have said, leaders who do not understand  rural areas, agriculture, and peasants cannot be regarded as  all-round good leaders. We should use this as the criterion to  judge the work of a city.    We should positively guide and organize the peasants to  enter markets. In developing the socialist market economy, the  government does not lighten but even enhances its responsibility  for leading agriculture. The new situation requires us to  quicken the change of functions. The governments should change,  in a step-by- step manner, the sets of administrative means and  methods by pressing the peasants to engage in planting and  harvesting, combating disasters, and providing relief to  disastrous areas into the methods of offering market  information, economic policies, and economic levers to the  peasants and guiding and organizing them to engage in production  and management according to market demands so as to eliminate  the current contradictions between the decentralized management  of the households and large-scale circulation and large- scale  markets. So far, the peasants have paid attention to and  entered markets. However, they still cannot use the functions  of market mechanisms or handle affairs according to the economic  law. This year, fruit growers in Dalian city miscalculated the  market situation and waited for the right prices to sell the  local apples. As a result, lots of Shandong's apples have  occupied Dalian's market. We should draw this kind of lessons.  According to the thinking that the governments cultivate  markets, markets guide production, and production suits markets,  we should strengthen the setup of the  trade-industrial-agricultural integrated management  organizations. We should organize and set up planting-breeding-  processing coordinate management entities to form advantageous  industries and key products, promote the development of bases  with advantageous industries and key products, enable the bases  to establish contacts with the peasants, and send the peasants  to markets. We should strengthen the setup of grain, vegetable,  aquatic product, ginseng specialized markets and farm and  sideline product wholesale markets to enliven the circulation of  farm products and to promote production. We should strengthen  the setup of socialized service systems; provide the peasants  with service before, during, and after production; guide  decentralized management and the combination of the peasants  with market demands; and make farm products and processed farm  products become readily marketable.    We should support grain production areas and  poverty-stricken  areas to develop the economy. The problem that the areas with  high output of grain are hit by poverty has constantly been  prominent. We should fully notice that under the socialist  market economic conditions, various kinds of production factors  will more easily be distributed to the areas with high  efficiency. Therefore, the grain production areas where social  benefits are high and their own benefits are low absolutely need  the government support. We should vigorously support main grain  production areas to develop precision and intensive processing  of farm products. The departments concerned should first  support them in regard to the arrangement of projects and the  collection of funds. The province and cities should  appropriately give priorities to the main grain production areas  when arranging some key construction and technological  transformation projects so as to gradually change their  unreasonable industrial structure and low economic results. We  should exert efforts to enliven the circulation of main grain  production areas, give priority to the distribution and  transportation of their grain, and strengthen the construction  of the facilities to store up and dry grain in the sun. We  should untie the grain "debt chains" in line with the method of  adding overdue fines and interests so as to protect and mobilize  the enthusiasm of main grain production bases.    Over the past years, our province has made great  achievements  in supporting the poor and the poverty-stricken areas have  basically had sufficient food and clothes. Under the new  situation of building the socialist market economic system, the  problems due to the uneven development of the regional economy  still become more serious. These are the problems cropping up  in the course of advance. The governments at various levels  should pay high attention to this. The faster the economy  develops, the more we should support the poor. The governments  at various levels should mobilize their internal vitality,  upgrade their self-development functions, study and work out  support-the-poor measures, and quicken the pace of eliminating  poverty and seeking wealth.    We should intensify the protection, regulation, and control  of agriculture. It is impossible for agricultural production to  compete with other production on an equal footing because it has  great risks and comparable low profits. Therefore, government  support and protection are necessary. 1) The work to reduce the  burdens on peasants should not be shaken. Measures for this  work have won great popular support and yielded good results  and, therefore, should be continued. 2) Resolute efforts should  be made to prevent issuance of IOU's during purchases of farm  products. We have done a pretty good job this year, and  peasants are fairly satisfied. Banks, finance departments, and  grain enterprises should please make continued efforts in the  supplies of funds for the purchases. 3) Efforts should be made  to ensure the payment to cover the price difference in the  purchases of chemical fertilizers and diesel oil linked to the  grain purchasing contract. 4) We should protect the limited  cultivated land, establish the basic farmland protection system  as soon as possible, strictly control the use of land for  non-agricultural purposes, and adopt effective reclamation and  compensation methods to control the use of large amounts of  cultivated land. 5) Efforts should be made to carry out  agricultural insurance in line with specific conditions and  improve the agricultural risk compensation mechanism. In  essence, to protect agriculture is to protect the interests of  peasants. Governments at all levels should sternly investigate  and handle all cases that damage the interests of peasants to  protect and boost peasants' production enthusiasm. We should  strengthen local governments' capacity to regulate and control  agricultural development. A particularly important task for the  present is to establish the local grain reserve system as soon  as possible and develop a multi-level reserve system  participated in by the central and local authorities as well as  peasants. We should establish the grain risk foundation.  Finance departments at all levels should use the reduced amount  of subsidies resulting from lifting of grain price control as  the grain risk foundation and development foundation and no  other purposes. We should deepen the reform of rural credit  cooperatives and establish rural cooperative banks to collect  funds and provide better service to rural economic development.    We should change work styles, go to the grass-roots level to  continuously study and address the new conditions and new  problems in rural economic development. Problems of one kind or  another are bound to emerge in rural economic development  following the establishment of the socialist market economy  system and the deepening of rural reform. These problems, plus  the old ones, will make new and old contradictions intertwine,  increase work amount, and make our work more difficult. This  requires that our leading comrades at all levels go to the  grass-roots level and the masses to conduct investigation and  study, pay attention to the major contradictions in rural  economic development, and, in particular, study ways to properly  resolve the new conditions and new problems emerging after the  execution of a series of reform measures next year. Due to  numerous factors, the prices of some staple and nonstaple foods  have risen fairly substantially, thus bringing certain  difficulties to urban people's life. The provincial government  recently held a meeting on this work and sent a cable to lower  levels to put forward some specific demands. Leading comrades  at all levels should implement it well. In particular, they  should adopt effective measures to help disaster- and  poverty-stricken areas and loss-making enterprises arrange well  the life of their people and workers so that they will spend the  two large festivals happily. In line with the requirements of  the party Central Committee and the State Council, we should  implement to the letter the three tasks for opposing corruption  and be determined to investigate and handle the major and  serious cases like the ones committed by the Changtu County  grain departments to enhance people's confidence in the  anticorruption struggle. Leading comrades at all levels should  take the lead in maintaining honesty and self-restraint and  establish a good image among the masses, particularly during the  New Year and Spring Festival periods.    Comrades! Liaoning's agriculture and rural economic  development have entered a new stage, and the tasks we encounter  are both arduous and glorious. Despite the numerous  difficulties and contradictions on the road of advancement, we  will be able to promote Liaoning's agriculture and rural economy  to a new level and make contributions to the "second pioneering  program" and to regaining Liaoning's magnificence as long as we  earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, implement the guidelines  of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central  Committee, further emancipate the mind, deepen reform, uplift  spirit, pioneer the way forward, and work in a down-to-earth  manner.</p>

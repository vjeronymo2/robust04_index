			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Danes revel in putting the Euro boot in 'WHAT DO the Europeans think of us now?' one of Denmark's 5m giant-killers wanted to know at the news stand yesterday. There is not one of them who is not walking nine feet tall after first telling Europe where to put the Maastricht treaty and then booting their way to the final of the European Cup soccer championships with a 7-6 victory over favourites and reigning European champions Holland in the semi-final in Gothenburg on Monday night. The country has never had such an impact on Europe before, politically or in sport. The Danish team was a last-minute entry to the championships, replacing the embargoed Yugoslav team days before the championships started. When Danish player Kim Christofte kicked the winning goal in a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw after extra time more than 50,000 people poured into the streets in the city centre in joyous celebration. And, said police, it was joy untrammelled by rioting or hooliganism. Spirits even rose at the Foreign Ministry, where officials have been sunk in a deep depression since the electorate voted down the Maastricht treaty in the June 2 referendum. One visitor said there was victorious singing in the corridors. National pride after killing off the Maastricht pact is already boundless. From a 50.7 to 49.3 per cent vote against the treaty on June 2, opinion surveys show that the No vote has since soared to 60 per cent. Where it will end if the Danish soccer team beats Germany in the final in Gothenburg on Friday is anyone's guess. Danish shipbuilders and shipowners fear a drop in orders and jobs following the approval by the European Commission last week of a DM6bn (Dollars 3.70n) support programme for east German shipyards. Mr Thorkil Christensen, chairman of the Danish Shipbuilder's Association, said the agreement might even lead to the closure of some yards.</p>

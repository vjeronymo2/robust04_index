			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters sought clarification on whether both proposed exceptions were limited to cases where the tying product was offered by a bank, or also included cases where the tying product was offered by a bank holding company or its nonbanking subsidiary. The concern arose because the proposed exceptions were phrased only in terms of banks. The Board notes that the language of section 225.4(d)(1) of Regulation Y would automatically apply the proposed exceptions for banks to bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries, as was intended by the proposed rulemaking. However, the final rule has been amended to make this coverage explicit. Rather than referring to a ``bank'' offering a traditional bank product or a discount on brokerage services, the rule refers to a ``bank holding company or bank or nonbank subsidiary thereof.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reorganization of Regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a non-substantive change, the Board has restructured the regulation to make it more easily understandable. The regulation has been moved from the section on corporate practices, &sect;225.4, and established as its own section, &sect;225.7. The application of section 106 to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries is contained in paragraph (a). Paragraph (b) contains exceptions to both section 106 and &sect;225.7(a), and paragraph (c) contains limitations on each of those exceptions. Finally, a definition paragraph, &sect;225.7(d), has been added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the exception for credit card services previously contained in &sect;225.4(d)(2) has been removed from the regulation, as all transactions previously excepted under that provision are now excepted under the traditional bank product exception in &sect;225.7(b)(1). Also, the phrase ``(but no other products)'' has been deleted in places where it was superfluous. These changes are not substantive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No collections of information pursuant to section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) are contained in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is hereby certified that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities that would be subject to the regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 225  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Banks, banking, Holding companies, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in this document, the Board amends 12 CFR part 225 as set forth below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 225_BANK HOLDING COMPANIES AND CHANGE IN BANK CONTROL (REGULATION Y)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

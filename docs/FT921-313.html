			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / UK Gilts: Prices battered by election jitters THE GILT market suffered as yields rose for most classes of UK government bonds, against a background of worries about the election and a possible rise in interest rates in the next two months. During the week, yields for 10-year securities rose about 10 basis points, making an increase of some 60 basis points over the past month. There has been a consequent decline in prices. The yield increase may make it more difficult for the Bank of England during the next six months to raise the revenues it needs through new gilt issues to pay for the large increase in public sector borrowing envisaged by the Treasury. The tendency towards higher yields was particularly noticeable at the short end of the yield curve. That reflected the view that sterling may be susceptible to selling pressure in the next few weeks, which which might force the government to increase short-term base rates to prevent the pound slipping beneath its band in the European exchange rate mechanism. But despite the recent decline in prices, the mood in the gilt market is not all gloom. Many gilt practitioners reckon that, at their current prices, UK securities are cheap compared with their counterparts in other government bond markets. As a result, buying pressure, particularly from overseas, could become evident in the weeks ahead. Last week, the main focus for gilts investors was the April 9 general election, with more opinion polls pointing to the possibility of a Labour victory or a hung parliament. That worries many people in the market, on the grounds that Labour might push up government borrowing further, or there could be a run on the pound as nervous investors switch funds out of sterling. As a result, the week saw a general decline in prices, with the benchmark Treasury 10 per cent bond maturing in 1994 edging down to 99 17/32 , a fall of about a quarter of a point. The yield climbed 13 basis points to 10.22 per cent. The price for the longer-dated 9 per cent stock due in 2008 fell by more than half a point to 94 1/2 . The yield on Friday night was 9.67 per cent, up 7 basis points. At the 10-year maturity level, yields were pushed up by 9 basis points to 9.94 per cent, close to the psychologically-important 10 per cent mark last seen in August 1991. German bond yields also rose, by about 6 basis points at the 10-year mark, largely due to worries about inflation and because of growing consensus that the Bundesbank is unlikely to ease interest rates before late-summer. Even though German bonds have seen a general rise in yields this month, the change has been small compared with the increase in gilt yields. As a result, the difference between German and UK yields has increased considerably from the low point last autumn. UK bonds have yields 181 basis points higher than comparable German ones, compared with 123 basis points in September. Some believe this could offer a buying opportunity for gilt investors. Mr Philip Tyson, a bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, reckons buying support could easily push up prices, particularly if the market is boosted by opinion polls pointing to a Tory win. A longer-term consideration for many in the market is the volume of new issues by the Bank which will be needed to pay for the rise in the public sector borrowing requirement, which the Treasury sees reaching Pounds 28bn in 1992-93 and Pounds 32bn the year after. Taking into account gilt redemptions, this means that during the next financial year - and probably the one after as well - the Bank will probably have to sell about Pounds 3bn of gilts a month. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, believes the Bank will have to gain much of this sum by issuing long-dated gilts, in the 10-20 year maturity area. However, now there is little incentive for institutions such as pension funds to buy gilts of this maturity, as prices for them are higher than those of shorter-dated bonds. Accordingly, yields are lower: a 20-year gilt provides about 9.6 per cent, some 30 basis points below the level for 10-year gilts. As a result of such thinking, Mr Shepperd believes that during the next year or so, yields for long and short-dated securities will start to converge, making it no less attractive for investors to buy long-dated gilts as short-dated ones.</p>

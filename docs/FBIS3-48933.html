			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, December 30 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime  Minister Radoje Kontic has asked the general director of the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) to dispatch a mission to  Yugoslavia to acquaint itself with the government's  anti-inflationary programme and a monetary system reconstruction  programme prepared for January 17. Letters with the same  content were sent on Wednesday to the president of the World  Bank amd the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development. Kontic wrote that inflation of more than 20  per cent a day was causing the withdrawal of goods, services and  factors of production from the market.    The government is aware of the urgency of stabilizing the  national currency and putting the financial system back on its  feet in order to save the economy, he wrote. The inflation is  especially hard on the sick and the poor, Kontic wrote. The  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is hit by the world's highest  inflation as a result of international economic sanctions  imposed 19 months ago. Production is paralyzed, imports and  exports are banned, and the country's assets are frozen in  foreign banks. Retail prices rose by more than 20,000 per cent  in November alone.    Kontic invited an IMF mission to visit Yugoslavia any time  before January 14. The start of monetary reconstruction is  scheduled for January 17. The government has requested the UN  Sanctions Committee to take action to release Yugoslavia's  assets abroad (National Bank reserves and commercial bank  deposits), Kontic wrote. These funds would be used to prop up  the national currency and soften the transition from  inflationary financing to an economy backed by a sound currency,  he wrote. The initiative for these activities was given by  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Kontic wrote.    A team of experts has advised Kontic to start monetary  reconstruction on January 17 even if his request is turned down  by the international institutions concerned. The experts  estimate there will be a deficit of some 800 million [figure as  received] during the first half of the year. The deficit, they  say, could be covered by releasing the foreign currency reserves  of the National Bank and commercial banks. This could be done  by lifting the sanctions or finding other ways of giving  Yugoslavia access to these funds.</p>

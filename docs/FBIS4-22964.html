N. Popov at the Moscow Institute  of Nonferrous Metals and Gold in 1949. The tasks of the  department included training mining engineers having facility  with the specific features of underground exploitation of  uranium and rare metal deposits and scientific personnel of a  high qualification in this field, and providing methodological  assistance to mining enterprises and to planning and research  institutes.    In 1963 the department was transferred to the Moscow  Institute for Geological Prospecting, where to this date it has  been training mining engineers specializing in underground and  combined exploitation of ore deposits.    Students are taught on the basis of individual training  plans  distinguished by a high volume of training in geological  disciplines, in the use of geophysical methods in mining, and in  the specific features of combatting occupational diseases and  protecting and making integrated use of the subsoil. Training of  mining engineers specifically for exploitation of stratified  deposits was started in 1989.    Each year the department accepts two groups of students.  Training of foreign students was started in 1992 (India, Libya,  Chad, Bulgaria etc.), in connection with which a student group  for the training of specialists of a broad profile--mineral  deposit exploitation--was organized.    Forty-seven doctorate dissertations were defended, 145  candidates of technical sciences were matriculated, and over  3,160 mining engineers were trained at the department.    The multifaceted activity of the department's collective  embraces a wide range of work.    One of the most important directions in the work of the  department's collective is supporting the training process with  textbooks and training aids of a modern scientific and technical  level.    The department is constantly working among students to  attract them to scientific research. Students are prepared for  independent research, and they present reports at scientific  conferences within the framework of a student mining circle.    The scientific interests of all instructors, associates and  graduate students are oriented on developing and improving the  procedures of underground and surface mining of nonferrous, rare  metal and diamond deposits.    Fundamental research completed by the department's  collective  since 1963 is described below.    In the field of underground exploitation of mineral  deposits. A complex of research aimed at improving the  procedures of mining Altay polymetallic deposits was carried out  under the leadership of Prof. G. N. Popov, merited worker of  science and technology.    A broad complex of scientific research aimed at  substantiating and creating new procedures and equipment for  hydraulic transportation of mineral raw materials for a number  of enterprises in rare metal industry and ferrous metallurgy was  carried out.    The technical possibility and feasibility of drilling  conveyor extraction of ore from thin sections of sandy clay  uranium deposits were substantiated. Systems of descending  layered excavation employing hardening filling for exploitation  of uranium deposits presenting a fire danger were actively  introduced.    A cycle of work to substantiate sensible use the reserves of  ore deposits was carried out under the leadership of Prof. V. A.  Simakov. In this case the concept ``sensible use of reserves''  was refined by the inclusion of the time and intensity of  developing deposits into it, in addition to full extraction of  useful components in the entire extraction-processing cycle. A  procedure was proposed for optimizing development of mineral  extraction, in which the intensity and time of deposit  development ensuring minimum outlays on acquisition of the end  product at a prescribed production volume over the years of the  period of optimization, within the bounds of allocated materials  and monetary resources, are determined.    A new indicator was introduced to describe the quality of  development of deposits in terms of the degree of fouling of ore  by enclosing rock--the coefficient of introduction of enclosing  rock, which is the ratio of introduced rock to extinguished  reserves. In distinction from the known dilution coefficient,  its magnitude does not depend on loss of ore during mining.    A procedure of optimizing the level of losses and dilution  during mining based on compensational outlays to obtain metal  underproduced in one of the variants was created with regard for  the proposed coefficient. Solving this problem on the basis of  the profit from a tonne of diluted reserves, where metal prices  are established at the level of long-term marginal costs, is a  particular case of this procedure. The results of this research  made up part of a project for which the group of authors,  including Prof A. V. Simakov, was awarded the State Prize for  1983.    Research on generalizing the minimum industrial and flank  content of the useful component at operating and new deposits  had important significance to lead and zinc industry. The  impermissible scatter of their values was revealed. A proposed  means of ordering the values of these indicators at deposits  provided for a significant savings of resources.    Research on the possibilities of grade-specific mining  showed  that enterprises frequently do not mine ore by grades, which  significantly reduces the economic potential.    Scientific research is acquiring special importance to  mining  enterprises in the time of transition to market relations, when  allocation of production reserves on the basis of sensible use  of the reserves of deposits in terms of the time and intensity  of deposit development, loss and dilution of ore during mining,  establishment of requirements on the ore, grade-specific and  selective mining, and exploitation equipment and procedures are  becoming especially important.    The procedures for developing complexly structured ore  deposits by an underground method were developed under the  leadership of Prof. I. A. Kovalev:     -  a phased method of conducting scientific research when  planning and introducing new mineral extraction procedures and  improving existing ones;    -  a complex of measures for improving systems of sublevel  breaking making it possible to preserve the stability of worked  rock in the course of developing chamber reserves;    -  a procedure for removing reserves without leaving chamber  pillars behind, which raises the effectiveness of developing  steep deposits of low and moderate thickness with insufficiently  stable enclosing rock;    -  a scheme of preparing a story in which it is divided into  blocks with geometric parameters determined by the stability of  the worked rock mass;    -  a means of directed crack formation along the outer boundary  of  a chamber to reduce the seismic action of explosions.       In the field of open-cut exploitation of mineral  deposits.    The following were developed under the leadership of Prof.  Yu. I. Anistratov:     -  a special procedure of open-cut exploitation of diamond  deposits in Yakutia, where the quarry flanks are steep (the Mir  and Aykhal quarries, the Internatsionalnaya and Udachnaya  tubes), for which Yu. I. Anistratov was awarded the USSR State  Prize;    -  a procedure for developing deposits to a considerable depth  (over 500 m) in stories with intermediate quarry flanks close to  the extinction angle (introduced at a number of quarries in  nonferrous metallurgy);    -  an explosion-less procedure for mining crystalline raw  material  at kimberlite deposits of Yakutia and Arkhangel Oblast using  drilling cutter-loaders;    -  a method of laying out quarries with a personal computer  using  standard elements;    -  an energy-based method for selecting and justifying full  mechanization of mining operations at quarries;    -  a means of exposing working horizons of mountain quarries  with  underground workings (Khibiny, Tyrnyauz);    -  a method of evaluating the influence of open-cut mining on  the  environment, and of developing procedures providing for  ecological balance.       The following were developed under the leadership of  professors B. P. Yumatov and Zh. V. Bunin:     -  a sensible and safe procedure of open-cut mining for  combined (surface-underground) exploitation of ore deposits  (objects of research and introduction--the Norilsk Mining and  Metallurgical Works, the Tselinnyy Mining and Chemical Works,  and the Tyrnyauz VMK [not further identified]);    -  procedural directives on establishing requirements on  minerals  in the course of exploitation of ore deposits by the open-cut  method (objects of research and introduction--the Sorsk  Molybdenum Works, the Yaroslavskiy Mining and Concentration  Works, the Agarak Mining and Concentration Works);    -  a procedure and a package of applications programs for  planning  the basic parameters of quarries with a personal computer (for  use in a system for automated planning and control of quarries):  the outer and intermediate boundaries of quarries, the sensible  direction for developing the work zone, and the calendar plan of  mining operations (objects of research--the Sorsk Molybdenum  Works and the Navoi Mining and Metallurgical Works);    -  the theoretical principles of planning phased development and  reconstruction of ore quarries (the Sorsk Molybdenum Works, and  the Muruntau quarry of the Navoi Mining and Concentration  Works).

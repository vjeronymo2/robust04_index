			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Greenpeace Thorp action blocked A MOVE by Greenpeace to stop British Nuclear Fuels carrying out uranium testing at the Thorp nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, was blocked yesterday by the High Court. Mr Justice Hutchison said the government had not yet fully authorised the testing and told the environmental pressure group that it would have to delay its challenge. Greenpeace had argued that the test run would allow radioactive uranium to be fed through the plant, create new radioactive waste, contaminate the plant and lead to radioactive discharges into the environment.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Call for Pounds 7bn Tube investment A TOTAL of Pounds 7bn needs to be spent on London's Tube system over the next 10 years if the capital is to have a 'decently modern metro' by the end of that period, London Underground said yesterday. It warned that if the government failed to provide funding, London could be stuck with an 'sprawling, overcrowded and neglected' metro for 20 years. Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, London Underground's managing director, said action was urgently needed to compensate for a backlog of investment.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Australian unions start to flex their muscles: High pay claims have prompted Keating to urge employers not to buckle under These are anxious times in Australian boardrooms. Across a wide range of industries, unions have been putting in large pay claims, and threats of industrial action have been quick to follow. Among the most publicised demands has been the claim for a 15.8 per cent wage rise, spread over two years, from the 75,000-member Transport Workers Union. This has been echoed by the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union, representing 40,000 workers asking for a similar figure. The National Union of Workers, which represents blue-collar employees in factories and warehouses, has claimed 14.7 per cent, also over two years. So far, there has been more in the way of sabre-rattling than serious industrial disruption as the claims have been pursued. This week saw localised strikes by teachers in New South Wales and workers at Australian Meat Holdings, the nation's biggest meat-processing operation. But the upheavals pale beside the chaos which could ensue if the TWU makes good its threat to disturb road transport services in the run-up to Christmas. The main issue is where these claims will eventually be settled. Mr Ralph Willis, Australia's treasurer, has pointed out that many of the headline figures are mere negotiation numbers. Moreover, some degree of 'wages break-out' was probably inevitable, as employees made up for several years of recession-enforced restraint. But this wages round is being played out under different rules from previously. Over the past two years, Australia's traditional system of centralised awards and arbitration, backed by a pact between the Labor government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions to pursue wages outcomes which kept the nation's inflation rate in line with that of its trading partners, has reduced in importance. Instead, an increasing number of workers have moved to company-based wage agreements. According to Department of Industrial Relations data, at least one-fifth of all wage and salary earners are now covered by formal enterprise agreements. The number of agreements, it estimates, has risen from about 360 in August 1992, to 2,700 at present. But both statistics may be understated, since they only look at employees in the federal awards system, not those covered by state-based awards. The optimists say the new system should be more efficient, because companies will only pay above-inflation wage rises when justified on productivity grounds. Given that labour productivity has been rising by about 1-2 per cent annually and the inflation target is about 2 per cent, the implication is that aggregate wages should increase by about 3-4 per cent a year, but with considerable flexibility for individual companies around this figure. The problem is that wage-bargaining psychology is stubborn. Economists have noted a trend in the latest wage round for a standard pay claim to be served on all employers in a given industry, regardless of their individual circumstances. Since last year's industrial relations reform legislation beefed up workers' rights in dispute situations, there are fears that less efficient companies will be pressured into settling at the same level as their more productive competitors, simply to buy peace. 'There is a risk that firms whose sales have been growing quickly will 'roll over' to avoid disruption to business, planning to push through price rises in the face of strong demand to offset higher labour costs,' analysts warn. Already, Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, has urged employers to stand firm. Yesterday, Simon Crean, a former union president and now employment minister, added that claims such as those of the TWU should be capable of being resolved by 'sensible discussion'. Employers' organisations, which have long sought this devolved system, are optimistic. 'Certainly, there are a lot of employers being spooked by the level of claims, and that in itself is a worry,' says Mr Stephen Kates, economist at the Australian Council of Commerce and Industry. 'But I think the reality is that most businesses will find they can't push the added costs (of above-inflation pay settlements) through to prices.' Financial markets seem less convinced. The yield on Australia's 10-year bonds stands at about 10.8 per cent, way above that of the US, which stands at about 8 per cent, and closer to the levels of Spain or Italy. While wages are only one ingredient in the inflation equation, it is not a sign of confidence.</p>

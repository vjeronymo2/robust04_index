			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farming in Tunisia faces a long drag - Francis Ghiles reports on a country struggling to boost output from its arid land The Gulf war has brought about a collapse in what, for many years, has been Tunisia's main source of foreign income - tourism. More than any event in the past 20 years, this conflict has brought home to Tunisian leaders the considerable challenge they face as they try to boost output from the land. A much bolder policy is needed than has been pursued so far. First, the country needs to improve the food trade balance. Domestic production covers, on average, only two thirds of requirements. Food demand will increase by between 30 per cent and 50 per cent by the year 2000 as the population grows with the rise in living standards. The average volume and cost of cereal imports has trebled since 1970. In years of drought, they account for half the food import bill. It also needs to improve export earnings. Fish and shellfish have made a growing contribution, although signs of overfishing are increasingly worrying the authorities. The output of olive oil has declined by a sixth since 1970 to an average of 100,000 tonnes a year. Yet this sector plays an important role in three respects - olive trees are the best means of preventing land erosion, they provide a fifth of all employment on the land, and they contribute a third of the value of food exports. Second, the country needs to slow internal migration from the countryside. Not only do farm hands earn a quarter of what civil servants do but two thirds only find work 80 days every year, and even that is not guaranteed in years of drought. Although a third farmers have non-farming sources of income, life on the land is hard. The neglect of farming outside the rich orange groves of the Cap Bon region in the north-east explains the high rate of illiteracy on the land (75 per cent) as it does the ing lack of access roads. As it is, the network of main roads in Tunisia is regarded as a national disgrace. Third, Tunisia needs to halt land erosion and make much better use of scarce water resources. Much of the underground water reserves are already being tapped, but 85 per cent of surface water is lost. This is equivalent to 1bn cubic metres of water, which could irrigate 200,000 hectares and produce up to 1m tons of wheat, roughly what Tunisia imports every year. As the farming sector uses 82 per cent of all water, popularising more efficient ways of using water is essential. However, the failure of a recent joint World Bank-EC attempt to rehabilitate the country's irrigated lands does not augur well. It does not come as a surprise if one considers that the price farmers pay for water covers a quarter of costs. The IMF-induced reforms aimed at liberalising the management of Tunisia's economy, which followed the 1986 balance of payments crisis, have brought many changes. Prices paid to producers have increased by 40 per cent on average, although many farmers are not benefiting much as wholesalers have pocketed the difference. Cost of inputs has also increased - fertilisers by 72-109 per cent, seeds by a more modest 11-16 per cent. More worryingly, however, the price of farm machines has doubled, spurred by the fall in the value of the dinar. Coming at the same time as two years of severe drought in 1988-99, this has reduced the capacity of farmers to finance investments from their own funds, which account for only 15 per cent of all investment in agriculture. Until the departure of the former president, Mr Habib Bourguiba, in 1987, the poorer western and southern regions were at best forgotten. Since then, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has started to grapple with the fact that, however difficult it might prove politically to redistribute wealth from the towns to the countryside, the future economic and political stability of the country calls for a bold policy. Signs of greater interest abound. West of Gafsa, Mr Mohamed Ben Rejeb displays with considerable pride the 1,000-hectare Segdoud project on which miners from the nearby Metlaoui phosphate mines are being resettled on 1.5-6 hectare lots where date palms, pomegranate and apricot trees, not to mention vegetables, are being grown. In spite of the arid appearance of the country, Mr Ben Rejeb says there is a surprising abundance of water near the surface in the area. Further north, on the vast cereal plains which surround the stronghold of El Kef, the governor, Mr Moncef Balti, himself an agricultural engineer seconded by an imaginative head of farming, Mr Amor Mtimet, is promoting efforts to build small earthenware dams to halt erosion. He is concerned by the many absentee landlords who let their land lie fallow every other year. The Minister of Agriculture, Mr Mouldi Zouaoui, accepts that such practices must be penalised but he who wishes to change the habit of channelling profits from the land into property speculation in towns will have to be both adroit and enjoy strong backing from the head of state if he is to stand a chance of success. Low productivity also characterises much state-owned land. These lands may account for only 5 per cent of arable land overall but they are concentrated in the richest cereal areas. The government is beginning to sell them, although it is aware of the need to avoid further fragmentation of property. A recent, and promising, development is the setting up of joint companies to manage such domains with foreign investors on the basis of long leases - recent examples include a Swiss company to grow flowers and a Swedish company to grow vegetables. Such ventures have the advantage of providing know-how to Tunisia and ensuring access to foreign markets. The authorities, however, are wary of repeating the costly mistakes of the 1980s when joint ventures of this kind with Gulf and Saudi funds led to widespread corruption and extravagant schemes described by one expert as a 'policy of importing Rolls-Royces in lieu of Peugeots'. Two further issues will have to be addressed if Tunisia is one day to have a real farming policy. The first concerns the allocation of credit, for which only a fifth of farmers are eligible. Farmers are going to have to learn that credit does not amount to handouts. Conversely, bankers whose role is deemed to include promoting farming will have to get out of their offices and learn what risk is all about - a change of mentality which many may find hard but which is all the more necessary in a country whose erratic climate makes farming more risky than industry. There is also the vexed matter of how decisions are reached at the Ministry of Agriculture. Politics often play a greater part than economics. Many people in the field argue that the ministry's 3,000 civil servants constitute the greatest threat of all to the modernisation of Tunisian farming.</p>

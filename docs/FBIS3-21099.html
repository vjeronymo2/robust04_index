			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by F. J. and N. B.: "Why Brussels Has Given </F> Messier-Dowty Merger the Green Light"]    [Text] By authorizing the merger between  Messier-Bugatti and Dowty Aerospace, the European Union is  endowing Europe with a structure capable of rivaling the  American enterprises.    In giving the green light to the creation of Messier-Dowty  International Ltd in the landing-gear sector, Karel Van Miert,  the European commissioner for competition, has created a  precedent in the aeronautical sector. Actually, he has  recognized that the market in which the project calling for the  creation of a jointly-owned Messier-Dowty company by the Snecma  and TI groups on a 50/50 basis, to merge their landing-gear  activities, must be positioned, is unquestionably the world  market, rather than that of the European Community. His  predecessor, Sir Leon, in the Havilland-Aerospatiale-Alenia  affair, judged the need differently. And as a result, he  rejected the acquisition of the first of these by the latter two.    To date, the Europeans have been lost out in the bidding on  contracts simply because the European manufacturers of landing  gear (Messier-Bugatti and Dowty Aerospace) were too small to  rival the big U.S.-based firms CPC (recently acquired by BF  Goodrich) and Menasco. In 1990, Menasco obtained the contract  for the Fokker F100/130, and TI's Dowty Aerospace division was  eliminated, although traditionally it had been Fokker's  preferred supplier of landing gear. More recently, Menasco  magnanimously offered Messier-Bugatti a partnership in a Boeing  777 contract.    Currently, Messier-Bugatti and Dowty Aerospace, Europe's two  number ones, have very few other competitors. Specifically, they  are Great Britain's AP Precision Hydraulic, with its 5 percent  of the world market, Italy's Magnaghi, Israel's Servo Hydraulic  Lod, Japan's Sumitomo, etc; all these small manufacturers  together representing a total of 17 percent. The U.S.-based CPC  and Menasco companies account for 38 percent and 22 percent of  the world market respectively. Thus, it is impossible for the  Europeans separately to compete with them on the same footing.  With the forming of Messier-Dowty, the Europeans will be able  to, since the joint company will be in a position to obtain 23  percent of the world market, whereas neither of the two  companies separately attains a 15-percent share of it at present.    In the course of their investigations, the sleuths of the  Community's General Directorate for Competition (DG 4) were  compelled to recognize that it would have been absurd to  consider only the Community market, even though, a priori, the  creation of Messier-Dowty entails a monopoly situation. Why?  First, because of the characteristic of its clients. There are  only four principal clients worldwide: Airbus, Boeing, McDonnell  Douglas, and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). The three  civil-sector builders, namely, Airbus, Boeing, and McDonnell  Douglas, represent 80 percent of the market in terms of the  value of all purchases of landing gear for civil aircraft. And  the DOD alone has 70 percent, in terms of value, of all  purchases for military applications. In any case, all four have  a clear-cut preference for solidly-based suppliers who are not  likely to suddenly disappear from the market. They want to be  sure that once a supplier of is awarded a contract, he will be  able to supply replacement parts throughout the life of the  program. In addition, they very frequently require that the  supplier of landing gear participate in the financial outlay for  research and development. Suppliers must therefore attain a  certain critical mass to be able to meet this challenge. In  short, Airbus and Boeing do not seek necessarily the cheapest  price, but rather a reliable long-term partner.    And secondly, according to the European experts, the  creation  of Messier-Dowty is not likely, per se, to eliminate the small  manufacturers, even though Messier-Dowty, CPC, and Menasco will  be in a position, among the three of them, to make a clean sweep  of around 80 percent of the Western world's estimated $1 billion  market for civil landing gear. The reason is very simple: The  civil and military applications market is closely intertwined,  and new competitors often enter the market via the military  sector. This is the case in Germany and Japan.    The European Commission's green light will very likely  enable  Snecma and TI, to substantially reduce production costs.  According to Karel Van Miert, they will also be able to develop  the very recently constructed Dowty industrial site in Quebec,  since 80 percent of Dowty Canada Limited's capital will go into  Messier-Dowty, whose total capital will consist of this 80  percent of Dowty Canada plus 90 percent of Dowty Aerospace's  capital, and 90 percent of the capital of ERAM,  Messier-Bugatti's subsidiary, to which all of Messier-Bugatti's  landing-gear activities will have priorly been transferred.  ERAM's name will then be changed to Messier-Dowty SA. Via  Messier-Dowty, the two parent companies will thus attain a  critical mass capable of competing with the American firms.    The other side of the coin is that TI and Snecma will have  to  restructure their landing-gear activities, possibly with job  losses. But according to Messier-Bugatti's top management, this  restructuring has already taken place over the past two years.  If the current level of activity continues, there will be no  need for new reductions in staff.</p>

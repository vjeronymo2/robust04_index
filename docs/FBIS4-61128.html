			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, 2 May, BNS -- Mainly elderly residents  from northeast Estonia's Russian-populated cities of Narva and  Sillamae formed a human chain on the Tallinn-St. Petersburg  highway Sunday [1 May], demanding permanent resident's status  and higher pensions.    The picketers demanded the authorities to grant a permanent  resident's status to everybody who has the Estonian resident's  status stamp in their Soviet passports from earlier than July  1990, said Nikolai Klotschkov, editor in chief of Sillamae's  local newspaper.    Other demands included amendments to the pension law,  determining of the cost of living index, and increasing the  pensions of retired workers of the nuclear industry -- the  leading branch for decades under the Soviet rule in the once  closed-for-outsiders military plant town of Sillamae.    The roadside picket, organized by local pensioners unions,  was called by the activists a "Baltic Chain", referring to the  23 Aug 1989, event under the same name.    In 1989, Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians linked their  hands in a chain extending from Tallinn to Vilnuis to demand  from the then Soviet leadership official denouncement of the  1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Belgium to push EU growth plan THE Belgian presidency of the European Union intends to to strengthen the European Commission's programme for economic growth and job creation at a meeting of EU finance ministers early next month. The move is in response to UK and German success in neutering Commission efforts to set EU-wide targets for halting rising unemployment and promoting growth. Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister, is understood to have been surprised by the Commission's abrupt retreat from earlier calls for specific targets to spur a recovery and disappointed by the document's bloodless tone compared with previous drafts. Brussels had earlier called for a 2-3 per cent reduction in short-term interest rates contingent upon wage restraint and cuts in budget deficits, a broadening of the tax base to pay for cuts in employment taxes, and a specific recommendation to create 15m jobs by the end of the century. Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands all voiced strong objections to these targets, pointing out that the EU had no legal instruments to fulfil them and that the levers of macroeconomic power still rested with member states. However, France, Italy and Spain were much less hostile, according to an official. Mr Maystadt is said to be determined to put forward a strongly-worded document on the grounds that it will have legal status according to the recently ratified Maastricht treaty. Under the Maastricht treaty, the Commission is required to put forward a recommendation on macroeconomic targets which can be adopted by qualified majority by the European Council on December 10-11. Belgian officials point out, with a touch of bravado, that this could mean that the Germans and British alone could be outvoted. A Commission official defended the watering down of the original macro-economic guidelines on the grounds that it was important to 'carry' along member states. In Brussels, officials are concerned that Mr Jacques Delors' white paper on employment, competitiveness and growth could lose impact because of the Commission's retreat, particularly since it has no legal status and is unlikely to contain recommendations.</p>

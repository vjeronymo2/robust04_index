			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Not a bad day, quite the reverse I HAD a dream this week in which the outcome of next Wednesday's Epsom Derby was revealed to me backwards. Time ran backwards, which meant that everything happened in reverse: the Derby, my conversations with the Queen, my journey to the racetrack. What prompted the dream, I'm sure, was Time's Arrow, the Martin Amis novel, which I read last weekend. It tells the story of a man's life backwards. (The man is a Nazi doctor at Auschwitz; with time running backwards, he grows younger by the day, until he arrives at childhood's innocence. We were all innocent, once). My Derby dream was vivid. It started at the moment that a horse named Alnasr Alwasheek, travelling backwards, left the finishing line last, which meant he was first - two lengths behind Dr Devious, the horse I had backed. (The Lester Piggott-ridden favourite, Rodrigo De Triano, was closer to last than first, having been one of the first to cross the line). 'Tip-top]' said the Queen. 'Let's have some strawberries, then we'll meet the owner. I'll send someone to fetch him.' 'An excellent race,' I agreed. 'Astonishing]' cried the Queen, raising her binoculars. 'Just as you predicted] Is there clairvoyancy in your family? What a super race]' As I watched, the runners moved backwards to Tattenham Corner, where there was a certain amount of scrimmaging, then on up the hill and into the starting stalls. 'They're off]' cried the Queen excitedly, lowering her binoculars. Just before the Off], I raced downstairs, past the security guards and across to the bookmakers. I handed a bookie a betting stub and he gave me Pounds 500. 'Thankyou, sir.' 'Thankyou.' 'Certainly, sir. Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 500, Dr Devious.' 'Pounds 500 on Dr Devious, please.' The Queen said: 'You've got about four minutes.' I explained that I had not yet placed my bet. 'You certainly don't lack confidence. What a glorious afternoon] Have you met the Queen Mother?' 'Dr Devious,' I said, 'though I am worried by Alnasr Alwasheek. Whatever the outcome, there will be two lengths between them.' 'Such a shame,' agreed the Queen, 'but we can't have everything we want, can we? What is your tip?' 'The Derby is easily my favourite race,' I told her. 'It is a pity that the royal studs are without a runner this year.' As most people know, the Queen is an expert on racing and breeding. She owns many racehorses, though some are very slow. Despite her fabulous wealth, she has had only scant success since unwisely selling one of her best horses, Height of Fashion, to the Maktoum family of Dubai for a sum reckoned to have been about Pounds 1.6m. Last year (or was it next?) the Queen finished 69th on the UK owners' list, with prizemoney of Pounds 62,168, immediately below a company called Skeltools, which won Pounds 62,423. Her winnings were a drab pittance when set against those of the leading owner, Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum, who won Pounds 1.84m. According to her apologists, the Queen's bloodstock operation has to be seen to be self-financing and is extremely tightly budgeted, to ward off political criticism. The Queen said: 'So glad you could make it. I know that you like horse-racing. As I said to my racing manager, so few of my relatives are now suitable to be seen in public with me that I want to meet new people at Epsom on Derby day. Young people. Bright people. New people.' 'Good afternoon, Ma'am.' 'Good afternoon, Mr Thompson-Noel,' said the Queen, her blue eyes glittering. She was wearing a yellow dress and a strand of ancestral pearls. She is grey and small now, but still vivacious and droll. After leaving the track, I headed for the rail station. At the end of my journey I went to the ticket office; I handed in my ticket and received Pounds 12. Then I hailed a taxi. I gave the driver some change and he gave me Pounds 8. My long day was ending. I read the newspapers and poached myself an egg. I bathed and shaved and gargled. Then I rolled into bed. What a splendid day, I thought. Because I had backed a loser, I was Pounds 500 ahead, plus Pounds 42.80 for expenses. Once you start going backwards, you can't afford to stop.</p>

Agriculture Minister Yeoryios Moraitis said in Helsinki  yesterday that in the membership negotiations there are still  open questions of this type that need bold political decisions.    Greece currently holds the EU presidency, and Moraitis will  therefore play a central role when the EU reaches a decision on  its agricultural goals in the membership negotiations.    Yesterday Moraitis held five hours of talks with Agriculture  and Forestry Minister Martti Pura, and he also met Foreign  Minister Heikki Haavisto and Foreign Trade Minister Pertti  Salolainen.    After the meeting Pura said that there had been no  negotiations, but that Moraitis had been briefed on Finland's  goals. No new issues emerged in the negotiations, Pura said.    Moraitis was tight-lipped when it came to answering  questions  -- for example, about Spain's proposal that the new member  countries' net contributions should be targeted in support to  the poorest member countries. As the holder of the presidency,  Greece must be cautious and not comment on something that will  perhaps not happen, Moraitis said.</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Scots loan rates to be guaranteed Scottish Enterprise, the official development body for Scotland, is to launch a scheme to assist small businesses by guaranteeing the rate of interest on loans taken from banks. Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Office had to defeat strong Treasury opposition to secure approval for the scheme, which is thought to be unprecedented in the UK. It is particularly aimed at companies employing up to 250 people in manufacturing and construction, but is also expected to apply to business services. Scottish Enterprise will be able to rule on the eligibility of companies. Although details of how the scheme will operate have yet to be finalised, it is expected that companies will receive a guarantee that the interest rate on loans over two to seven years will not increase by more than one percentage point. Scottish Enterprise will make up the difference to the banks if interest rates on the affected loans exceed the cap. The scheme is expected to cover Pounds 100m worth of loans and the cost to Scottish Enterprise could be Pounds 5m a year - from its annual budget of Pounds 450m. The initiative is one of a number of projects launched by Scottish Enterprise to increase Scotland's low rate of new business formation. The development body has won the backing of the Scottish banks - Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland, TSB Bank Scotland and Clydesdale - and has support from Scottish business leaders and providers of professional services. The scheme had the backing of the prime minister and the Department of Trade and Industry in spite of resistance from the Treasury. Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of Scottish Enterprise, finally persuaded Mr Kenneth Clarke to approve it at a meeting in Inverness last May when the chancellor was attending the Scottish Conservative party confer-ence. Fears about the volatility of interest rates have proved a strong disincentive to small businesses to undertake new investment and to expand their operations. Scottish Enterprise is also acting to make good the shortage of equity finance for small businesses, which they require for expansion alongside loan finance. It intends shortly to announce plans for the creation of venture capital funds to invest money subscribed by banks, financial institutions and large Scottish companies. The new funds would be administered by Scottish Development Finance, an arm of Scottish Enterprise which has been restructured. It is targeting its investments at businesses needing less than Pounds 500,000, an area often shunned by private investment capital providers because of the disproportionate cost of making investments of this size.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Employers dig in over cost-cutting: German engineering bosses pre-empt union wage demand Germany's engineering employers yesterday called for the planned 35-hour-week in the industry to be renegotiated as part of a package to save jobs and cut costs. In a pre-emptive strike on the eve of the annual wage demand from IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, the employers served notice that cost-cutting remains the absolute priority for the industry, still reeling from last year's economic downturn. The union is expected to table a claim today for a wage rise in excess of the inflation rate, designed to compensate for real pay cuts over the past year, and to reflect an increase in productivity forecast at more than 3 per cent. The employers' move to renegotiate the 35-hour week, the most hard-fought achievement of the engineering workers in recent years, seems certain to infuriate the union leaders, who were forced to accept a virtual pay freeze for their members last year. But Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, the president of Gesamtmetall, the engineering employers' federation, warned yesterday: 'The shortening of the working week limits the room for any wage increase.' He added that the planned 35-hour week, due to come into effect from October 1, 1995, should be renegotiated as part of a package aimed at more flexible working practices, and an overall cut in costs. Mr Gottschol said that the wave of redundancies through the engineering industry, which was running at 30,000 a month last year, had finally halted, not least thanks to the job security deal involved in last year's pay settlement. That deal allowed individual employers to put their staff on to short-time working without full compensation in their pay packets, as an alternative to outright redundancies. His five-point plan includes an extension of the current deal on short-time working and job security, cost-cutting, renegotiating the 35-hour week, negotiating a special deal to employ the long-term unemployed, and seeking more flexibility in the wage package to give relief to small and medium-sized enterprises. The number of short-time workers in the industry has now sunk from 750,000 at the low point of the recession in 1993 to 80,000 today, Mr Gottschol said. He forecast a growth rate of 3 to 4 per cent in the electrical and mechanical engineering industry as a whole in 1994, but warned that the effects of the recovery were very patchy. Since mid-1991, 750,000 jobs had been lost in the west German engineering industry because of the pressure of costs, and the loss of orders.</p>

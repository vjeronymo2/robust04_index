			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: PosGold adds to Aztec bid Poseidon Gold, part of Mr Robert de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon mining and minerals empire, yesterday submitted expanded offer documents for Aztec Mining Company to the Australian Securities Commission in an effort to acquire the medium-sized mining house for ADollars 261m (USDollars 180m). PosGold's move came after the federal court in Sydney declared invalid the bidder's previous 'Part A' statement, one of the formal bid documents required in Australian takeovers. Aztec's directors, who oppose the bid, claimed that PosGold should divulge more information in specific areas; these ranged from PosGold's sources of finance to Normandy Poseidon's relationship with the South African Anglo-American group and the bidder's plans for Aztec's base metal interests. PosGold said yesterday that it had decided to lodge the expanded document in an effort to expedite the bid, although it added: 'PosGold remains of the belief that none of the matters raised by Aztec . . . were sufficient to affect the validity of its 'Part A' statement'. It said that additional information had been provided in various areas requested by Aztec, including funding arrangements and the Anglo-American relationship. Aztec directors will now have approximately two weeks to consider the new document before it is sent out to shareholders. They would be free to raise fresh legal objections if they felt the information was still deficient.</p>

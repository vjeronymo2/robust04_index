			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium row escalates THE STORM of disapproval about the European Commission's weekend decision to put short-term restrictions on aluminium imports from the Commonwealth of Independent States increased in ferocity yesterday. Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of the Aluminium Company of America, the world's biggest aluminium group, warned that the EC's move would certainly increase trade friction and might force the US industry to ask its government to take retaliatory action. Russia's foreign economic relations ministry accused the EC of 'betrayal' and added: 'Restrictions on aluminium imports from Russia contradict numerous declarations of Community representatives about support for Russian reforms and trade liberalisation.' Intercomalum, the CIS aluminium industry's trade association, said the EC had given no hint that it would take such draconian action and suggested 'this will confuse the (aluminium) market and create unnecessary disorder'. The EC said at the weekend that the European aluminium industry was being 'seriously damaged' by the surge in imports from the CIS and that imports until the end of November would be limited to 60,000 tonnes. In June, Alcoa cut production at its smelters by 25 per cent, partly in the hope of heading off action by the EC. At that time Mr O'Neill, a fervent free-trade advocate, insisted that the western aluminium industry had to learn to live with the changed situation following the collapse of the former Soviet Union and should not resort to protectionism. Yesterday he said he had followed Alcoa's June cuts with talks with US trade officials in the hope that they would raise the issue with the EC. But, apparently, nothing had been done. He was 'extremely disappointed' by the EC decision, which he called a 'futile action'; the market gave its judgment in a decisive way by dropping the price of aluminium substantially. Mr O'Neill said the EC statement showed the futility of the commission's restrictions by stressing that there were not enough statistics available to see what was going on in the CIS industry. The restrictions would have little impact because the industry would swap CIS aluminium for that made in Brazil or North America and send that to Europe. 'The only logical way to make the scheme effective is for the EC to restrict imports from anywhere in the world to 60,000 tonnes in the next four months. 'Clearly we have to assume more Russian metal will be directed towards the US. This is unfair trade, so I must get my lawyers and trade experts together to see if we can stop that flow. If this is the way our political leaders want to play, then we must act to protect ourselves,' he said. Mr Elliot Spitz, a vice chairman of Intercomalum, said there had been two meetings between the CIS industry, Russian government and EC officials. Intercomalum had assumed that negotiations would continue until satisfactory arrangements about imports to the EC could be worked out. More talks were scheduled for September and, while Intercomalum did not expect that the present restrictions would be lifted, 'we are much more concerned to prevent an extension to the restrictions'. As for the EC complaint that the CIS industry had failed to provide statistics, Mr Spitz pointed out that this was caused by the collapse of centralised structures as the Soviet Union broke up. But today all the CIS aluminium industry's plants were open to receive western visitors and 'there is no doubt about the willingness of the industry to co-operate with the west'. Meanwhile, the Russian foreign economic relations ministry urged the commission to drop the restrictions and instead stand by an agreement reached in July to explore alternative ways for limiting CIS exports. It said the EC's unilateral action was a serious blow to Russia's economy and trade and at odds with the EC's previous support of Russian economic reforms.</p>

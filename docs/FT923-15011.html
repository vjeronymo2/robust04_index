			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Losses at FNFC rise sharply to Pounds 22.7m FIRST NATIONAL FINANCE, the consumer finance and banking group, said yesterday that it believed it was poised for a significant improvement in its business in the second half of the year, despite heavy pre-tax losses in the first six months. Mr Martin May-Smith, chairman, said that though there were no clear signs of a recovery in the property market, he thought the worst was now over as far as the group's businesses were concerned. He said that the group's gross margin had widened by one percentage point to ten per cent and that it was now concentrating on less risky but still profitable business, such as home improvement loans. Despite this note of optimism, FNFC turned in another set of discouraging results. Pre-tax losses for the half year to April 30 were Pounds 22.64m, up from Pounds 6.24m in the same period last year. All three divisions of the group were in the red, with the heaviest losses coming in its consumer credit oper-ations which lost Pounds 12.85m (Pounds 6.47m). The commercial lending division, which made a Pounds 3.92m profit in the first half of last year, plunged into a Pounds 5.48m loss. Mr May-Smith said that this sector was causing especial concern. There was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 16.94m on the group's property portfolio against losses on immediate sales of undeveloped sites where the group had received an offer from a potential purchaser in line with current market prices. Group turnover excluding the banking business was slightly up on a year ago at Pounds 21.25m (Pounds 20.3m) though it was down from Pounds 26.06m at the end of October. FNFC now has a total loan book of Pounds 1.2bn. Around six per cent of the group's mortgage customers are said to be in arrears of six months or more. Bad debt provisions on consumer credit were Pounds 35.7m with a further Pounds 14m for suspended interest. The total group charge for bad debts was Pounds 64.5m for the half year, compared to Pounds 120.5m in the whole of last year. The group is considering a variety of strategies,including refinancing, securitisation and asset sales to cover borrowing which falls due during 1993. Mr Tim Ingrams, previously of ANZ Grindlay's, has been appointed finance director. Net asset value declined to 89p per share from 118p in April 1991. See Lex</p>

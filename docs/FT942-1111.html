			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family (Pensions): What's Goode for you . . . - Last October, a committee set up by the government produced a report containing 218 recommendations Robert Maxwell's raids on his group's pension funds forced the government to review the law intensively to find how to improve protection for scheme members. In October 1993, professor Roy Goode, chairman of the government-appointed review committee, produced a 1,000-page Pension Law Reform Report containing 218 recommendations. The White Paper published this week set out which of the proposals the government would adopt in full, which it would water down, and those it would ditch. For most scheme members, though, there is one issue on which Goode's recommendations and the White Paper measures will be judged: namely, to what extent has the security of pensions been improved? How do the government's plans accord with the report? GOODE'S PROPOSALS IN BRIEF . . . A pensions act to enshrine in law the employer's 'pension promise' and to protect members' benefits earned already. Adopted. A pensions regulator to have supreme authority over company pensions with power to intervene and impose sanctions. Watered down. A compensation fund to pay out in the case of fraud, theft and misappropriation of pension fund assets. Adopted. A minimum solvency standard to ensure that, if the company fails, the fund has enough assets to meet its liabilities. Adopted. A system to check that employers have paid their contributions. Adopted. Greater power for the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (OPAS) and the pensions ombudsman, plus a requirement for employers to set up internal machinery to deal with disputes over pensions. Adopted. More power for trustees, who would also be liable to criminal proceedings if they fail to protect members' rights. Adopted. A statutory requirement for members to be represented on trustee boards  - up to one-third for final salary schemes and two-thirds for money purchase schemes. Watered down. Greater access by members to information, which should be explained in plain English. Adopted. . . . AND IN DETAIL Pensions act and regulator. Goode recommended that trust law, which separates the pension fund legally from the company's assets, should continue but should be strengthened by a pensions act administered by a regulator. Since trust law is complex and ill-defined, the act would enforce the 'pension promise' - that is, members' basic rights to a pension based on past service and contributions paid. Employers would be required to make clear their pension obligations in the contract of employment. The act would make clear the trustees' primary duties to members and their families. To enforce it, Goode wanted a regulator with absolute authority over occupational schemes and power to intervene and impose sanctions on wrongdoers. Compensation scheme. Goode recommended that this should cover all occupational pension schemes with an identifiable fund, including schemes run by insurance companies. The scheme would not offer protection on an all-risk basis, though. Instead, it would pay out in the case of proven fraud, theft and other misappropriation. Other events, such as bad investment decisions leading to insolvency, would not trigger compensation. The compensation itself would take the form of a loan repayable from any pension fund money recovered, and would be funded by a compulsory post-event levy on all schemes. Solvency. Goode said that the level of funding backing the pension promise was crucial and recommended a minimum solvency standard to secure the pension rights of members. The solvency level would be monitored regularly by the trustees and scheme actuaries. If a fund fell below the minimum, there would have to be an immediate injection of cash, failing which the trustees would have to recover the funds from the employer. Actuaries get very excited about the solvency issue. For scheme members, however, there is only one point to consider. Since the compensation scheme would not cover all risks, the fund should - in the event of an employer going bust - have enough cash to provide adequate transfer values for present and deferred members, and to buy annuities to replace the pensions already in payment. (Deferred members are former employees who have left their pension benefits behind on changing jobs. Annuities are sold by life offices which, in return for a lump sum investment, guarantee an agreed income for life). Member trustees. These are the legal owners of the pension fund and have a duty to pay the promised benefits to members and their families. Goode called for more representation for members on trustee boards, except for very small schemes. At present, an estimated one-third of schemes appoint trustees solely from the company's management - a system that can lead to abuse. Goode recommended that where the investment risk fell on the employer - as is the case with schemes that link the value of the pension to employees' final salary - the balance of power should be retained by the employer, which should have a two-thirds majority on the trustee board. Where the investment risk fell on the individual - as is the case with money purchase schemes that offer pensions based purely on investment returns - the balance of power should be held by scheme members, who would form a two-thirds majority. Goode also wanted trustees to have more power over the professionals they appointed to run the fund. In turn, the latter would have a legal duty to report any 'serious or persistent irregularities'.</p>

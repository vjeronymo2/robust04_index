			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BIG ONE' ON SHAKY GROUND;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE CONSENSUS OF SCIENTISTS WAS THAT MANY OF THE SPECIFICS AS  DRAMATIZED IN THE MOVIE WERE 'CREDIBLE' AND 'POSSIBLE' BUT 'NOT PROBABLE.'  </P> <P> In the latest offering of disaster-as-art, the NBC miniseries "The Big One: The  Great Los Angeles Earthquake" amounted to a beyond-worst-case scenario,  according to scientists and specialists in earthquake watching.  </P> <P> The consensus of those surveyed by The Times was that many of the specifics of  earthquake science as dramatized in the movie Sunday and Monday were "credible"  and "possible" but "not probable."  </P> <P> Earth scientists and emergency-service officials who saw the movie at an NBC  promotional screening seemed pleased with it, even joyful, on the grounds that  it might shake people into more fervent preparations for major tremors. The  plot -- which "starred" shakers of 5.7, 8.0 and 7.2 Richter magnitude --  included some instructional details, such as using survival kits and turning  off gas pipes into the house.  </P> <P> But some were unhappy with the catastrophic depictions, among them Paul Flores,  executive director of the Southern California Earthquake Preparedness Project,  a state-sponsored information clearinghouse. He said, with harsh  understatement, that "The Big One" was "counterproductive."  </P> <P> "I've been at this nine years," he stated angrily, "and you work so hard to get  over this notion of apathy or futility -- and this is what this movie is  showing." If anyone thought a magnitude-8 earthquake was likely here, there  wouldn't be any point in trying to meet earthquake-resistant building  standards, Flores maintained.  </P> <P> He said the movie had many misrepresentations. For one thing, he insisted that  buildings would not all topple as the program suggested, "especially  steel-framed high-rise buildings."  </P> <P> And geology professor Kerry Sieh of the California Institute of Technology, a  pioneer in the attempts to predict earthquakes, complained that the miniseries  had its Big One running five minutes long: "It would be more likely a minute  long. And they had so many aftershocks. That was pushing it." Emphasized Asst.  Fire Chief Frank Borden, who runs the Disaster Preparedness Division that is  probably the largest of its kind in the country, "Yes, we're going to have a  major earthquake, and, yes, people do need to prepare because earthquakes are  survivable. That's the key issue. The first part of the movie was  semi-educational. (But) one of the problems at the end is that it went on  killing people."  </P> <P> Tom Heaton, scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological Survey field office in  Pasadena, noted that viewers got a mixed signal from the movie -- that they  were left with an impression that one out of four people were killed, "which  would mean millions dead; then they came on and said it's hundreds of  thousands."  </P> <P> The experts also said that NBC's drama was "at the extreme" in its depiction of  predicting earthquakes. To a quiet but ominous undertone of music, the movie  showed miniquakes at Bombay Beach, dropping oil field pressures in Baldwin  Hills, rising radon readings, a methane gas explosion in the Fairfax district,  gurgling in the La Brea tar pits and satellite laser measurements showing  slight movement of Mt. Wilson toward Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> "Well, if all those things actually happened," Heaton speculated, "we still  wouldn't have the theory to tie them all together. But if all those things did  come in -- which, by the way, wouldn't happen because we don't have the funds  to do it -- there'd be a lot of sweating."  </P> <P> But California does have a very precise quake response plan, as opposed to the  movie images about battles over what and when to tell the public. In fact, the  state has issued five quake advisories in the last six years based on data from  the U.S. Geological Survey.  </P> <P> "The last time we did it was the Upland earthquake," said Lucile Jones of the  survey staff, who specializes in foreshocks as clues to predicting  probabilities and was a key source for the screenwriters, providing much of  their model for the character of Claire Townsend (played by Joanna Kearns). "It  was having so many aftershocks that we did this advisory that they could get  larger than the first one. In fact, we had three earthquakes of 4.7 or 4.8 and  the main shock was only 5.2. So in that sense we were right.  </P> <P> "We managed to get that statement out (to emergency management organizations)  and issued to the press within an hour and a half, and along with it was  information and suggestions for appropriate responses on the part of the public  and local government."  </P> <P> The problem, Heaton said, is that most members of the public are reluctant to  act on such predictions because of the very long odds involved: "Probabilities  today are one in 10 or one in 20. Those are numbers that are high enough to  concern us but low enough that it still means that it (an advisory) could mean  a false alarm. Some people would say, 'Big deal.' "  </P> <P> Cmdr. George Morrison, chief of staff to Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates  and an architect of the city's Earthquake Prediction Response Plan, said that  people want two-to-one odds that the next quake is in, say, 47 minutes: "But we  aren't close to that. We can say, 'Yes, there's enough activity that we can  expect an earthquake in the range of 3.5 to 5.8 within the next three weeks.  And people say, 'Ho hum, I'm going to roll over and go back to sleep.' "  </P> <P> Heaton found "The Big One" fraught with irony.  </P> <P> "Somebody told me the budget was $10 million (sources told The Times it was  $9.5 million), and that's 10 times the budget of our office. And it struck me  that this is so indicative of Southern California society, that they're willing  to spend 10 times the money in a fictionalization of something than on the real  situation. The perfect example of Southern California denial."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is important to note that some projects which do not have to reserve any units for non-elderly disabled families under subtitle D may have disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly on their waiting lists. If a project originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families would not have to reserve any units for disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly under subtitle D, the owner would not have to admit such disabled families on the waiting list to covered section 8 units, nor would any additional non-elderly families have to be added to the waiting list for covered section 8 units. The owner would, of course, have to admit disabled families who are also elderly, and provide such families with the same preference for admission as non-disabled elderly families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, an owner who has adopted a secondary preference under section 653(a) would admit, and give a preference to, near-elderly disabled families, if there are insufficient numbers of elderly families to fill the elderly units. An owner who has adopted a secondary preference under section 653(a) would also admit families without regard to age (including disabled families that are not elderly or near-elderly) if there are not sufficient numbers of elderly families or near-elderly disabled families to fill the elderly units (pursuant to section 654). An owner who has not adopted a secondary preference under section 653(a) would admit applicants without regard to age (including disabled families that are not elderly or near-elderly) if there are not sufficient numbers of elderly families to fill the elderly units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even where there are sufficient numbers of elderly families to fill the elderly units, an owner may elect to admit disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly to covered section 8 units, and the Department encourages this voluntary policy, particularly where the need exists and the units are available. Owners who choose to admit such disabled families in excess of the statutorily-mandated minimum may do so without incurring any continuing obligation as such disabled families voluntarily move out, and without losing their project's identification as a project designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any case, when an owner's decision to provide preferences to elderly families under subtitle D would have an adverse effect on non-elderly families on the waiting list, the owner would be required to notify those families of the new policy and how this policy may affect them. The notification requirement would be triggered if the current percentage of disabled families who are neither elderly nor near-elderly exceeds the minimum required percentage, and non-elderly families on the waiting list (including those with disabilities) may be passed over for covered section 8 units for the elderly, or if the project is one of the few which will have no units set aside for such disabled families under subtitle D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Justification for Interim Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is the Department's general policy to publish a rule for notice and comment before issuing a rule for effect in accordance with the Department's own rule on rulemaking, codified at 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 provides for exceptions from that general rule where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied when prior public procedure is determined to be ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (See 24 CFR 10.1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department finds that good cause exists to publish this interim rule for effect without notice and prior public comment because the Department has determined that, with the exception of possible clarifying changes at the final rule stage, public comment will not alter the standards set forth in this interim rule for making the election of preferences provided by subtitle D, and is therefore unnecessary. The interim rule adopts the standards for the election of preferences for elderly families and reservation of units for disabled families as set forth in the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subtitle D establishes which section 8 housing projects are eligible for the election of preferences provided by subtitle D. Subtitle D establishes that the ``elderly families'' eligible to reside in covered section 8 housing projects for which the owner has made the election of preferences provided by subtitle D are those families who meet the definition of ``elderly families'' as set forth in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act, as amended by section 621 of the 1992 HCD Act. Subtitle D establishes the formula by which an owner will determine the number of units in the covered section 8 housing project that must be reserved for occupancy by disabled families who are not elderly or near-elderly. Subtitle D establishes the secondary system of preferences available to owners if there are insufficient numbers of elderly families to occupy all the units reserved for elderly families. Subtitle D also establishes the procedures to be followed if units remain vacant after the owner has elected to provide the secondary system of preferences, and the procedures to be followed concerning the order of selection within groups to whom a preference has been given. The interim rule adopts all these statutory provisions without substantive change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim rule departs from the statute in providing the types of documents that an owner must be able to produce in the event the owner is challenged on the issue of whether the owner's project is eligible for the election of preferences provided by subtitle D. The statute does not provide how the owner may support that the owner's section 8 housing project was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (i.e., seniors). The interim rule provides a list of documents which the owner may rely upon as support for determining project eligibility to make the election of preferences provided by subtitle D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department carefully considered which documents may evidence project eligibility for the subtitle D system of preferences. As discussed earlier in the preamble, because of the various types of housing projects covered by subtitle D and this interim rule, and because these housing projects were developed under several different programs and over a period of time which spans almost two decades, there is no uniform documentation at the Department which identifies the population group to be served by the project. Additionally, and again as discussed earlier in the preamble, the difficulty in identifying the population group to be served is added by the fact that the previous definition of ``elderly families'' in the 1937 Act included disabled families, and the Department's policy required all housing for the elderly (defined by age) to incorporate certain accessible features and to design a certain percentage of units to be accessible for persons with physical disabilities. The Department specifically requests comments from the public on the list of supporting documents provided in the interim rule, and this provision may change following public comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

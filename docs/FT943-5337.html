			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / 'Flexible' staff win jobs as cuts bite Full-time core staff are being increasingly displaced by 'flexible' employees, including contract workers, according to a joint survey published today by the Institute of Management and the Manpower, the employment services company. The authors said that for the third year running respondents believed the need to cut costs would be the main factor affecting next year's decisions on employment levels. The other key factors were the related requirements of increasing productivity and flexibility. For the majority of employers, flexible working was now essential. Eighty-one per cent of respondents used temporary workers, 74 per cent used part - timers and 70 per cent contracted out non-core operations. More recent forms of flexible working were less well established: only one in five respondents used teleworkers or home workers. Few employers predicted a return to traditional patterns of full-time core employment. The trend to contracting-out continued, with two-thirds of large employers expecting to contract-out more work in the next year, particularly in facilities management, driving-distribution and data preparation. Among remaining core staff, work patterns would also continue to change, with increases in part-time working and work-sharing. The only departure from trends noted in previous years was in the use of older workers. In previous surveys, this was the least-favoured type of employee. Three-quarters of the 186 respondents in this year's survey, all of which are members of the Institute of Management, said that greater use of older workers and of flexible retirement were top priorities. The authors said the reasons for the shift were unclear but 'employers may only now be realising that they have lost valuable experience and skills through focusing redundancy programmes on older workers'.

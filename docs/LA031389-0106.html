			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CHICAGO MAYOR REFUSES TO ENDORSE  </P> <P> Lame-duck Mayor Eugene Sawyer today refused to endorse a candidate in next  month's mayoral election, despite pressure from black leaders to throw his  support behind third-party hopeful Timothy Evans.  </P> <P> "After careful consideration, I have decided not to endorse any candidate,"  Sawyer said.  </P> <P> Sawyer lost the Feb. 28 Democratic primary to Richard M. Daley, the son of  Richard J. Daley, the legendary political boss who ran City Hall for 22 years.  Evans, a black alderman, bypassed the primary to run as an independent in the  April 4 general election and will face white candidates Daley and Edward  Vrdolyak, 51, the Republican nominee.  </P></p>

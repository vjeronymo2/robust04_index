			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Negotiations Should Be Held Toward Achieving </F> the Return of the Yomitan Airfield Within This Year"]    [Text] A plan is taking shape for the return of the Yomitan  Auxiliary Airfield [YAA] used by U.S. military forces. This  return is strongly demanded by local residents, particularly the  residents of Yomitan village, where the YAA is located.    This issue was taken up for discussion at a meeting between  the visiting Frank Wisner, U.S. under secretary of defense [for  policy], and Shigeru Hatakeyama, Japanese Defense Agency vice  minister. During the meeting, Wisner reportedly indicated the  United States' intention to return the YAA as early as this  year, saying: "In the near future, certain progress is expected  to be made in talks (on the return)."    Ichiro Yoneyama, Defense Facilities Administration Agency  [DFAA] director general, visited the United States in late  February in a bid to settle issues concerning the U.S. military  bases in Okinawa. As for the return of the YAA, a U.S.  Government official told Yoneyama that "we will study the  possibility of returning it." Thus, the United States appears  to be studying details of the plan for its return.    Yomitan villagers are pleased wholeheartedly by the report  that the YAA may be returned as early as this year, and all the  more so because they have earnestly called for its return.  Yomitan village Mayor Tokushin Yamaguchi said: "I have waited  for this day. I have a lump in my throat all the more so  because the struggle for the return has been hard." The  feelings of the local people are completely understandable.    However, it does not seem that a "return within this year"  has become definite. Japanese Foreign Ministry and DFAA  officials have denied the possibility of the return within this  year, explaining that the United States merely said that among  the three plans presently under consideration (the return of the  Naha naval port, the transfer of functions and the return of the  YAA, and the cancellation of live-fire exercises across  Prefectural Highway 104), "the return of the YAA may be  possible." On the contrary, a senior DFAA official said that  the possibility of its being returned within this year is "very  low."    It appears premature to be pleased by the report. However,  judging from Wisner's remarks after the U.S. Government  indicated its views to Yoneyama, it is certain that the United  States is studying in an in-depth manner the details of the plan  to return the YAA.    Prior to the Wisner-Hatakeyama talks, a ministerial-level  meeting of the Japanese-U.S. Security Consultative Committee was  held and was attended by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Defense  Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi, U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher, Under Secretary of Defense Frank Wisner, and  other officials. A statement saying that the retrenchment and  consolidation of U.S. military bases on Okinawa will continue to  be discussed was included in the joint communique released after  the meeting. The meeting was aimed at confirming that the  Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is still playing an important role.  It is believed that Japan and the United States are currently  discussing intensively the retrenchment and consolidation of  U.S. military bases on Okinawa because Aichi during the meeting  touched on the return of the Naha naval port and the two other  plans.    U.S. military bases on Okinawa were built during the cold  war  era as frontline strongholds of the West. However, the global  situation has changed greatly in these 50 years after the last  war. The cold war between the East and West has ended, and the  Japanese-U.S. relationship has also changed. Above all, Japan's  international status has improved. In spite of this, extensive  bases of foreign military forces are located on Okinawa, which  is part of Japan, thus obstructing economic development and  becoming great a impediment to the people's livelihood. We  cannot ignore such a situation any longer. That is why the DFAA  director general himself visited the United States to settle the  return of the Naha naval port and the two other issues.    Efforts must be made so that Yomitan villagers' and Okinawan  residents' elation will not be in vain. The government should  strongly urge the U.S. Government to return its bases, including  the YAA, at an early date to meet the demands of Okinawa's  residents.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Syndicated Ecu8bn loan sought to support krona SWEDEN plans to launch an Ecu8bn syndicated loan in the international credit market as part of the Ecu16bn financing being used to help support the krona in the foreign exchange markets. The Swedish currency came under pressure earlier this week after Finland cut the markka's link with the Ecu, allowing it to float against other currencies. Sweden was hit by a sudden outflow of capital, and the Riksbank, the country's central bank, was forced to pushed its marginal lending rate up to 75 per cent, from 24 per cent, to defend the Swedish currency. The Riksbank said it would add foreign currency worth up to Ecu16bn to its foreign exchange reserves, using borrowings made on its own behalf and on the part of the National Debt Office. The Ecu8bn syndicated loan, being co-ordinated by JP Morgan, constitutes half this borrowing. The remainder of the Ecu16bn earmarked for supporting the krona has been raised already. The National Debt Office said it has drawn on US and Euro-commercial paper programmes amounting to Dollars 5bn and two standby credit facilities totalling Dollars 3.4bn, while the Riksbank has drawn on existing agreements with other central banks.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Bonds: SmithKline Beecham taps Euromarket for first time SMITHKLINE Beecham, the drugs company, made its debut Eurobond offering yesterday, three years after SmithKline Beckman of the US merged with Beecham of the UK. The company tapped the bond market in order to diversify its sources of funding and extend the maturity profile of its debt, according to Mr Stephen Crompton, director of treasury operations. Most of the company's funding has been concentrated in the US commercial paper market, where its Dollars 1.5bn programme is used actively. The CDollars 125m, five-year deal, arranged by Merrill Lynch, was swapped into floating-rate US dollars at a level below the London interbank offered rate. The deal was launched late in the day to gauge the extent of retail demand. Dealers said the 9 1/2 per cent coupon would be attractive to some retail investors but that demand remained subdued. Merrill Lynch underwrote the whole deal, assembling only a selling group. The deal was bid at 100.05, above the fixed reoffer level of 99.75, against a rallying Canadian government bond market. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs raised funds for its derivatives trading subsidiary, GS Financial Products, using an unusual asset-backed structure. The Y30bn issue, backed by securities and options, was over-collateralised in order to achieve a triple-A rating. The structure of the deal - placed mainly in Asia - allows Goldman to remove assets from its balance sheet and reduce the amount of capital which it has to hold. In the equity-linked sector, Onward Kashiyama, the Japanese clothing manufacturer, launched a Dollars 200m four-year deal which was bid at 98 1/2 , below its par issue price but well within 2 1/4 point fees. Conditions in the equity warrants market have been further depressed this week by the fall in the Nikkei stock index below 20,000 points. Many warrants were already trading so far out of the money that the decline had little further effect on depressed prices. Volume in the secondary markets has sunk to an extremely low level, and the calendar for new issues is thin. However, any improvements in market conditions would boost the flow of new paper, since many Japanese companies would welcome the chance to refinance equity-linked deals.</p>

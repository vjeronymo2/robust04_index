			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DUTCH COMPANY TO BUY A&amp;M RECORDS  </P> <P> The PolyGram BV unit of Dutch-based NV Philips has agreed to acquire A&amp;M  Records, owned by trumpet player Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss, for about $500  million, PolyGram officials said today.  </P> <P> The acquisition of A&amp;M, founded 27 years ago by Alpert and Moss, is the  latest in a long-running series of foreign buyouts of U.S. record companies.  </P> <P> PolyGram, which says it is the world's third largest music group, said it will  acquire all of A&amp;M's record operations plus its music video interests, its  Los Angeles offices, including the former Charlie Chaplin film studios, and the  A&amp;M recording studio.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Music Publishing Excluded  </P> <P> The acquisition does not include A&amp;M's music publishing interests.  </P> <P> PolyGram said the two founders of A&amp;M and its president, Gil Friesen, will  continue their day-to-day roles at the company after the buyout.  </P> <P> "We are not seeing the demise of the independent record company, rather the  emergence of a new brand of independent," said David Fine, PolyGram's  president. He said the deal will give A&amp;M "the resources and marketing  infrastructure of a major worldwide group."  </P> <P> At a news conference, Fine declined to state a precise price for the buyout but  said speculation that it was about $500 million "is in the ballpark." A&amp;M  had sales of about $300 million last year.  </P> <P> A&amp;M, one of the last privately held major labels, has a talent roster that  includes Janet Jackson, Sting, Toni Childs, Joe Jackson, Al Green and Brenda  Russell.  </P> <P> Alpert and Moss, who used their initials to name the company, founded it in  1962 in the garage of Alpert's home in a Los Angeles suburb.  </P> <P> Alpert told reporters that he was "excited about this situation" and that it  would give A&amp;M "more visibility and more muscle" competing for new talent.  </P> <P> "I think it's the right move at the right time," he said.  </P> <P> PolyGram has been interested in expanding in the United States, Fine said.  Earlier this year it acquired Island Records Ltd., which specializes in rap and  reggae music, for an estimated $300 million.  </P> <P> PolyGram already distributes A&amp;M records in Europe; RCA records is the  label's American distributor.  </P> <P> PolyGram, 90% owned by Dutch electronics giant NV Philips, bought Island  Records in August for around $300 million. PolyGram's artists include Bon Jovi,  Fine Young Cannibals, U2, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Luciano Pavarotti.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Music: PolyGram offers about $500 million for company co-founded by trumpeter  Herb Alpert.  </P></p>

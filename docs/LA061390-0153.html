			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 'MAIL-ORDER BRIDES' OUTLAWED  </P> <P> President Corazon Aquino today signed a bill banning the "pernicious trade" in  mail-order brides, which she said insults national pride and breaks the hearts  of young women and their families.  </P> <P> Aquino hailed the new law's prohibition of the "commerce in women under the  guise of legitimate marriage."  </P> <P> The measure outlaws the "solicitation or inducement" of Filipino women to  become members of any club or association whose objective is to match women for  marriage to foreign nationals -- either on a mail-order basis or through  personal introductions for a fee.  </P> <P> Sen. Ernesto Maceda, sponsor of the new law, said he was spurred to action by  the "alarming rate" of battered Filipino wives married to foreign nationals  through the mail-order bride business.  </P> <P> Any foreigner convicted under the new law faces the same fine and jail time,  plus deportation.  </P></p>

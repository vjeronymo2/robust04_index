			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUILDER, NEIGHBORS TO DISCUSS CARWASH  </P> <P> A developer who wants to tear down a popular Studio City carwash and gas  station to make way for a mini-mall, setting off a clash with neighbors who  want it declared a cultural monument, said Friday he will meet with community  leaders in hopes of negotiating a compromise.  </P> <P> Builder Ira Smedra will discuss changes to his proposed $15-million, two-story  shopping center with representatives of five community groups, a spokesman for  his company said. After the private meeting on Tuesday afternoon, local  residents will gather to discuss Smedra's offer, neighborhood leaders said.  </P> <P> Smedra's proposal to demolish the carwash and gas station at Ventura and Laurel  Canyon boulevards, which dates back to 1929, has prompted Studio City  residents, who oppose construction of the mini-mall, to demand that Los Angeles  officials declare the site a cultural landmark.  </P> <P> In addition to honoring the role of the automobile in the development of the  San Fernando Valley, such a designation would preserve a unique 1950s-era  structure topped by a tower of 55-foot-tall boomerang-shaped steel beams,  residents contend.  </P></p>

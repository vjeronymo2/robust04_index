			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MICHELLE SHOCKED'S DANCE-HAPPY REVOLUTION  </P> <P> Like Dylan when he "went electric" in '65, Michelle Shocked has alienated a  number of fans and critics with her switch from folk-based songs to the  seemingly less confrontational jump-blues-flavored music on her current  "Captain Swing" album. The foment has been such that Shocked evidently thinks  it necessary to justify the switch during her shows.  </P> <P> At the Coach House on Tuesday the slight, impish singer wryly asserted that  "political correctness has been a serious social disease for the last several  years. . . . Don't make the mistakes I did." She went on to cite a cure,  quoting radical forebear Emma Goldman: "What good's a revolution if I can't  dance?"  </P> <P> Shocked's flat-out wonderful, dance-happy music needed no explication: The  wild, unfettered spirit of the singer and her six-piece Captain Swing Revue  conveyed all the liberation one could ask for. Her voice is far from naturally  suited to the rigors of a horn-blaring outfit, but, pushing its limitations,  she communicated the crucial life and emotion often missed by more skilled  singers.  </P> <P> Though sometimes awash in the band's anarchic-but-tight musical melee, her  lyrics remained politically incisive, and evocative of the byways of American  life. Coupled with the still-potent solo folk finesse evidenced on the  haunting, fragile reminiscence "Memories of East Texas," the "new" Shocked  remains one of the best things to happen to American music in years.  </P> <P> Shocked also appears tonight at the Bacchanal in San Diego, Friday at the  Ventura Theatre in Ventura and Saturday at the Wiltern Theatre.

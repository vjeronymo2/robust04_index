			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / West scrambles for coherent Bosnia policy WESTERN countries scrambled for a policy direction on Bosnia yesterday after Serbs in the republic rejected last-minute attempts to persuade them to sign up to the Vance-Owen peace plan. The Bosnian Serb assembly announced at dawn yesterday that it would reject the plan to divide Bosnia into 10 ethnic provinces despite the certainty of stepped-up sanctions on the last two republics left in Yugoslavia, namely Serbia and Montenegro. The self-styled assembly rejected the plan despite an appeal from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and his Montenegrin and Yugoslav counterparts. The message warned the deputies gathered in the Bosnian frontier town of Bijelina that they had 'no right to endanger 10m citizens of Yugoslavia because of. . . some minor points'. The refusal meant new United Nations sanctions took affect against Serbia and Montenegro. In Bonn, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, called for the reconvening of the EC-chaired Yugoslav peace conference - excluding the warring parties - for the west and its allies to agree on new moves to bring peace to the region. He put forward his proposal at talks with Lord Owen, the EC peace envoy, to discuss the rejection of the Vance-Owen peace plan by the Bosnian Serbs. 'We are not saying the peace plan has failed,' a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said last night. 'If we said that, we would have to have an alternative, and nobody sees alternatives. 'We are saying the plan is temporarily rejected. The question is how we proceed from here. We fear the atrocities will continue. The participants at the conference - excluding the warring parties - must now decide what next steps they will take.' Lord Owen flew from Bonn to Copenhagen yesterday, where he was expected to put the German proposal to the Danish government, now in the EC chair. Mr Kinkel made it clear that he believed the Serbs should be put under 'the most massive pressure' to stop their aggression. Lord Owen described the Bosnian Serb proposal to hold a referendum in Bosnia as 'perfectly obscene' in the light of their campaign of annihilation of Bosnian Moslems. Editorial comment, Page 19</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SABATINI OVERCOMES PRESSURE AND CAPRIATI;  </P> <P> TENNIS: IT'S NOT EASY, BUT ARGENTINE GETS PAST 13-YEAR-OLD IN THE FLORIDA  FINAL, 6-4, 7-5.  </P> <P> Jennifer Capriati is only 13, but on Sunday she managed to put all the pressure  on Gabriela Sabatini.  </P> <P> Sabatini was up to it, scoring a 6-4, 7-5 victory to win the Virginia Slims of  Florida tournament, but she didn't seem to enjoy it.  </P> <P> "I had to be strong mentally to play against all the pressure I had to face  today," Sabatini said. "I had to play my best tennis. I had to concentrate and  play smart.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to finish the match and get out of this match today."  </P> <P> Capriati, playing in her first professional tournament, rolled through five  matches to reach the final, but couldn't get past the third-ranked women's  player in the world.  </P> <P> Not that it bothered her much.  </P> <P> "I thought this week was one of the greatest weeks in my life," Capriati said.  "My first pro tournament and I got to the finals. I'm just so excited that I  got this far."  </P> <P> Sabatini won $70,000, while Capriati, who turns 14 later this month, won  $28,000 as the youngest player to reach a major pro tournament final in the  Open era that began in 1968.  </P> <P> Unlike in her previous matches, Capriati couldn't come up with the winners when  she needed them the most. Down a break of service, 3-2, in the first set,  Capriati could only trade games with the stronger, more experienced Sabatini.  </P> <P> With the Argentine on the brink of taking the first set at 5-4, Capriati was up  love-30 -- two points from evening the set.  </P> <P> But Sabatini held off the spirited Capriati and nailed down the set.  </P> <P> It was more of the same in the second set. Capriati went up, 4-2, breaking  Sabatini at love, but she couldn't hold it. Sabatini broke right back and then  held for 4-4.  </P> <P> At 5-5, Sabatini broke the youngster's serve to take a 6-5 lead before serving  out the match.  </P> <P> Capriati had a break point in the final game, but Sabatini fired a service  winner to foil any comeback thoughts.  </P> <P> "She kept the rallies going," Capriati said. "She kept hitting those  unbelievable dropshots . . . I think I got a little impatient."  </P></p>

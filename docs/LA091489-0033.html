			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: HOW TO REDUCE THE INTAKE OF FAT AND CHOLESTEROL FOR  HEALTH'S SAKE  </P> <P> The influence of cholesterol on American health has been a cornerstone of  scientific research in recent years. In fact, when the news began to spread  that the waxy substance was a major risk factor for heart disease, consumers  responded swiftly.  </P> <P> They didn't eat it.  </P> <P> Food manufacturers had similar reactions. They began removing cholesterol from  as many food items as they possibly could. They promoted those products that  didn't contain the substance, which was now perceived as "deadly," and touted  those that could potentially offset or reduce its impact on the body.  </P> <P> As the scientific community watched, consumers ate less and less  cholesterol-filled foods, but the incidence of heart disease failed to decline.  In 1986 (the latest year for which statistics are available, according to the  American Heart Assn.), heart and blood vessel diseases killed as many as 1  million Americans -- almost as many as cancer, accidents, pneumonia, influenza  and all other causes of death combined. That same year, about 466,000 Americans  died of cancer.  </P> <P> Researchers decided to look for another culprit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Look at the Fats  </P> <P> After scrutiny of clinical and epidemiologic data, they determined that  saturated fat, which is converted by the body into cholesterol, might instead  be responsible for the death rate from heart disease. High intake of saturated  fat was linked to the high levels of cholesterol found in the bloodstreams of  Americans.  </P> <P> Because the American diet had shifted from foods rich in cholesterol to those  containing high amounts of saturated fats, such as baked goods, salad dressings  and fried fast foods, fat -- both of the saturated and unsaturated varieties --  became the prominent risk factor for heart disease. Cholesterol in food was off  the hook -- sort of.  </P> <P> In the meantime, researchers continued to study the overall effects of high  blood cholesterol levels on other diseases. They speculated that -- although  not quite sure how -- cholesterol might contribute to another deadly American  affliction -- cancer.  </P> <P> Their findings give consumers another reason to put cholesterol back on  America's most "un" wanted list.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contributors to Tumors  </P> <P> Although both fat and cholesterol have always been suspected as contributors to  tumor formation in certain forms of cancer, such as colon, breast, prostate and  endometrium, a Northern California research group has confirmed it. Excessive  blood cholesterol does indeed have a role in triggering two of the most deadly  tumors found in U.S. cancer victims -- colorectal and pancreatic, they claim.  </P> <P> According to recent article in the journal Science, geneticists at UC Berkeley  identified a type of chemical, the ras oncogene, which has a dual, but  potentially dangerous function: While it is crucial to the formation of  cholesterol, which the body manufacturers by itself for proper cell  functioning, it is also necessary for maintaining a gene that triggers tumor  development in the pancreas, colon and rectum.  </P> <P> Reports of this type tend to support the advice from health organizations,  which encourages Americans to limit intake of foods that are high in fat and  cholesterol and to increase intake of those -- such as fiber -- that have a  protective benefit.  </P> <P> It is a goal that is easily accomplished by replacing high-fat dairy products  and meats in the daily diet with low-fat and lean varieties, including fish or  skinless poultry. Substituting fresh fruits and vegetables such as those that  are rich in vitamins A and C (dark green vegetables, red, yellow and orange  fruits and vegetables) for baked and fried goods, also may reduce risk,  according to the National Cancer Institute.  </P> <P> ONION HARVEST MEDLEY  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds sweet Spanish onions  </P> <P> 3 medium tomatoes, quartered  </P> <P> 3 medium zucchini, cut in 1-inch pieces  </P> <P> 1/4 cup chopped basil leaves or 1 teaspoon dried  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons oil  </P> <P> Peel and cut onions into wedges.

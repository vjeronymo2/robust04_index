			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Letter: In charming company Sir, I can't see how Brian McNamara (Letters, March 2) can possibly object to the FT calling Brian Mulroney an 'Irish charmer'. A stereotype it may be, but the example of other Irish politicians from around the world - Ulster's Ian Paisley, Australia's Paul Keating, the late Robert 'Piggy' Muldoon of New Zealand - surely testify to its validity.

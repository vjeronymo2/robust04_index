			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Further 207 jobs shed at Swans A further 207 job losses were yesterday announced at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, Chris Tighe writes. The redundancies affect workers laid off since May 31. The receivers injected a new urgency to the struggle to find a buyer for the company by insisting that unless Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie - the sole prospective bidder for the yard as a going concern - starts paying the Pounds 200,000-a-month wage bill of the technical and design team by the end of August, the team's 100 members will also be made redundant. Price Waterhouse says talks with CMN have not yet yielded a deal. Mr Fred Henderson of CMN insisted yesterday that the French company had an 'understanding' with the receivers, and that a deal hinged on the Ministry of Defence agreeing to CMN's proposal to take on the contract for Swans' last frigate, which is scheduled for completion in November, and sub-contract it to the receiver.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, June 28 (MENA) -- The PLO Cultural Department  here has been closed and its headquarters handed over to the  owners. The closure came in implementation of PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat's decision to shut down all the organization's  departments in the Tunisian capital except the political one.    Personnel will move to the self-rule area of Gaza and  Jericho  to start their mission there within the context of the  Palestinian autonomy.</p>

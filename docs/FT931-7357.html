			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Crown Agents to buy food for Russia BRITAIN's Crown Agents have been appointed by Japan's Foreign Ministry to procure food for distribution in Russia as part of Japan's first emergency humanitarian aid package to former Soviet republics totalling Dollars 100m (Pounds 70.4m), David Dodwell writes. Half the Dollars 100m has been earmarked for Russia, of which Dollars 25m will be medicine and medical supplies distributed by the Japan Red Cross. The Crown Agents are to procure about Dollars 25m-worth of food to be used in 'monetisation programmes' in Russia, mostly in target cities such as Irkutsk and Khabarovsk in the far east of the country. Funds will also go to Yuzhino-Sakhalinsk, a city in the disputed territory of the Kurile Islands. Under these programmes, consumers will buy food at below-market prices, with the sales proceeds being used for under-privileged groups in Russia. The Crown Agents were last year involved in a similar EC-funded scheme, under which food aid worth Ecu1.2bn (Pounds 990m) was distributed in Moscow and St Petersburg.</p>

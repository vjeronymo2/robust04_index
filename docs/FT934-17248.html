			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bouygues leads paging network consortium BOUYGUES, the French construction and engineering group, said yesterday that it had been selected to head a consortium to run a new network of electronic paging services. The consortium, called Omnicom, plans to be operational in the Paris region by the end of 1994 and nationwide by the end of 1998. It will enter an increasingly competitive market. In addition to three existing players, the government has authorised the telecommunications groups Cofira and France Telecom to establish paging systems. The announcement followed comments by Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister, that the government is also considering the creation of a third cellular telephone operator. The two existing operators - France Telecom and SFR, a unit of Compagnie Generale des Eaux - might be given access to a broader range of wavelengths. Bouygues, which is believed to be interested in entering the cellular telephone market, will hold just under 50 per cent of Omnicom. Pacific Telesis International, a subsidiary of PacTel, the US telecoms group, will be the principal technical partner in the consortium and will hold 18 per cent of the shares. Other Omnicom partners include Societe Generale, the French bank; Preussen Elektra Telekom, a subsidiary of Veba of Germany; and Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet, a subsidiary of ABN-Amro, the Dutch bank. A spokesman for Bouygues said that the group expected strong growth in the market for electronic paging. He said that with 350,000 subscribers at present, the market was much less developed than in countries such as the US and Japan.</p>

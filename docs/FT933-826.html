Maddox has been told by Lantek Electronic that it is putting C&amp;F into administrative receivership rather than continuing to fund its losses. In selling C&amp;F and Seacoast Electric to Lantek in June, Maddox has an investment in Lantek in loan notes and various preference shares valued in Maddox's 1992 accounts at Pounds 15.1m, of which Pounds 5.63m related to the investment in C&amp;F.</p>

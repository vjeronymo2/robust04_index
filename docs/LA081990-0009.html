			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> LONG JUMPS  </P> <P> Sleek. Stretchy. Undeniably catlike. This year's jumpsuit -- a catsuit if the  pant legs are tight -- has evolved from exercise leotards, with a fit close  enough to make exercise clearly worthwhile.  </P> <P> Designed with movement in mind, jumpsuits now are shaped from technologically  advanced fabrics that mold to the body. Fall/winter colors -- curry, raisin --  are bold but not flamboyant. The look is 21st-Century modern, with not a hint  of retro about it.  </P> <P> Along with stretch, new details include hidden zippers or Velcro closures and  stirrups.  </P> <P> To vary the look, bibbed jumpsuits can be worn with dressy or sporty tops. But  in keeping with a sophisticated sportswear concept, accessories are simple -- a  wide belt and understated jewelry, all grounded, of course, with ankle boots.  BARBARA FOLEY  </P></p>

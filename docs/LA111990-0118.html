			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> MANILA OFFICIAL ESCAPES BOMBING  </P> <P> The Philippine justice secretary narrowly escaped a bomb attack on his home  early today.  </P> <P> Police said unidentified men hurled four bombs from a car at Franklin Drilon's  home in the fashionable Manila district of Greenhills, damaging his two-story  house and five other homes nearby and slightly injuring a neighbor.  </P> <P> Drilon and his family escaped unhurt.  </P> <P> "They were aimed at me because some of the bombs exploded just below the  bedroom where I was sleeping," Drilon said in a radio interview. "Perhaps this  is a message for me to go slow on the people we are investigating. I don't know  who sent this message because we are investigating so many people."  </P> <P> Drilon is in charge of prosecuting rebel soldiers linked to last December's  sixth and most serious army coup attempt against President Corazon Aquino.  </P></p>

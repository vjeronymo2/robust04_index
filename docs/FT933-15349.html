			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Howard rejects criticism of police authority reform LOCAL authorities did not have a 'monopoly of knowledge' on the way the police service should be run, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said yesterday. Mr Howard faced several interruptions as he defended government proposals for small, more businesslike police authorities to senior police officers and local authority leaders at the Association of Chief Police Officers' conference in Birmingham. Farmers, head teachers and shopkeepers all knew something about crime, Mr Howard said. Some had been victims of it and all understood the fear of it. Such people should be able to bring their knowledge to police authorities. The government, as part of a wide-ranging agenda for police reform, intends to reduce local authority representation on police authorities, with the home secretary appointing some members and authority chairs directly. Chief constables as well as local authorities have attacked the proposals, which were published in a white paper last month. Mr Robin Wendt, secretary of the Association of County Councils, told the conference that the white paper made no attempt to assess the benefits of different structures and merely asserted that the new system would be better. 'As a basis for major constitutional change, that simply will not do,' he said. Mr John Burrow, chief constable of Essex and president of ACPO, warned Mr Howard that if he did not allow a genuine dialogue on proposed changes to the police service 'you run the risk of not taking the main players with you'. There appears little likelihood of the government changing its mind over the reform of police authorities, which mirror changes elsewhere in the public sector. But Mr Howard told the conference that he had no pre-determined position on another aspect of the reforms - the Sheehy report on police pay and responsibilities - although he believed that 'if we can improve the link between performance and pay we will all be better off'. He said he would consider responses to the report until September and hoped to move forward in consultation with the police service.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Fyodor Angeli] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 20 April, TASS -- "A new meeting  of the Moldovan leadership with leaders of the breakaway  Dniester Republic is expected to be held shortly. It will be  attended by representatives from the CSCE and by the Russian  president's special envoy," Moldovan President Mircea Snegur  told the newspaper ZEMLYA I LYUDI.    "But already before that meeting," he stressed, "all the  barriers, obstructing economic relations between the left-hand  and right-hand banks of the Dniester will be eliminated."    According to Snegur, customs barriers and other control  services of the two sides will be abolished and traffic will be  reopened across the presently blocked bridges."    The president again stressed that the Moldovan parliament  would soon discuss the question of granting a special legal  status to towns and villages with a compact Gagauz population.  "After all," he noted, "nobody is encroaching upon the integrity  of the state. They merely want autonomy within Moldova. Gagauz  representatives had themselves stated that they could not  imagine their existence outside the Republic. The point is to  decentralise the government, to transfer some of its functions  to the local administration, and to give broader opportunities  for developing the market relations."    The Moldovan leader noted that "if the Republic shuts up in  its purely national shell, it will not get any support from the  civilised world. Moldova's prestige on the international arena  will depend on how it observes human rights, on the state of  inter-ethnic relations within the country."</p>

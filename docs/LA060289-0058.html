			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'RENEGADES' A WASTE OF SUTHERLAND, PHILLIPS  </P> <P> "Renegades" (citywide), a shamelessly contrived, ultraviolent macho fantasy,  stars Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips, who are too talented and too  successful to be wasting themselves on such trash.  </P> <P> Sutherland plays a maverick undercover Philadelphia cop who has infiltrated a  ring of jewel thieves. For absolutely no discernible reason except to further  the plot, its icily lethal ringleader (Rob Knepper), while making his escape,  steals a lance sacred to the Lakota Sioux on display as part of a gallery  exhibition of Lakota arts and crafts. This allows Phillips, a tribe member, to  team up (warily) with Sutherland in his pursuit of the bad guys.  </P> <P> David Rich's script provides for maximum bloodshed and destruction of property  and minimal common sense. Director Jack Sholder can at least be credited for  maintaining a high level of energy in deploying the film's rampant foolishness,  which includes Sutherland's miraculously rapid recovery from a gunshot wound to  his abdomen.  </P> <P> It's a real shame that Gary Farmer, the hilarious co-star of "Powwow Highway,"  is gunned down early on, because his massively humorous and sweet-natured  presence would have been a welcome comic relief.  </P> <P> As it is, the only laughs that occur in "Renegades" (rated R for extreme  violence) are in its final scene, when Phillips, not once but twice,  mispronounces "cavalry" as "calvary."

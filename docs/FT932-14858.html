			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Leading Article: Market power LAST NOVEMBER'S green paper on reforming the law on abuse of market power was welcome evidence of the UK government's intention to sharpen up competition policy. There were compelling reasons for change. The government was committed to reforming restrictive practices legislation in line with EC law. Leaving the law on abuse of market power unchanged would have been inherently contradictory - and would have left UK competition policy more obviously at odds with the rest of the Community than at present. There was also genuine concern that the present UK system was not working. It was weak on deterrence as well as slow and cumbersome. What was needed, it seemed, was what already existed at EC level: clear prohibitions, backed by substantial fines, full rights for third party redress, enforced by an agency with strong investigatory powers. The government's announcement that it intends just to tinker with the present legislation is therefore a disappointment. It has been persuaded by industry that the costs of complying with a prohibition-based system, together with the uncertainty it would create, would outweigh any benefits to the consumer. There is some merit to the uncertainty argument. The handful of European decisions and court judgments on abuse of market power underline the difficulty in drawing lessons from the application of the EC's prohibition regime. Industry is right to be concerned about the prospect of being fined for behaviour which at the time it was undertaken was believed to be legal. But the argument on the cost of compliance has been overdone. Most companies of a size to be caught by abuse of market power laws are active in Europe, and have already borne the costs of introducing sophisticated competition compliance programmes. The government's decision will leave the UK increasingly isolated in Europe. Brussels has recently indicated that in future it intends to leave run-of-the-mill competition cases to national authorities. Its condition for this exercise in subsidiarity is that EC states should adopt competition regimes based on EC rules. Most member states have already done so. Britain runs the risk of being the odd one out. This may not matter in the short term, but in the long run could affect its ability to influence other areas of Community competition policy. Along with Germany and France, Britain is used to making itself heard in Brussels on such matters as EC merger policy. That will be harder to do if it is out on a limb. Meanwhile, if the government's present approach is to be effective, the Office of Fair Trading will have to take a more pro-active role in rooting out abuses of market power. For that, it will require more than the extra powers which the government seems for the moment inclined to grant.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO 'VIETNAM' IN COLOMBIA, U.S. STRESSES  </P> <P> The White House asserted Monday that the deployment of U.S. military advisers  to Colombia will not become "another Vietnam situation" or lead to a "massive  troop buildup" that draws the United States into a shooting war overseas.  </P> <P> Acknowledging critics' concerns that American military personnel could become  involved in Colombian drug raids, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater  said that the 30 advisers are there only to provide training and will let the  Colombians do the fighting.  </P> <P> But, he said, "their orders are the same orders that our forces anywhere in the  world have and that is that they have the right to defend themselves.  </P> <P> "There is risk associated with U.S. forces there at any time," he said, adding:  "Colombia is a very dangerous place to be these days."  </P> <P> The stepped-up efforts by the United States and Colombia to stem the illegal  flow of cocaine from Colombia to U.S. drug markets has been met with an  increase in violence there. On Monday, a former mayor of Medellin, a center of  the Colombian drug trade, was assassinated by masked gunmen.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Combat Role Foreseen  </P> <P> President Bush reiterated the Administration's insistence that no combat role  is foreseen for the U.S. troops.  </P> <P> The President, who met with British Foreign Secretary John Major and reviewed  Britain's plans to provide "training and technical assistance" to Colombia,  said in a speech:  </P> <P> "There is no contemplation of the . . . use of American armed forces in any  combat role there. No U.S. military personnel will accompany host government  forces on actual field operations. Our personnel will provide training,  equipment and operational support as we have been asked to do.  </P> <P> "I will see that it works, just exactly that way," the President insisted.  </P> <P> As he has done repeatedly since he unveiled his anti-drug plan a week ago, Bush  continued in his public appearances to try to drum up support for his drug war  strategy. He used a ceremony marking the 200th anniversary of the Treasury  Department as a platform to pledge that "we are going to track every lead that  we receive from whatever source to separate the drug barons from the drug  money."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Great Involvement Possible?  </P> <P> The dispatch of the troops to advise Colombians raised questions about whether  the deployment would become a first step toward greater U.S. military  involvement in South America. Such questions were given added urgency in recent  days with the disclosure that a National Security Decision Directive signed by  Bush would allow the troops to train Colombians in areas beyond their base  camps -- a move that presumably would increase the risk that they could come  under fire.  </P> <P> Fitzwater, speaking with reporters, said:  </P> <P> "We are interested in not letting misinformation get out about this use, and  there's a lot of people who are trying to portray this as another Vietnam  situation or the beginning of a massive troop buildup and so forth."  </P> <P> He said the Administration wants "to knock down" such an impression. The bitter  U.S. military involvement in Vietnam began with the deployment of small numbers  of advisers intended to counsel Saigon's troops in their guerrilla war with the  Communist-led Viet Cong.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Expanded Military Role  </P> <P> Fitzwater also said that any expanded role for the U.S. military in the drug  fight in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia would require an additional National  Security Decision Directive -- the classified paperwork ordering the Pentagon  to act on the President's decisions.  </P> <P> The spokesman, portraying a limited role for the advisers in Columbia, said,  "My understanding is that our support is related to the operation and  maintenance of the equipment."  </P> <P> The flow of U.S. military gear to Colombia, announced in August by the White  House, is well under way, Bush suggested.  </P> <P> "Today, we've supplied over $10-million worth of equipment, 10 aircraft, five  UH-1 helicopters, an assortment of jeeps, ambulances and armor," Bush said at  the Treasury Department. "Sixteen members of the American armed forces are in  Colombia to oversee the supply operation and provide training."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Emergency Assistance  </P> <P> The supplies are being sent under a $65-million emergency assistance program in  the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. In addition, Colombia, Peru and  Bolivia would receive $261 million in military and law enforcement assistance  next year.  </P> <P> Bush also said that the United States is "working with the Colombian judiciary  to increase the physical safety of judges and other members of the judicial  system, and that includes security training as well as the delivery of armored  cars and vests and communications equipment already under way."  </P> <P> After a week of public debate over the President's plan, White House officials  were upbeat over the outcome. They expressed optimism that Democrats'  complaints that the spending is insufficient is not catching fire with the  public.  </P></p>

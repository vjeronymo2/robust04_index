Barry Corporation, located in Goldsboro, North Carolina. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR Part 400). It was formally filed on November 16, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> R.G. Barry is a manufacturer and distributor of comfort footwear (household slippers) and thermal comfort products (heat seats, scarves, back warmers, hand warmers, pocket warmers, ear muffs and bread warmers) with total sales of over $100 million (1993) and worldwide employment of 3,685 persons. The company has U.S. plants in San Angelo, Texas, Goldsboro, North Carolina, and Laredo, Texas, with operational headquarters in San Antonio, Texas. An application is pending with the FTZ Board for subzone status for warehouse/distribution activities at Barry's San Angelo plant (FTZ Docket 34&hyph;94, 59 FR 56459, 11/14/94).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> R.G. Barry's Goldsboro, North Carolina plant is located at 2201 South John Street (172,020 sq. ft. on 35 acres), some 45 miles southeast of Raleigh. The facility (65 employees) is engaged in the warehousing and distribution of R.G. Barry's footwear and comfort products. The products are generally made of domestic materials (polyester and other man-made fibers), which are cut at Barry plants in the U.S. and sent to company plants abroad to be sewn. The finished products are then shipped to Barry's U.S. distribution centers. While currently over five percent of the finished products are reexported, the company plans to increase export activity to 14 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zone procedures would exempt R.G. Barry from Customs duty payments on the foreign value involved in products that are reexported. On its domestic sales, the company would be able to defer Customs duties on the value added abroad. The application indicates that zone savings would help improve the international competitiveness of the company's domestic operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Board's regulations, a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment on the application is invited from interested parties. Submissions (original and three copies) shall be addressed to the Board's Executive Secretary at the address below. The closing period for their receipt is January 30, 1995. Rebuttal comments in response to material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted during the foregoing period may be submitted during the subsequent 15-day period (to February 13, 1995).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the application and the accompanying exhibits will be available for public inspection at each of the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Commerce District Office,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 400 W.

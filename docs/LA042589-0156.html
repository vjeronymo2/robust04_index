			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> KORENSTEIN AGREES TO DEBATE FOE IN WEST VALLEY SCHOOL BOARD RACE  </P> <P> Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein agreed today to face-to-face  debates with challenger Gerald E. Horowitz before the June 6 runoff election,  her campaign manager said.  </P> <P> Horowitz, the principal of Byrd Junior High School in Sun Valley, challenged  Korenstein to a series of five debates next month on topics such as district  finances, the ongoing contract dispute with teachers, and campus violence. But  Parke Skelton, Korenstein's campaign consultant, said the West Valley incumbent  will probably not agree to more than one or two debates and does not want a  limit on the topics to be debated.  </P> <P> Horowitz set a Wednesday deadline to arrange the details of the debate.  </P> <P> Korenstein fell 57 votes short of the 50% plus one vote majority needed to win  the April 11 primary election. She was elected in 1987 to fill the two years  remaining in former board member David Armor's term.  </P></p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Cutting down on background noise Irritating background noise can now be eliminated with the arrival of the Noisebuster from Noise Cancellation Technologies, writes Richard Rosen. The system consists of a set of light-weight headphones and a small noise analyser/sound source production unit. Microphones in the earcups of the headphones listen to external sounds. These are fed to the noise analyser. An anti-noisewave is generated by the controller as an electronic signal which is fed back to the speakers in the headphones. When the anti-noise reaches the incoming offensive noise each cancels the other out. The system is claimed to reduce noise by 50 to 90 per cent within the 20Hz to 120Hz frequency bandwidths. The Noisebuster is available for Dollars 149 (Pounds 98). Noise Cancellation Technologies: US, 203 961 0500.</p>

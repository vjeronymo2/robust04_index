			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Japan The Japanese equity market was well prepared for yesterday's dismal slew of results from the big banks. Besides, there are a couple of silver linings. One is that all the large commercial banks are now above minimum international standards of capital adequacy. By widening their lending margins as interest rates came down, the banks also generated stronger operating profits against which to help offset bad debt provisions. Whether the sector can hold on to its remarkable 25 per cent gain relative to the market since early April is another matter. The suspicion remains that banks have only recognised the tip of a bad debt iceberg. The best of the gains from wider margins have now passed. Interest rates have fallen by 2.5 percentage points since this time last year. Even allowing for a possible cut in the discount rate next month, there is surely little more to come. Meanwhile the recession appears to have spread from the epicentre of the Tokyo property market to manufacturing industry, especially small businesses in the provinces. That points to bad news to come from the regional banks. Even if yesterday's optimistic economic outlook from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development proves correct, there seems little chance of the banking sector providing much more of a boost to the Nikkei.</p>

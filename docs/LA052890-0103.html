			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP REVIEW;  </P> <P> EL TORO'S DAVID FAIR HAS NEVER MET A CHALLENGE HE DIDN'T TAKE  </P> <P> He's been known to dive out of trees like Tarzan, leap over five-foot-high  fences on a whim and hurdle the back end of pickups.  </P> <P> If there was ever a competition for crazy, spontaneous stunts, David Fair of El  Toro High School would probably win.  </P> <P> Fair demonstrates his daring in the world of track and field, where he has  performed impressively.  </P> <P> Fair, a senior 300-meter intermediate hurdler, qualified for this week's state  track and field championships by placing fourth in the Masters meet Friday. His  time of 38.46 seconds is the fastest in the county this year.  </P> <P> Most impressive, however, is the fact that until this year, Fair had never  competed in the hurdles. Last year, he competed in the 200, 400 and high jump.  </P> <P> "That's my character, pretty much," Fair said. "I got bored of the 400, so I  wanted to try something else. . . . I thought I could hurdle, but I wasn't  sure. My problem is that where other guys go over the hurdle with a set  (specific) foot, and know exactly how many steps they're going to take between  each hurdle, I'm going sometimes with my right, sometimes with my left,  sometimes with 14 steps, sometimes with 15. . . . That part of it gets  frustrating."  </P> <P> But being new to an event is nothing new to Fair. Last May, on the advice of El  Toro Coach Rick Hagin, Fair entered his first decathlon competition at Mt. San  Antonio College.  </P> <P> Though Fair had little experience with most of the 10 events, he won the  competition, scoring 5,512 points (ninth-best on the county's all-time prep  list and second-best in the state in 1989).  </P> <P> "David never pole vaulted before the Mt. SAC decathlon," said his father, Jerry  Fair. "He didn't even know (about the competition) until four days before. He  came home and said, 'Dad, can you take me to this decathlon at Mt. SAC this  weekend?' I said, 'Sure. But do you even know what events are in the  decathlon?' He said no, so we went through them all that night.  </P> <P> "We never had any dreams he would win it; it was crazy to even think about it."  </P> <P> Now, Fair is one of eight decathletes -- and the only one from California --  invited to compete in the prestigious Golden West Invitational, June 7-10 at  Cal State Sacramento. The meet brings in the top eight seniors in the nation in  each event for a four-day, all-expenses-paid trip.  </P> <P> Even though Fair has not competed in another decathlon, nor has had time to  practice the shotput, discus, javelin, etc., Golden West officials told him  that his 5,512 point total was proof enough of his talent.  </P> <P> Before the Mt. SAC meet, Fair had never tried the pole vault. He was given  about an hour to practice before the competition.  </P> <P> "He watched a couple of boys do it, and ended up going (10 feet 4 inches),"  Jerry Fair said. "He hasn't pole vaulted since then, though. He's been too busy  trying to get to the state meet in the hurdles."  </P> <P> Fair, who also holds school records in the 110 high hurdles (15.02) and the 400  (49.8), "can do anything if he puts his mind to it," Hagin said.  </P> <P> "He learns quickly and isn't afraid of anything," Hagin said. "I could see him  vaulting 14 feet in a month or two without much of a problem. That's the kind  of athlete he is."  </P> <P> Of course, he's also the kind of athlete some might describe as foolhardy.  </P> <P> "He does do strange things," Hagin said. "We were waiting for our bus after  this meet at Irvine (High School) and suddenly he just jumps out of a tree. He  does this weird thing where he falls and grabs the branches, and then says 'O,  I do that all the time.' "  </P> <P> Said Fair: "You just climb way up in this tree and jump. You let yourself fall,  and the boughs kind of catch you. You can get pretty scraped up, but I've never  really gotten hurt. . . . I'm not that crazy. I make sure I can do it first --  or at least I make sure I think I can."  </P> <P> Fair, who plays piano and guitar, won an El Toro talent show this year -- "He  sung a song he wrote about a girl who got involved with an older man and had  her heart broken," Jerry Fair said.  </P> <P> When he found out he won, Fair was so happy he sprinted out to the school  parking lot and hurdled the back end of a pickup.  </P> <P> For Fair, a fitting celebration.  </P> <P> Final meeting: In March of last year, Tim Martin, then an unheralded sophomore  at San Clemente, upset one of the top sprinters in the Southern Section not  once but three times during a nonleague meet at San Clemente.  </P> <P> The sprinters name? Erik Mitchell.  </P> <P> Before he moved to Los Alamitos with his family last June, Mitchell was a  football and track standout at Mayfair High in Lakewood. At Mayfair, Mitchell  won the 2-A title in the 100 and 200.  </P> <P> Since moving across the county line, Mitchell has given Martin -- the county's  fastest boy last year -- his share of challenges. The two have gone back and  forth all season, including Friday night at the Southern Section Masters meet.  There, Martin got the better of Mitchell in the 100, but just barely -- Martin  was third in 10.70, Mitchell was fourth in 10.71. Later, Mitchell outran Martin  in the 200, placing second to Martin's sixth, 21.34 to 21.80.  </P> <P> This weekend at the state championships, the two will have one last showdown.  Mitchell, a Colorado-bound senior, and Martin, a junior, will run against each  other in the 100 if both make it through Friday night's qualifying heats.  (Mitchell also will run the 200, but Martin did not advance in that event).  </P> <P> Asked if it is important to finish the season as the county's fastest boy, both  were nonchalant.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter to me; I just want to win," Martin said. "I don't want to be  making any enemies."  </P> <P> Said Mitchell: "Nah, it doesn't matter. I don't really think about it."  </P> <P> Record-bound? University's Tanja Brix and Katella's Martha Pinto both ran  personal bests in the girls' 3,200 meters at the Masters meet Friday.  </P> <P> Brix, who led the county last year with a time of 10:54.64, finished third in  10:50.10. Pinto, whose previous best was 10:55, took fifth in 10:51.29.  </P> <P> Brix, a sophomore, and Pinto, a junior, are the only county girls to run under  11 minutes in the 3,200 since Buffy Rabbitt, now at UC Irvine, ran 10:42.16  while at Newport Harbor High in 1986. Only 25 county girls have broken the  11-minute barrier.  </P> <P> Now, with the state meet -- and one of the fastest 3,200 meter fields in years  -- coming their way Saturday, Brix and Pinto will have an opportunity to run  even faster.  </P> <P> Though breaking one of the oldest county records -- 10:29.03, set by  University's Teresa Barrios in 1982 -- may have to wait a few more years,  Orange County girls' distance running may be returning to the high level of  years past.  </P> <P> Bad timing: A crew from ESPN's Scholastic Sports America came to SeaCliff  Tennis Club in Huntington Beach Saturday to film what turned out to be Jon  Leach's final high school match.  </P> <P> Leach, a junior at Laguna Beach, lost to Ari Nathan of Brentwood, 5-7, 6-3,  7-5, in the semifinals of the Southern Section singles tournament. He plans to  graduate from Laguna Beach in January and play for his father, Dick, at USC.  </P> <P> His departure leaves a void, in more ways than one, for Laguna Beach Coach Bob  Walton.  </P> <P> In his three seasons, Leach was one of the county's most dominant players. This  season, he won 63 consecutive sets in team play as Laguna Beach advanced to the  semifinals of the 3-A playoffs.  </P> <P> It will be the first time there will be no Leach for Walton to coach. He  coached Jon for three seasons, sister Mindy for four and was the junior varsity  coach when older brother, Rick, was playing for the Artists.  </P> <P> "It's going to be weird for me next year," Walton said. "I'm probably going to  write 'Leach' into the lineup card automatically. And there won't be a Leach  (playing)."  </P> <P> Walton and the rest of the country can watch Leach play as a high-schooler one  last time when ESPN airs the segment some time in the fall.  </P> <P> Hoop horizons: Dave Zirkle, director of the Orange Holiday basketball  tournament, has expanded the field of one of the county's top tournaments to  include a Canadian team and two schools from Washington.  </P> <P> Bev Facey Composite, which won the provincial title of Alberta, has entered the  tournament scheduled for Dec. 26-29 in Chapman College's Hutton Sports Center.  Sammamish High of Seattle, the runner-up in Washington's state tournament, is  also entered along with Kent Merdian of Kent, Wash.  </P> <P> Zirkle has also added San Francisco Archbishop Riordan, runner-up to Mater Dei  in the State Division I tournament, and San Diego Lincoln Prep, the 3-A  division champion in San Diego.  </P> <P> State champion Mater Dei and Division IV champion Santa Clara of Oxnard are the  co-favorites.  </P> <P> Orange County high school track and field programs will be the chief  beneficiary of proceeds raised by the Newport 5K Walk &amp; Run, Sunday at 8  a.m. All proceeds from the race, which starts at the intersection of Jamboree  Boulevard and Campus Drive in Newport Beach, will go toward sponsoring  underprivileged athletes, funding summer training programs and providing  athletic equipment and scholarships for running camps.

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Chambers chase quality standards - In a Nutshell Three UK chambers of commerce have had their quality control procedures approved by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce as a further step in the association's programme to improve services to members. Chambers in Birmingham, Kirklees and Norwich have been approved and a further 20 should reach this stage by the end of the year. Approval by the association's own inspectors is intended to be the first stage in a process leading to accreditation under the British Standard Institution's quality control standard, BS 5750. Chambers must meet minimum standards of export assistance, business information, education and training.</p>

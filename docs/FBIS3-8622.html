The talks were conducted by  Hasan Muratovic, Bosnia-Herzegovina minister without portfolio,  who came from the airport a few minutes ago and made the  following statement for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr.  Muratovic,  two days ago you had a meeting at which you agreed to resume the  talks today. What was agreed today?    [Muratovic] Today we agreed something that we could not do  last time. In brief, we agreed to sign an agreement by Tuesday.  The details of it, according to our guidelines and minutes from  the meeting, will be worked out by UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces]. The details include maps showing roads.    We have agreed to open up the Butmir-Dobrinja road--which  will run across the airport runway--for our use, and the  Lukavica-Ilidza road--which will also run across the airport  runway--for use by the Serbian side. The roads will cut across  each other at one point. We have also agreed to open up the  Sarajevo-Visoko road via Vogosca, and to open the Grbavica  bridge for civilians.    All this will be opened up simultaneously on Saturday, 18  March, if the agreement is signed, which I no longer doubt will  happen. Only UNPROFOR can now make some problems in this  respect, as the roads run across the airport runway. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

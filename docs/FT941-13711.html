Prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa hopes to persuade the LDP to form a joint panel of the upper and lower houses of parliament to agree to a watered down version of his four reform bills. He has given himself until the end of the parliamentary session on January 29 to get the bills through. Mr Hosokawa said he would still attend the US-Japan summit in Washington on February 11, to conclude talks on opening Japan's market to imports. Three Japanese vice-ministers meet their US counterparts in Washington today for critical talks on the bilateral 'framework' trade agreement.

Delegations from the parliaments of the Council's 32 member states will also debate plans for new applicants after receiving applications from Russia, Ukraine, Albania, Belarus, Croatia, Latvia, the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, and Moldova. Entry depends on candidates passing the test of free and fair elections and showing respect for human rights. Greeks debate Macedonia Andreas Papandreou, Greece's prime minister, opens a debate in parliament on the dispute with the neighbouring former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia over its choice of name.

It will be topped by healthcare reform, but also includes anti-crime initiatives, welfare reform and worker retraining. Algerian reconciliation The ruling High Council has called a 'national conference of reconciliation' in Algiers to try to end an increasingly bloody conflict which has left more than 3,000 dead. The Council has been running the country since the cancellation in January 1992 of elections that the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. Most opposition groups will boycott the conference. French Communist conference The main task at the party's 28th congress (to Jan 29) is to chose a successor to chairman Georges Marchais, 73.

Mr Ahern is under pressure to reduce income tax and employers' social insurance contributions. Specific job-creation measures are also expected.

Its next task is to formulate concrete strategies, especially on trade and investment. Delegates will also contemplate the economic implications of majority rule in South Africa after April 27 and the likelihood that South Africa will become its 11th member.

Transport is likely to be badly hit and stoppages will probably be widespread. Bank of France meets The newly independent Bank of France holds a council meeting to set the bank's monetary policy targets for the current year. Unfortunately, the meeting could not come at a more difficult time. France, according to the Balladur government, is creeping out of recession, but economic indicators for the past few months - and forecasts for the coming year - are very mixed. This will make the task of setting targets more than usually complicated. Lithuanian president Lithuanian president Algirdas Brazauskas is to meet European Commission president Jacques Delors in Brussels.

The Culture Ministry has accused him of adding artefacts looted from graves on Crete to his private collection of antiquities. Zambian budget Finance minister Ronald Penza presents his 1994 budget against a deepening crisis. Last year's budget promised tight controls on spending, big reductions in the money supply, and 10 per cent inflation by the end of 1993.

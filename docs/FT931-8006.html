			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Single Market Watch: Europe turns inward - and falls behind / The fruits of the single European market are starting to look less healthy IS Europe starting to seize up again? Fears during the last decade that Europe was suffering a damaging loss of international competitiveness were dissipated during the EC's mini-economic boom of the late 1980s, partly engendered by the run-up to the single market. With the European Community this year facing a re-run of the 1981-1982 recession, and the Maastricht integration process bedevilled by question-marks, Europessimism seems to be coming back into fashion. Backing up the new mood, a discussion paper from the London-based Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) concludes that the economic effect of integration has been far less positive than often argued. Further, it has led to an inward-looking and protectionist trend in the EC's international trade policy. This appears to have contributed to a technological lag between the Community and other parts of the world. The study's conclusions are borne out by figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showing declines in the export market shares of leading EC economies in recent years - though this is a problem shared by virtually the entire industrialised world. The study's author, Prof Alan Winters of Birmingham University, denies being a 'Eurosceptic'. He backs the single market programme as a way of pressing forward with internal market liberalisation started with the Treaty of Rome in 1957. But, he says, he produced his report 'to prick the balloon of complacency' about the achievements of European integration. The existence of the EC has coincided with above-average growth of its members' economies, with the 12-member Community's share of world GDP increasing from 22.5 per cent in 1965 to 23.5 per cent in 1989, Prof Winters writes. However, he adds that EC unemployment has been persistently high. In addition, the Community has been less able to control inflation and unit labour costs during the past decade than important competitors, and has fallen behind in high technology compared with the US and Japan. Among the EC's chief drawbacks, Prof Winters points to the EC's common agricultural policy. This has brought protectionism to trade since the early 1960s, making the EC a net agricultural exporter rather than a net importer. The subsidies flowing to EC producers have caused EC consumers annual income losses of 1.5 per cent of GDP. In terms of overall trade flows, Prof Winters believes EC members' success in increasing trade among each other has detracted attention from falling ratios for trade with the rest of the world. This has coincided with restrictive EC trade policies to protect sectors such as motor vehicles, consumer electronics and office machinery. The Community suffers from 'a tendency to look backwards and preserve itself from change, rather than to embrace change', Prof Winters remarks. This trend is illustrated by the rising proportion of EC GDP devoted to industry subsidies. 'Some subsidies are given to emerging sectors such as the Airbus, but the bulk of them go to resisting change in traditional sectors. 'The use of protection to avoid industrial restructuring has almost certainly contributed to Europe's falling behind the US and Japan in high-tech goods.' Prof Winters cites figures showing that the fall in the EC's share of world engineering markets since 1970 has been concentrated in more sophisticated products. In less technologically demanding areas of engineering, the EC's share of world trade has increased. 'We're doing OK relative to India, but not so good compared with Korea,' Prof Winters says. He complains about the protective bias of EC trade arrangements with central and eastern Europe enshrined in the 'Europe agreements' completed last year with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland. Citing restrictions on 'sensitive' east European exports in areas such as steel and chemicals, Prof Winters says: 'A noble concern for the welfare of our brothers in Europe was subverted by entrenched economic interests.' Moreover, the accords are geared in the long run to giving the EC preferential access to east European markets rather than the other way around. 'The Europe agreements seem intent on obtaining markets and production facilities in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, on managing access to EC markets and, above all, on avoiding serious levels of migration.' Prof Winters says the European Community has reduced protectionist pressures in some areas by giving national manufacturers the opportunity of a larger internal market. But 'once protectionism is introduced, it is spread around more and more difficult to remove.' When high interest rates and recession are spreading economic gloom around the Community, removing these sources of Euro-protectionism will be especially difficult. Prof Winters' study suggests, however, that the EC should be preparing a new trade policy agenda for the time when growth starts to edge up again. CEPR: 25-28 Old Burlington Street, London W1X 1LB.

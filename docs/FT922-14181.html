			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Tokyo's vicious circle It is hard to believe that, as recently as 1987, the market capitalisation of NTT was greater than that of the entire German stock market. By yesterday, the Nikkei had fallen 23 per cent since the start of the year and was still apparently without a floor. The abiding problem is bank stocks, which fell 7 per cent yesterday alone. Even so, they are trading at a slight premium to the market multiple compared with a traditional discount of some 20 per cent. That suggests the sector's correction has further to go, especially since the banks have still to sort out the bad debt problems created by falling property values. After adjustment for accounting differences, export-related sectors like electricals look cheap compared to their overseas equivalents. Unfortunately, worries about the financial sector look like continuing to undermine confidence in the market as a whole, not least because the banks may yet have to sell industrial company shares to rebuild core capital after property loan losses. Ultimately, it looks as though the Japanese authorities will have to find a way of supporting the banks and arresting property deflation. The banks are already turning to subordinated debt from life insurance companies to offset the effect of falling share prices on their Tier 2 capital. This compounds the problem, as the insurers sell bank shares to finance the loans. It has also eaten into the insurers' appetite for US Treasury securities, contributing to the 50 basis point rise in the long bond yield this year. It must be a source of concern to governments with deficits to finance that the world's largest saver is developing such claims on its own resources.</p>

The author  obtained the results in a number of experiments using one  experimental setup and identical conditions. This was done to  eliminate the effect of technical perturbations of the  resonator. The qualitative difference in the behavior of the  free generation of chromium and neodymium ions suggests a  physical mechanism which causes nonattenuating radiation  pulsations in lasers using ions with an external working shell  linked with the spallation of the working levels of the ions in  their own radiation field. It is unambiguously found that  chromium ion lasers, in contrast to neodymium ion lasers, have a  distinct physical mechanism which causes nonattenuating  pulsation of radiation intensity. Any mechanism associated with  spatial interaction of modes in the active medium is ruled out.  The difference in the lasers is ascribed to the great difference  in the structure of the ions' working levels. The electric field  of the laser radiation which arises in the active medium will  affect only chromium ions, leading to further spallation of the  working levels due to the dynamic Stark effect. When the field  in the active medium is spatially inhomogeneous, a standing wave  is formed whose spatial structure is altered during generation.  The Stark effect leads to modulation of intensity over time and  nonattenuating pulsations in intensity. When the spatial  inhomogeneity of the field in the active medium is smoothed,  this intensity modulation disappears. This conclusion was  verified experimentally using titanium lasers. It may also be  concluded that free generation of all rare earth ions in various  media should occur in quasi-stationary mode without the need to  smooth the spatial inhomogeneity of the field in the active  medium.

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Tanabu to debate rice issue with EC MR Masami Tanabu, Japan's agriculture minister, plans to visit Brussels next week to argue the country's case that rice should be excluded from trade liberalisation under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The Japanese government has said 'flexibility' will be shown in handling the issue of rice imports, but Mr Tanabu is under pressure from farmers' groups to show the government is defending their interests in the Uruguay Round. However, his ministry has already begun studying methods of compensating farmers affected by liberalisation of the rice market, and newspaper opinion polls suggest a large majority of Japanese are in favour of a market opening. Mr Tanabu is to attend a January 15 meeting of Japanese and EC ministers, which will also be attended by Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, and Mr Yoshiro Mori, the new minister of international trade and industry. The Japanese ministers will want also to discuss the recent confusion over whether Italy and France intended to ban imports of Japanese cars.</p>

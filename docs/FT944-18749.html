			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / As They Say in Europe: The train spotter's guide to unification - No one can agree on a timetable or a destination September marked a new stage in the European debate. It is not now just about Europe. It seemed to take a traditional turn with the publication of the now notorious paper by the German Christian Democrats proposing a Union based on a 'hard core' of five or six states. But there were also two little-noticed comments by the Czech prime minister, Vaclav Klaus, which, if taken seriously, could breathe new life into the flaccid body of British negativism and nationalism on this subject. In an article in The Economist, written before the CDU paper appeared, Klaus established a simple principle of subsidiarity: 'We cannot escape responsibility to solve our problems at home . . . Nor should we be surprised if the forms and pace of European integration prove to be determined by the real interests of the countries concerned and of their citizens, rather than by artificial blueprints approved at various inter-governmental summits.' Klaus concluded with an analysis of the difference between European 'integration' (good) and 'unification' (bad). These views attracted less attention than they deserved for they were overtaken by the row about a multi-speed Europe. The CDU said someone had to set the pace and it should be a grouping based on the Franco-German axis. Klaus replied in the Prague daily Lidove Noviny. He said that Europe was a 'multi-speed continent, whose elements have always been strikingly different from each other'. He was alarmed about the way things were going. There was a growing view that 'Europe' was the basic unit, whereas in fact the nation was, and would remain so. If all this sounds like Lady Thatcher circa 1990, it is not surprising. While she talked about throwing back the (economic) frontiers of the state and not allowing Brussels to roll them forward again, the central Europeans think in terms of their recently reclaimed political independence. Central European nationalism is at odds with the ideology of Europe, even when that nationalism has the civilised and utilitarian character offered by Vaclav Klaus. Britain should heed Klaus. He says that, when it comes to joining Europe, 'The Czech Republic will find it easier to board the slower train rather than the 'super express'.' Why does John Major not say that? Why not follow the advice of the Daily Telegraph: other countries should be told they are welcome to try an economic and monetary union and Britain would watch quite happily as the whole thing fell apart. Anyway, nothing worries Euro-enthusiasts more than explicit moves to strengthen the unification process. It was Le Monde which headlined its comment on the CDU paper Rudesse germanique. It was the Italians and Spaniards who clamoured 'me too' when the exclusive nature of the hard core was revealed. If there is a slow train in Europe, the British will be in the driving seat, with a fair chance of seeing the express derailed. But the British have their own illusions which overstate the power of the nation. Listen to the endless crowing about the departure of the UK from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism a couple of years ago. That governmental disaster is now credited with near-magic properties: the consequent cut in short-term interest rates brought about a boom, the devaluation of the currency made British exports competitive. With one bound, the Union Jack was free. No matter that if there is a great recovery going on, nobody outside the M25, the motorway around London, believed it. No matter that the devaluation has not eliminated the country's trade deficit while other nations, still un-devalued within an unofficial ERM, suffer no such problem. The cut in interest rates was a good thing but that is a reflection of the exaggerated British reliance on short term loans. All that has happened is that Britain has moved from a monetary policy dictated by the Bundesbank to one dictated by the bond markets. What will be said when they force unacceptably high short term rates on us? Professor Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the council of the Bundesbank, entered the debate when he told a conference in Oxford last month that the nation-state had become too small to solve most problems with which it was confronted. He concluded that a Euro-solution demanded that there ought to be some middle way between a Brussels super-state and the nation. So there is a new argument about Europe. Klaus welcomes the idea of many speeds where nations can choose their own destiny and says the nation state can solve its own problems. The Bundesbank says it cannot and wants a train to a destination that has yet to be built. The British want there to be just a slow track or no track, and the Euro-enthusiasts want to drag the true-believers away from the rest to a station all of their own. A four-track Europe.

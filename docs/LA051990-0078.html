			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1 KILLED, 46 INJURED AS TOUR BUS OVERTURNS  </P> <P> A tour bus carrying European tourists from Las Vegas to Mammoth Lakes  overturned on a two-lane highway east of this small eastern Sierra town Friday,  killing one passenger and injuring 46 others, the California Highway Patrol  said.  </P> <P> The CHP said the Southwest Charter Co. bus was traveling at an unknown speed on  a slight downhill grade along Highway 168, a road that traverses the White  Mountains, when it rolled once after the driver failed to negotiate a sharp  turn. The bus came to rest on its wheel about 4 1/2 miles east of here.  </P> <P> One passenger, identified as Marguerite Finat, 60, was pronounced dead at the  scene. Earlier CHP reports that two passengers had died were incorrect.  </P> <P> The injured were taken to Bishop's small Northern Inyo Hospital, where hospital  Administrator Herman Spencer said six of the passengers were in critical  condition with internal injuries and broken bones.  </P> <P> CHP Sgt. Ray Dixon said the bus was traveling in third gear, when the driver,  identified as Juan Garcia, 30, of Phoenix, attempted to shift into a lower gear  but found he couldn't and hit the brakes.  </P> <P> Dixon said that when the brakes failed to slow the bus enough as it approached  a sharp curve the driver turned into the bank on the right side, then lost  control as the bus slanted across the road to the left and rolled.  </P> <P> When help arrived, most of the dust-covered passengers were sitting beside the  road, many with blood on their faces. Others wandered around the crash scene  seemingly in a daze.  </P> <P> At the hospital in Bishop, Spencer estimated that about a third of the  passengers suffered scrapes, bumps and bruises; another third were treated for  moderate injuries.  </P> <P> He said 46 patients arrived at the hospital within an hour to an hour and a  half.  </P> <P> Hospital attendants encountered a language problem immediately. Many of the  passengers -- including Germans, French, Belgians and Austrians -- were unable  to speak English. Volunteers from the community were recruited to help the  staff, Spencer said.  </P> <P> "Our biggest limitation is that we only have a 32-bed hospital," he said.  </P> <P> The overflow patients or those with injuries that could not be treated in  Bishop were scheduled for transfer to other hospitals in Mammoth Lakes and in  Reno.  </P> <P> After treatment, some of the patients were driven by police to Bishop  Auditorium to wait for arrangements to be made for overnight accommodations.  </P> <P> In Phoenix, a spokesperson for Southwest Charter Co., said the company is "very  concerned" about the accident and the owner, Mark Pike, made immediate  arrangements to fly to Bishop.  </P> <P> Friday's accident was the second deadly bus crash in the eastern Sierra in four  years. Twenty-one elderly Southern California residents were killed north of  Bridgeport in May, 1986, when a gamblers' special returning from Reno careened  into an icy, swollen river.  </P> <P> Twenty other passengers were injured.  </P> <P> Times staff writer John Kendall and correspondent Martin Forstenzer contributed  to this story.  </P></p>

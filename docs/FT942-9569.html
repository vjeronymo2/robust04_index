			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: SIB acts Next week, the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City watchdog, will publish advice to people about the issues they should raise with sales agents when discussing the possibility of transferring a lump sum out of a former employer's pension scheme into a private plan, writes Alison Smith. The move is part of SIB's efforts to raise the standards of selling pension transfers following a pilot study late last year. This suggested a widespread failure among sales agents to meet regulatory requirements and raised public concern about the mis-selling of pensions.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Indian bank reform accelerates after scandal INDIA'S financial market scandal is accelerating reform of the banking system, although prospects for private-sector banking in the country have been set back, according to Mr S. Venkitaramanan, governor of the Reserve Bank of India. In London on his way to a meeting of central bank heads, he said: 'I think the process of reform of the financial system will, in fact, be speeded up because the need for modernisation is becoming more obvious, as the recent irregularities and scam indicate.' The scandal, centring on short-term bank loans used to fund stock market speculation, has led to resignations and arrests among some of the country's top financiers, as well as known bank losses of about Pounds 600m. Banks lent substantial sums on the basis of bankers' receipts, an instrument which developed partly because of antiquated settlement methods for securities. Mr Venkitaramanan said banks' settlement and internal inspection systems, especially in treasury operations, funds management and foreign exchange dealings, had to be modernised. Banks were working on setting internal dealing limits and limiting off-balance sheet exposure. Changes would be overseen by a new supervisory board to be set up under the aegis of the Reserve Bank. India is meanwhile pressing ahead with plans to put banks on a sounder footing. They are chronically weak, as socialist central planning has forced them to lend at below market rates to the government and officially determined 'priority' sectors - chiefly state-owned entities and agriculture. Mr Venkitaramanan said interest rates for many borrowers had moved closer to the market and he hoped that statutory liquidity ratios, the proportion of banks' deposits pre-empted by the government to fund its budget deficit, would come down further after being cut from 38.5 to 30 per cent. This would still leave a large amount of small loans to farmers at rates well below that of the market. It was proposed to establish a National Rural Bank, along the lines of France's Credit Agricole, to ensure the flow of lending to farmers but along more commercial lines. After these reforms, many banks will need infusions of capital to meet international standards. However, the government has ruled out privatisation because of intense political opposition, particularly from unions. Mr Venkitaramanan said the banking scandal had also ruled out, for the time being, development of new private-sector Indian banks. 'Public opinion today would not welcome new private banks because of the problems that have arisen.' Because of misuse of private banks by brokers, 'one has to pause a little to ensure that these banks are properly managed.' Although problems had also arisen in state-owned and foreign banks, Mr Venkitaramanan said that pushing ahead with development of private-sector banking could jeopardise the whole reform process. INDIA has frozen the assets of three bank officials allegedly involved in the financial market scandal, Reuter reports from New Delhi. The Finance Ministry said properties of the three officials of the State Bank of India, including its deputy managing director, had been 'attached'.</p>

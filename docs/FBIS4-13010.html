			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 Apr (MENA)--President Muhammad Husni  Mubarak is following events in Rwanda with grave concern and  deep regret, especially because of the hardships faced by the  fraternal Rwandan people as security deteriorates.

The statement announced that Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  communicated with OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim on the  possible steps the OAU can take to contain the deteriorating  situation in Rwanda.    The statement reported that the committee in charge of  solving inter-African disputes will meet in Addis Ababa today  chaired by an Egyptian representative to discuss the dangerous  events in Rwanda.    The statement continued: The Government of the Arab Republic  of Egypt appeals to all Rwandan parties to exercise  self-restraint, accept an immediate cease-fire, and create the  appropriate conditions for relief organizations to carry out  their humanitarian mission. It also urges these parties to  immediately resume their efforts to implement the Arosha  Agreement so as to attain stability and peace in the country.    The Egyptian ambassador and Embassy staff in Kigali have  been  instructed to leave Rwanda temporarily in light of the dangers  they are facing there and the extreme deterioration in security.</p>

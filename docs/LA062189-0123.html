			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROGRAM TRIES TO HELP FEMALE EXECUTIVES GAIN LOAN LITERACY  </P> <P> Women own more than a quarter of all small U.S. companies, but a women's  economic development group maintains that many of these entrepreneurs still  don't have the financial savvy to write a credible loan application.  </P> <P> Beatrice Fitzpatrick, president and founder of American Woman's Economic  Development Corp., said women's uneasiness with the financial end of business  is cultural.  </P> <P> "Most women who come here are wonderful at the creative end but haven't learned  the business end," she said. "They've been given the message one way or another  . . . that this is not something they should be concerned with."  </P> <P> The trend is especially disturbing because almost 50% of all small companies  will be run by women by the turn of the century, according to Fitzpatrick.  </P> <P> "This is the first time in the country's history that more women than men are  going into business for themselves," she said. "It's such a wonderful avenue  for people to advance and improve their lives."  </P> <P> In view of these statistics, American Woman's Economic Development Corp. has  developed a new program designed to raise the standard of loan literacy among  female entrepreneurs in New York state.  </P> <P> The program is designed for the female executive whose business has been  growing steadily or the woman who is just preparing to set up a company.  </P> <P> The course consists of 10 to 13 two-hour, private counseling sessions that give  executives tips on how to write a business history, project the financial  performance of their companies and assemble data that will build credibility  with a lending institution.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIAL CITES TRAFFIC, EFFECT ON NEIGHBORHOOD;  </P> <P> CLUB PLANNED NEAR CSUN FAILS TO WIN PERMIT  </P> <P> An application for a youth dance club near Cal State Northridge was turned down  by a zoning officer Monday after the proposal ran into a barrage of criticism  from university officials, police and neighbors.  </P> <P> Mark A. Steele, a 25-year-old concert promoter who had filed the application,  said he probably would appeal the ruling but admitted that he "didn't expect  this much opposition."  </P> <P> Steele is proposing a dance club to be called Whiplash, which would accommodate  up to 550 patrons age 18 and older, in the former Bullwinkle's restaurant on  Reseda Boulevard, one block west of the campus.  </P> <P> He said that only those who are 21 and older would be given wristbands  permitting them to buy alcoholic drinks and that 10 off-duty police officers  would patrol inside the club to make certain that 18- to 20-year-olds did not  obtain liquor through friends who were of legal age.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Neighborhood Cited  </P> <P> Jack C. Sedwick, a Los Angeles city associate zoning administrator, rejected  Steele's request for a conditional-use permit to open the club, saying that it  would be "detrimental to the neighborhood" and that patrons would "interfere  with traffic circulation."  </P> <P> Diana R. Gruendler, university housing services director, said that the club  would encourage excessive drinking by students and that after its 2 a.m.  closing, non-students would drift onto campus because "many young people have  the mistaken notion that universities are a place where there are 24-hour  parties."  </P> <P> She also said the club would harm the university's reputation in the community  because people would associate it with trouble caused by patrons, regardless of  whether the disturbances were caused by students.  </P> <P> The application also was opposed by Los Angeles Police Sgt. Frank Reynoso, who  heads the Devonshire Division vice unit.  </P> <P> Other clubs open to 18-year-olds "never succeed in keeping liquor from the  underage group," he said. "In the dark, there is nothing to stop them from  sipping someone else's drink."  </P> <P> Reynoso also said other youth dance clubs are magnets for gangs, "which mix  with one another, resulting in troubles in the parking lot, problems in the  neighborhood."  </P> <P> Reynoso said that in the last 30 months, there have been 25 accidents on Reseda  Boulevard in front of the proposed club and that the club would aggravate the  situation.  </P> <P> Anita Aragon, one of several longtime area residents who argued against the  application, said it would harm "what has been a quiet university  neighborhood."  </P> <P> But another said residents "already go through hell" because of disturbances in  parking lots of restaurants in the area.  </P> <P> Steele countered that clubs patronized by gangs "project a kind of image and  play a certain kind of music to attract gang members. That is not the kind of  club I want to operate."  </P> <P> He also argued that he "should be given an opportunity to open up, to show what  kind of operation I will run."  </P></p>

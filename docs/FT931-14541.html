			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / People: Weaver's prudent move pays off Less than three years after joining Murray Johnstone, the independent Glasgow fund managers, Giles Weaver is to become its managing director. He will take over as md from Nick McAndrew, currently chairman and md, when McAndrew becomes executive chairman at the end of June, and should succeed McAndrew, 58, when the latter retires from an executive role in two years' time. Weaver, 46, was recruited to Murray Johnstone in 1990 from the Prudential where he ran pension funds. Murray Johnstone needed him as investment director to stop a haemorrhage of pension clients who had been dismayed by the company's poor investment performance. Weaver improved communication with clients and re-positioned the funds in the market. The pension fund performance duly improved. The engaging Weaver, who will stay in charge of pensions at Murray Johnstone, joined the Prudential in 1986 from Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh fund managers. The move to Murray Johnstone meant a return to Scotland, though Weaver does not have the negligible commuting time of many Scottish fund managers. He lives in East Lothian and drives nearly 70 miles to Glasgow early every morning, eschewing news programmes for full text recordings of the classics of English and French literature. With Weaver's promotion Stephen Anderson will take charge of the UK department and David Briggs will take over responsibility for investment trusts.</p>

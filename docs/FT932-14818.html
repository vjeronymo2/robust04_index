			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Alex Russell Pounds 2m in red after US withdrawal costs THE COST of its final withdrawal from US coal production put Alexander Russell, the Scottish quarrying, concrete and coal group, into a Pounds 1.93m pre-tax loss in 1992, against a Pounds 1.66m profit previously. A one-off charge of Pounds 2.56m related to closure of the coal operation in Southern Illinois and any foreseeable costs linked to the withdrawal. The final dividend was passed, restricting the total to 1p (2.15p). The board hopes to return to normal dividends this year. Trading profit was reduced from Pounds 1.72m to Pounds 625,000. Turnover fell to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 37.6m) including Pounds 802,000 (Pounds 1.49m) from discontinued operations. 'It is the second loss in our history, which, as with the first in 1925, arose through terrible coal trading conditions,' Mr Russell Nicolson, chairman, said. The quarrying side recorded a 41 per cent decline in profit to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 2.7m), and in concrete, profits fell to Pounds 513,000 (Pounds 805,000) . However UK coal operations showed a substantial increase to Pounds 548,000. There were signs of recovery in the company's markets. 'With the closure of our loss-making US coal operations, an overall reduction of Pounds 500,000 in labour costs through early retirement and 50 redundancies, and the effects of reduced interest rates, we are confident of a return to profit this year.' Losses per share were 11.86p basic (2.59p earnings) and 8.26p (3.32p earnings) fully diluted.</p>

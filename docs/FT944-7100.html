			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / West German inflation slows The annual inflation rate in west Germany slowed from 2.8 per cent to 2.6 per cent in the month to mid-November, according to preliminary data from the federal statistics office yesterday. With prices continuing to stabilise, and a strong D-Mark defending the economy against imported inflation, economists suggested the Bundesbank still had room to reduce its short-term interest rates. Meanwhile, central bank data issued yesterday showed that a deficit of DM7.7bn (Pounds 3.14bn) on the pan-German services trade balance made the largest contribution to an unexpectedly big total current account deficit of DM5.2bn during September. The aggregate deficit for the first three quarters of the year rose accordingly to DM41.9bn. Visible imports, up 5.2 per cent, grew more than forecast, leaving the trade surplus at DM5.8bn, down from DM7.1bn in August. Mr Horst Schulmann, a Bundesbank council member and president of the regional central bank in the state of Hesse, has died. He had been ill for some time.</p>

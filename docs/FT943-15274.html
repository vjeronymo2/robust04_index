			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Ukraine offered funds to close Chernobyl nuclear plant Eight years after the nuclear power plant explosion in Chernobyl disrupted a G7 summit in Tokyo, the world's leading industrial nations agreed to offer Ukraine an action plan that would close the plant. The G7 leaders from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, together with the president of the European Commission, agreed to provide up to Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m) in grants as an initial payment to shut down Chernobyl. The funding would be additional to the Ecu500m (Pounds 390m) in grants and loans offered by the European Union after its summit in Corfu last month to help close dangerous plants and complete replacement capacity. Provision of the funds will be conditional on action by Ukraine. The country, which yesterday held a second-round run-off poll in a presidential election, would be expected to shut Chernobyl as 'an urgent priority'. Ukraine would also have to agree to early completion of three new reactors with adequate safety standards, comprehensive energy reforms including higher prices, increased energy conservation and use of other energy sources. It is expected that talks between G7 representatives and Ukraine will begin soon after the Ukraine election results are clear. The G7 meeting was notable for the concern expressed about the Ukraine economy. The leaders urged Ukraine to embark on genuine economic reforms, promising up to Dollars 4bn in finance from the International Monetary fund and other institutions over two years in return. The weekend nuclear safety offer was a hard-won victory for Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor. Together with Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, he urged other G7 members to act and solve the problem of Ukraine's dangerous Soviet-designed nuclear power plants. Some G7 nations, such as Japan and Britain, were reluctant to provide large-scale funding. After an all-night working session that began on Friday, the sherpas, senior officials who prepare the summit, agreed on a sum of only Dollars 100m. This was raised to 'up to Dollars 200m' when the leaders discussed the matter on Saturday, with Germany promising to provide DM50m, or about 17 per cent of the total. The G7 pledges, together with Dollars 115m in grants promised by the EU in Corfu, should provide about Dollars 300m to close down Chernobyl - the amount experts say is necessary for the first stage of the operation. It is estimated Ukraine needs Dollars 1.5bn to deal with its nuclear safety problem entirely.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sao Tome, 19 Apr (AFP) -- The Sao Tomean Parliament  today began examining a draft bill on autonomy status for  Principe Island whose 6,000 inhabitants consider themselves  abandoned by the central power installed on the other island,  the Sao Tome Archipelago, which is 150 km away from it.    The draft bill provides for the creation of a regional  assembly in Principe and a five-member regional government under  the authority of a minister appointed by the president of the  Republic. The bill also authorizes Principe to have bonds of  cooperation with foreign local governments.    This volcanic island, which measures 128 square km, is  located 300 km off the Gabonese coast. It has only one town,  San-Antonio, with 1,000 inhabitants. The people of Principe  believe they have been neglected by the Sao Tome Government  since they gained independence in 1975, so they are now asking  for "balanced development" of the archipelago.</p>

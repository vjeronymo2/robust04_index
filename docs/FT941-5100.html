			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Setback for Wallenberg group Investor, the main holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg family, yesterday reported a sharp fall in profits in 1993 as reverses at Saab-Scania, the vehicle and aerospace group, and a fall in capital gains left profits after financial items at SKr410m (Dollars 52m), down from SKr1.48bn in 1992. However, the group painted a brighter picture for 1994. It said income in the latter part of the year surged, mainly due to a strong recovery at Saab-Scania, Investor's chief offshoot, producing a fourth-quarter profit of SKr194m, compared with a loss in the same 1992 period of SKr147m. The dividend was unchanged for the second year running at SKr5.25 per share and Investor's most-traded B share rose SKr5.00 to close at SKr191. Investor said its net worth rose over the year to SKr37.5bn from SKr30.1bn. The value of its strategic portfolio at the year-end was up 41 per cent at SKr27.96bn - lagging a 54 per cent rise in the Affarsvarlden general index. But sales from the industrial portfolio, positive cash flow from Saab-Scania and a reduction in working capital tied up in Saab-Scania saw group net debt fall sharply to SKr4.85bn from SKr8.7bn. Income from capital gains fell to SKr1.4bn from SKr2.27bn as portfolio sales fell. Profits at Saab-Scania fell to SKr1.66bn from SKr2.13bn, with the truck and bus and aircraft divisions reporting lower income, and a fifth successive loss for Saab Automobile, jointly owned with General Motors of the US.</p>

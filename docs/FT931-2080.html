			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Risk and Reward: Regulators offer blueprint for US futures industry A PROPOSED change in US regulations could put the US futures market on a more even footing with the over-the-counter swaps market, at a time when competition between the two markets is intensifying. US futures exchanges also hope that a more liberal environment will help stem their loss of market share to European exchanges. Last week, Mr William Albrecht, acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates futures trading, put forward ambitious proposals for the liberalisation of rules governing US futures exchanges. Speaking at the annual Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton, Florida, Mr Albrecht said he had asked the CFTC's staff to draft a proposed rule that exchange products traded on electronic systems and used by institutional investors should be exempt from most CFTC regulations. This would mean that, apart from rules governing manipulation and fraud, exchanges meeting these requirements would not have to seek CFTC approval for new contracts, rule changes, and so on. In practice, it would allow exchanges to enter part of the territory currently controlled by the OTC market. In particular, it would make it easier for them to break into the Dollars 4,000bn swaps market. US exchange officials tend to have a rather ambivalent attitude to the swaps market. On the one hand, they realise that banks and securities houses in the swaps market are also active users of futures markets, to lay off risks. On the other hand, they are also aware that the growth of the OTC market has been generated by that market's ability to tailor OTC products to specific client needs. Last year, it was confirmed that swaps were exempt from CFTC futures regulations. Consequently, the swaps market is not directly regulated, but most of the players are (either by the Securities and Exchange Commission in the case of securities houses, or by the Federal Reserve in the case of banks). Mr Pat Arbor, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, said that the proposed rule change would create 'a level playing field so we can not only complement but compete with the OTC market.' He added that there had been a blurring of the line between swaps and futures, citing the growing secondary market in swaps and the fact that swaps are now used for a variety of reasons, including speculation on interest rate movements, in the same way as futures. Mr Arbor suggested that a suitable exchange instrument would be a Dollars 10m swap contract from fixed to Libor-linked floating rate interest. But the chances of Mr Albrecht's proposal seeing the light of day are probably slim. As acting chairman of the CFTC before the appointment of a new head by President Bill Clinton, he admitted he hoped the proposal might help force the hand of any new chairman into reforming current regulations. However, the move runs counter to the trend followed by most US regulators, whose approach has generally been to extend rather than retrench their powers where possible. Mr Albrecht, however, shares the view of market practitioners that changes are needed in order to halt the flow of business to less regulated markets overseas. 'Our regulatory system dates back to the 1930s. All we have done is add on rather than taking anything out,' he said. Consequently, regulation has not kept pace with developments such as electronic technology and the challenge of fresh regulatory approaches in overseas markets. 'With electronic trading systems, there is an electronic audit trail which makes it easier to detect violations,' Mr Albrecht said. 'If people know they will get caught, they are less likely to commit violations.' In response to proposals from Mr Jack Sandner, head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, that the current array of regulators should be streamlined into a single authority, Mr Albrecht said: 'The question of how many agencies we have is less important than the rules they are supposed to be enforcing.'</p>

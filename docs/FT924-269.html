			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Merivale Moore - Correction Merivale Moore, the property group, was the victim last week of a fake press release which said it had gone into receivership. 'The announcement was a total fabrication and the matter is being investigated,' the company said. 'Merivale Moore continues to have the full support of its bankers.' A news item, based on the fake press release, appeared in later editions of last Thursday's Financial Times. The FT regrets the distress the item caused Merivale Moore. The press release was received by the FT's UK Companies newsdesk at about 7pm Wednesday evening. Normally news items are checked thoroughly before they are published. If no verification is possible, the item is left to the next day. Given the season and the hour, it was not possible to verify the information in the fake press release. Contrary to our rules, a short item appeared.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMINE HELP  </P> <P> I read with deep interest the article "Hoping to Leave the Famine Rut" by  Michael Hiltzik (Oct. 23). His observations about the importance of encouraging  self-sufficiency in Ethiopia rather than dependence echoed my feelings after  seeing the beleaguered country in April of 1988. I visited an eastern province  called Harrarghe with CARE, the international relief and development  organization. What I saw there was both harrowing and encouraging.  </P> <P> In 1984 and 1985 the horrible famine years, CARE was rushing food to 600,000  men, women and children threatened by starvation in Harrarghe and two other  regions. Today in Harrarghe, CARE has dismantled all of its food distribution  centers because most of those who were standing in food lines four years ago  are now farming. CARE is using the food-for-work approach to support farmers in  environmental projects that will safeguard their land against the next famine.  </P> <P> Since 1985 the people of Harrarghe and CARE have planted about 8 million trees,  filled in hundreds of gullies, terraced miles of hillsides, dug water  catchments and much more. Workers receive food in exchange for their efforts.  Their handiwork, by conserving water and topsoil, will help all the local  residents survive the next drought.  </P> <P> Through programs created after World War II, CARE receives free food  commodities from the U.S. government. CARE uses that food and private donations  in such a way that $1 from an American donor creates $11 worth of help  overseas. Best of all, the help is the kind that, as Hiltzik says, gets the  poor out of "the famine rut." I thank him for an accurate and ultimately  hopeful look at hunger in Ethiopia.  </P> <P> LLOYD BRIDGES  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

The message was in connection with  developments in the Bakassi peninsula. State House  Correspondent Chris Ngu reports:    [Ngu] General Abacha told a four-man French delegation, led  by Mr. Bruno Delaye, President Mitterrand's adviser on African  affairs and ecology, that Nigeria's concern in the disputed  Bakassi peninsula is the security of Nigerians who form 96  percent of residents of the area. The head of state explained  that the presence of Nigerian soldiers there is to prevent  clashes between communities in Akwa Ibom and Cross River states,  both in Nigeria. He restated Nigeria's commitment to peaceful  coexistence worldwide.    On claims and counter claims of authority over the  peninsula,  Gen. Abacha told the delegation that evidence of history showed  that the disputed area for long had Nigerian presence in the  form of a police post. Not only that, several census exercises  have been conducted in the area by Nigerian authorities. The  head of state reaffirmed his belief that the dispute could be  resolved amicably without foreign assistance.    Mr. Delaye had explained that French paratroopers were in  the  Cameroon only to honor the defense pact between France and the  Cameroon. Mr. Delaye and Nigeria's foreign affairs minister,  Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, later walked into a waiting party  of State House correspondent. Mr. Delaye was not forthcoming  with answers to questions. That way he left Nigeria's foreign  minister to do the talking.    [Begin recording] [Delaye] I am not prepared to make  comments  now, [words indistint] I am not the minister.    [Kingibe] Mr. Delaye, who is the special adviser to the  president of France, accompanied by his delegation, has come to  see the head of state with a message from the president of  France conveying to the Nigerian authorities the observations of  the French authorities on the ongoing situation in the Bakassi  and on the general relationship between Nigeria and France. I  think that is .... [pauses] Mr. Delaye said he had very useful  discussions during his visit to Abuja and I think that they will  now go towards a resolution of the problem in the way that will  be satisfactory to all concerned. Well, at least there is a  determination in that commitment on both sides, it seems, but  definitely on our side, for a peaceful resolution of the problem  through dialogue. And there is this proposed summit of the two  heads of state to which we were looking forward and for which we  were prepared and the sooner this summit takes place, the sooner  we will find our way forward towards finding a solution.

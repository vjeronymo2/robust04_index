			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Electricity generator may swap assets PowerGen, the electricity generator, yesterday indicated a preference for an assets swap with an overseas company as it revealed a 20.5 per cent rise in dividend payments on the back of last year's Pounds 476m pre-tax profits. Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said a cross-border deal was the company's favoured option to fulfil an agreement with the electricity regulator to try to dispose of 2,000MW of generating plant. The company had been approached by about 20 parties interested in buying the plant but considered only a handful to be serious, Mr Wallis said. However, any disposal could take time to achieve. In the year to April 3, PowerGen's pre-tax profits of Pounds 476m represented a 12 per cent rise on 1992-93's Pounds 425m. This was in spite of a Pounds 24m net increase in provisions and an 8 per cent reduction in sales to Pounds 2.94bn. A lower tax charge enabled the company to lift earnings per share by 20.5 per cent to 44p (36.5p) and the dividend for the year to 12.65p (10.5p) after a final of 8.7p. Analysts said similar dividend rises were possible next year. Cover remained at 3.5 times earnings against a policy of reducing it to 2.5 to 2.7. Mr Wallis said market share, down 1 percentage point to 26 per cent, was likely to fall further and could reach 22 per cent in 1995-96. He expected it to rise again as new capacity came on stream. Job numbers fell 11 per cent to 4,399 and salaries and overhead costs were down from Pounds 566m to Pounds 439m. Last year's performance was also helped by a reduction in coal stocks, from 15.7m tonnes to 12.9m. Mr John Rennocks, finance director, said he expected a further cut to less than 5m in the next two years. Gearing rose to 15 per cent at the year-end. During the year PowerGen paid the full Pounds 441m costs of developing its Connah's Quay gas station, reducing the total cost by Pounds 54m. Mr Wallis said three of the company's four new business areas - offshore gas, gas trading, and combined heat and power - were UK-based. In the fourth, overseas, the company did not need to take the corporate acquisitions route. It preferred a lower-risk strategy, for example, building power plant in other countries. Lex, Page 20</p>

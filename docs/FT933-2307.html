			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / China's Mr Zhu pursues creative destruction IN SPITE of the hype, China's high-speed dash towards economic development is highly unlikely to be affected by the outcome of its bid to host the 2000 Olympic games in Beijing. Much more important for China's future, if currently less geo-politically touchy, is vice-premier Zhu Rongji's attempt to slow its over-heating economy and avoid a hard landing. It is too early to tell whether he will succeed - Mr Zhu only took over at the central bank in July. But he has wasted no time in using a mix of market and administrative measures to rein in credit creation. Market interest rates have risen by 25 percentage points to around 35 per cent since June; credit quotas for local banks have been cut and all speculative loans to the real estate sector. More than 1,000 special economic development zones have been closed since August and land prices in coastal cities have fallen by between 20 and 30 per cent from their May 1993 peak. Foreign investors appear willing to give Mr Zhu the benefit of the doubt, at least for now. For, as a new Bank Credit Analyst publication, The China Analyst, points out, utilised direct foreign investment reached a record Dollars 9.4bn (Pounds 6.1bn) in the first half of 1993, 150 per cent higher than in the same period a year earlier. The BCA forecasts it will reach Dollars 18bn this year. Moreover, there are signs that this tight monetary policy is starting to affect spending and output. Retail sales in August were 23.8 per cent higher than the same month a year ago, down from 26.5 per cent in July. And industrial production is slowing: output in August was 23.4 per cent higher than a year ago, down down from 25.1 per cent in July. But monetary policy will have to be kept tight for some months yet before inflation starts to slow significantly. According to China's Financial News, consumer prices in the 35 main cities in August were 22.2 per cent higher than a year ago, slightly down from 23.3 per cent in July but still above the 17.4 per cent inflation rate in the first half of the year. Mr Zhu has quite a task if he is to bring inflation under control and avoid a damaging credit crunch. Managing a price deflation of this magnitude without over-doing the squeeze is difficult enough in a developed market economy in which the levers of monetary policy have relatively predictable effects. But in China's half-reformed economy, with blunt credit quotas the main policy tool, it is much more difficult. For it is profitable state companies, not bankrupt property developers, who will have to repay their loans to enable the banks to satisfy their credit quotas. The result is first a growing squeeze on corporate profits followed by a liquidity crisis in the state industrial sector leading to the build-up of inter-enterprise debts. The textbook central bank response in a planned economy, as the Russian central bank is currently demonstrating, is to pump liquidity back into the banking system to keep the state companies afloat, thus laying the foundations for the next inflationary boom. Mr Zhu hopes that this time things will be different, which explains why he is simultaneously trying to push through structural reforms which will preclude such a wholesale bail-out of the state sector, free the state banks to lend only to profitable customers and force unprofitable companies either to be privatised or to go bankrupt. What China needs is time, to push through these reforms and thus further weaken the influence of the state banks and companies. The share of state companies in total output has, in fact, been falling progressively over the past 30 years - from more than 90 per cent of total production in the early 1960s to less than 50 per cent today - as the left-hand chart shows. The need to go further is one reason why the continued inflow of foreign investment into China is so important, and why a confidence-crushing credit crunch would be such a setback.

countries are currently changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All trade figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and the German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA from national government and central bank sources.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

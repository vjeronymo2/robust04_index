			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / MMC to probe advertising bid The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate a bid by More O'Ferrall, the poster advertising company, for London Transport Advertising, the London Transport subsidiary which is being privatised. More O'Ferrall, one of four bidders for LTA, said it was 'extremely disappointed' about the referral. The resulting delay could jeopardise its chances of a successful bid. LTA generates about Pounds 23m a year from the sale of poster space in Underground stations and on buses and trains. It employs about 300 people. It had been expected that the sale would be completed by the end of this month but the government has now given the MMC a deadline of mid-October to present its report. Mr Vincent Slevin, More O'Ferrall UK managing director, said it was up to London Transport to evaluate the bids and take the MMC investigation into account. The Department of Trade and Industry is concerned that More O'Ferrall's bid 'raises competition concerns in the poster advertising market in the London area which merit investigation by the MMC'. If More O'Ferrall were to be successful it would control about 21 per cent of the UK outdoor advertising market and about 38 per cent of the market in London. A market share of 25 per cent commonly triggers an MMC investigation. Mr Slevin said the company had hoped that the bid would not be referred because the media world was changing. Carlton had 55 per cent of the London television market and Capital Radio 65 per cent of London radio, he added. The three other bidders for LTA are a management and employee buy-out; a joint bid by Giraudy, a French poster company, and Primesight, a UK outdoor company; and a consortium led by Transportation Displays, a US transport advertising company. More O'Ferrall shares closed down 1p at 361p.</p>

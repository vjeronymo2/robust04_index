			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAVELING IN STYLE;  </P> <P> A PRIMAL PIECE OF PARADISE  </P> <P> Few places on earth match the awesome beauty of Kauai's Na Pali coast with its  thunderous waves and precipitous cliffs that fall away to the Pacific -- to  deserted beaches and hidden coves. A special place on a special island. Beyond  its shores appears the other face of Hawaii, with condominiums and high-rise  resorts. Na Pali, though, is blessed with a serenity these islands knew only in  the beginning.  </P> <P> Bathed by trade winds, Na Pali is a world unchanged through the centuries, a  world that remains silent save for the voice of the wind and the explosion of  waves against lava that rose from the ocean floor, eons ago, to form the  islands of Hawaii.  </P> <P>  Aloft in a helicopter, vacationers study Kauai's valleys and jungles that  reach to the very shores of Na Pali. The copters cruise above jungles without a  single trail -- jungles that have never known the footstep of man. Waterfalls  spill furiously. This is only a few miles from Hanalei and that magnificent  white strand, Lumahai Beach, where Hollywood came to film "South Pacific."  Precisely where Lumahai ends, the earth turns green with taro patches and rice  paddies, and shortly thereafter the Na Pali coast begins, blue and green waters  slamming against ancient cliffs, leaving behind white trails of foam. Coves dug  by millions of years of ocean anger remain peaceful, untouched. All this is  woven into the tapestry of Kauai's Na Pali coast. JERRY HULSE  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Applause greets 'best Budget in years' - Small companies The business community yesterday warmly welcomed a package of measures that many see as the best Budget for small and growing companies in years. Business groups said it was cleverly targeted at helping existing businesses to grow and would attract much-needed private equity capital into unquoted companies. The announcement that the government was considering legislation to give a statutory right to interest on over-due payments was greeted by the Forum of Private Business as 'the single best thing that could have been done for small business'. Supporters of this legislation say it would change the whole culture surrounding late payment of suppliers and would remove a damaging drain on growing businesses's cash positions at a time when they are struggling to find debt finance. Welcoming a more targeted replacement for the discredited Business Expansion Scheme, the British venture capital industry said more risk capital would become available for the UK's entrepreneurs. In particular, investors in Enterprise Investment Schemes - as the successor to BES will be called - will be allowed full capital gains tax roll-over relief on gains made on the sale of quoted investments which are then reinvested in unquoted companies. Property investments will be specifically excluded, closing one avenue that was greatly abused in the BES scheme. Venture capital companies also welcomed the proposal to set up venture capital trusts, in which private investors would be exempt from capital gains tax and income tax. This will be introduced in the 1995 Finance Bill. These two measures may also attract much needed knowledge from business 'angels' who will now be able to invest their money and their expertise. 'The chancellor is once again giving individuals an incentive to put money into unlisted companies,' said Mr Michael Walton, head of Venture Capital at Gartmore. Of the more immediate benefits for existing companies, business groups particularly welcomed changes to the thresholds below which companies pay the small business tax rate. The Chancellor raised the threshold below which companies pay a 25 per cent tax rate from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000. There were other issues that will have an immediate benefit on small company cash flow. The chancellor modified the transitional relief scheme for the uniform business rate; instead of facing a 15 per cent or 20 per cent per annum increase in the rate, depending on the company's size, companies will now only face a 7.5 per cent or 10 per cent increase. There were other measures that will have an immediate effect on cashflow. The Chancellor has raised the level for full reimbursement of statutory sickness pay from those companies paying Pounds 16,000 in national insurance bills to those paying Pounds 20,000. Companies will also be repaid within four weeks instead of the current six weeks. Small companies administrative costs could also fall. The threshold for administering VAT will rise from sales of Pounds 37.600 to Pounds 45,000, allowing 75,000 more companies to drop out of the net, the Chancellor said. This threshold rise gives the lie to previous government claims that Brussels was preventing an increase in the threshold. Plans to integrate National Insurance and PAYE collection could also help cut administration costs. Statutory audit ends for small companies, Page 24</p>

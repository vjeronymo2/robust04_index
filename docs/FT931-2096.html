			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Brokers on Wall Street bow to a trend: The process that created Smith Barney Shearson The merger between Smith Barney, the brokerage subsidiary of financial services group Primerica, and the former Shearson broking operations of American Express, has created a formidable new force in the US retail broking industry. Last week's deal, in which Primerica bought Shearson for Dollars 1bn (Pounds 672m), underlines a trend towards consolidation evident on Wall Street since the early 1980s, but which now may be coming to a close. As one chairman of a leading Wall Street house said of the merger: 'This is the culmination of a process that has been going on since the early 1980s - one more step in the rationalisation of the securities business.' Some 10 or 12 years ago the early phase of consolidation was either about building fully integrated securities houses that could prosper in both the retail and wholesale markets, or creating 'financial supermarkets' by bringing securities firms and providers of related services under the umbrella of huge diversified corporations. Only one large firm, however, succeeded in becoming a big, fully integrated securities house, and that was Merrill Lynch (although on a smaller scale, PaineWebber has built a modest presence in investment banking to go with its retail strengths). And none of the attempts to create financial supermarkets - notably American Express with Shearson Lehman Brothers, and Sears Roebuck with Dean Witter - succeeded. It is clear the big corporations that sought to build financial supermarkets paid too much for their securities units in 1980s. When the securities business went sour in 1988-1990, they tried to get rid of them but could not find buyers. When the industry returned to profitability in 1991, buyers began to emerge. Two parent groups, Sears and American Express, have taken the opportunity to sell part or all their securities units. Two others, General Electric, which owns Kidder Peabody, and Prudential Insurance, which owns Bache (now called Prudential Securities), may be looking for buyers over the next year or so. As for those Wall Street firms that failed to make it as integrated houses, ever since the start of the 1990s they have been concentrating on either broking or investment banking. The creation of Smith Barney Shearson, and the splitting of Shearson from its old investment banking partner Lehman Brothers, is part of a process that has been going on for several years. The merger certainly makes it easier to see how the structure of the US securities industry now looks. The brokerage business is dominated by a small number of large firms, of which Merrill and Smith Barney Shearson are by far the biggest. Below them come a handful of medium-sized houses, such as PaineWebber, Dean Witter, Prudential and Bear Stearns. Merrill, however, is different from its nearest rivals in one important respect - it is also a dominant force in investment banking, where it competes with a small band of global investment banking powerhouses such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Salomon Brothers and CS First Boston. This group concentrates on providing underwriting, financing and advisory services to corporations in the US and overseas. Below the big brokers and investment banks, come the smaller players - securities firms such as Alex Brown, Donaldson Lufkin and Brown Brothers Harriman, investment banks such as Dillon Read, and finance boutiques such as Blackstone - which thrive by specialising in just a few areas of the securities business. Among the groupings, Prudential Securities and Kidder Peabody are the odd ones out, because they are still owned by large parents. They have yet to undergo the final part of the consolidation process - a merger or a takeover  -and GE and Prudential Insurance would probably sell them at the right price. Smith Barney Shearson, meanwhile, faces a difficult first year of life. In leaving behind the Lehman Brothers investment banking unit at American Express, Primerica's chairman Mr Sanford Weill made clear he was not interested in building an integrated securities house. Instead, the new firm will concentrate on what Smith Barney and Shearson did best when they were independent - selling stocks to the investing public. In terms of size, Smith Barney Shearson is not far behind Merrill Lynch. The new company will have 11,000 brokers, 495 branches, and mutual fund assets under management of Dollars 62bn. Merrill has 11,500 brokers, 458 branches and Dollars 117bn under management. The gap between the two is likely to widen, however, because Mr Weill will have to cut fat from the new operation. While Smith Barney, under the careful eye of Mr Weill, was generally regarded as trim and efficient, Shearson's cost base had become bloated. In particular, employee compensation was rising faster than productivity. The most common criticism analysts have aimed at the firm has been that Shearson was paying too many people too much money. Mr Perrin Long, securities industry analyst at First of Michigan, estimates that between 2,000 and 4,000 people could go at the new company, and not all from the cost-laden Shearson. It is too early to tell how much savings can be wrung from the merger, but Mr Frank Zarb, president of Smith Barney and the newly appointed chief executive of SBS, has said he expects to take between Dollars 100m and Dollars 200m out of costs in the first few years. Although he insisted there would be no lay-offs among the company's broking force, analysts cannot see how costs can be cut without shedding some brokers. Most of the jobs cuts, however, will come from the back office operations. But merging the two companies' broking forces will pose human problems. Smith Barney's strength as a broker was in the top end of the market, catering to richer individual investors. Shearson brokers, however, have always aimed much lower, and have earned a reputation for hard-sell tactics. Yet, in spite of Shearson's more aggressive selling, Smith Barney's brokers have been consistently more productive than Shearson's. Merging the two cultures, and avoiding the kind of clashes and rivalries that undermined Shearson's alliance with Lehman Brothers, will be one of the most difficult tasks facing Mr Weill and his senior managers over the next year.</p>

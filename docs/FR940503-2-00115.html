			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Thus, radiological releases will not differ from those determined previously and the proposed exemption does not otherwise affect facility radiological effluent or occupational exposures. The proposed exemption will not increase the probability or consequences of any reactor accidents. The proposed exemption does not affect plant nonradiological effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no measurable radiological or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption and amendment and to require rigid compliance with the requirements of paragraphs III.D.2.(a) and III.D.3 of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment and would result in unjustified burdens and costs for the licensee and greater occupational exposure to plant personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative Use of Resources <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in connection with the Commission's Final Environmental Statement for D.C.

The State had no comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this proposed action, see the licensee's application and request for exemption dated March 9 and April 13, 1994.

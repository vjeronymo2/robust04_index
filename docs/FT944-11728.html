			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Barr &amp; Wallace calls enfranchisement EGM The board of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, the motor and leisure group whose voting shareholders are split by a family feud, yesterday issued details of proposals to enfranchise its non-voting A shares. The board called an extraordinary general meeting for November 25 to consider its plans to end the company's two-tier share structure. Ordinary voting shareholders would be compensated by a one-for-one scrip issue, while the non-voting shares, owned almost entirely by institutions, are enfranchised. The proposals are opposed by Mr Nicholas and Mr Robert Barr, nephews of Mr Malcolm Barr, the company chairman. The brothers, who speak for nearly 30 per cent of voting shares, have also called for an EGM to unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr Brian Small, finance director. They are also seeking their uncle's resignation and want to split the company's two divisions into stand-alone businesses. Ironically, enfranchisement was one of their own proposals. Mr Malcolm Barr said: 'The board feels it is essential that all shareholders have a vote on the very radical proposals from the other side. This is especially the case because the other side have said they support enfranchisement.' However, the board's proposal seems likely to fail as it requires 75 per cent of voting shares to proceed. The brothers claim to have enlisted majority support among voting shareholders for their own proposals. Mr Nicholas Barr said: 'Whilst we support enfranchisement in principle, we believe it should only be part of an overall strategy.' A circular on the rebel shareholders' EGM is expected to be published today.</p>

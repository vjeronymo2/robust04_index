			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Labour moves on to offensive with six-point economic plan: Major says tax increases 'are precisely what this country doesn't need' LABOUR moved on to the political offensive yesterday in the increasingly frenetic electioneering atmosphere by setting out a six-point short-term plan to take the UK out of recession. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, accused the prime minister of telling 'whoppers' about Labour's tax plans: he said he detected 'almost a sense of panic' among the Tories. Mr Kinnock sounded confident after the last day-long meeting of Labour's shadow cabinet before the election, which discussed campaigning and endorsed the programme for long-term economic recovery which will be published today. He said the Tories' negative campaigning was a sign of their desperation to provide a distraction from the recession. Yesterday Mr John Major and Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, broadened their attack on the possibility of higher taxes under Labour by focussing on the economic harm they would do. The prime minister said substantial tax increases across the board 'would not only be unwelcome, they would be economically damaging. They are precisely what this country doesn't need at the moment'. Mr Patten said they would 'destroy hopes of an economic recovery'. Mr Major said Labour had spent years condemning the government for 'underfunding' public services and promising to correct this. This inevitably 'involves expenditure and that expenditure has to be paid for'. The intense level of campaigning will continue in the coming weeks, whatever the date chosen for the general election. Mr Major will discuss the manifesto and campaign tactics in meetings with colleagues at Chequers towards the end of the week. Recent opinion polls have not shown a clear lead for either party, and a February election would mean losing the opportunity to use the Budget to gain popularity, as well as delaying the introduction of the council tax. Mr Kinnock rejected Tory assertions that the increase in the top rate would damage economic recovery, pointing out that in the period of strongest growth in the mid-1980s the top tax rate was 60 per cent. With Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, he reiterated that Labour's planned top tax rate would affect only people earning 'well over Pounds 30,000', and that 88 per cent of earners would not be affected by the removal of the ceiling on national insurance contributions. Labour would not spend more than the country could afford, they promised. Labour's six-point programme includes enhanced first-year capital allowances for new investment in manufacturing; creating a new skills fund and a job experience programme, estimated to cost Pounds 800m-Pounds 900m; and setting up a cash-limited enterprise investment scheme. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, joined the fray, saying the government was not coming clean about how it would fund any tax cuts and that Labour was not telling the whole truth about its public spending.

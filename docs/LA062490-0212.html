			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REFERRAL PROGRAM FOR MISDEMEANORS WORKING OUT FINE;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: SANTA ANA GETS NEEDED WORK DONE AND SAVES $100,000, AND THE 324  LAWBREAKERS SERVE THEIR TIME OUTSIDE.  </P> <P> A 16-year-old Santa Ana boy got up early Saturday morning to paint fences. With  the sun beaming down, he stroked away at the wooden fences and stone walls,  covered with graffiti and gang markings, that line a 4 1/2-mile bike path.  </P> <P> Unlike many 16-year-olds who would scoff at spending their weekend in the  summer heat, painting, this teen-ager seemed to be enjoying himself. For him,  the alternative was to spend a few days in jail.  </P> <P> "They lock me up if I don't do this," he said, taking a brief break from his  brush work. "This is a lot better than doing time."  </P> <P> Convicted of theft charges, the youth was eight hours shy of completing his  sentence of performing 40 hours of community service.  </P> <P> He was but one in a crew of 18 "community service employees" assigned Saturday  to paint over the graffiti covering the walls lining the bike path between  Hobart Street and Edinger Avenue. The cleanup effort is part of a Santa Ana  court's referral program that allows some defendants found guilty of  misdemeanors to forgo jail terms by performing community work instead.  </P> <P> City officials say the program, the only one of its kind in Orange County, has  324 participants and has saved Santa Ana more than $100,000 in its first six  months of operation.  </P> <P> "We provide an alternative to spending time in jail," said City Councilman  Miguel Pulido at an informal press conference. "And the program enables us to  do a lot more than we could do with city dollars."  </P> <P> For instance, Pulido said, the city is saving $45,000 by using community  service employees to maintain the Regional Transportation Center on East Santa  Ana Boulevard instead of contracting a company to do the work. They perform  such duties as shampooing rugs and landscaping that were previously contracted  out.  </P> <P> The community service employees are also assigned to other city departments and  facilities, including the library, the Santa Ana Zoo, the Fire Department and  the Parks Department.  </P> <P> The length of the sentence, which varies by judge and crime committed, has  ranged from a low of 24 hours of community service to a high of 650 hours, said  coordinator Belam Padilla, who is in charge of the program's day-to-day  activities.  </P> <P> Before receiving an assignment, workers are required to attend an orientation  session to acquaint them with the program and city policies, Padilla said.  </P> <P> "A lot of them come in with a negative attitude but leave with a more positive  one after orientation," she said, noting that the session is also a screening  process.  </P> <P> "If they come to the orientation intoxicated, we will not allow them to  participate," she said. "And we check to see if they have any prior affiliation  with gangs so we don't assign them to the wrong neighborhood to remove  graffiti."  </P> <P> Participants are also required to report on time and work at least one day per  week until their sentence is completed. While working, they are not allowed to  smoke, have visitors or use profanity.  </P> <P> The city works closely with the county Probation Department and community  organizations, such as Turning Point and the Volunteer Center, to place court  referrals in suitable departments. Padilla said each department using court  referrals is monitored daily to ensure that there are no problems and that the  work being performed is satisfactory.  </P> <P> Pulido said the program has been in the works for more than two years but was  delayed while insurance, legal and other concerns were addressed. For insurance  purposes, the participants are designated as temporary city employees but are  allowed to perform only such activities as collecting trash, filing and mopping  to minimize the possibility of accidents.  </P> <P> Once defendants have completed their required hours with the city, they receive  letters signed by the mayor thanking them for their work, Padilla said.  </P></p>

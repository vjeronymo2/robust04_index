			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Letter: Clear need for UK government to provide export credits Sir, In your editorial, 'The pleas for manufacturing' (March 8), you take a side-swipe against export credit guarantees, on the grounds that they 'help companies do business in countries where there is little security of payment'. Really? Among the top 10 markets backed by Export Credits Guarantee Department last year were Malaysia, China, South Africa, Australia and Dubai. Which of these do you view as having 'little security of payment'? The need for government backing for export credits is primarily a matter of time-scale. A typical construction project overseas can take five years or more to complete. Over that period, however secure and stable the country concerned, there will always be a risk of some unforeseen political, financial or natural upheaval frustrating the smooth development of the project. Government agencies can afford to take - indeed many would say they have a duty to take - a longer view than any private company or financial institution. This is why all major exporting countries have found it necessary to establish export credit agencies to shield their exporters from at least some of the unfore-seeable risks. Among such agencies, ECGD has for most of its long life been extremely successful, both in its primary task of encouraging the export of British goods and services, and, until recently, earning substantial profits for the exchequer. It returned to profit in 1991-92. In recent years, ECGD has been forced by government to put the cart of prudence before the horse of export promotion. Despite some welcome steps last year to redress the balance, recent surveys continue to show that, in a number of vital markets, ECGD cover remains more expensive and harder to obtain than that provided by the equivalent agencies of our competitors on the continent and overseas. Additional ECGD cover for crucial markets, a competitive premium, would be a vital catalyst for further growth in project and other exports, to the immediate benefit of the British economy, and at no immediate cost to the exchequer. There might be a real cost at some point in the future; but any additional contingent liability would represent the sort of risks which other governments find acceptable in terms of their industrial goals.

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> By now Los Angeles knows Santa Barbara artist Guy Williams as a maker of  loosely structured, intellectually astute geometric paintings. A painter's  painter, Williams' work has always reflected a belief that colored paint  conscientiously handled was content enough for art.  </P> <P> Given this, his new work and his new medium come as a particularly enticing  change.  </P> <P> Quiet, meditative emblems are built on the format of a square intersected by a  single horizontal or vertical line, but they are made from tree bark!  </P> <P> The bark has been smoothed and sanded so finely that it resembles compressed  cork. At each craggy seam, vein-like horizontal striations form, giving the  work the look of geological strata. Williams remains a painter, using the  natural variations in the wood's color to modulate tonalities and "paint" moody  atmospheres. "Asia No. 3" is exquisite and, though Williams is an artist quick  to eschew any earthbound content, one work made from the teal-tinged bark of a  eucalyptus tree (with a single filament of wood creating a central horizon  line) looks just like a vast Oriental landscape at dawn.  </P> <P> You don't need to see the titles of this "Asia" suite to know Williams is  looking East. That there is transcendent content in repose here strikes some  hyper-stimulated Americans as a little airy. The notion made contemporary art  history in the works of Barnett Newman, to whom these works owe a great debt,  and it's timely and believable in Williams' hands.

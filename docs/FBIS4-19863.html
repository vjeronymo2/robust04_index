			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] At 1700 this afternoon, President Scalfaro will  hold consultations on the formation of the 12th legislature's  first government. The first person to see him will be Senate  Speaker Carlo Scognamiglio, followed by Irene Pivetti, speaker  of the Chamber of Deputies, at 1800.    An official communique has not yet been received because all  those involved must be informed before the calendar of  appointments can be made public.    From what is known, Scalfaro is expected to continue to hold  talks tomorrow, Saturday [23 April]. Things will be placed on  hold for Sunday and the 25 April public holiday, and  consultations will end on Tuesday. The go-ahead to form a  government could come on Wednesday or Thursday.

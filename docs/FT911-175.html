			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Sanderson Electronics dips SANDERSON Electronics, the computing services group which graduated from the USM to a full listing in January, experienced a profits fall of Pounds 280,000 to Pounds 1.5m pre-tax for the half year ended March 31. The associates' contribution fell to Pounds 337,000 (Pounds 649,000) while interest charges accounted for Pounds 118,000 more at Pounds 264,000. The 16 per cent profits downturn was struck from a turnover Pounds 4.16m higher at Pounds 10.61m. Earnings per share declined by 3p to 11p. The company now pays two interim dividends and a second payment of 3.3p makes an 8.7p total for the 1990-91 year. For the 1989-90 year an interim of 3p was paid but there was no final. However, the first interim for the period under review was paid on the day the final would have been paid. Mr Paul Thompson, chairman, said that comparing the amounts paid in the calendar years, 8.7p is being paid in 1991 against 8.4p in 1990. Looking ahead, Mr Thompson said immediate progress in the UK continued to depend on the effects of the recession. He pointed out, however, that the group was well positioned with its associates to continue to expand its activities on an international basis as opportunities arose. The shares closed 13p higher at 138p.</p>

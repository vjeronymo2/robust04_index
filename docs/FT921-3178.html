			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (6): Tighter monetary and fiscal stance needed - IMF negotiations will be important for the economy as always - depend primarily on oil prices, though the outcome of the current IMF negotiations will also have far-reaching implications. Nigeria's 1990 International Monetary Fund standby agreement in effect lapsed last year when domestic credit ceilings were overshot. Since Nigeria does not draw on its fund facility, the main importance of the current talks to secure a new standby is access to Paris Club debt relief. Without the IMF imprimatur, not only will there be no debt relief but funding big forthcoming projects, such as the Dollars 4bn needed for the liquefied natural gas scheme, will be well-nigh impossible. The fund programme fell apart because domestic credit rose 42 per cent last year to N75bn, compared with an IMF-agreed target ceiling of some N52bn. That was the result of a 26 per cent increase in private sector credit and almost 70 per cent in government borrowing. An immediate consequence was a widening of the gap between the official exchange rate and the parallel market from 25 per cent in early 1991 to more than 90 per cent by February this year. By floating the naira and abandoning the artificial rate of N10.5 to the dollar, the Nigerians have taken a decisive step towards a new Fund agreement. At the first 'free' auction, the rate plunged to N18, though bankers speculate that as and when liquidity is squeezed, there will be some recovery possibly to N15 or N16 to the dollar. But the IMF is going to want a good deal more, insisting that without public spending cutbacks and a tight money policy, excess demand for foreign exchange will continue to undermine the exchange rate. Last week, a new tranche of stabilisation securities was issued taking an estimated N4 billion out of the system and with the first post-float auction draining at least N10 billion from the banks, money market liquidity has tightened considerably. But the Nigerians, deeply concerned at the political implications of new stagflationary measures - naira devaluation and increased petrol prices, if the domestic petrol subsidy is phased out as demanded by the IMF, will mean higher inflation later this year - have precious little room for manoeuvre. They hope the IMF will take a lenient view, but its bottom line will still be a far tighter fiscal and monetary stance than at present, in addition to exchange rate liberalisation. All of which means that if a debt crisis is to be averted, economic growth must slow, - even further than the oil price-induced recessiuon - and interest rates rise as liquidity is squeezed . With such a scenario, growth would fall from 4.3 per cent last year and more than 8 per cent in 1990, to no more than 1 to 2 per cent in 1992. Lower oil prices are already having an impact on economic activity while industrialists complain that capacity utilisation is falling once again, and profits are being squeezed by higher import prices and interest rates. Inflation, which reached 20 per cent at the end of 1991, averaging 15 per cent over the year, is set to move well above 30 per cent in the first half of 1992 as last year's monetary excesses and naira depreciation take their toll of retail prices. Even with an IMF package, inflation is likely to double to around 30 per cent this year. Without one, it will be substantially higher - at least 40 per cent. The balance of payments outlook hinges on oil and debt; the 1992 foreign exchange budget projects total earnings of Dollars 8.9bn, of which Dollars 7.4bn would be oil revenue. This looks to be unduly low since, with a price of Dollars 18 and exports of 1.43m barrels a day, revenues would come close to Dollars 9.4bn. The budget allocates Dollars 2.3bn for external debt-service (30 per cent of 'official' export earnings of Dollars 7.4bn), but since this is well below the Dollars 5.8bn in scheduled obligations, the assumption must be either than the authorities expect to conclude a debt-rescheduling agreement by the end of 1992 or that oil earnings will be substantially higher than forecast. In 1992, the provision of only Dollars 4.25bn to fund non-oil imports - less than last year's Dollars 4.5bn - will constrain investment and output growth, while maintaining upward pressure on prices. Given the binding nature of the import and debt-service constraints, the only option open to the authorities for stabilising prices and the exchange rate is demand management. But after four years in which real private consumer spending has been growing at less than 1 per cent while population increases at 3 per cent a year, it is hardly surprising that the government should be so reluctant to tighten its policy stance when output is already flagging. If the authorities are serious about letting the naira find its own level, there is now no alternative to decisive action on both the monetary and fiscal fronts, but especially the former. . If this is done, then an IMF agreement, and probably also Paris Club debt relief, are within the government's grasp. But time is not on the government's side, and if there is to be a debt agreement this year, the Nigerians must settle their differences with the IMF by July at the latest.</p>

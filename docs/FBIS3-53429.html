Ayatollah Emami-Kashani, in continuation of the prayers,  while commemorating martyrs of the Islamic revolution and the  imposed war, praised the disabled, the missing in action and the  POWs of the Islamic Iran.    The interim Friday prayer leader of Tehran, pointing to the  enmity of the arrogant powers with Islam said: The United  Nations and the West commit crimes against Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the world arrogant powers and the  Zionism commit crimes in Palestine and Lebanon, and their  intervention in Afghanistan has made the Afghan groups fight  each other. The interim Friday prayer leader of Tehran then  stated that the arrogant powers must know that their crimes only  disgrace them in the eyes and opinion of the world nations and  they will never succeed in destroying Islam.</p>

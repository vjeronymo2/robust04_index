			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oil sector wavers Uncertainty created by President Boris Yeltsin's dissolution of the Russian parliament was ultimately responsible for sending leading oil shares higher in early trading. However, the market took a phlegmatic view of potential eastern European chaos and most of the gains were reversed. The initial view that political turmoil would restrict oil supplies forced the price of Brent crude higher. Oil shares were bought in the US and the subsequent shortage of stock in London led to a squeeze. However, Brent fell back and the shortage was filled. Also, Lehman Brothers, the US investment house, officially released downgrades relating to a sector review last Friday. The house shifted BP to a sell from neutral and Shell Transport to neutral from buy. BP, which had been up 5, closed 1 1/2 ahead at 302 1/2 p and Shell lost an earlier gain of 5 to end a net penny down at 638p.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Lib Dems reveal Tory poll fears The Liberal Democrats yesterday sought to undermine the morale of Conservative activists gathering for a weekend conference by unveiling a leaked document revealing alarm within the Tory party over the Liberal Democrat threat. The 16-page document, written by a Conservative Central Office researcher shortly after the 1992 general election, states that the 'Liberal Democrats in the 1990s have to be taken as a serious threat by both the two major parties'. It says that Conservatives 'must wake up to the fact that no seat in the whole of the south-west can any longer be taken for granted as 'safe'', and that the Liberal Democrat resurgence means the Conservative party 'is faced with the very real threat of losing its majority at the next general election'. Mr Matthew Taylor, Liberal Democrat chairman of campaigns, said yesterday that the document showed how concerned the Tories were about prospects in the forthcoming local and European elections. The release of the research paper coincides with the start of the annual Conservative Central Council in Plymouth, seen as an opportunity for Tory managers to take their election campaign into the Liberal Democrat heartland. Mr Taylor said the document showed why the Tories were convening in Plymouth. 'That is why they are attacking us on a daily basis, why we believe they are right to be worried,' he said. The research document predicts that, in the European elections in June this year, the Euro seats of Cornwall and Plymouth, and Somerset and Dorset West would be 'very vulnerable: on the basis of 1992 voting the Liberal Democrats require only a 5 per cent swing to take either of them'. Yesterday, Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, accused the Liberal Democrats of being 'Labour's bedfellows' and 'leftwing opportunists'. He told journalists in London that the Liberal Democrats were 'a party of the left for the left'. He added: 'Like Labour, their activists and MPs remain committed to higher taxes, higher spending, more state intervention and greater union power.' The counter-attack will not disguise the difficulties the Conservatives face in Plymouth, with the conference certain to be dominated by the growing storm over Britain's voting powers in an enlarged European Union.</p>

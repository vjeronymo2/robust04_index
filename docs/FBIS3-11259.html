The Military Intelligence  Services institution has asked EL TIEMPO, a Bogota daily, to  explain a report published Friday stating Monsignor Nel Beltran  attended the alleged meeting. Gen. Tapia said the newspaper's  report is not in line with any document prepared by Military  Intelligence Services and therefore such a document could not  have been delivered to the media.</p>

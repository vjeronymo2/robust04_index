			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CARLSBAD VOTING TODAY ON HOTEL TAX, RECREATION  </P> <P> Carlsbad voters will decide today on whether to increase the city's hotel room  tax from 8% to 10% to provide funds to build major recreational facilities,  including two public golf courses.  </P> <P> Carlsbad's 36,000 registered voters face two propositions in the special  election: Proposition F seeks to raise the transient occupancy tax rate by 2%,  with the revenue earmarked for the General Fund; Proposition G, an advisory  measure, asks voters to approve the spending of more than $1 million in city  funds to build recreational facilities.  </P> <P> If approved, the two propositions -- endorsed unanimously by Carlsbad's five  council members -- will enable the city to pursue its long-sought goal of  constructing two golf courses, a multicourt tennis complex, two multipurpose  recreational fields and an enclosed soccer facility. The facilities are  expected to cost from $6 million to $8 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Room Tax Raised Last Year  </P> <P> Opponents of the ballot measures, including the city's hotel and motel  association, say the tax rise would inflate room rates and send tourists  elsewhere. The room tax was already raised last year, from 6% to 8%.  </P> <P> The Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce also opposes Proposition F, but backs  Proposition G.  </P> <P> "The main thing is we feel Proposition F is unfairly hitting one industry for  recreational facilities that will benefit everyone in the community," said Lee  Bohlmann, chamber executive vice president.  </P> <P> But, advocates say, the recreational facilities would make Carlsbad more  attractive and help boost tourism.  </P> <P> Councilman John Mamaux said the recreational facilities would pay back  residents who often bear the burdens of tourism -- crowds and traffic. The  transient occupancy tax rate had stood at 6% for 23 years, from 1965 until  1988, he added.  </P> <P> Although city leaders' attempts to raise the hotel tax to pay for recreation  have failed twice before, council members hope the third try will be a charm.  </P> <P> In previous elections -- most recently last November -- ballot measures asked  that tax-rise revenue be earmarked for recreational facilities. Such a  provision requires two-thirds voter support. In each prior case, the tax rise  failed to get the needed votes, but did receive majority support, proponents  said.  </P> <P> Hoping to avoid a similar defeat this time, city leaders drafted propositions  that only need majority support for approval.  </P></p>

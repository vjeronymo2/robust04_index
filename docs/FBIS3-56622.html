Reports say fierce fighting  continues at that section of the front.    On Tuesday morning there was a relative lull at other  sections of the front.    In the morning of January 18 an Azeri war plane attempted to  drop bombs on Stepanakert, the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh. The  Karabakh air defenses forced the plane away from the city.    Meanwhile, a source in the Azeri Defense Ministry spoke  about  attempts by the Armenian forces to attack the strategic railway  station at Goradiz, but were recently beaten off by the Azeri  army. The station is situated near the Azeri-Iranian border.  Two attacks to re-capture the station were thwarted. A  Karabakh tank was put out of action.    The source also spoke about fighting on Monday evening to  the  east of the Azeri regional center of Agdam, which is under  Armenian control, as well as at the approaches to the village of  Novruzlu, where, the source says, a Karabakh armored personnel  vehicle was put out of action.    In the early hours of Tuesday, the fighting at this section  of the front, as well as in the north part of the conflict zone,  was restricted by sporadic artillery shelling.    The source says four local inhabitants were wounded as a  result of the shelling of Azeri settlements bordering on Armenia.</p>

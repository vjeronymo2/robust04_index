			<p>BFN     [Text] Libreville, 8 Apr (AFP) -- The state of alert and  the curfew that has been in force almost constantly for four  months in Gabon were lifted this evening, government spokesman  Paulette Missambo announced after a meeting of the Council of  Ministers.    "After a report by Defense Minister General Idriss Ngari to  the Council of Ministers on the calm prevailing in the country,  the council decided to lift this emergency regulation as of  today," Mrs. Missambo added in a statement to the media at the  end of the first session of the new Gabonese Government formed  on 25 March.    The state of alert, "an emergency decree restricting public  liberties" that bans demonstrations and provides for the  imposition of a curfew, was decreed on 9 December 1993 following  disturbances in Libreville after the reelection of President  Omar Bongo was announced.    The head of state's victory in the first round of the  country's first multiparty presidential election was challenged  by the opposition, which claimed it had been won by one of their  leaders, Father Paul Mba Abessole, chairman of the National  Lumberjacks Rally [RNB].    Lifted on 13 February, the state of alert was reimposed a  week later as a general strike called for by a confederation of  labor unions close to the opposition resulted in fresh violence  in Libreville. Many densely populated districts of the capital  were affected by the disturbances, which lasted four days.  According to official figures, nine people, including two  soldiers, were killed in the violence.    The government blamed Father Mba Abessole and his party for  the unrest, but the charges were rejected by the opposition.  The RNB's radio in Libreville was destroyed "in retaliation,"  according to the authorities, by the security forces who also  attacked the opposition leader's residence.    In response to the violence, the main opposition leaders,  grouped within the High Council of Resistance, called for the  opening of "true talks" with the government, while laying down a  series of conditions, including the lifting of the state of  alert.</p>

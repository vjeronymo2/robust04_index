			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Allied-Lyons to pay Pounds 739m for Pedro Domecq Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks and food group, is to pay Pounds 739m for control of Pedro Domecq Group, the Spanish drinks producer. Allied said yesterday the deal would make it the world's second largest spirits producer, with 13 of the top 100 spirits brands. Allied will finance the purchase with a Pounds 651m rights issue. It forecast its pre-tax profits in the year to March 1994 at Pounds 604m, or Pounds 630m before exceptionals, compared to Pounds 620m before exceptionals the year before. Allied said it would change its name to Allied Domecq, dropping the name of J. Lyons - once famous for its teashops - which Allied acquired in 1978. The top management of the family-owned Domecq are to remain. Mr Ramon Mora-Figueroa, Domecq's chief executive, is expected to join the Allied board, although Allied refused to comment. Domecq, best known in the UK for sherry brands such as La Ina, made 50 per cent of its profits last year from Mexico, where it owns Presidente, the largest-selling brandy in the world. Allied will also take control of Sauza, Mexico's second largest tequila brand. Mr Tony Hales, Allied's chief executive, said 'the Domecq brands are a real gateway for us in Latin America.' In a complex deal Allied, which already owns 32 per cent of Domecq, will buy out the 500-strong Domecq family, whose members want to realise their holdings. Mr Mora-Figueroa, who belongs to the family, will protect its position by retaining a 27 per cent holding in Domecq, with the option to sell to Allied over the next six years. Allied said he was not expected to sell within the first year. Mr Mora-Figueroa said 'hopefully' Allied would eventually own 100 per cent. Mr Michael Jackaman, Allied's chairman, said the deal would concentrate the group's focus on drinks and retailing. Allied also has food manufacturing interests, and in 1992 merged its UK brewing interests into a joint venture with Carlsberg of Denmark. Allied said its sales of spirits would almost double from 23m cases to 45m a year. Based on volume sales of the world's top 100 spirits brands, this put it second to Grand Metropolitan of the UK and ahead of Guinness. Allied said the purchase price for Domecq, which made just under Pta20bn (Pounds 97m) before tax and restructuring costs last year, represented 15.2 times last year's earnings. Allied's share price fell 7 per cent to 561p. Analysts said the rights issue had been unexpected and the profits forecast was disappointing.

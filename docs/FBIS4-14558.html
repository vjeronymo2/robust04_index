			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina and </F> Anna Melnikova]    [Text] Moscow, 31 March -- "The investigation into the case  of the `versions' of the coup d'etat has thrown up the three  people who, technically speaking, were the perpetrators of the  provocation," Russian Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav  Kostikov said at today's briefing in the Kremlin; not to mention  the fact that the name of the person behind "version No. 1" is  already known to the public, he recalled, meaning the journalist  Gleb Pavlovskiy. "The question now is whether there are clients  behind these people, something the investigation will now  reveal," Vyacheslav Kostikov said.    Replying to a question as to who would benefit from this  provocation, the press secretary emphasized that neither the  president nor his team "had gained any dividends from this  sensational story, which is testimony to the lack of any  interest on their part in this petty game."    In Vyacheslav Kostikov's opinion, those who were interested  in this provocation are those political forces who have been  striving "to sound out the level of stability in society and the  degree of the president's staying-power." He believes that on  both these criteria, "the result has proved positive. Even the  extremist political forces have not used the provocation to make  statements, and the president did not interrupt his holiday,  although a year ago he would surely have got into an aircraft  and flown to Moscow."    So, Vyacheslav Kostikov concluded, this impartial story has  nevertheless demonstrated a definite "level of civic accord in  society." At the same time, the president's press secretary did  not argue with journalists over the fact that the publication of  the "versions" of the coup reflected a degree of indifference on  the part of society to political scandals on the Olympus of  power.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Ukraine holds arms export talks with India UKRAINE is negotiating a big arms export deal with India which could include warships as well as spare parts for Soviet-supplied tanks and aircraft. India, whose fleet includes modern destroyers made at the Nikolayev yards in Ukraine, has expressed interest in additional naval vessels including aircraft carriers, according to officials from the two countries. It currently has two aircraft carriers bought second-hand from Britain. It is also seeking spares for its modern T-72 tanks and earlier T-55 models, as well as for its medium-range Antonov An-32 transport aircraft. India previously bought most of its arms from the Soviet Union. Mr Sharad Pawar, the Indian minister of defence, was scheduled today to conclude a visit to Ukraine, where many of the factories and shipyards which supply those weapons are located. The deal under discussion is expected to be based largely on barter. 'It has been agreed by both sides that Ukraine will not have any problem supplying the spare parts,' the Indian embassy said. Mr Viktor Antonov, Ukraine's armaments minister, said his country's chief aim was to replace the old Soviet-Indian contract with a direct bilateral agreement or even three-way arrangements involving Russia as well. He complained that payment for the An-32s - produced in Ukraine and supplied to India in the dying days of the Soviet Union - was going to Russia. 'Our factories will not work for free,' Mr Antonov said. 'That is why, as an independent state, we would like to conclude bilateral agreements.' Indian trade with the former Soviet Union was facilitated by a rouble-rupee clearing arrangement. That has now fallen apart and Mr Antonov said it was difficult to find an alternative. The Indian deal points to the emergence of Ukraine as an important international arms supplier. Ukrainian officials denied suggestions this year that the country paid for 5m tonnes of Iranian oil with weapons.</p>

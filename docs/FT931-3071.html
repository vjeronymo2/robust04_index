			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Letter: Hitch to contracting-out plans no red herring Sir, David Goodhart's article on the Transfer of Undertakings Regulations ('Tupe or not Tupe . . .', March 15) illustrates the problems that the government's market-testing initiative has hit. It is ironic that some Tory MPs are complaining that the Acquired Rights Directive is an anti-competitive measure. One of the arguments behind its implementation was to promote genuine competition across the Community. It is only regarded as anti-competitive because the British government appears hell bent on creating an offshore Taiwan in Europe. Mr Waldegrave, minister for public service, continues to be one of the very few trying to sell the idea that the Tupe regulations are a 'red herring' that will have no impact on the market-testing programme. Christopher Chope, his ex-colleague and fervent exponent of contracting-out, is more reliable when he told a recent seminar that the European Court would 'drive a coach and horses through the competitive tendering legislation'; that he is 'working on the assumption that all contracts will be caught by the Acquired Rights Directive'; and that he thinks 'it is a political impossibility to get the 1977 directive amended'. The humiliating collapse of the government's position in the South Glamorgan case ('Government admits defeat over contracting-out case', March 16) is further evidence of the real impact of Tupe. This is a red herring that bites back. John Sheldon, general secretary, NUCPS, 124/130 Southwark Street, London SE1 0TU</p>

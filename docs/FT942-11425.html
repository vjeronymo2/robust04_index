			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo remains in focus There was plenty of activity but no real share price performance in Lasmo in spite of a spate of rumours that a cash bid of 155p to 160p from either Enterprise Oil or a counter-bidder is imminent. There was also very heavy activity in Lasmo traded options, where the equivalent of 4.5m shares changed hands. Atlantic Richfield, the US oil group, was the name most frequently mentioned in the market but was regarded as unlikely by some analysts. Lasmo ordinary stock closed unchanged at 148p after turnover of 8.1m and was held up by the stable performance of Enterprise shares, also unaltered at 410p. Lasmo nil-paid shares settled a penny off at 43p with 4.7m traded.</p>

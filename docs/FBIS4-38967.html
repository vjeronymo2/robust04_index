			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Leonid Kuchma, former Prime Minister of </F> Ukraine and incumbent President of the Ukrainian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, by Boris Sverdlov; in Kiev,  date not given: "Leonid Kuchma: Ukraine Cannot Manage Without  Economic Alliance With Russia"]    [Text] Kiev -- Former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who is  currently president of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs, is one of the most popular figures in the  republic. Some people -- and they constitute a majority -- are  ready to support Leonid Danilovich without hesitation in the  presidential election despite serious failings in the economy  under his government. Others -- they, too, are fairly numerous  -- place virtually every catastrophe ever to have befallen  Ukraine at his door. While the mass media never tire of forging  an antihero out of him. Nevertheless, at this point in time he  is firmly rooted on the front row of the ratings grid, shunting  L. Kravchuk into second place. Kuchma himself attributes this  to the following:    [Kuchma] I have always spoken the truth; indeed, I always do  speak the truth. It may not be very nice, but it is the truth.  Most people like to hear the truth, but not everyone. Can you  really tell me that my assertion that we cannot survive without  economic alliance with Russia will please those who envisage a  Ukraine geared toward the West? Or else I am reproached  nowadays with not having had a clear idea of the type of state  which we are building -- socialist, or capitalist -- while  executing the duties of head of the government. In actual fact  I did not know, and I was not ashamed to ask the legislators  about this in public.    [Sverdlov] What do you think of the new Ukrainian  parliament?    [Kuchma] My position is known. I would like to see the  Supreme Council occupied not so much with politics as with  economics. Unfortunately, many representatives from political  parties were elected to it. On the one hand the parliament is  too right-wing, and on the other it is too left-wing. If the  extremes fail to meet each other halfway, Ukraine will lie idle  for a long time yet. The managerial corps acceded to  legislative power in too weak a condition. However, there are  many deputies in parliament who are ready to devote their  efforts entirely to reviving the economy. I pin great hopes on  them.    [Sverdlov] You are aware that a consultative poll of the  population was conducted in the Donbass during the elections.  The overwhelming majority expressed support for Ukraine's entry  into the Commonwealth of Independent States, a federal  structure, and the attribution to Russian of the status of the  second state language. Do you share their point of view?    [Kuchma] I have advocated and still advocate Ukraine's entry  into the CIS. Nobody is waiting to receive us in the West as  yet. Especially with the quality of goods being produced at  current levels. Which is why it is essential to make every  effort to support integration toward the East. Yet we are doing  everything possible to prevent this. It is very easy to lose  the sales market in Russia. There will be states poised to fill  the niche. Indeed, they are already filling the gaps. It is  far harder to conquer the market afterward. Indeed, once it  gets used to doing without us, Russia will hardly want to begin  focusing attention on us again. In this respect I am in complete  sympathy with the Donbass people. As, indeed, I am on the point  of the regions' possessing greater autonomy. I stated this on  the very first day after Ukraine acquired independence. As for  the language problem, I believe that the state language should  be just Ukrainian, but that the official languages should be  Russian and Ukrainian.    [Sverdlov] What is the difference?    [Kuchma] The state language is the language of diplomacy and  law. Official languages apply in every other sphere.    [Sverdlov] It became known recently that you advocate  setting up a party of industrialists and entrepreneurs. Have  you set about fulfilling this task?    [Kuchma] Without an influential party of industrialists and  entrepreneurs, it is very difficult to resolve questions of  reforming the economy. And we will set up such a party in the  very near future. There are many deputies in the new parliament  with a tremendous desire to top up the ranks of our party, and  this will open the way to forming the type of government which  will not be in awe of the Supreme Council.    [Sverdlov] What economic program will you be taking to the  presidential election?    [Kuchma] Look first at what is happening with the republic  economy. In the first quarter of this year alone industrial  output fell by one third. In the machine-building sector it  fell by 40 percent. Hundreds of enterprises have ground to a  halt. And both the domestic and foreign debts have hit  astronomical figures.    My program for getting out of the crisis is primarily the  program of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. As  for the first steps, it is above all necessary to loosen  taxation on commodity producers. They are quite simply being  suffocated by them. Accounting by promissory note [vekselnyy  zachet] should also be carried out between enterprises, as this  will provide an opportunity to identify bankruptcies. Some of  these enterprises, having no future, will have to be shut down,  while others will have to be retooled. And of course, we should  renounce the fixed rate for the karbovanets against the dollar,  which renders all our output for export loss-making.    [Sverdlov] But if you are gunning for bankruptcies, then it  follows, for instance, that coal enterprises first and foremost  must be cut back. It is these enterprises which are currently  up to their eyeballs in debt.    [Kuchma] The wisdom of any government resides in its skill  in forecasting. Otherwise the hatchets could come down too  vigorously! Yes, the coal enterprises in Ukraine are  loss-making. However, we have no other fuel. Which means that  investment and state support are necessary.    [Sverdlov] Today many people are stressing the inexpediency  of holding a presidential election. What is your view on this  score?    [Kuchma] There is a law, and it should be observed. There  are no grounds for calling off the presidential election.</p>

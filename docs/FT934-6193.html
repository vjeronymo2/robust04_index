			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Motorway charges put on hold until after election The government has decided to press ahead with its long-term plan for electronic charging of motorway users, but ruled out proposals for an interim system of permits to finance maintenance improvements on the motorway network. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, is expected to announce before Christmas that there will be no charges for motorway users this side of the general election due by 1997. But his cabinet colleagues have given him the go-ahead to develop a scheme for electronic road tolls - based on computerised recorders or tags in cars and lorries - which could be operational by 1998, a year or so after the last date for the election. The transport department's wrangle with the Treasury over whether money raised through the road charges should be committed in full to spending on the network is unresolved. Treasury ministers remain strongly opposed to this direct hypothecation of revenue from user charges. With the Pounds 19bn road-building programme one of the main targets of the government's public spending squeeze, Mr MacGregor floated the idea, in a consultation paper during the summer, of charging for monthly or yearly motorway permits. The roads programme will be one of the main victims of the spending cuts in next Tuesday's Budget, although Mr MacGregor has won a firm commitment from the Treasury to fill some of the resulting gap through privately-financed schemes. The government's green paper on road pricing suggested a permit system could bridge the gap before the technology which is under development is sufficiently advanced to introduce electronic pricing. Ministers said the government could introduce a scheme similar to Switzerland's vignette system - under which motorists display a permit bought from post offices or petrol stations - by 1996. But Mr MacGregor intends to announce within the next few weeks that the government has decided the idea is unworkable. He has rejected it for political and practical reasons. On one level ministers decided that it would be foolish to introduce any charges before the next general election. On another they concluded that the flat-rate charges implied by permits would alienate many traditional Conservative party supporters in rural or semi-rural areas who use sections of the motorway for relatively short journeys. The practical difficulties include the fact that the cost of permits would bear no relation to use or to the timing of journeys. Once they had bought a permit motorists could increase their use of motorways to get the most from the cost. A flat-rate charge would also provide no incentive for drivers to travel offpeak. By contrast electronic pricing would provide the flexibility to vary charges for length and timing and charges would be on a strictly pay-as-go basis.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Technology: The perfect bath every time - Worth Watching A battery-powered automatic bath filler has won 14-year-old Leo Currie, from Glasgow, first prize in the Duracell Science and Technology Schools Competition. The gadget comprises four hoses - two to fit on the taps and two to carry the water into the bath - joined by a black box. An attached sensor is positioned down the side of the bath to indicate the height to which the bath should be filled, while a heat sensor in the box is programmed to ensure the water is at the correct temperature.

Kamath: "The Fate of Kashmiri Pandits"] </F>   [Text] An international conference of Kashmiri Pandits was  held in Delhi in the last week of December 1993 to focus the  attention firstly of all Indians and secondly of the world  beyond, on their present fate. And what is their fate? Their  fate is to live as refugees in places outside the Vale of  Kashmir which has been their ancestral home for centuries, in  make-shift tents, braving the cold in winter and the searing  heat in summer with no proper sanitary facilities and less  medical attention. Organisations like Asia Watch while raising  howls about the difficulties of Kashmiri Muslims, make no more  than passing reference to the inhuman brutalities with which the  Muslim terrorists have dealt with them. Over three lakh Kashmiri  Pandits have been forced to flee their homes under threat of  death. The terrorists have indulged in the rape of women and the  killing of men in the best style of invading Muslim hordes of  the Middle Ages. The latest incident is the shooting down of a  hundred-year old Kashmiri Pandit in Wanpora in the first week of  June 1993. In what way an aged man could have menaced Islam only  the terrorists can tell. The Kashmir Government is silent on  this as on other reckless murders. The Government of India is  embarrassingly silent. Nobody wants to speak out lest their  secular credentials are questioned by anyone. In 1941, according  to census figures, Muslims formed 83 percent of the population  of the Vale of Kashmir and Hindus 15 percent. In 1991 Muslims  formed 97 percent of the population and Hindus 0.1 percent.  Ethnic cleansing is complete. Aurangzeb would have been proud of  the Muslim terrorists for the splendid work the latter have  accomplished in the last four decades. According to a booklet  published by the Kashmiri Samiti on human rights violation in  Kashmir, the terrorist killings have been accompanied by torture  unheard of in the annals of human history and includes  strangulation by using steel wires, hanging, impaling, branding  with red hot irons, burning alive, lynching, gouging of eyes  before assassination, dismemberment of body, dragging to death  and just plain slaughter. The booklet gives details including  the names of those killed and the dates they were killed. The  Government of India is free to challenge these facts and if they  are untrue, this should be publicised. If they are true, we need  an explanation. According to the booklet "the (Kashmiri) State  Government is yet to disclose the identity of about 400 dead  bodies recovered by the police and disposed of at its will". The  booklet accuses the State Government of an attempt "to cover the  anti-Hindu character of the terrorist violence and has tried to  play down the massacre of Hindus". It is true that the  terrorists have also killed Muslims not in their good books.  Total civilians so far killed number 2,256 in five years  (1988-1992) for which figures are available. The majority, of  course, are Hindus -- Kashmiri Pandits. The unpleasant fact  about Kashmir and its terrorist faction is that the crusade is  to merge the State with Pakistan and drive every single Hindu  out. Already the ethnic cleansing is almost complete. The brunt  of hatred has been borne by the Kashmiri Pandits who have been  denied elementary human rights. But to this date the fate of the  Kashmiri Pandits is of no concern to anybody.    But let it be said clearly and precisely: Kashmir belongs to  the Kashmiri Pandits, the original inhabitants of the state --  and NOT to the Muslims, just as Kuwait, or Oman or Bahrain which  have non-Muslim majorities belong to the local Muslims because  the latter are the original inhabitants of the areas.  Islam came to India only in the 12th century. That a good number  of the original Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam does not  hide the fact that the background and the past of all  Kashmiris is Hindu and should be recognised as such. The list of  distinguished Kashmiri poets and scholars in Sanskrit from the  Vedic period right on to the 12th century is long and  impressive. The list tapers off following the advent of islam in  the Vale.    To say that Kashmir is Muslim is a negation of history and a  pandering to the whims of the neo-historians. Kashmir was, is  and shall remain essentially Hindu and cannot be permitted to go  into the hands of Pakistan for the last traces of Hinduism to be  wiped out for ever. That is why the Kashmiris have been asking  for a "homeland" of their own. That homeland can only be in  Kashmir, not in Dandakaranya or somewhere in the wilds of Madhya  Pradesh. And there is nothing fanciful in the demand of the  Pandits. If Jews in their diaspora could dream and fight for a  Jewish state two thousand years after they were dispersed in the  four corners of Europe and get the support of modern states like  Britain, France and United States and other smaller nations,  there is no reason why the Kashmiri Pandits should not ask for a  homeland here and now, while their status as refugees is  temporary. There is an attempt made by our "intellectuals" to  fob off the Kashmiri Pandits with false promises by saying that,  why, of course, they could get back to their homes they were  forced to vacate when the Kashmir issue is "settled". Nobody  asks the question: Settled how? Or when? Or under what  conditions? They are not consulted when the foreign secretaries  of India and Pakistan discuss the so-called "Kashmir Question"  as if their fate is of no moment. Aren't they entitled to know?  Are they destined for ever to live as refugees at the mercy as  much of a callous government as of a callous class of  "intellectuals"?    There can be -- and there should be -- no Kashmir  "settlement" without the guaranteed return of the Kashmiri  Pandits to their ancestral homes. And even that is not enough.  The State should guarantee that they will not be treated as  second class citizens as has been the case these last four  decades. They cannot be left to the tender mercies of  ex-terrorists and their ilk. One can be sure that if Pakistan  has its way, there will be no place for Kashmiri Pandits in  Kashmir, which is their legitimate home. Under no circumstances  should this be allowed to come to pass. Islamic terrorists  should not be allowed to get away with murder. To support  Kashmiri Pandits in their just cause -- which is a demand for a  homeland -- is not communalism. Conceding that  Kashmir is "Muslim" is reverse communalism. Kashmiri  Pandits have a sound case and it should be presented in every  international forum. The Government has to stop being defeatist.  Kashmir cannot be given away to Pakistan; nor can it be handed  over on a platter to Islamic fundamentalists. The safe return of  the Kashmiri Pandits to their ancestral homes is -- and should  be -- the special responsibility of the Government of India  which cannot be dodged or made slight of. Kashmir is the  homeland of the Pandits -- and so it will remain.  *</p>

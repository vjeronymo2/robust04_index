			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Jerusalem pressed to free more prisoners PALESTINIAN negotiators yesterday pressed Israel for a more rapid and extensive release of prisoners as the two sides resumed peace talks at the Egyptian resort of Taba. The talks, centring on the transfer of limited powers to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, are due to be completed by mid-December. The Palestinians, while welcoming this week's release of 617 prisoners, stressed that many more of the estimated 11,000 still held had to be freed to win greater popular support. They insisted that prisoners from factions other than Fatah, headed by Mr Yassir Arafat, had to be included. 'We are not happy,' Palestinian delegate Ziad Abu Ziad said. 'We are trying to make peace between Palestinians and Israelis, not between Israel and a faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. If peace has a broader base it will have wider support.' Israel has so far refused to free prisoners belonging to radical Islamic groups, such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Premier Yitzhak Rabin of Israel said yesterday that the agreement with the PLO provided only for the release of a limited number of prisoners at this stage. How many more could be freed would depend on progress made in the peace talks. In Damascus, one of the radical Palestinian groups opposed to the outline peace agreement said it had agreed with Fatah to end clashes in the Gaza strip. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said the agreement was reached during talks between representatives of both groups.</p>

			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA;  </P> <P> WRITE-IN CANDIDATE LOSES IN COUNCIL BID  </P> <P> With all absentee votes tallied, write-in candidate Wally Linn fell short in  his bid for City Council.  </P> <P> Incumbents Larry A. Herman and Orbrey Duke were able to fend off Linn, who  received only 571 votes. Linn, a real estate broker, finished fifth behind  challengers Christian Basquette and Kenneth Tipton. The candidates were  competing for two four-year terms.  </P> <P> Herman and Duke, who were ahead after the original counts, maintained their  strong leads. In the final tally, Duke received 2,276 votes and Herman received  2,134.  </P> <P> Linn entered the race on the last possible day and campaigned hard in the weeks  before the election. However, because he was a write-in candidate, his name did  not appear on the ballot. LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

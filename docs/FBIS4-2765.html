			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- China produced more  than 34 million tons of onshore oil in the first quarter of this  year, slightly higher than a year ago.    "This production makes up 24.7 percent of the projected  total  for the whole year," said an official from the China Oil and Gas  Corporation, which is responsible for onshore oil exploration,  development and production across China.    Oil production in the first quarter used to be lower than  the  following quarters because of the holidays and the commencement  of construction of new oil wells, the official explained.  Considering this, he added, this year's figure is "really  better than expected."    He said that the stabilized production in the oil fields in  eastern China and the increasing oil output in western China,  were the "two contributing factors."    In eastern China, oil output was maintained at the level of  the fourth quarter of last year in spite of even greater  difficulties in extracting oil from mature fields, he said.    The methods of controlling water cut and confining oil  deposits and the techniques of tertiary oil extraction have been  used in Daqing and Shengli oil fields to avoid output  fluctuation. Oil exploration was intensified at the same time,  the official said.    He disclosed that oil production in western China, including  the Tarim Basin, was up 13.2 percent from the same period last  year. There also appeared improvement in crude transportation  toward the eastern region, thanks to coordinating efforts.    China's onshore natural gas production in the first quarter  was registered at 3.9 billion cubic meters, 25.4 percent of the  planned total for this year.    Challenged by growing demand for oil because of rapid  economic growth, China's oil industry has worked out the  strategy of "stabilizing oil production in eastern China while  developing western China."    More efforts were called for earlier this year to maintain  oil output in mature fields at the level of 124 million tons  each year in the three years to come. On this basis, oil output  in western China will be markedly increased.    According to the China Oil and Gas Corporation, China  onshore  oil production is targeted at 140 million tons and that of  natural gas 16 billion cubic meters this year.    As long as oil production keeps up the trend set by the  first  quarter, predicted an official, these targets are likely to be  reached.</p>

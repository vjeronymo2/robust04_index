			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / EC disputes Japanese claim on car export curbs JAPAN has agreed to cut car and light commercial vehicle exports to the EC by 6 per cent this year, Brussels officials said yesterday, contradicting EC and Japanese officials in Tokyo who said the cut was likely to be 1.5 to 2 per cent. A senior Commission official in Brussels said the EC would never have accepted a cut of 2 per cent. Officially, neither side will discuss the specific terms of the agreement, which involves Japan 'monitoring' its exports to the EC, but there was confusion about the implications of the deal, reflecting the sensitivity of the issue. 'The key thing here is that the Japanese have accepted to reduce exports,' said Mr Antonio Menezes, spokesman for the delegation of the EC in Tokyo. An official of the vehicle division of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said: 'The EC and Japan both recognise that demand in the EC will decline by 1.5 to 2 per cent compared to 1991. Japan will monitor car exports so as not to cause market disruption.' The official said that the agreement was made taking into account the difficulties of European vehicle makers, and that it would be desirable for Japanese exports to decline by slightly more than the contraction of the market. But it was maintained in Brussels yesterday that Japanese exports of cars and light commercial vehicles would fall by 75,000 units to 1.185m this year  -a drop of 6 per cent from 1.26m last year. The Japanese share of the EC car and light commercial vehicle market would fall to 11 per cent this year from 11.3 per cent last year. Earlier, the Japanese authorities had appeared surprised by reports out of Brussels that they might reduce exports by 5 per cent. The 1992 agreement is the last before a longer-term agreement comes into force, with the aim of opening the Community market gradually between 1993 and 1999. The 1993-99 deal is a similar 'gentleman's agreement' and - like this week's accord - was called into question almost as soon as it had been made. European car-makers have been hit by the decline in demand and restructuring costs, but it remains unclear how much relief the Japanese export curbs will bring them, as production by Japanese manufacturers in the UK is to increase. European production by Japanese companies is not covered by either accord. Meanwhile, a unilateral decision by the Japanese government to cut export quotas to the US has been condemned in the US as inadequate. Japanese exports to the US have declined steadily in recent years, but have been more than replaced by increased local production. The exports cuts are likely to prevent Japanese makers from boosting exports at a time when the domestic market is declining. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association yesterday reported that vehicle production in the year to last month fell by 3.3 per cent, the first decline in five years. While exports remained stable, domestic demand fell 4.8 per cent. Mazda, the Japanese car maker, said yesterday it was cancelling night shifts at its recently-opened plant in Hofu, Yamaguchi Prefecture, because of slack demand. Toyota said this week it would suspend night shifts for some models produced at its fourth Tahara plant in Aichi Prefecture. Japanese retail sales in March were down 4.1 per cent on March 1991 as the slowdown in the Japanese economy bit more deeply into consumer spending. This is the steepest drop since 1965. Luxury items were hard hit, but even clothing sales were down sharply by 3.2 per cent. Retailers blamed unseasonal weather.</p>

The government military action in Cuito may lead  UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] to  leave the talks. This is another chapter in the war for the  government, but for Savimbi's movement words are being replaced  by the law of weapons. More details from Ana Rodrigues:    [Rodrigues] [passage omitted] The government says it  believed  in UNITA's cease-fire declaration. But government spokesman  Aldomiro Vaz da Conceicao stated that UNITA has never respected  that cease-fire:    [Begin Conceicao recording] UNITA already stated last year  that it was declaring a unilateral cease-fire, but it has  increased its offensive action against government positions and  its forces since November last year. Therefore UNITA is  permanently contradicting itself. [passage omitted]    I have no doubt whatsoever in stating that it was UNITA that  started the fighting because it had been engaged for a long time  in troop maneuvers and in mobilizing its means to take the city  of Cuito once and for all. [end recording]    [Rodrigues] There is an exchange of accusations going on  between the government and UNITA, the two sides discussing peace  in Lusaka. UNITA has already stated that the talks are in  jeopardy at a time when they are discussing the last point on  the agenda relating to the mandate of UNAVEM [United Nations  Angola Verification Mission] and the role of observers. The  government is more optimistic, it says there has always been  fighting and, despite that, the talks have carried on. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Observer: Labour's pet grouses Quite what Islington man thinks about the Glorious Twelfth of August is not entirely clear, but Labour leader Tony Blair would do well to mind his back when it comes to the whole subject of huntin', shootin' and fishin'. Earlier this year, Tony Banks, the talkative animal lover from Newham North West, demanded the sacking of Baroness Mallalieu and Lord Donoughue from Labour's front bench team in the Lords after they set up a robust campaign backing the continuation of field sports. The urbanised Banks, wrongly as it happens, claimed that the two working peers were contravening party policy. 'I am not going to listen to people telling me how to win votes who could never get elected to anything themselves,' he barked. Plenty of the party's more famous extra-parliamentary supporters are right behind the peers. Writer Penny Mortimer was heard to complain recently that the Tony Banks breed of MP had become 'urbanised' and was in danger of losing the votes of the party's rural supporters. Film producer David Puttnam is another field sports type, and even Sam McCluskie, former general secretary of the National Union of Seamen, turns out to be a part-time hare courser. No doubt Blair, in his wisdom, will set his sights on less controversial targets - full employment, say, and the statutory minimum wage.</p>

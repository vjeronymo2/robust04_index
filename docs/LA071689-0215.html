			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STOCK WATCH: ENVIRONMENTAL DIAGNOSTICS CUTS ITS STAKE IN DISEASE DETECTION  </P> <P> Environmental Diagnostics Inc. is learning to let go.  </P> <P> Four years ago, the North Carolina-based manufacturer of medical test kits gave  birth to Disease Detection International in Irvine.  </P> <P> Begun as one of Environmental Diagnostics' divisions, Disease Detection went  public in 1987. Former Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt left his  position as chairman at Environmental Diagnostics to run the new company.  </P> <P> Ever since then, the two firms have fought over various technology rights.  Environmental Diagnostics last year even launched an unsuccessful proxy battle  to gain control of Disease Detection, which also makes test kits.  </P> <P> But Environmental Diagnostic has apparently given up and has begun to  systematically sell its huge stake in Disease Detection.  </P> <P> This week, the company disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange  Commission that it has sold nearly 1.9 million shares of Disease Detection for  about $300,000.  </P> <P> "We still feel as strong as we did when we embarked on a proxy battle to  replace their board directors that we are not satisfied with the management of  DDI," said Peter Heath, Environmental Diagnostics' controller. "That situation  has not changed."  </P> <P> For its part, Disease Detection claims not to care that Environmental  Diagnostics is unloading its shares. "That's fine with us," said H. Thad  Morris, Disease Detection's president.  </P> <P> Since September, Environmental Diagnostics has sold 6.5 million of its 32.1  million shares of Disease Detection. The sales -- coupled with a stock offering  by Disease Detection -- has reduced Environmental Diagnostic's stake in the  company from 27.2% to 17.2%  </P> <P> Heath said his company would sell even more of its shares of Disease Detection  but SEC rules say a corporate investor cannot sell more than 1% of any company  in a 90-day period.  </P> <P> "We think there is no value to us holding on to it," Heath said.  </P> <P> Disease Detection, which has 28 employees, reported sales for the first quarter  ended March 31 of $88,104 and it lost nearly four times that -- $323,983. The  company's stock is worth a quarter a share.  </P> <P> Environmental Diagnostics is still on the critical list too. The company had  sales during the first quarter of $788,000 but lost $773,000. Its stock closed  Friday at $1.09.  </P> <P> Helionetics Inc. in Irvine said its common stock began trading on NASDAQ Friday  under the symbol HLXC. The electrical equipment manufacturer's common stock  also trades on the Pacific Stock Exchange under the symbol HLX.P.  </P></p>

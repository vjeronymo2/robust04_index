			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marko Franjic: "The Commissars Are Restoring </F> Order"]    [Text]  <H5>  Financial Rescue of the Banks </H5>   The financial rescue of Croatian banks is an old term  usually  used, and in fact abused in the past, to refer to attempts to  restore the Croatian banks to health. Financial rescue of the  banks was referred to for a long time as one of the key moves,  once inflation was shattered, in the approach to restructuring  and restoring the entire Croatian economy to health, and it was  also said that the success of the stabilization program would  depend greatly on success in rescuing the banks. The first  results were followed immediately by the first significant  problems of the stabilization program. One of them was division  of the banks into those which can provisionally be said to be  operating normally and those which have problems with liquidity,  and some even with insolvency. While liquidity is corrected with  short-term solutions, the problem of insolvency is far more  difficult, because this means that the value of debt exceeds the  value of property, which is an altogether sufficient reason for  the bank's bankruptcy. Because there is a reluctance to conduct  bankruptcy proceedings of banks because of what is usually  referred to as the domino effect, i.e., an excessively great  influence on economic events because of connections between the  banks and their customers, the effort is usually made to restore  the bank to health, liquidity, and normal operation, which as a  rule means paying its debts. Following an agreement in one of  its meetings to undertake financial rescue, which is a major  decision, the Croatian Government has taken specific steps. Back  in January the National Bank of Croatia [NBH] sent its  representatives, referred to in the press as commissars, to the  Bank of Split, which is first on the list for financial rescue.  The commissars are overseeing the operation of the Bank of  Split, monitoring its liquidity, and sending in a report on this  to the NBH; that in turn is to be the basis for defining  precisely the situation in the bank, for prescribing the  therapy, and, most interestingly, for fixing the amount of money  the state must furnish to steer the bank toward normal operation.  <H5>  Liquidation as a Last Resort </H5>   In addition to the Bank of Split, the Bank of Slavonia is  also to be rescued in the first round, and after them come the  Bank of Rijeka and the Bank of Istria, and, it is assumed, the  Bank of Zupanja as well. The Government of the RH [Republic of  Croatia] seems to have taken the problem of rescuing the banks  quite seriously. Following the agreement, there will be  regulations governing the conduct of the rescue, and soon the  Law on Rescue of the Banks should be presented in public, and  the government will form a professional body, the Agency for  Rescue of the Banks, consisting of experts, most probably from  the National Bank of Croatia and the finance ministry, who will  conduct and monitor the rescue of the banks. The greatest  attention, but also debate, will be aroused by the amount of  money necessary to carry out the rescue of the banks. According  to the first unofficial estimates, this will be some 200 million  German marks [DM], and the final amount will be made public  soon, because it will be planned in the new proposal of the  state budget which the finance ministry is preparing for the  March session of the Sabor [Croatian parliament]. This time,  even representatives of the government have been very clear in  statements that the rescue of the banks will be paid for by  taxpayers, and that is why Dr. Zoran Jasic, finance minister,  has declared: "We will stick firmly by the principle that  whoever receives money from the state must also render an  account to the state." This statement sounds good, but the  question is how it will look in practice.    Because government expenditure is a topic that is always  interesting, at least to the public and taxpayers from whose  pocket everything is financed, we can expect fierce debates over  the budget, because the deputies in the last debate threatened  that the budget would no longer squeeze through. The item of the  outlay for rescue of the banks will certainly be "attacked" not  only because of the amount, but also because of the situation in  certain banks, which are to be rescued because of scandals that  have befallen them and because of ties to politics. The Bank of  Split will be called to account ahead of all the others.    The war is given as the reason for the problematical  business  operation of these banks, and these are regional banks. The Bank  of Split encountered problems because of TLM [Light Metal  Factory] and certain other customers, the Bank of Slavonia  follows agriculture, which has major problems, the Bank of  Istria, has, as they say, paid the price of poor tourist  seasons, and the Bank of Rijeka is closely tied to shipbuilding.  To some extent, of course, all these reasons are justified, but  it is certain that the experts will have bad business moves of  the banks to investigate as well. Experts say that when the  results are totaled and assessments made, the extreme measures  will include even liquidation of the bank. There has been a  great deal of debate about that problem up to now, because  mainly the line was taken that it is almost impossible to  liquidate a bank. Recently, that possibility is not being  discounted, and it is usually said that it comes into account if  the figures show that it is necessary. However, the banks and  the economy are so intertwined, and in the specific case there  is also a political connotation, so that the possibility of  liquidation is almost precluded.  <H5>  And Personnel Changes </H5>   In the banks that will be rescued there are differing  estimates of how much money is needed, but they all say that  they can hardly wait for the rescue to begin. Frane Mitrovic,  director of the Bank of Split, has said in the press that  customers owe the bank more than DM150 million. "The Bank of  Split, according to our estimate, needs DM35 million so that we  can do business normally. If TLM repaid us its debt of some DM40  million, everything would be fine," Mitrovic said.    In the Bank of Slavonia they say that they have already  begun  rescue of the bank through rescue of customers. They have  initiated several bankruptcies of delinquent customers and in  this way cleared up certain uncollected claims, and some they  have solved by buying shares from the firm with the money owed  the bank.    An internal reorganization of the bank has already been  carried out, and the size of the labor force has been reduced.  Although they do not want to make estimates of how much money is  needed for the rescue, Ivo Markotic, the bank's director, says  that they have DM177 million in outstanding loans which they  have not collected and which they will not be able to collect.  Markotic explains this situation in terms of problems in  agriculture, where they have the most uncollected claims,  because the government is not paying the rebate on interest in  agriculture, they are not paying creditors, and the entire  burden falls on the banks. The problem of the Bank of Rijeka is  the illiquidity of shipbuilding, and the people in the bank say  that $40-50 million would save them. They agree with the  government that the customers should be rescued in order to  restore the banks to health. An auditor, they say at the bank,  has examined the bank's operation and seen that the assets are  twice the basic capital, so that the bank is sound, and some of  the experts concur in that.    Aside from the measures mentioned, government officials have  also announced possible personnel changes in the bank and  appointment of commissars who will monitor the bank's business.  This view was immediately attacked as such, but in the  government department they are clear--because they are putting  up the money, they want control over the bank's operation.  Before that, it was reported, but never confirmed, that the  reason for such decisions, but also the stricter measures of the  NBH, was one bank on the list for rescue which received some of  the money for rescue and immediately loaned it out to  problematical customers. Whether it is specifically because of  that or in order to head off events that might be similar, the  NBH has reacted with a press release in which it said: "People  seem to expect from the announced rescue of the banks that there  will be abundant coverage even for unreasonable undertaking of  problematical loans, that is, for losses and shortage of money  resulting from a decision of the banks themselves, not from  objective circumstances."  <H5>  A Crash Effort To Reduce the Debt </H5>   The government is entering upon rescue of the banks  cautiously, because it already has quite a bit of experience in  intervention and aid to the banks. This can be seen with  particular clarity in the example of old foreign exchange  savings. The state took up as public debt about DM5 billion of  old foreign exchange savings in order to take the burden off the  banks and help them survive. When the government was late in  paying the interest which the banks were supposed to pay to the  depositors, the banks unhesitatingly called the government to  account, viewing the problem of old foreign exchange savings as  exclusively a problem of the government. The bankers never  replied as to the basis for their feeling that they have been  absolved of this problem, when it is well-known that when old  foreign exchange savings were taken over, this also cleared up  some of the poor assets and loans of the banks, for which no  bill was ever presented to them. Even though the public debt has  been reduced by DM4.2 billion because of the purchase of shares,  housing loans, and the so-called manager credits, the present  assessment is that this is too large a burden for the  government, because the first installment comes due next year,  and the government is barely able to pay interest on the old  foreign exchange savings, and even then it is doing so late.  That is why it was decided to undertake a great crash effort to  reduce the public debt by allowing the purchase of enterprise  stock with old foreign exchange savings, and this is now being  done.    There is an offer at the moment to sell more than DM1.2  billion of enterprise stock which individuals can buy with old  foreign exchange savings. There is some question what will come  of this, but it is clear that it is difficult to get cash for  the stock of even the best firms, and the purchase with "paper,"  anathematized at one time, is now favored. Other problems are  also arising here, because the banks have also become owners of  about DM1 billion in enterprise stock in the transformation, and  it is being asked ever more frequently why the banks are not  selling enterprise stock in order to repair their liquidity and  operation? Illiquidity, especially of the major banks like the  Bank of Zagreb, could cause problems for the entire economy and  the stabilization program, because in order to repair its  liquidity, the bank has lowered the exchange rate of foreign  currencies, thereby worsening the already difficult position of  exporters. It is the large banks, the Bank of Zagreb and the  Privredna Banka [Business Bank], that have the largest share in  the equity of firms, and they are the only ones of the 43  registered banks in Croatia that are included among the 500  largest banks in the world.  <H5>  And Political Scandals </H5>   Privredna Banka is covering 1.5 billion of Croatia's foreign  debt, which amounts to 2.7 billion, and its customers are the  largest giants in Croatia, its director is a member of the  incumbent party and a parliamentary deputy, and the Bank of  Zagreb has one-fourth of the savings deposits of individuals,  and when all that is taken into account, it is clear that they  dictate many things in economic policy. What is more, along with  the Bank of Split, Privredna Banka has already been involved in  scandals. According to the speculation and rumors in the  corridor, Privredna Banka will reportedly be taking over Nama.  All of this postpones solutions to some extent, because an  essential precondition for success of the banking system is a  defined ownership structure in which the state has no great  share. The interlocking between the banks and enterprises  operating at a loss and the quasi-ownership structure, which is  the situation in the majority of banks established in the former  system, distort views of the market and business operation,  which means confidence in the banks, which is the foundation for  successful banking, is constantly being put to the test. It was  foreseen even earlier that certain banks would be rescued with  large bond issues, i.e., a kind of swap (exchange) of the shares  of large firms which are the customers, but also the owners, of  the bank, for the shares of the banks under government  guardianship, which would take care of what up to now has been  the incestuous relations between the banks and their debtors,  who were also their owners, and would finally establish a normal  ownership relation in which the creditors would have the last  word.    Financial rescue of the banks can be carried out only by the  government, but this ought to be done with a program, and if in  that process the government is to increase its share in  ownership of the banks, it should also divest itself of that by  selling it, because the banks must be free of the government,  but the central bank ought to have oversight over the business  operation of the banks because of their importance.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible pins its hopes on the US MORGAN CRUCIBLE, the industrial materials maker that yesterday reported profits up 3 per cent last year, is in an enviable position as the US begins to edge out of recession. With 45 per cent of its profits deriving from North America, the company is confident it can ride the economic recovery that should be emerging by the time President Bush seeks re-election later this year. While continental Europe is a possible problem area, with recession at least a possibility, Morgan should enjoy the benefits of its decision 10 years ago to reduce its reliance on the UK and to spread into world markets. Shareholders would be forgiven, however, for wondering if Morgan might not spring yet another rights issue for more acquisitions. Last April's Pounds 96m rights issue was dropped on a market still digesting a Pounds 79m call some 10 months earlier. While Morgan has not lost its appetite to acquire, it still has about half the latest rights proceeds on deposit and Mr Bruce Farmer, chief executive, has said that unless something extraordinary happens, shareholders will not be tapped again this year or in 1993. Morgan is therefore left to enjoy, not only the interest on their pile but the fruits of its four US acquisitions last year, all of which look as though they will immediately enhance earnings. In the absence of a faltering in US growth - an occurrence Mr Bush will do his darndest to avoid - Morgan should make pre-tax profits of Pounds 71m this year, giving earnings of 22p which put the shares on an undemanding prospective multiple of 13.</p>

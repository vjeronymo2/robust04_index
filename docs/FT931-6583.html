			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Management: Streamlined for speed - A report on General Accident's 'inside-out' transformation It's 16.32 on a Friday afternoon. The electronic indicator board high on the wall of General Accident's new Glasgow offices shows that 1,365 calls have been handled by the claims staff of the country's second-biggest insurance company. Five staff are on the phone dealing with customers' inquiries. No calls are waiting to be answered, a pleasing statistic for Alistair Waters, at 32, one of a new generation of insurance managers at the UK's second-biggest insurance company. He says that 98 per cent of calls are handled within three seconds and most claims are handled within two days. It is a far cry from the recent past when it could take General Accident weeks to respond to its policyholders. But, in common with other insurers, GA is changing its ways, overhauling its traditional bureaucratic organisation in order to transform relationships with its customers. Stung by losses of more than Pounds 2bn in 1990 and 1991 and spurred by new competitors who have been quick to take advantage of new technologies, the UK's biggest insurers have slashed jobs, reducing numbers by up to a third in some cases. But there is more to the industry's reorganisation than a simple reduction in headcount. In many companies whole layers of middle management have been removed, while new responsibilities are being given to lower-grade staff. Status-conscious hierarchies are giving way to flatter, more responsive and more goal-oriented businesses. The changes are all the more striking at General Accident because the company has long been one of the industry's most conservative, dominated by generations of Scottish actuaries. Yet two years of losses have underlined the need for change, which has quickened since the departure of Buchan Marshall, the former chief general manager, who retired at the end of 1989. One of the main aims of the reorganisation - orchestrated by the head of UK operations, Bob Scott - has been to improve the speed with which claims are paid, as well as the quality of back-up services and complaints procedures. Such changes have had an important influence on the organisation's culture, with the company shifting from what Scott calls an 'administrative-centred' approach to one based on 'long-term customer service', heavily influenced by the experience of companies such as Toyota. GA has been turned 'inside out', says Ray Andrews, a former Saatchi and Saatchi executive, recruited in 1990 to head an overhaul of GA's internal communications. Scott explains how management and organisational changes have paved the way for much more rapid handling of claims. The goal is to respond to all claimants within five days, says Scott. Five years ago 'a claim would have been processed by the clerk, sent to the under manager, then the manager to be checked and finally back to the clerk. The whole process could take weeks,' says Scott. 'You could justify the old system on the grounds that it guaranteed accuracy. But it destroyed people's initiative.' Under the new system GA's lower-grade claims staff have been given more responsibility to carry out basic tasks. 'They have to get it right. They are responsible,' says Scott. Computers have helped. Over the past three years, GA has abolished its typing pool and has weaned staff away from the use of paper files. Staff at GA's 'new model' office in Dundee - where the new systems were first introduced - make extensive use of computer training techniques, as part of a programme which equips them to handle all aspects of insurance transactions - underwriting, claims and accounts, and the like - instead of the much narrower focus of the past. While lower-grade staff are being asked to be more responsible, managers are under pressure to take a more active interest in the development of the company's business. For a start there are fewer of them. Scott has pushed through a radical overhaul of GA's branch structure, replacing over two thirds of the company's 60 or so branch managers. A middle management position, responsible purely for office administration, has been scrapped. Relieved of many of their control and checking functions, managers are being encouraged to develop areas of new business. John Munro and his management team in Dundee, for example, are examining ways of persuading motor policyholders to take out home or creditor insurance. 'There is much more emphasis on accountability,' says Munro, who runs the group's Dundee office. 'We have much more headroom and much more room to take initiatives.' There are now six management layers, against eight previously, improving the company's responsiveness and increasing the opportunities for younger managers such as Waters and Munro to rise within the organisation, where promotion is no longer tied to seniority and time serving. Performance-related pay is becoming common and information about the company more widely disseminated. In the past, middle management has seen its control over information as a source of power, says Scott. By contrast GA senior management now report details of the company's performance. All this is good news for younger managers such as Waters, who began working with GA 13 years ago at the group's offices in Ayr and began building up GA's direct motor subsidiary at the age of 29, a position of prominence unimaginable for a young manager even 10 years ago. 'Everyone is on first-name terms,' says Waters. 'We are trying to develop an operation that downplays concern for status. It's much more open - more frank and more goal-orientated than in the past. All the layers have been taken away. All the bullshit has gone.'</p>

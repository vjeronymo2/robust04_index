Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> CAPTAIN MAY GET DRUNK FOR DEFENSE  </P> <P> The fired captain of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker, source of the worst oil spill  in North American history, may fight allegations that he was intoxicated at the  time of the accident by getting drunk under a doctor's supervision, his lawyer  said today.  </P> <P> Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, who failed an alcohol test 10 hours after the ship's  grounding, may get drunk this week in Portland, Ore., to see how fast his body  assimilates liquor, Seattle lawyer Michael Williamson said. "We're trying to  find out the rate at which his body burns off alcohol -- everyone's body burns  off alcohol at a different rate," Williamson said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 May (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  today expressed optimism that the Argentine Congress will  approve the law on pharmaceutical patents and thus avoid U.S.  economic sanctions, but he made it clear that "we will not take  a drastic position" over any congressional delay in approving it.    Menem noted: "One could either follow the European or the  Brazilian models," adding: "One must not forget that the United  States is not acting in the world alone, it is part of an  interdependent world."    He noted that Washington is engaged in "the NAFTA process,  which seeks to promote free trade, while we are within Mercosur  [Common Market of the South]." He said there are many options  available as far as approving this law is concerned.    Menem said: "We are committed to lobbying for the proposal,  but we are not going to force lawmakers."    In remarks during the program "Controversy at the Bar,"  Menem  joked with the actors and told producer Gerardo Sofovich that if  he expected the president to defend him against the  "aggressions" of his colleagues, he will have to pay him his  "fees as an attorney."    Menem also described as "simple rumors" reports of federal  government intervention in the Buenos Aires City Council and in  the Tucuman Province Legislature. He also denied charges that  he only grants interviews to "journalists who are my friends."</p>

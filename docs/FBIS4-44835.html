			<p>Project   <F P=102>   94WS0371A Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG/BLICK DURCH DIE  WIRTSCHAFT in German 24 May 94 p 10 </F>  <F P=103> 94WS0371A </F> <F P=104>  Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG/BLICK DURCH DIE  WIRTSCHAFT </F>  <F P=105>  German </F> CSO     [Text] Frankfurt. Jessi offices in Munich report that a  spray processor for use in semiconductor production has been  developed within the framework of a Jessi project. This  completely automatic unit, called the ACC4, has been designed  for treating silicon wafers 150 mm in diameter.    Instead of treating the wafers in chemical baths, as has  been  done to date, a process that has become increasingly difficult  because of the continual reduction in structural widths, the  spray processor removes the chemicals from large containers, and  then filters, mixes, and heats them before spraying the rotating  wafers. In this way, the liquid is evenly distributed on the  wafer surface, a higher operating temperature with a shorter  treatment time is achieved, and the reproducibility of the  production process is improved.    Currently, 150 to 300 wafers per hour can be treated in this  way. Drying is performed by means of heated nitrogen, thereby  making a closed "dry-in/dry-out" processing cycle possible. The  four partners in the Jessi project--Blomme, Sapi Equipments,  Leti, and Philips RTL--are now developing a similar system for  wafers 200 mm in diameter. It is expected to be ready in the  second half of 1995.    The present system uses less energy and is about 30 percent  cheaper than other competitive systems. Planned improvements in  the process are aimed at reducing the amounts of chemicals and  deionized water even further.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Tax change may cost 10,000 N Sea oil jobs, says Treasury THE NORTH SEA oil industry could lose 10,000 jobs in the next two to three years, according to government estimates if planned changes to petroleum revenue taxes go ahead. The Treasury's worst estimate for the effect of the tax changes on North Sea activity is that exploration will halve. But the new PRT rules will generate Pounds 700m in the first three years which the government believes will more than offset the potential job losses. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in the Budget that the rate of PRT would drop from 75 per cent to 50 per cent for established oilfields. For new fields it would be abolished. But in future companies will be unable to claim tax allowances for spending on exploration and appraisal work. The changes have been attacked by many oil companies which claim the government is sounding a death knell for exploration in the North Sea. Drilling companies have estimated job losses as high as 39,000. But the industry has also been split between winners and losers. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary, yesterday defended the decision to change the North Sea tax rules amid strong opposition from some oil companies. The Treasury believes that the existing regime has caused oil companies to run inefficient exploration programmes funded by the taxpayer. The changes would force companies to become more efficient and would not affect overall oil production, Mr Dorrell said. He said the changes were part of government plans to streamline the tax system and establish low marginal tax rates. The government is ensuring that 'those who commit resources are making their own judgments about the economic value of their decisions and when they invest in activities which prove to be successful they are entitled to the lion's share of the return', he said. The Treasury is likely to resist any pressure for transitional relief for some of the smaller exploration companies hit hardest by the tax changes. If companies had entered into contracts for drilling wells at the time of the Budget statement, they can continue to claim PRT relief for the work. But obligations made to the Department of Trade and Industry by companies applying for exploration licences will not qualify for relief. This has led to threats by several oil companies to pull out of the government's latest North Sea licensing round. Budget makes waves in the North Sea, Page 21</p>

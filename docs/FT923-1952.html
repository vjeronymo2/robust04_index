			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / How To Spend It: So you want to be a paperback writer? - Poplar fiction writers need a congenial work environment free of disctraction, especially if they are knocking out a private eye novel that has a protagonist - Harriet Costley - who is tracking a lost Mantegna and eats strawberry ice cream for love food BOOK PUBLISHERS are anguished and despondent, just like everyone else. Yet it cannot last indefinitely. At some point this side of the millennium there ought to be a hiccup of recovery, a tiny burp of growth, which would-be novelists like me can take advantage of. Not that I want to be Patrick White, or even Hanif Kureishi. My aim is strikingly modest: to write a thriller, set in London and starring a female PI (private investigator), that someone will want to publish and others will want to read. Easy it is not. I only write at weekends. I have problems with minor characters and problems of credibility. The mise en scene is blurred. I have trouble depicting nastiness. I sometimes wonder if I am too nice and sheltered - a good word is vacuous - to even be attempting it. But on I bravely plod. I believe I am halfway through. And at least I have a protagonist - sexy Harriet Costley - who bears not a flicker of resemblance to the current brood of sweaty, boiled-knuckled, post-feminist female investigators with whom publishers are enamoured. Harriet is investigating the theft of a Mantegna drawing. Somehow the trail leads her into ultra-right politics. She is intelligent and manipulative. She ought to be in the movies. I am sure I am not alone in my weekend endeavours - that there are numberless beavering souls trying to break into the ranks of paperback writers (or paperback righters, in the case of private-eye fiction, where wrongs are righted, evil thwarted). Perhaps you are thinking of trying it. If so, you will rapidly discover that what a fiction writer needs most is a congenial environment free of distraction. You need absolute quiet, because you must concentrate absolutely. A few toys help. Here are eight things that will help create an ideal work environment, or fiddle away the hours when creativity flags: 1) A table and chair. For some reason, I prefer working at a table to working at a desk. But it has to be a large one. A PI novel needs plenty of research. At present I use the dining table, but I am saving up for one of the smart and chic tables available at the Aero showroom at 96 Westbourne Grove, London W2 5RT. Aero produces an excellent range of modern furniture, including shelving and lighting. The table I like most is called the Drennan rectangular: cast aluminium base, glass top, designed by Robert Drennan - Pounds 740. There is also a round version at Pounds 590. 2) A good supply of pens. I am not a home computer bore. I usually write in longhand. I will probably buy a PC when I come to the first re-write, but for now I am using pens. There are times, when writing fiction, when the only thing you can do to chase away the blues is reach for a different pen. Recently I visited The Pen Shop at 199 Regent St, London W1, which stocks about 2,000 different pens and has demure and helpful staff. Normally I use cheap pens. If I had the money I would buy the Waterman Man 100, which costs Pounds 190. As it happens, the most expensive pen in the shop, at Pounds 5,000, is a solid gold version of the Man 100. There are other branches of The Pen Shop in Leeds, Glasgow, Sheffield, Manchester and Newcastle. 3) A pot of artificial flowers to remind oneself, constantly, that nothing is what it seems, not in politics, philosophy, business or fiction. I like artificial flowers. I like a lot of things - patterned carpets, spotlights, brightly coloured wallpaper - that the snooties abominate; no wonder their homes are identically ruched and dull. You can buy artificial flowers practically anywhere. I bought some this week, at Felton's, near St Paul's Cathedral - sprays of cream roses, you could hardly tell the difference. Someone who can tell the difference is my assistant, Miss Lee, an unreconstructed Thatcherite. Thatcherites like dried flowers artistically arranged in baskets and believe that Agatha Christie is an under-rated writer. 4) Portable air conditioner. A nice-looking mobile air conditioner is the Carrier Holiday 1 (the company's founder, Dr Willis Carrier, is the man credited with inventing air conditioning, 90 years ago). The Holiday 1 plugs into a standard power point and provides de-humidified hot or cold air instantly. It is mounted on castors and is reckoned to be quiet enough to use in a bedroom. Like any proper refrigerated air conditioner, the Holiday 1 needs an exhaust tube, which can be run (vented) through a porthole fitted into a window pane or wall, up a chimney, through a partition, or through a slightly open window. It costs Pounds 949 plus VAT from the Air Improvement Centre in Victoria (23 Denbigh St, London SW1). Its director, the deeply-informed Valerie Taplin, is almost as swishy as PI Harriet Costley. The centre supplies a wide range of products, not just air conditioners but air purifiers, humidifiers and de-humidifiers. 5) Ice-cream machine. When you're running hot, air conditioning alone may not cool you down. Some weeks ago I spent an adventurous Pounds 250 on a Gaggia Gelatiera. It is a professional's machine - not one of those limp-wristed jobs you stick in the freezer, that seem to take forever - but a free-standing pro job that makes unimproveable ice-cream and sorbet (sherbert, to Americans), starting from scratch, in about 30 minutes. For love food, Harriet Costley is fond of knocking up strawberry or date ice cream in her Notting Hill kitchen. Cute, non? 6) Coffee machine. You cannot write fiction without putting in the hours. It takes hundreds of hours of practice. Sometimes you need to rouse yourself. I drink coffee. There are numerous machines to chose from; I happen to like Gaggia's. Harriet Costley drinks gallons of espresso. 7) A blind to shut the world out. I find John Lewis a vexingly eccentric store. It won't do this, it won't do the other. But I like its blinds, especially the modern ones in Hockneyesque stripes and colours; and it is happy to measure and fit them. 8) Tennis club membership. Just as fiction writers must entomb themselves for hours at a stretch so as to plumb the creative depths, so, periodically, they must escape outside for air. A lot of hacks play tennis. So do various novelists. Like me, Martin Amis is a member of the Paddington Sports Club in London's Maida Vale, which is friendly, well managed and has plenty of courts. A tennis membership costs Pounds 100 to join and Pounds 255 annually. Tennis and squash combined: Pounds 100 plus Pounds 300. They also have bowls. If Amis played tennis like me, he would be a happier little fellow. If I could write like Amis, I don't suppose I'd be here.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 9 May (EFE) -- It was reported on 9 May  that a contingent of 476 soldiers will leave for Mozambique on  12 May to relieve the Uruguay Battalion, which is part of the UN  peace-keeping force in that African country.    Some 900 Uruguayan officers and enlisted men have been  deployed there for seven months, enforcing the Peace Treaty  signed between Mozambique and the United Nations in Rome in 1992.    The Uruguay Battalion is participating in the UN mission  that  is monitoring the observance of the treaty, disarming feuding  factions, and ensuring the transport of food and humanitarian  aid in an area covering 800 km.

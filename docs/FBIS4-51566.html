			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, April 30 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge [KR]  guerrillas killed a Buddhist monk, two nuns and an elderly man,  as well as injured several other monks, when they attacked a  peace march in northwest Cambodia, a police officer said  Saturday.    The guerrillas opened fire with automatic weapons and  rocket-propelled grenades as the marchers were being escorted by  government troops in northwest Battambang's Bavel district, said  Mek Dara, the deputy police commissioner for Cambodia's second  city of Battambang.    Kol Sarul, one of the three injured monks who was brought to  Battambang hospital, told AFP that the Khmer Rouge "came from  everywhere."    "The army of Pol Pot then stole all our money and medicine,"  he said.    Up to 12 foreigners walking with the monks might have been  taken hostage during the attack, a spokeswoman for the march,  Kong Nary, said in the Cambodian capital. Police in Battambang  could not immediately confirm the report. The marchers were  being led by Nobel peace prize nominee Maha Ghosananda.    "How can the Khmer Rouge dare attack Buddhist monks like  that? When will our country ever have peace," Kong Nary said.  "When they attack the Dhammayietra (peace walk), it's just like  they attack our nation."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Executive Committee of the League of the Sons of  Yemen Party [LSYP] has condemned any attempt to depart from the  principles of Yemeni unity, the Republic of Yemen, the  democratic gains, the political pluralism, the multiparty  system, and the constitutional legitimacy, which is represented  by the Presidential Council that was elected by the elected  legislative authority. The party views such a departure as a  departure from the Yemeni people's consensus and will.    The statement issued by the committee today asserts that the  LSYP adheres to the Yemeni unity, views it as a destiny, and  believes in democracy, political pluralism, the multiparty  system, and constitutional legitimacy, which was established by  the Yemeni people's consensus and in light of the general  elections that were held on 27 April before the eyes of the  entire world, including all the fraternal Arab countries.    The statement expresses the Executive Committee's rejection  of any statement, issued in the name of the league without its  approval, and which conflicts with the party's positions stated  in this statement. It also stresses that assigning certain  tasks by the party to its representatives from the national  opposition bloc is temporary and not permanent.</p>

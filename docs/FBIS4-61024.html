			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, 2 May, BNS -- Lithuanian Parliament  Chairman Ceslovas Jursenas says he is pleased with the  agreements signed between Latvia and Russia to withdraw Russian  troops from Latvian territory by 31 Aug.    At a press conference in Vilnius Monday [2 May], Jursenas  said he is glad that "one more Baltic state will be free of a  foreign army."    The parliament chairman noted, however, that the agreements  signed last Saturday in Moscow are not as good as "wanted by  Latvia and us." Jursenas said his reservation primarily concerns  a permission for Russia to keep its radar base in Skrunda for  another several years, although "forward movement is impossible  without compromises."    Jursenas criticized Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the  rightist opposition in the Lithuanian parliament, for calling  Latvia the weakest Baltic link that was broken by Russia. The  parliament chairman said it is unethical to "criticize a sister  of one fate in such a way and to call her names."    Jursenas also praised the first all-race election in the  "far-away" South Africa. He said the election buried the  apartheid system, which has completely discredited itself in the  course of years. The South African election was observed by  Lithuanian Parliament Vice Chairman Aloyzas Sakalas.</p>

			<p>BFN     [text] Crimea's President Yuriy Meshkov declared that a  Crimean parliamentary delegation has arrived in Kiev for talks  with the Ukrainian leadership to conclude a treaty and settle  the conflict. In an exclusive interview with INTERFAX on Tuesday  [24 May], he said that the situation would not reach the  critical point.    Asked whether Crimea might go back on its decision to  restore  the 1992 Constitution on dual citizenship and formal relations  with Ukraine, Meshkov remarked that the decision had been taken  by Crimea's parliament rather than president. Consequently, it  is for Crimean legislators to decide how to respond to the  ultimatum by Kiev, which has given Simferopol ten days to  reconsider the decision. He recalled that he had asked Crimean  lawmakers to postpone debates on the revision of the  constitution.    Queried whether Crimea expected help from Russia, Meshkov  replied, "It would be enough to warn against the use of force in  efforts to solve our problems." In his words, the Crimean  leadership has been constantly in touch with Moscow on the  issue. However, he evaded answer to a question on what precisely  "Moscow tells" him.    Asked about a solution to the Black Sea Fleet's problem,  President Meshkov replied, "It has become more obvious that it  is quite complex to come to grips with the problem without us.  From the start of the talks on the issue Russia has negotiated  from a reasonable and balanced position, suggesting that Crimea  would take part in these negotiations or at least send its  observers there."    Ukraine seeks to force Crimea out of Ukraine, which was  explicit when General Radetskyy (defense minister -- IF) barred  the Crimean president from the talks on the Black Sea Navy in  Simferopol, "He clearly deals with us as an adversary," Meshkov  said.</p>

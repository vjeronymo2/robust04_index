			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Han Fook Kwang in New Delhi] </F>   [Text] New Delhi -- In a major move to boost Singapore's  external economy, the Government is setting up a $150 million  venture capital fund which will assist companies going abroad.  Announcing this to Singapore reporters covering the Prime  Minister's visit here Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong  said yesterday that the fund will also have a unique component  -- it will also target budding entrepreneurs.    Mr Yeo said the fund will in essence, operate like any other  venture capital fund, but with a regional focus.    A private sector fund manager will be appointed to manage  it.  Investments will be made in private companies which are  "regional" or "going regional" and whose projects will benefit  the Singapore economy.    In return, equity participation will be obtained in the  companies.    The fund was recommended originally by the Committee to  Promote Enterprise Overseas chaired by Minister of State  (Finance) Teo Chee Hean. The unique part of the scheme lies in  its additional goal -- to bring together budding entrepreneurs  with the projects that have been identified by the fund manager.    Low cost funds will be made available to the entrepreneurs  to  help them obtain a stake in these companies-- up to S4 for every  dollar from the entrepreneur. Mr Yeo told reporters that this  was to encourage budding entrepreneurs to venture into the  region.    "We'll work through the private sector to identify projects  and potential entrepreneurs who wish to go abroad but lack the  financial means to do so, although they have the expertise," he  said.    If they succeed, the intention of the scheme is to help them  gain a significant stake in the companies after three to seven  years.    Existing entrepreneurs already in business but who lack the  means to expand abroad are also eligible for such assistance.    This component of the fund is targeted at those who have the  characteristics of entrepreneurship: a practical vision or a  good track record but lack the means to carry out their ideas or  expand their businesses overseas.    They can be from the private or the public sectors.    The Economic Development Board Investment Pte Ltd [Private  Limited] (EDBI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of EDB [Economic  Development Board], will oversee the fund through the private  fund manager.    The fund is expected to exceed $150 million [Singapore  currency], with the Government contributing more than $100  million. Private sector funds will also be sought. Mr Yeo  pointed out that the Government was not giving away "free money"  to any entrepreneur.    "We're participating with him. He must first be prepared to  put his own money on the line," he said.    Replying to a question on why the scheme was necessary when  there were private venture capital companies around already, Mr  Yeo said that a different set of criteria would apply for the  Government- inspired scheme.    Private fund managers, he added, might only want to support  those with a proven track record.    Thus, those who were working in companies but had never set  up their own might not qualify. Yet they might be precisely  those whom the Government was trying to encourage as they had  the expertise.    An MTI [Ministry of Trade and Industry] official said it had  consulted the private sector on the scheme and the feedback had  been positive.    "Our business leaders agree that there are many people out  there who have the bright ideas and the ability and drive to  carry them through, but for the lack of financing and  opportunity," he said.    While some will make it in any case, this "matchmaking"  scheme broadens the net. If, by providing the extra push and  financial backing we can increase the pool of entrepreneurs, it  will be good for Singapore, he said.</p>

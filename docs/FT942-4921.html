			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'No ANC threat' to gold rights South Africa's new government will not nationalise the gold mines or threaten mineral rights, according to Mr Marcel Golding, an ANC member of parliament. Mr Golding, who spent 10 years as a mining union official, told the Financial Times World Gold Conference in London that the damage caused by apartheid should not be underestimated. 'The vote will not immediately remove all the warts.' But gold mining remained the backbone of the South African economy, employing 380,000 workers. Millions more depended directly or indirectly on the industry. 'The challenge of transition is to ensure that living standards are enhanced,' said Mr Golding. While the industry had moved away from confrontation, further co-operation between the government, mining companies and the unions would be needed. Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of the gold and uranium division of Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, said that in 1985 the company had written a fairy tale which it called The High Road, specifying four conditions for the continuing health of the mining sector: a comprehensive negotiated political settlement; free enterprise as the basis of the economy; the devolvement of political power to local authorities; and the end of economic sanctions against the country. 'Our scenario team is cock-a-hoop about recent developments,' he told the conference. 'So far so good. South Africa has become a very attractive place to invest.' South Africa, still the biggest gold producer in the world with 32 per cent, had produced 44,000 tonnes of gold from the Witwatersrand basin since mining began. Throughout history the world has produced only 120,000 tonnes. Mr Sunter said that while most of the big fish in the basin had been caught, there were probably a few more. However the depth of the seams meant that it was expensive to establish a new mine. South Africa's annual output peaked at 1,000 tonnes in 1970. It had been steady at 600 tonnes for the last few years, a level it should be able to maintain for several years. 'Virtually the whole industry is viable given the current price and rand-dollar exchange rate.' Mr Chris Stals, governor of the South African Reserve Bank, said that the pressures on foreign reserves during the run-up to the change of governement had forced the country to reduce its gold reserves and gold swap portfolio. The country now intended to rebuild its foreign reserves. 'From our own experience with the management of the country's international reserves in the years of South Africa's economic isolation, we have learned the value of gold in the official foreign reserves for a country in distress. We believe it is also a good investment for a country at peace with the rest of the world.' Mr Jean Zwahlen, a member of the governing board of the Swiss National Bank, said gold was virtually the only asset that did not constitute someone else's liability. The SNB holds 2,600 tonnes, equivalent to 370 grams per capita - the highest level in the world. It was unlikely even in the long-term to sell. Mr Zwahlen also ruled out more active management of the holdings, describing the return on loans, swaps and options as 'low and volatile'. The fear of large-scale net sales by central banks, which together with international institutions have 35,000 tonnes in their vaults, had receded, Mr Zwahlen said. The conference is being held in London to coincide with the tercentenary of the Bank of England. Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea, deputy governor, suggested that the time was ripe for an annual survey of physical gold trading to provide a figure for the aggregate market turnover. 'It is a pity that no data are available for turnover, not just here in London but in all the various physical centres,' he said.</p>

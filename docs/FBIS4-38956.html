			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- The first group of "active vacationers" from  Lvov is leaving for Crimea in the next few days, Andriy Shkil,  leader of the Ukrainian National Assembly-Ukrainian National  Self-Defense [UNA-UNSO] Lvov branch, told UNIAN. The group will  be 20-30 strong and its main task will be to "set the stage for  the arrival of more groups."    According to Andriy Shkil, "active vacation groups" in Lvov  Oblast have already about 200 volunteers on the rolls. But  UNA-UNSO is unable to dispatch them to Crimea immediately for  lack of money. "We are busy looking for sponsors of the action  who would appreciate the need to defend Crimea," Andriy Shkil  said.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report New York arabica COFFEE was broadly higher at midday after rallying on what traders said was heavy trade short covering in the spot March contract. London's robusta COFFEE closed with sharp gains of Dollars 38 to Dollars 49 a tonne as the market remained very volatile. There was little consensus about the market's next move after the recent large price swings. On the LME most markets were steady in a pretty featureless day. Physical offtake of COPPER in Europe is extremely slow, which is restricting interest and outweighing the positive implications of improved US economic data. Also, shipments of CIS copper remain high. ZINC has lost upward momentum with no further production cuts emerging, and dealers believe the market could revert to the dull range seen for most of January between Dollars 1,060 and Dollars 1,080 a tonne. Three-month NICKEL was unable to hold above Dollars 6,100 a tonne. But overall technicals are more constructive after recent investment fund interest, dealers said. Compiled from Reuters</p>

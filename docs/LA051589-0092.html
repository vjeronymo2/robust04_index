			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BIG NIGHT OUT FOR PARACHUTISTS;  </P> <P> BENEFIT FOR ISRAELI GROUP HONORS EX-PARATROOPER PLITT  </P> <P> Gen. Alexander Haig wasn't there. He was what parachutists call a refusal. "He  stood at the door but wouldn't go out," Henry Plitt said of his fellow former  paratrooper.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, if there were ever a parachutists' party, this was it. Table  centerpieces were parachutes anchored in beds of red roses. The baked Alaskas  arrived with tiny plastic airplanes on board. And just thinking about some of  the great moments in paratrooping history turned this crowd nostalgic.  </P> <P> Officially, the $250-a-person gala at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Thursday  night was a fund-raiser for Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, a  nonpolitical organization that provides educational, recreational and cultural  services to Israeli soldiers ("It's Israel's USO -- it's that simple," said Lou  Lenart, who directs activities in North America) and for Israel's Open  University. The evening coincided with Israel's 41st Independence Day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A War Hero  </P> <P> But the man of the hour, honoree Henry Plitt, was a war hero in World War II  and a captain in the 101st Airborne Division who was among the first  paratroopers to jump at Normandy. Though he is currently a Hollywood producer  who recently sold his 700 Plitt Theaters to Cineplex Odeon, on this particular  evening he was unquestionably Gen. Henry Plitt.  </P> <P> "Tonight, because of me, it's a parachutists' event," he said. Plitt not only  invited Maj. Gen. Amos Yarom, in charge of parachutists in Israel, but also  retired Col. Salvo Rizza, who also served in the 101st Airborne, whom Plitt had  only met earlier in the week at another party. "When he asked me to come, he  said 'Please wear your uniform,' " said Rizza, who indeed arrived at the  black-tie event in his "formal mess."  </P> <P> Seated with Plitt and his wife, Sedge, were his son, Sam, who also served in  the 101st Airborne, and his 21-year-old grandson Henry II -- in Army uniform  and jumper's boots -- who currently serves in the famed unit. Also present were  members of Machal, American volunteers who served in Israel's war of  independence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Few Snags  </P> <P> For anyone unaware of Henry Sr.'s talents, he left no doubts about his ability  to command. The evening was replete with more than the usual number of snags --  emcee Morey Amsterdam had not only forgotten to introduce Rabbi David Baron for  the invocation, but he skipped over Maj. Gen. Yarom. To top it off, many guests  were grumbling about seating mistakes. Before his cue, Plitt marched to the  podium and restored dignity to the proceedings.  </P> <P> On hand to honor Plitt and for the cause were Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and his  wife, Judge Diane Wayne; Ruth and Harry Roman; Vidal and Jeanette Sassoon;  Guilford and Diane Glazer; Fred Hayman and his son, Robert; Frances and Sid  Klein; Nathan and Lily Shapell and Father Maurice Chase. Norm Crosby  entertained after dinner.  </P> <P> The event, which raised $200,000 for the charities, was stylishly chaired by  Ellen Byrens, Beverly Cohen and David Horne. Hal and Cynthia Gershman received  a special award for establishing a family center at the Hatzor Air Base in  Israel.  </P></p>

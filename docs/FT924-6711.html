			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Japanese synthetic fibres group declines to Y25bn in half year TORAY Industries, the Japanese synthetic fibres group, yesterday announced a 12.2 per cent fall in unconsolidated pre-tax profits to Y25.03bn (Dollars 201.2m) in the six months to September 30. Sales slipped 1.9 per cent to Y296.7bn, while net income fell 15.2 per cent to Y12.8bn, compared with Y15.03bn in the previous corresponding half year. Sales of fibres and textiles fell 1.6 per cent to Y166.1bn, despite higher sales for products used in clothing such as polyester filament and nylon. However, nylon sales to the tyre and carpet industries fell, reflecting the difficult trading conditions in the automotive and construction sectors. Plastics and chemicals sales were 7.9 per cent lower at Y90.8bn. The automotive industry's troubles also hit this division, while the slowdown in sales of electrical appliances and magnetic tapes also had an adverse impact. Chemicals sales moved higher led by caprolactam which is employed in synthetic fibre production. In the group's new products and other businesses area, sales advanced 13.5 per cent to Y39.9bn. Foreign sales of advanced composite materials which are used in the aircraft industry moved against the trend in the division although sales to the sporting goods business strengthened. Toray is forecasting a fall in net income for the 12 months to March 31 next year to Y25bn from Y27.2bn in 1992 and a slight rise in sales to Y600bn for the same term. Taisho Pharmaceutical posted a 1.7 per cent rise in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y28.8bn for the six months to September, writes Emiko Terazono. Sales rose 6.3 per cent to Y104.9bn. After-tax profits grew 7.1 per cent to Y14.5bn.</p>

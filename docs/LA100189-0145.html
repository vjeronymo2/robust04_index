			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REP. ROHRABACHER'S STANCE ON U.S. FUNDS FOR THE ARTS  </P> <P> In news coverage of controversial events that create a public outcry, such as  abortion protests, gay rights or the controversy over federal funding of the  NEA, groups who represent the so-called conservative viewpoint are invariably  tagged as "fundamentalist Christians" by your news reporters.  </P> <P> That tag is unfair. In the minds of your readers, it could represent that all  protesters who are morally outraged are intolerant, unfair Bible thumpers  guided by an almost fanatic belief that they are absolutely right and everyone  else is absolutely wrong, according to the teachings of Christianity.  </P> <P> There are great numbers of Americans who hold conservative opinions on moral  issues who have nothing to do with fundamentalist Christianity. I am one of  them. I am a Christian, yes, but I am not intolerant of other people's opinions  or their rights. Please don't lump all protesters who hold conservative  viewpoints under one general description of "fundamentalist Christians."  </P> <P> ELIZABETH N. MILLER  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

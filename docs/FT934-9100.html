			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UN tightens Lockerbie sanctions on Libya THE UN Security Council last night voted to tighten sanctions against Libya in a new effort to bring the two men accused of the Lockerbie airliner bombing to trial in Scotland or the US. The measures include freezing Libyan financial assets abroad, strengthening an existing ban on international air links by closing all foreign offices of the Libyan airline, and halting exports to Libya of oil refining and pipeline equipment. In addition, funds derived from Libya's oil and natural gas sales and from agricultural products must be paid into separate and exclusive bank accounts. Eleven member nations of the Security Council voted for the resolution. There were no votes against it but China, Pakistan, Morocco and Djibouti abstained. Libya so far has refused to hand over the two men accused of blowing up the Pan American airliner which disintegrated over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988 with the loss of 270 lives. The latest measures will not go into effect until December 1, giving Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, extra time to try to negotiate a solution. The new sanctions are likely to have a psychological rather than an immediate economic impact on Libya, particularly as they leave untouched its hydrocarbon export revenues, which amounted to Dollars 9.5bn last year - some 95 per cent of hard currency earnings. Closure of the state airline offices merely tightens an existing ban on air travel, an inconvenience Libyans have got used to since April 1992. Most of Libya's imports arrive by sea or road. The ban on parts and spares for the country's oil transport and export facilities is designed to erode its export capacity. There were hints last month that Libya might surrender the accused men for trial in Scotland but this came to nothing, ostensibly because their lawyers objected. An offer to hold the proceedings in Switzerland, which Mr Ali Ahmed Elhouderi, the Libyan delegate, repeated at the UN yesterday, has been rejected by Britain. The Libyan delegate insisted that only the venue was in dispute, not the question of holding a trial. The resolution was carefully drafted to cause as little interference as possible with western Europe's economic relations with Libya or with exploration contracts signed recently by Total of France, Eni-Agip of Italy and Petrofina of Belgium. In a bid to protect its own economic interests, including Libya's Dollars 4bn debt-for-arms purchases, Russia at first threatened to block the resolution. President Boris Yeltsin relented in response to personal appeals by President Bill Clinton and Mr John Major, the British prime minister. Russia voted for the resolution, which at its insistence included an affirmation of 'Libya's duty scrupulously to adhere to all of its obligations concerning servicing and repayment of its foreign debt'. Delaying imposition of the new measures until next month was also a Russian proposal.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, the NYSE proposal contains a new standard for evaluating whether a debt issuer has the ability to meet its interest obligations. Rather than using an earnings deficit, or the lack thereof, as the basis for making that determination, <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  the Exchange will rely instead on either (1) its own initial and continued listing standards for equity securities or (2) the analysis of a nationally recognized securities rating organization (``NRSRO''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , note 4 and accompanying text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, if an issuer of NYSE listed equity is in ``good standing'' with the Exchange, <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  the NYSE normally will list that company's debt securities so long as they have an aggregate market value or principal amount of at least $5 million. This standard also will apply to an issuer owned by, or under common control with, an issuer of NYSE listed equity; and to an issuer whose debt securities are guaranteed by an issuer of NYSE listed equity. According to the NYSE, because debt enjoys seniority over equity, the ``good standing'' test warrants listing an ``affiliated'' issuer's bonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 24. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In contrast, debt securities of an ``unaffiliated'' issuer <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  will not be eligible for initial listing on the NYSE unless an NRSRO has assigned a certain minimum rating to the bonds (or to other bonds issued by the same company). Thus, the NYSE will be able to list such a debt issue only if it has received a rating no lower than a Standard and Poor's (``S&amp;P'') Corporation ``B'' rating (or another NRSRO's equivalent thereof). If the issue proposed to be listed has not been rated, those bonds must be either senior to, or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pari passu  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> with, <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  an issue that has received at least an S&amp;P Corporation ``B'' rating (or another NRSRO's equivalent thereof). Alternatively, the proposed rule change will allow the NYSE to list unrated bonds that are junior to an investment grade issue. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As defined in the NYSE proposal, ``an `unaffiliated' issuer is one that has no equity securities listed on the Exchange; is not, directly or indirectly, majority-owned by, nor under common control with, an issuer of Exchange-listed equity securities; and is not issuing a debt security that an issuer of Exchange-listed equity securities is guaranteeing.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> pari passu <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  issue has equal standing with the debt issue proposed to be listed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To be investment grade, an issue must be assigned a rating no lower than an S&amp;P Corporation rating of ``BBB'' (or another NRSRO's equivalent thereof). The NYSE has indicated that it will apply this standard only to unrated bonds which are immediately junior to another rated class of securities issued by the same company.

Simon, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy; Fred Siesel, Director, Fixed Income Markets, NYSE; Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, SEC; and Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, on February 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As under current Paragraph 802.00, the NYSE will give consideration to delisting a bond issue if its aggregate market value or principal amount falls below $1 million, or if the issuer is unable to meet its obligations on the listed debt securities. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  The NYSE also will retain the discretion to remove a bond from listing if, among other things, ``authoritative advice [is] received that [the] security is without value.'' As a practical matter, the NYSE has indicated that it normally will not delist debt where there is value in the security and continued exchange trading is in the best interests of investors. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  The Exchange, however, has committed to give serious consideration to delisting a bond issue if the debt security has minimal or no value and the issuer is unable to meet its financial obligations. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3.

Further, if the common stock is delisted due to a violation of the NYSE's ``corporate responsibility'' criteria (including, but not limited to, the outside director, audit committee and shareholder voting requirements), <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  then the Exchange will delist all debt securities convertible into that common stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under Paragraph 801.00, other convertible securities will continue to be delisted when the related common stock is delisted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Section 3 of the Listed Company Manual. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On a related matter, Amendment No. 1, see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 3, clarifies that, if the NYSE delists the equity securities of a company which is the majority owner of an issuer of NYSE listed debt or the guarantor thereof, the Exchange will review the listing of the formerly ``affiliated'' issuer's bonds, convertible or otherwise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the NYSE has indicated that the listing and delisting standards for ``unaffiliated'' corporate issuers <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  also will apply to certain non-corporate issuers. In particular, the proposed rule change specifies that sovereign issues will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The NYSE proposal also will codify the Exchange's current policy that only term/dollar municipal bonds may be listed. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> notes 11&hyph;13 and accompanying text. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A term/dollar municipal bond is issued with a single maturity date (as opposed to a serial bond), and is quoted in dollars or as a percentage of its par value (rather than by yield).

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: London The gilts market faces a difficult few days, after the sell-off in world bond markets last week. US investors were reported to be heavy sellers of European bonds. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, described the market as 'truly unbelievable' in the wake of a series of economic statistics which should have been favourable for gilts. 'A week ago, if someone had said we will give you 10 statistics which point to a weak economy and low price pressures, and a German rate cut, I would have said gilts would be up three points. In fact they were down two. The market has lost track with fundamentals,' Mr Briscoe believes. With US Treasuries performing badly on a Philadelphia Fed report of an upturn in inflationary pressures, Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe), said: 'UK investors are looking to the US as a guide to the outlook in the UK'. All this is a bad omen for the next auction, of Pounds 2.5bn of 7 per cent gilt stock, due on Wednesday. Mr Richardson said there is a chance that gilts fell sufficiently last week to make the new stock attractive, with the spread over German bunds now 87 basis points. But Mr Briscoe warned it could be a make or break auction.</p>

Defense Secretariat Communique No. 27 stated that  armed groups attacked Indian villages that refused to cooperate  with the self-styled Zapatist National Liberation Army. The  communique added that 56 families were evicted with excessive  violence from Santa Elena, La Soleda, San Francisco, and San  Miguel Villages. The families were later given shelter by the  Rural Association of Common Interest [Asociacion Rural de  Interes Colectivo] in Ocosingo Municipality in eastern Chiapas.    The 7th Military Region Command received 27 complaints from  cattle ranchers in Ocosingo and Altamirano of looting by  aggressor groups. The office reported that on 27 January the  person in charge of one of the ranches attacked in Ocosingo had  stated that a group of 50 armed persons destroyed the ranch he  was guarding.    Near the Miguel Hidalgo ranches in Ocosingo, some 500 armed  individuals have surrounded 1,460 residents of nearby villages,  asking them for food and a "war tax" and threatening to kill  them if they do not join the armed movement.    A report received on 29 January stated that armed groups  burned four wooden houses and used mallets to destroy three  brick houses located close by the San Cristobal de las  Casas-Ocosingo highway near Nuevo Oxchuc village, the communique  added.    Residents of the 10 April and San Bartolo Ejidos went to  military installations in Comitan on Sunday to ask for help in  evacuating the refugees and to ask for food since armed groups  are blocking the roads.</p>

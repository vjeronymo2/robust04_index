			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Refat Chubarov, deputy chairman of the </F> Crimean Tatar assembly, by Mykola Marynenko; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Marynenko] I asked Refat  Chubarov about the assembly's possible actions when President  Meshkov holds a referendum on the status of Crimea.    [Chubarov, in Russian fading into Ukrainian translation] We  have always consistently opposed a referendum on the status of  Crimea since such a referendum would be held according to the  same mechanism as before, that is, following the will of the  majority of the population. We understand that, generally  speaking, it is a democratic norm. But the current majority of  the Crimean population and its emergence on the peninsula has  its peculiarities. That is why the Crimean Tatars have always  opposed any kind of referendum here which would decide crucial  matters of Crimea's development, ignoring the will of the  indigenous people. That is why if the moratorium on referendums  is lifted, I can definitely say that we will not take part in  such a referendum. [passage omitted]    [Marynenko] I asked the deputy chairman of the assembly  whether they are relying on Kiev to protect Crimean Tatars if  Meshkov does infringe on the legal interests of the Crimean  Tatar people in Crimea.    [Chubarov] Given the present situation and the present  composition of the Ukrainian Supreme Council and the current  president of Ukraine, there is no relying on that. The events  of the past three years showed that Kiev took and continues to  take an indulgent attitude toward separatists, hoping, perhaps,  that it will somehow bring these forces closer and somehow will  cool the separatist sentiments in Crimea. Time has proven,  however, that this only encourages them. Therefore, given the  present composition of the Ukrainian parliament, there is no  hoping that Kiev will protect not only the interests of the  Crimean Tatars but even its own state interests in Crimea in a  more resolute, but legal, way.    To fulfill Ukraine's state interests in Crimea and to solve  the problems of Crimea is impossible today without solving the  Crimea Tatar problem.</p>

			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Ford union leaders fear further job cuts UNION LEADERS at Ford, the US-owned vehicle manufacturer, have been called to a meeting with Ford's head of manufacturing in Europe this month, raising fears of further job losses at the company's plant in Halewood, Merseyside. Ford said yesterday that it had no immediate plans for cutting jobs in Britain beyond the reduction of 980 jobs among its manual workforce of 31,000 announced earlier this year. The company said it also had no plans to close either its Halewood plant or its plant in Dagenham, Essex - which employs 12,000 workers - and it required output from both to maintain European capacity. Mr Jimmy Airlie and Mr Jack Adams, the secretary and chairman of Ford unions in Britain, have been asked to meet Mr Albert Caspers, Ford's European vice-president for manufacturing operations, on April 25 and they expect to discuss Halewood's future. Although productivity has been raised at Halewood and Dagenham in the past two years, the unions are worried about the long-term future of both plants. Unions welcomed Ford's announcement this month of a Pounds 12.9m investment in Dagenham as a sign of the company's long-term commitment to the plant. However, it has implemented short-time working at Halewood because of a drop in demand for Escort cars. Redundancies at Ford are likely to form the background to pay negotiations later this year at the end of a two-year pay deal reached in 1989. Pay talks at Ford traditionally act as a benchmark for pay in the car industry and in manufacturing generally. Because the second half of the 1989 two-year deal guaranteed workers a rise of 2.5 per cent above inflation, Ford employees received a 13.4 per cent rise last November. The fall in demand for cars in Europe may make Ford less generous this year.</p>

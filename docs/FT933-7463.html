			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Customs removes double duty TRAVELLERS WHO buy goods in another EC country but return to the UK through a non-EC state will no longer be forced to pay duty twice, Customs said yesterday. Anyone who can produce evidence that goods imported to the UK were bought in another EC country for personal use with duty and tax paid will not be required to pay again. Since the lifting of border controls with the creation of the single European market at the start of the year, some travellers have been caught by the requirement to pay duty on all imports to the UK from a non-EC state. The travellers most affected have been those on yachts sailing to the UK from France via the Channel Islands, which are not part of the EC. Others affected included travellers from airports in Switzerland and Scandinavia.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / 'Tamilgate': something rotten in the state of Denmark - Hilary Barnes reports on the background and possible consequences of Copenhagen's gravest post-war political scandal IT STARTED with an illegal decision by a Danish minister of justice, and snowballed when his cabinet colleagues tried to cover up for him. Yesterday the affair that has become known as 'Tamilgate' turned into Denmark's most damaging political scandal since 1945. The prime minister, Mr Poul Schluter, who had held the office for more than 10 years, resigned last night in disgrace following the publication of a 6,000-page report by a judicial inquiry. The minority Conservative-Liberal coalition over which he had presided also looks unlikely to survive. His departure has plunged Denmark into political uncertainty just two weeks after it took over the rotating presidency of the European Community. It has removed a leader whose talents as a conciliator gave the country an unaccustomed degree of political stability. And it may, in the short term at least, prompt another burst of speculation against the Danish krone, which has been sporadically under pressure in Europe's exchange rate mechanism. The affair began in 1987, when the then justice minister, Mr Erik Ninn-Hansen, ordered civil servants to delay entry visas for the wives and children of Tamil refugees, although the Tamils had an explicit right under Danish law to bring their families to the country. The affair began to become a serious liability for the government when it emerged that attempts were made to prevent the parliamentary ombudsman from looking into the case. The controversy turned on whether the prime minister tried to cover up parts of the scandal in a 1989 speech to parliament. Yesterday's report by High Court judge Mogens Hornslet was damning in its conclusions. Mr Schluter 'has given the Folketing (parliament) and the Folketing's justice committee incomplete information, and in the commission's view, he must have known it', Judge Hornslet concluded. The judge found that in his 1989 speech, the prime minister misled MPs on nine separate points and provided them with information which was 'directly wrong'. The word 'lie' is not used. Mr Ninn-Hansen's successor as minister of justice, Mr H P Clausen, who is now parliamentary speaker, also said last night he would resign after being strongly criticised for giving misleading and incorrect information to parliament. A lawyer by profession, Mr Schluter was Denmark's longest-serving post-war prime minister. When he took office in September 1982, ending the 50-year domination of Danish politics by the Social Democratic party, the country was suffering from huge balance of payments and budget deficits and neither he nor anyone else thought that his government would endure for more than a few months. Instead he will be remembered as the leader of a government which restored the country's finances. There is now a large current account surplus and although the budget has recently dipped into the red again, it is one of the smallest deficits in the EC. On at least two occasions Mr Schluter showed great political courage. In 1985, a centre-left majority in parliament was prepared to prevent Denmark ratifying the Single European Act. He dished the opposition by calling a referendum. In 1988, the same parties created a crisis in the country's relations with Nato by demanding that alliance vessels entering Danish waters should declare whether or not they were carrying nuclear weapons. On that occasion Mr Schluter settled the issue by calling a general election. Following Mr Schluter's resignation, confusion prevails. An election is unlikely. So there will now be an interregnum while the eight Folketing parties try to establish majority support for a successor. The outgoing prime minister has nominated Mr Henning Dyremose, the finance minister, but it was unclear yesterday whether he would obtain the necessary support, or whether there will be a change of government, which might let in the Social Democrats after 10 years in opposition. Although Denmark's political crisis may leave the EC rudderless for the time being, political commentators in Copenhagen do not expect it to affect the outcome of the second Danish referendum on Maastricht, probably in May.  ---------------------------------       THE DANISH PARLIAMENT  --------------------------------- Parties                   Seats  --------------------------------- Ruling coalition Conservative                 30 Liberal                      29  --------------------------------- Supporters Centre Democrats              9 Christian People's            4 Radical Liberals              7  --------------------------------- Opposition Social Democratic            69 Socialist People's           15 Anti-Maastricht Progress     12  --------------------------------- Special seats Faroes                        2 Greenland                     2 Total                       179  ---------------------------------</p>

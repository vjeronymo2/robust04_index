			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: BSN scales down plans to restrict voting rights BSN, France's largest food group, has scaled down plans to protect itself from hostile takeovers, in response to objections from institutional shareholders that their voting rights were being curbed. Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's chairman, said he would ask shareholders at an extraordinary meeting on September 30 to agree that planned new limits on voting rights should cease to apply once a bidder had bought more than 67 per cent of the group's capital. Previously, he was planning to ask the meeting to make the new voting limits apply up to a ceiling of 90 per cent of BSN's equity, after which level they would be lifted. The planned restrictions would limit holders of shares with single voting rights to vote for 6 per cent of BSN's equity capital, rising to 12 per cent for holders of shares with double voting rights. Shares in French companies held for two years automatically get double voting rights. BSN is proposing the new curbs to avoid being caught by surprise by this process. Some of BSN's largest shareholders were irritated by the 90 per cent plan and the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the stock exchange watchdog, has in the past disapproved of excessively restrictive voting curbs. In common with many French companies, BSN also has a 'poison pill' under which loyal shareholders would acquire 20 per cent of the equity in the event of a hostile bid. This provision would remain.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / People: Zographos' new commercial break Meridian Broadcasting, the new ITV company for the south and south east of England is losing its finance director Stratis Zographos within days of going on air. He has been poached by Andrew Quinn, chief executive of the ITV Network Centre, which will be responsible for commissioning ITV's network schedule, to be its first commercial director. Stratis will be responsible for programme budgets in excess of Pounds 500m a year. Since 1984, Stratis, who was born in Eritrea of Greek parents but who has lived in the UK for 30 years, presided with skill and humour over the accumulating cash pile at TV-am. The breakfast station that lost its franchise would have accumulated Pounds 50m by the end of the year had it not been for last month's Pounds 26m distribution to shareholders. The new job means that for a brief period Zographos, who is 48, will hold three senior broadcasting jobs. Until the end of March he is still technically director of finance at TV-am and then there will be the handover period between Meridian and the ITV Network Centre. Although Zographos says he is moving to the Network Centre because of the challenge of helping ITV make more efficient and cost-effective programmes, he also says: 'I'm not talking about cost-cutting. The last thing I want to do is harm production values on the screen. The viewer has to come first.' He worked a video editing machine during the dispute at TV-am. Before moving to TV-am, Zographos worked for a range of companies including Conoco, Valor Group, Muraspec and Fobel International. But television is his business now. 'I really love this industry,' he says.</p>

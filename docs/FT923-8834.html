			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / US Fed intervenes as dollar nears low against D-Mark THE FEDERAL Reserve bought dollars in foreign exchange markets yesterday as the US currency threatened to slip to its all-time low against the D-Mark. Making its first move shortly after the London market closed, the Fed bought dollars four or five times at levels ranging from DM1.4675 to DM1.473. The first round of intervention lifted the US currency to DM1.475 but in a market almost devoid of participants it drifted lower to DM1.4668 by the end of New York trading. The Fed's action, the second attempt to prop up the dollar in less than three weeks, followed the release of disappointing US employment figures for July. These showed a rise of 198,000 month-on-month, underlining the sluggish growth of the economy. Dealers had expected a larger overall rise. The dollar's fall weakened sterling. Dealers said the pound fell at one stage to DM2.8232, its lowest since sterling joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism in October 1990. Sterling closed down in Europe at DM2.8250, although it picked up in New York to DM2.8334, benefiting from the Fed's intervention. The pound's poor London performance was mirrored by another bad day for UK equities, with the FT-SE 100 share index dropping 27.5 to 2,350.1. The closing level was better than dealers had expected earlier in the day. After bottoming out at 2,344.9, the index took heart from Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up some 25 points at mid-session. The Dow eventually succumbed to profit-taking and concerns about the economy, however, and closed down 8.38 at 3,332.18. The fall in London rounded off an unhappy week for UK stocks, with the FT-SE shedding about 2 per cent of its value.

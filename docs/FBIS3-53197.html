			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] AL-BA'TH highlights the important upcoming summit  between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. It notes  comments by Swiss papers, which highlight this meeting,  considering it a major event, expressing hope that the meeting  will achieve its desired objectives and give great momentum to  the peace process.    AL-BA'TH notes various media reports about Syria's major,  key  role in the peace process. Syria not only defends its national  interests. It also strongly defends all Arab interests. U.S.  President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher  were the first to note that there can be no peace in the region  without Syria.    The paper adds: It is common knowledge that Syria, as the  entire world has acknowledged, contributed to the convening of  the Madrid conference. Syria still believes that the Madrid  formula remains the basis in any real endeavor to establish a  just and comprehensive peace. Syria has repeatedly said that a  comprehensive solution alone would lead to peace and stability  in the region.    AL-BA'TH concludes: The Geneva summit between Presidents  Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton is extremely important. As many  observers think, the summit comes at a time when the peace  process has reached a dead end because of Israel's rejection of  the Madrid formula and its refusal to implement international  resolutions that stipulate full withdrawal from the occupied  Arab territories. Therefore, the whole world hopes the Geneva  summit will give new momentum to the stalled peace process. To  achieve this, the U.S. Administration is required to take a  firmer stance to consolidate the principle of international  legitimacy.    AL-THAWRAH says the world is looking in the direction of  Geneva and is anxiously awaiting the convening of the summit  between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton and its  results, which, it is hoped, will usher in a new stage of  U.S.-Syrian ties and cooperation regarding the peace process.    AL-THAWRAH adds that the nature of the issues and hot topics  that will be discussed, in addition to other issues which the  two presidents are expected to address, will make the summit  meeting a historic event and a major turning point, especially  in light of the constant, principled positions of al-Asad's  Syria toward these issues. These positions, as everybody has  acknowledged, are now firmly embraced by the world. This  confirms the credibility of Syrian policy and its sound approach.    The summit reflects a clear recognition of Syria's  important,  central, and weighty role. It is also a U.S. and international  confirmation that Syria is a major party to the Middle East  equation, a major interlocutor, and truly embodies hopes and  aspirations for the liberation of lands and restoration of  rights.    AL-THAWRAH asserts that leader al-Asad is a man of constants  and difficult historic positions in difficult times. He has  proven under all circumstances, and in an age of stormy changes  and developments, that he is the person most capable of steering  the nation's ship toward a safe shore. Al-Asad is going to  Geneva to speak in the name of all Arabs. The nation which  authorized him realizes that he is its faithful son and honest  leader who can be entrusted with issues concerning future and  destiny.    While stressing the importance of the summit and the fact  that it is a juncture between war and peace, its success depends  on the U.S. side which sponsored the peace process and which is  authorized by the international community and how much it is  willing to pressure Israel to rectify the course of the peace  process, abide by the Madrid point of reference and formula, and  adhere to all resolutions of international legitimacy. Any  other wager that does not take into consideration a radical  change in Israeli positions and performance toward peace is an  illusion and self-deception that will not lead to any result.</p>

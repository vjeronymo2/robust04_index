A large number of peasants are conducting spring  plowing in the vast areas of farmland in Guangdong and Guangxi  Provinces.    Even though it rained often and has been cold since the  beginning of spring, peasants in south Guangdong still adhered  to their farming timetable; carried out spring plowing; turned  the soil and harrowed the land; and transplanted rice and sugar  cane seedlings.    According to the Agriculture Ministry's statistics, as of  early March, Guangdong has completely sown 860,000 mu of paddy  rice fields, or 57 percent of the total sowing area. Such  progress was faster than in 1993. Guangdong has improved 6.3  million mu of farmland, or a third of the total acreage of  farmland to be improved. Guangdong has planted 8.31 million mu  of land with spring crops including sugar cane, groundnuts, and  vegetables, including 2.9 million mu of sugar cane, or 70  percent of the planned target.    It has been learned that various localities in Guangdong  will  pay attention to checking wasteland and multiple plowing tasks  in an effort to ensure the implementation of grain planting  plans. Many cities and counties will also try in every possible  way to increase investments in the agricultural sector.</p>

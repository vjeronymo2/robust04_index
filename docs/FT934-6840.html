			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Italy's tide of protest If Italy's post-war political system has been a knotted ball of intricately-woven string, then Sunday was the day when it finally unravelled. Municipal elections to select mayors in 428 cities completed the political demolition of the long-ruling Christian Democrat party. Still more strongly than in the referendum on electoral reform in April and the municipal polls in June, the vote showed the unstoppable momentum of protest against the country's scandal-tainted mainstream parties. The swing to the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) and the neo-Fascist MSI party, coupled with the fresh momentum behind Mr Umberto Bossi's Northern League, led yesterday to sharp falls on Italian financial markets. The result was, however, hardly unexpected, in view of the widespread discrediting of the political apparatus during the past two years. The established parties are passing through inevitable catharsis, as part of more general change. After the progress already made during the past year towards political and economic reform, there is room for hope  - although not yet conclusive evidence - that a new system will emerge, stronger, more stable and less self-serving than before. If Sunday's result were repeated in the general elections expected in early 1994, the four parties behind the coalition government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi would gain no more than 15 per cent of the vote. The aim of electoral reform, which will introduce a largely majority voting system for the next election, is to produce a more coherent and stable constellation of parties better able to modernise Italy's industrial and administrative structure and regain public confidence. Chief anxiety In contrast, the chief anxiety on the financial markets yesterday was that the next parliament could be dominated by untried political groups united only by their tendencies towards populist extremism and (in the case of the Northern League) separatism. There is also concern that the setback for the government parties could complicate still further Mr Ciampi's task of steering his tough 1994 budget through parliament. Two senior ministers have already said they will resign if the budget is not passed by the end-year deadline. These fears cannot be lightly disregarded, but the risks should not be exaggerated. The swing to the neo-fascists in southern Italy was far more a signal of rejection of the Christian Democrats than a revival of a Mussolini-type movement. The dictator's photogenic granddaughter, standing in Naples, indeed, did less well than expected. Principal victor The principal victor on Sunday, the PDS, has shown it can run successful local alliances with parties such as the Greens and Radicals. Although the ex-communist party's economic policies, in particular, need much sharper definiton, it is on the way towards becoming the main standard-bearer of Italian social democracy. Benefiting from a clear lead over the Christian Democrats in reorganising its structure and its leadership, the PDS has yet to face the force of a reconstructed party of the centre, which could still emerge under Mr Mario Segni, the ex-Christian Democrat head of the April referendum movement. But there is no reason why a PDS-led government next year would produce policies fundamentally different from those undertaken by Mr Ciampi. No party likely to take power next year seems disposed to reverse the process of reforming wage legislation, restructuring the civil service and welfare spending, and reshaping the budget. The PDS, for instance, would be unlikely to halt the privatisation programme or reintroduce the scala mobile system of wage indexation dismantled in 1992. Whatever government is in charge will face an arduous agenda. Precisely because the challenges are so large and so evident, they cannot however be avoided. For 45 post-war years, the rules of the Italian political system were geared to keeping the Communist party out of office. Now that the old system has collapsed under its own disrepute, it would be a cause of neither surprise nor alarm if that party's successor became the first to take power under the new one.</p>

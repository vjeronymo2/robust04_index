			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BERNSTINE WANTS BALL OR A TRADE  </P> <P> Rod Bernstine, a No. 1 draft choice in 1987, said Monday he is fed up with his  limited playing time and would like to be traded if the Chargers aren't willing  to give him more opportunities to carry the ball.  </P> <P> "I'd be agreeable to a trade now," Bernstine said. "It's not benefiting me to  stay here on the sideline. I'm not getting any younger. If I was going out and  not gaining any yards, dropping balls or something, where I didn't deserve to  play, I would sit over there without a gripe in the world. But I'm not doing  any of those things."  </P> <P> Bernstine, 25, a running back who has averaged 4.9 yards in 27 carries this  season, has been criticized in the past for not being durable and for being an  ineffective blocker.  </P> <P> Asked about Bernstine's situation, Coach Dan Henning said: "If you want to have  the job, be the best. He's not the best. Marion (Butts) is."  </P> <P> Originally drafted out of Texas A&amp;M as a tight end, Bernstine was switched  to running back during the off-season. He said limited action didn't bother him  during exhibition season, but it does now.  </P> <P> "It slowly wears on you when you get in for a couple of plays and you think you  do a decent job and then you don't get the ball," he said. "That kind of stuff  would have anybody discouraged. It's definitely not fun."  </P> <P> Tuesday is the NFL's trading deadline, but Charger General Manager Bobby  Beathard said there is no chance Bernstine will be shipped out.  </P> <P> "No possibility," Beathard said. "We recognize the talent, and we recognize  that he's a threat when he has the ball. It's our job to get him the ball  either as a runner or receiver. He's got to touch the ball a lot if we're going  to be successful."  </P> <P> Bernstine had surgery for a torn anterior cruciate ligament late in the 1988  season. He played only five games last season, starting none. He isn't hot  trade bait because of a belief around the NFL that he doesn't have the  endurance to be used in a full-time capacity. Bernstine doesn't agree with  that, and he also disputes the knock on his blocking.  </P> <P> "Something always is there that I can't do," he said. "They never talk about  the positive, but it's always something like I can't block. I'm too big not to  be able to block, so that's not true. If you can't block, why would you be a  No. 1 draft choice?"  </P> <P> On the subject of his durability, he said: "I haven't asked to carry the ball  25 or 30 times a game, but I wouldn't mind carrying it 10 or 15 times. I'd just  like to get in the ballgame and play a little while. You know, good backs can't  just go in, run one play and run off the field. You've got to get into the flow  of the game."  </P> <P> The Chargers use four running backs: Butts, Bernstine, Ronnie Harmon and Darrin  Nelson. Of the four, Butts in the only one who has played on a consistent  basis, 79 times for 384 yards. Harmon has carried 10 times for 46 yards, Nelson  twice for nine yards.  </P> <P> Alternating running backs has its advantages. It eliminates late-game fatigue.  But Bernstine says it also makes it impossible to build continuity.  </P> <P> "If you only carry the ball three times, you're fresh as a daisy," he said.  "That's being a little too fresh."  </P></p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / German inflation 'beaten' at 2.9%: Early cuts in key interest rates unlikely, Bonn adviser says German inflation is beaten, but cuts in key interest rates are unlikely in the near future, leading officials said yesterday. 'The Bundesbank has won the battle against inflation,' said Mr Wolfgang Franz, one of the 'five wise men' on the Bonn government's council of economic advisers. The annual rate of consumer price rises had fallen to 2.9 per cent this month, and if the effects of administered prices - charges for local and federal government services - were excluded, it would be just over 2 per cent, he said. Speaking in an interview with a domestic news agency, Mr Franz ducked questions on the possibility of further interest rate cuts raised by falling inflation. That was more Bundesbank territory, he said. But Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the central bank president, made plain there was little likelihood of change. His remark earlier this week that 'the horizon for rates was now cleared for some time' - which caused this week's sharp fall in German stock markets - related only to the discount and Lombard rates, he said on radio. It was obvious that money market levels - including the repo rate at which the bank supplies short-term liquidity to the markets - must be able to move freely in the range of the 4.5 per cent discount and the 6 per cent Lombard, he added. His explanation seemed to be intended to clear up any lingering doubts still unsettling local and international financial markets. Mr Franz said he and his colleagues were investigating the persistent strong growth in money supply behind the Bundesbank's decision to put rates on hold. However, he had more positive views on the economy. West German gross domestic product would grow by 'a good 1 per cent' this year, he said. Whether that meant 1.3 or 1.5 per cent could not be discerned from the available data. Mr Herbert Hax, the council chairman, said separately yesterday that 1.5 per cent real growth was possible this year. Although the council does not issue interim reports, yesterday's statements suggest a marked change of heart. In its formal forecast last November, the council's prediction of stagnation in the west ran counter to government and economic institutes' expectations of 1 to 1.5 per cent growth. Opinions on prospects from all acknowledged expert sources are now broadly in line.</p>

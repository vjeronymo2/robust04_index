			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Vassiliou emerges poll favourite President George Vassiliou of Cyprus yesterday appeared well placed to win re-election after Greek-Cypriot voters gave him a substantial lead in the first of two presidential ballots, writes Kerin Hope in Nicosia. Mr Vassiliou, an independent supported by the still powerful Communist party, secured 44.2 per cent of the vote on Sunday, against 36.7 per cent for Mr Glafcos Clerides, leader of the right-wing Democratic Rally party. Centrist Mr Paschalis Paschalides won 18.6 per cent.</p>

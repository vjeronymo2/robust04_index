			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (20): Tiny twins turn their attention to Europe - Profile, The Channel Islands AS RECENTLY as 30 years ago, the Channel Islands scarcely had an offshore financial industry worthy of the name. Now, however, Jersey and Guernsey together boast bank deposits of over Pounds 85bn and offshore investment funds worth not far short of Pounds 30bn. To put this into perspective, the two tiny islands - Jersey has a population of rather more than 80,000, Guernsey of about 60,000 - have attained a size statistically equivalent to between a fifth and a quarter of the banking and investment funds industries on the UK mainland. This is, of course, rather deceptive. These offshore centres are basically booking and processing centres, and almost all of the money is actually sent on to the UK or elsewhere for investment. And while Jersey and Guernsey are big in these particular sectors, they are very small in life assurance and pensions, because these kinds of investment lack the tax incentives that have driven their growth on the mainland. Guernsey and Jersey have also long been prominent in the area of offshore trusts, a standard means by which wealthy people can hold assets out of reach of mainland tax men. Another important service is offshore company registration, sometimes for big multinational parent groups, but more usually for family businesses or for the purpose of individual tax planning. The relatively high costs of the Channel Islands mean that they find little attraction in seeking low-value business from the mainland, although several UK building societies market offshore deposit accounts from Jersey and Guernsey. For a better choice of building societies, and a selection of offshore life companies, try the Isle of Man, or Dublin. In the past the staple business of Jersey and Guernsey has been providing investment services to UK expatriates dotted around the world, who find it convenient and safe to hold their investments in the tax-free Channel Islands. More recently, however, the islands have been developing the concept of 'offshore Europe', in order to attract custom from the European Community, outside which they lie for the purposes of financial services. Guernsey, in particular, has been forging interesting connections with various Swiss banks which have found it less and less profitable to handle private banking business within their own borders, mainly for tax reasons. Geographically, the Channel Islands are reasonably well-positioned, within a short plane ride of London, Paris, Zurich and other European centres, and in this respect they score over centres such as Bermuda and Cayman. In terms of type of business, they have positioned themselves in the middle of the market, seeking business from the moderately wealthy - although the super-rich probably still get a better service in Switzerland. Quality of service can still be a problem. Labour shortages have been eased by the recent recession, but investors who use offshore centres have to balance the tax advantages with the frustrations and hassle of dealing with faraway bank officials. It is not easy to run substantial financial industries out there in amongst the ocean waves, but Jersey and Guernsey manage the trick better than most of their rivals.</p>

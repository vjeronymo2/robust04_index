			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Frederick Cooper shows 14% decline to Pounds 1.96m PROFITS OF Frederick Cooper, the West Midlands-based architectural hardware, specialist coatings and electrical products group, fell by 14 per cent from Pounds 2.29m to Pounds 1.96m pre-tax for the six months to January 31. However, the interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p from lower fully diluted earnings of 2.8p per share against 3.2p. Mr Eddie Kirk, chairman, said trading conditions during the second half had weakened . . . 'and, as yet, there are no signs of recovery in our markets.' Turnover was relatively static at Pounds 41.4m but profits were bolstered by an exceptional credit of Pounds 312,000, representing the net contribution of a pension surplus of Pounds 400,000 and proceeds from a property disposal offset by rationalisation costs. During the period, specialist coatings sold at record levels - largely because of the German market. However, architectural hardware sales, held back by the weakness of the UK construction industry, slipped by 7 per cent and the electrical products division fell into loss. So far in the second six months the electrical products division has moved back to profit, but February and March were poor for architectural hardware, which now accounts for 60 per cent of group turnover.</p>

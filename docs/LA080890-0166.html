			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ME AND ROGER AND 325 OTHERS  </P> <P> Singers Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme helped retired General Motors Corp.  Chairman Roger B. Smith say goodby to hundreds of friends at an opulent bash  featuring smoked duck and $120-a-bottle champagne.  </P> <P> "It was one of the most elegant functions like that that I've ever attended,  and I've been to quite a few," said David Cole, a University of Michigan  official and son of the late Edward Cole, former president of GM.  </P> <P> "I would have traded my salary for what it would have cost to put that on,"  Cole said. "I'm sure it was an expensive proposition."  </P> <P> Sunday's get-together became known as "the $5-million party." GM officials said  that figure was "ridiculous," but declined to say how much it cost.  </P> <P> "This is the usual party we have for retiring top executives," GM spokesman Jim  Crellin said.  </P> <P> There were 326 people on the guest list, including seven of Forbes magazine's  400 richest people in America. No one from Ford Motor Co. nor Chrysler Corp.  was there.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 'SIMPSONS' BEAUTY TELLS ALL  </P> <P> Marge Simpson's biggest pet peeves are defective shower caps and "oh, yes, . .  . the senselessness of war."  </P> <P> Marge, the blue-haired beauty from TV's cartoon sitcom, "The Simpsons," reveals  all in an "exclusive and, uh, animated interview" in the September issue of  Glamour.  </P> <P> For instance, her favorite way to relax:  </P> <P> "First I lock myself in the laundry room. Then, I put the clothes in the  washer, watch them go round and round and round, and get lost in the wonder of  it all.  </P> <P> "Forty-five minutes later, my whites are whiter, my colors are brighter and I  feel like the Queen of England."  </P> <P> And what makes this two-dimensional TV star feel sexy?  </P> <P> "A roaring fire, a moonlit walk, looking into the eyes of a loved one over an  expensive glass of wine," she confided. "If that ever happened to me, that  might work."  </P> <P> The Fox Broadcasting Co. show was created by cartoonist Matt Groening.  </P></p>

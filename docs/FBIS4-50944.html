			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jean Leclerc du Sablon in Beijing: </F> "Aerospatiale Jockeying for Position in China"]    [Text] Aerospatiale has decided "to make long-term  investments in China," announced Louis Gallois, its president  and one of the first major French CEO's to have come to study  opportunities opened by last January's normalization of  relations between Paris and Beijing. Among his priorities: To  collaborate with the Chinese in the space industry field.    "We must have a greater presence and convince the Chinese  authorities and companies that we are in China for the long  run," insisted the French manufacturer. With 43 Airbus ordered  by China, of which only 12 are already in operation (compared  with 225 Boeings and 100 or so McDonnell Douglas aircraft),  Aerospatiale's share of the Chinese market is far below its  world market share of 30 percent.    There are various reasons for France's aerospace industry's  poor performance in China. The sale of Dassault Mirage 2000-5  fighters to Taiwan precipitated political sanctions which  affected several sectors. U.S. manufacturers, supported by  their government and by procurement policy guidelines of the  Chinese authorities, managed to generate "purchasing habits" in  China.  <H5>  Pilot Training Center </H5>   "We can no longer use the political situation as an excuse;  we must make substantial efforts to achieve a share that we  consider just," Louis Gallois notes.    The Chinese authorities are getting ready to welcome "in a  few days" a technical mission sent by Aerospatiale to explore  potential areas for cooperation with Chinese industrials,  including satellites. "Long March" rockets are "competitors  equipped with modern technologies, but here, too, we can find a  way to collaborate, through technical exchange and concept  adjustment," Louis Gallois explains. "China is important as a  market, but also because of its existing technological know-how."    Other goals of the group include the projected Airbus'  training center for civilian and possibly military pilots and  technicians to be set up near Beijing Airport, as well as a  storehouse for spare parts. The European Union is currently  considering lifting the ban on military cooperation it imposed  after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989.    Also in progress is the development of a light helicopter in  partnership with China (25 percent), Singapore (16 percent), and  Eurocopter. Beside Airbus, Louis Gallois has been pushing the  French-Italian ATR 42 [Regional Transport Plane] turboprop. So  far, the Chinese authorities' interest has been nonexistent.  For political reasons, no doubt, but also due to a kind of  snobbishness: They think turboprops are "backward." As a  result, regional airlines have purchased jets, which epitomize  "modernity." However, they now complain that they cannot fill  them to capacity.</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'SCENT OF FEAR' AT THE LIBRARY  </P> <P> Re Dana Parsons' column "Scent of Fear Sends Scribe to Library Seeking Answers"  (Oct. 3): Dana Parsons' humorous attempt at looking at the Santa Ana Library  issue fell flat.  </P> <P> To him it may be a situation of levity, but to those directly involved, it's  mighty serious.  </P> <P> Maybe Mr. Parsons has never worked in an environment in which staff has been  afraid to come to work the next day because of tension in the workplace.  </P> <P> The library staff and library board have been attempting to resolve this  volatile situation for two years.  </P> <P> An axiom of sociology is that if someone perceives something to be real/true,  then for them it is real/true, regardless of what others think.  </P> <P> I wonder if Mr. Parsons would have taken the same cavalier approach had the  issue concerned another department -- perhaps the police or even The Times. I  think not.  </P> <P> Maybe next time when Mr. Parsons goes to the library, instead of checking out  "The Mutants Are Coming," he might check "An Introduction to Good Investigative  Reporting," a book that might offer a resolution to a pressing issue.  </P> <P> DON W. HAFFNER  </P> <P> Chairman,  </P> <P> Santa Ana Library Board  </P></p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Arts: Lloyd Webber buys Tissot IN RECENT weeks there have been queues around the Adelphi theatre in London as punters rush to buy tickets for the next Lloyd Webber, his musical interpretation of Sunset Boulevard, scheduled for the summer. The show seems certain to open to box office takings well above Pounds 1m. This is fortunate, because it seems likely that Sir Andrew has already spent the money. At Christie's in New York on Thursday a painting by the French 19th century artist, Tissot, of his mistress Kathleen Newton, sold for Dollars 2.97m (Pounds 2m). 'L'Orpheline', one of Tissot's largest canvases, depicts Newton dressed in widow's black, with a young girl, the orphan of the title. It was a record price for a Tissot, beating the Dollars 1.98m paid at Sotheby's 24 hours earlier for 'The Woman of Fashion'. In 1879 Tissot sold 'L'Orpheline' in London for Pounds 500. The buyer this week was David Mason, of Macconnal Mason, the London dealer who advises Sir Andrew. It is a typical Lloyd Webber picture. He has extended his collection to take in 19th century ceramics and the odd Old Master (he paid Pounds 10.12m last year for a Canaletto view of Whitehall, now on loan to the Tate), but Victorian art remains his great love and he has the finest private collection in the country. He is also prepared to out-bid the competition. The estimate on this Tissot was a modest Dollars 600-Dollars 800,000. Mason had also been busy on his behalf on Wednesday, paying a record Dollars 800,000 for a work by Sir Frank Dicksee. 'The Mirror' shows another beautiful woman admiring herself in a hand mirror. Almost single handedly Sir Andrew has enthused Victorian pictures, which have been out of fashion in recent years. Christie's auction of 19th century art raised Dollars 6.4m and was 91 per cent sold. The most macabre picture on offer also found a buyer, for Dollars 444,000, a record for the artist, Alexandre Cabanel. It shows Cleopatra coolly observing the deaths of her slaves as she tries out various poisons before choosing the asp for her own exit. The revival in the American economy has enabled New York to lead the art market out of recession. Victorian art, which is attractive to new collectors, is the beneficiary of this regained confidence.</p>

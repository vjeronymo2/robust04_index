			<p>BFN     [Text] Suriname and Guyana are working on strengthening  their relations and increasing cooperation among them.  Suriname's admittance to Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] next  month is expected to create possibilities to make these  intentions come true. So says the Surinamese president.  Meanwhile Guyana's president, Cheddi Jagan, has assured his  Dutch counterpart of his country's support for Suriname's  request for Caricom membership. President Jagan arrived in  Suriname on Monday [20 June] for a four-day official visit.  Marion Riedewald reports:    [Begin recording] [Riedewald] President Ronald Venetiaan  says  the border dispute between Suriname and Guyana should be solved  in order to promote collaboration between the two countries.  Guyana, 25 years ago, occupied the piece of land which she  claims to be hers. The countries are disputing about where the  source of the bordering Corantijn River is. The problem  originates from the time when Suriname was a colony of the  Netherlands and Guyana a colony of England. Holland and England  then agreed that the Corantijn River would be the border to  Suriname and Guyana, taking the uppper Corantijn as the source  of the Corantijn. Now President Ronald Venetiaan suggests  international mediation to solve this problem. However, the  border dispute should not stand in the way of positive  collaboration between the two nations, say the Surinamese  president.    During a special address to the National Assembly on Tuesday  [21 June], Guyana's president, Cheddi Jagan, said the Corantijn  River should not be dividing, but uniting the two countries. He  suggested that the parliaments of Suriname and Guyana make laws  that enable mutual private investments in the two countries.    [Jagan] Clearly we cannot be satisfied merely with the  establishment of democratic institutions. Our democratic  institutions, including our parliaments, must function in a  manner that puts the welfare of our people at the central point  of our purpose.    [Riedewald] Bilateral collaboration is not enough says  Jagan.  Suriname and Guyana should also work together within regional  organizations.    During his four-day visit to Suriname, President Jagan  visited the state oil company, the banana company, and  (Effebacher) power plants and other production facilities in  Suriname.

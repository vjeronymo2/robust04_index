			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SLATER BLINKS, REPORTS TO RAMS  </P> <P> When it comes to playing football, the Rams are pretty good. When it comes to  playing hardball, nobody does it better.  </P> <P> Offensive tackle Jackie Slater ended his 28-day holdout Wednesday and reported  to Rams Park. The six-time Pro Bowl selection didn't get his contract  re-negotiated, however. He obviously didn't get the trade he demanded three  weeks ago, either. And he apparently didn't get the Rams to waive the fines  levied against him, which could total $42,000 if he was being fined the NFL  maximum of $1,500 a day.  </P> <P> Slater, 36, a 14-year veteran who will earn a reported $550,000 this year, was  seeking a deal that would put him on a level with the league's highest-paid  offensive linemen. (Cincinnati's Anthony Munoz, for example, earns $875,000 a  year).  </P> <P> Instead, Slater apparently got a verbal guarantee that he would be more fairly  compensated in 1991, when he will set a club record for longevity, breaking the  mark of 15 seasons established by Charlie Cowan, Joe Scibelli and Merlin Olsen.  </P> <P> "I had the opportunity to sit down with the organization and we mutually agreed  on some things that addressed the problem that I was having, so here I am,"  Slater said. When asked direct questions about his contract and the fines, he  would only say, "it's Rams' policy not to re-negotiate contracts" and "it's  Rams policy not to waive fines."  </P> <P> That much, of course, he knew before he decided to hold out. So why did he  return?  </P> <P> "We had a meeting of the minds and everyone concerned feels that my goals are  realistic and I should be given the opportunity to obtain them," Slater said.  "We agreed on the fact that I will be playing here next year. All the details  haven't been ironed out, but I'll be here and I'm very pleased with the way the  Rams ended up handling my situation."  </P> <P> However, Slater said he was "certainly serious" when he requested that the Rams  trade him. "My feeling was that I was able to play two more years, regardless  of where it was," he said. "When I felt I wasn't going to be here, I looked at  it as an opportunity to see what was inside me, to go to a different system at  my age, be impressive enough to make the club and then start in a different  offense. It was a challenging thought, to say the least, and something that I  was certainly going to get up for."  </P> <P> During the early days of the holdout, Coach John Robinson lashed out at Slater,  pointing out that Slater was under contract and ought to think about his  obligations to the team. But Slater said he has no ill will toward the Rams.  </P> <P> "I don't have any hard feelings about what was said in the past," he said. "All  of that was in the past. Hopefully, this will all be put to rest now and we can  concentrate on trying to accomplish some of the team goals that we have."  </P> <P> Robinson, not surprisingly, was 100% behind that line of reasoning.  </P> <P> "I'm sure I irritated and frustrated him," Robinson said. "But I was frustrated  at the time, too. Relationships between human beings have frustration involved.  Unfortunately, (our relationships) undergo the scrutiny of the press. Those are  things you just have to get by.  </P> <P> "And despite those statements I made, my respect for Jackie is as much as for  any athlete I've ever known."  </P> <P> Slater, who has been running and working out on his own during the holdout,  said he planned on playing in Saturday night's exhibition game against Phoenix.  </P> <P> "Football shape and just what I've been doing are a lot different, though," he  said. "The next couple of days will tell the story to me about how much I can  play (Saturday). But I've got two solid weeks of work before the season opener,  so I'll be ready by then."  </P> <P> While admitting he was angry and frustrated at times during the past month,  Slater said he never gave up hope of reaching an agreement.  </P> <P> "There was always dialogue and there was never a closed ear, on my part or  theirs," Slater said. "Fortunately, there was always a thread of hope, despite  the gloomy circumstances that existed at one time. That thread turned into a  couple of strands and from there into a rope."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson said he would alternate Gaston Green and Curt Warner at  running back during Saturday's exhibition game against Phoenix, with the  intention of getting more work for Warner. "He needs now to get enough carries  to feel his progress," Robinson said. "To me, he's making really good progress.  It's like a guy in spring training who's swinging the bat real well but hitting  .210. Curt's doing very well, but he's been overshadowed by Green." Green has  gained 186 yards in 35 carries during the exhibition season. Warner has only 32  yards in 14 carries. . . . Running back Cleveland Gary's back continues to  cause problems and Robinson said he may or may not play Saturday. "He goes and  then all of a sudden the muscle starts cramping up and he can't go anymore,"  Robinson said. "Hopefully, it's getting better, but I'm certainly not going to  play him unless I feel he's past it."  </P> <P> Linebacker Mel Owens, who has been experiencing continued back pain, underwent  a Magnetic Resonance Imaging test Wednesday and Dr. William Dillin diagnosed  the problem as disc inflammation. Owens will be out indefinitely. . . . Results  of an arthrogram performed on the left wrist of defensive tackle Mike Piel were  negative and the injury was diagnosed as a sprain. Piel, who also has a sore  left elbow, is questionable for Saturday night's game.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed RBE: "Gist Incorporating R&amp;D in </F>  Divisions"]    [Text] Since 1 January, Gist-brocades, a biotechnology  company from Delft, has been operating with a thoroughly  decentralized research unit. Most of the R&amp;D has been  incorporated in the five departments or business units. This  makes the divisions' R&amp;D responsibility complete. While the  initial goal of decentralization was to guide research and the  use of its results in the proper direction, it now also deals  with the management of the researchers themselves.    This step can be regarded as the final phase of the process  which was initiated in 1990 to make R&amp;D more market-oriented.  From that moment on, the it was no longer the R&amp;D  organization  that determined which research had to be done, but the  departments. The technology manager was assigned the important  role of watching the long-term developments of customers and  competitors, and deciding which developments were interesting  for the departments involved. In cooperation with the  department's management, he determined the R&amp;D policy.    R&amp;D was organized by project. The researcher was given  clearly outlined objectives, but continued to work within the  central R&amp;D organization. R&amp;D became the strategic  partner of  the departments. Thinking along with the customerswas essential.  <H5>  Cut and Paste </H5>   Throughout 1993, however, it became clear that efficiency  still needed to be improved. Corporate strategist Joop Roels  says that this is mainly due to external circumstances: "Fierce  technological competition constantly forces you to seize upon  new developments very fast, to take immediate advantage of  market opportunities, and to work cheaper. As it turned out,  creating an organization which was even more efficient than  before, was only possible by incorporating research people and  resources in the departments wherever possible. In genetic  engineering terms, this means cuts in R&amp;D, and then pasting  in  the divisions." This reshuffle of over 500 researchers did not  involve any layoffs.    The reorganization, which was carried out within three  months, resulted in five units with an integrated research  activity: Industrial Pharmaceutical Products Division (IPPD,  penicillins and cephalosporins); Bakery Ingredients Division  (BID, yeast and other bakery ingredients); Business Unit Savory  Ingredients (BUSI, yeast extracts and other flavoring  substances); Bio-Specialties Division (BSD, industrial enzymes);  Corporate New Business Development (CNBD, development of new  products, which fall outside the four above-mentioned core  activities).    The part of the research which could not be decentralized  for  reasons of efficiency, for instance the test plants and  analysis, is incorporated in a central technical cluster, which  supports the divisions.  <H5>  Expansion </H5>   According to Roels, the reorganization of R&amp;D has  contributed  to giving Gist-brocades a good position for the company's next  evolutionary phase, which is expansion. "The departments are  now well positioned. The company has clearly opted for those  areas, in which it is strong or thinks it is strong. This  knowledge makes it possible for the company to gradually expand  its business. We will shun neither major acquisitions nor  partnerships, whenever the opportunity arises." Roels advocates  a balance between inventing and purchasing, when it comes to  acquiring the required technology as effectively as possible.  "Why bother to learn the technology yourself, if good  technology is available outside the company?"</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Government supports mine over aborigine land claim AUSTRALIA'S federal government, under pressure from miners and state governments, yesterday gave its support to a Queensland aluminium and bauxite project that promises 2,000 jobs but is under threat from an aboriginal land claim. Mr Michael Lavarch, the attorney general, said legislation protecting Comalco's Weipa project, the first working mine to be hit by a native title claim, may be introduced in September. 'The mining leases which Comalco hold will be validated,' he said in a radio interview. The Weipa bauxite mine leases are included in a claim by the aboriginal Wik people for more than 35,000 sq km of land on the western side of Cape York peninsula. A landmark 1992 high court case, known as the Mabo case after one of the aboriginal litigants, established aboriginal native title. It ruled that where aborigines could prove a continuing relationship with their traditional lands, their native title might not have been extinguished by white settlement. Comalco, 67 per cent owned by CRA, had said the aboriginal claim would scare off lenders from a planned ADollars 1.83bn (Pounds 830m) expansion of its smelter and electricity generating operations at the port of Gladstone. It declined to comment on Mr Lavarch's remarks. But Mr Lauchlan McIntosh, executive director of the Australian Mining Industry Council, praised the move. 'Mr Lavarch has seen the value of the project to Australia,' he said.</p>

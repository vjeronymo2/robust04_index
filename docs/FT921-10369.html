			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Death toll rises in Algeria: Demonstrators take to guns in street battles FIGHTING resumed yesterday in the Algerian mountain town of Batna, where Moslem militants say 15 people have been killed and dozens wounded in two-days of clashes with troops and police. Local security forces said eight people had been killed and 57 wounded since the violence erupted on Tuesday. Algiers radio reported last night that sporadic gunfire could still be heard and helicopters were flying over the town. It added that the security forces had again used teargas in continuing clashes with the fundamentalists angered that a Batna court had sentenced a local preacher to two months in jail for inciting rebellion. He was one of scores of preachers arrested in a government crackdown on the use of mosques for political ends by the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which won 47 per cent of the vote in last December's first round of elections and was confident of victory had the second round not been cancelled. An army captain was among those wounded in Batna and the authorities reported the first use of guns by demonstrators since last June's riots. The incident is the latest in a string of protests which have led to running street battles and to protesters being killed. The most serious clashes last week were in the eastern capital of Constantine and the southern town of Laghouat. The FIS has called on militants to march after Friday prayers on February 14 from Algiers' May 1st Square to Martyrs' Square. The march would demand an end to 'political piracy' which the FIS says brought a five-man presidency to power last month in a coup d'etat. Meanwhile, at least four bombs were thrown in Algiers during the past week. The targets included the US embassy, the French consulate, and the Ministry of Justice. Friday prayers in the three or four areas of the city which are FIS strongholds (Bab el Oued, Kouba, Belcourt and Badjarah) remain tense with an ever present risk of violence. The FIS yesterday repeated its claim that only an an Islamic state can achieve stability.</p>

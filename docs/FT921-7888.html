			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's says default rate on commercial paper may be easing THE PACE of commercial paper defaults, which rocketed in 1989, appears to be tailing off, according to a special report by Moody's published yesterday, writes Tracy Corrigan. Since January 1989, 14 issuers have defaulted on a total of Dollars 1.4bn of commercial paper in public markets. The rate of European commercial paper defaults outstrips the default rate in the US market. According to Moody's, some 46 per cent of commercial paper losses over the past three years were in the Euro-CP market and other developing sectors such as the sterling CP market. The remainder was concentrated in the Dollars 500bn US CP market, which overshadows the much-increased Dollars 80bn Euro-CP market. According to the report, the default rate has been proportionately lower in the US because the more mature US market has developed an 'orderly exit' process, whereby the market rations the quantity of paper issued by declining credits. 'Buyers simply refuse to hold risky paper at any price,' Moody's reports. Defaults have been more common in less-developed markets, but Moody's expects that 'over the next few years, they will adopt their own version of the orderly exit phenomenon'. The report also highlights the divergence between commercial paper rated prime by Moody's and paper without a prime rating. In the US between 1989 and 1991, the default rates of CP without a prime rating exceeded the default rate of prime-rated CP by 89 times. The report points to several reasons for the increase in default rates globally since 1989, including the greater issuance of low-grade or junk CP, associated with the bull market. Then, as liquidity in the credit markets tightened in 1989, commercial banks proved unwilling to back up liquidity as 'lenders of last resort'. An accompanying report highlights the importance of alternative liquidity to the successful functioning of the commercial paper market.</p>

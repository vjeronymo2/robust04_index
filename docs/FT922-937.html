			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Price competition causes Hoskyns' dive to Pounds 5.6m PRE-TAX profits at Hoskyns, the UK-based computing services company owned by Cap Gemini Sogeti of France, nosedived in the first half as the recession and fierce price competition squeezed margins relentlessly. Profits before tax in the six months to April 30 fell 35 per cent to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 8.6m) pushing earnings per share 39 per cent lower at 3.9p (6.4p). Turnover fell to Pounds 95.7m (Pounds 102.8m) suggesting that the company's reputation for unbroken growth may not be restored quickly. The interim dividend of 0.75p is being maintained, however, in the expectation of improved trading in the second half. Mr Geoff Unwin, chairman and chief executive, said the results reflected the grim trading conditions prevailing. In addition, the company's strong performance in the first half of 1991 made comparisons even less favourable. 'Our order book in most parts of the business is looking healthier and our increasing headcount reflects a stronger demand for our services. However, we still se no signs of recovery in certain areas and margins remain tight.' Hoskyns has proved a reliable performer over the past 13 years, coupling sound management with market leadership in fast growing areas such as facilities management. Mr Unwin said that while consultancy and systems integration work were producing reasonable returns, the education and training market was exceptionally tough. Price competition was forcing down profits margins in facilities management to unwise levels.</p>

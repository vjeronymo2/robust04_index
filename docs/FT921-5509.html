			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Japan and Canada attack US ruling on Honda assembly JAPAN and Canada have protested against a US Customs Service ruling that cars made by Honda in Ontario do not qualify for duty-free benefits under the US-Canada free trade agreement (FTA). Mr Kozo Watanabe, Japan's international trade and industry minister, said his ministry had expressed concern to the US on the decision and might file a more formal complaint. The US ruling 'lacked transparency', he added - a complaint generally made by US trade negotiators about Japanese rules. Japan was studying whether the decision 'reflects discrimination against foreign companies'. The US decision comes as Tokyo senses anti-Japanese sentiment is growing in the US, leading some Japanese officials to believe the ruling is politically motivated. In Canada, the Honda case follows several trade disputes which are raising questions about Washington's commitment to the letter and spirit of the 1989 free trade agreement. Mr Gordon Ritchie, who was Canada's deputy chief FTA negotiator, noted that while others might see the Honda decision as another case of discrimination against Japan, 'Canadians see it as Canada-bashing'. Ottawa is expected to ask the Honda case be referred to a binational dispute panel set up under the FTA. One such panel is already investigating the calculation of local content at another car-assembly plant in Ontario jointly owned by Suzuki and General Motors. The US ruling will require Honda to pay a 2.5 per cent duty on the 80,000 Civics shipped to the US from Ontario. Under the FTA, cars assembled in Canada must have at least 50 per cent North American content to qualify for duty-free entry to the US. Honda considers the Civic's North American content to be about 69 per cent. One point in dispute is the Customs Service ruling that the Civic's engine, assembled in Ohio by Honda of America, does not qualify as North American because it includes various Japanese-made components.</p>

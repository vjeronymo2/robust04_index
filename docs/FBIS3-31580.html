[Iliescu] Initially, I wish to emphasize that the relations  between the two countries are very strong and are favored by the  people of the two countries. In recent years, our relations  have improved on the basis of mutual respect and trust. Despite  all the changes that have taken place between Iran and Romania,  relations have continued in a cohesive form and have been  strengthened by suitable political circumstances, the will of  the leaders to preserve traditional political and economic  relations, and those leaders' interest in regional cooperation  because of the distinctive characteristics of the two countries  that have culminated in economic closeness.    Those relations have been constantly expanding so that the  Islamic Republic of Iran is the fourth greatest partner in  economic exchanges with Romania, which shows the capabilities of  the two countries for greater economic cooperation. Of course,  there is also the possibility of upgrading the exchanges, which  are currently at half a billion dollars annually. We believe  that it would be appropriate to increase the exchanges because  of the reciprocal recognition and relations between the two  economic parties.    Iran is the most important supplier of oil to Romania. A  project is underway for the construction of a gas pipeline from  Iran to Europe in which Romania is actively involved. It is  hoped that the project will materialize soon. In the near  future, a joint commission of the two projects will be set up in  Bucharest. Only today a trade and commerce agreement was signed  between Iran and Romania, which facilitates the increase in  trade, and new plans for cooperation will be specified at the  joint commission's session. We will support them and are very  hopeful of the implementation of such projects.    [RESALAT] Does your leanings toward the West, especially in  the field of free trade and a market economy, mean that you will  change your relations with those countries with which you have  traditional ties, such as Iran?    [Iliescu] On the contrary, I believe that the world is  leaning toward the participation of countries in international  exchanges and that we are witnessing a trend toward integrating  national economies with international economies. [passage  omitted]    [RESALAT] Europe and the rest of the West have not been able  to end the tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What is your  assessment of the issue? Ostensibly, the United Nations treats  the people of Europe--including the Bosnian Muslims--very  unjustly. Why is that?    [Iliescu] The tragedy that the people of the former  Yugoslavia have been faced with, especially the people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, has also affected Romania because it is a  neighbor of Yugoslavia. In the past we have had very cordial  relations. [passage omitted]    We believe that this conflict can be resolved by the  international community as the continuation of war and bloodshed  can only deepen the catastrophe in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of  course, steps have been taken in this direction. In the Geneva  talks the basic conditions were discussed and an understanding  was achieved. Therefore, constant efforts should be made until a  solution is reached.    We are confident that logic will be victorious, since the  people of Bosnia-Herzegovina have lived together for centuries.  It is not a mere ethnic conflict, as a large number of people  in Bosnia- Herzegovina are Serbs and Croats who accepted Islam  during the Ottoman empire. [passage omitted on historical  details]    [RESALAT] How are your relations with Russia, especially on  economic issues? What is your opinion on the statements made by  Zhirinovskiy? He has threatened Russia's neighbors. What do  you think about this?    [Iliescu] We are following the developments in Russia very  carefully, as it is a major country in out region. We are  neighbors and we should maintain our relations with Russia. We  have had both positive and negative relations throughout  history, and it is to our benefit that democratic forces should  triumph in Russia so internal stability may be ensured and it  can play a positive role in the world.    Unfortunately, there have been problems in the republics of  the former Soviet Union, especially economic disarray that has  had a negative impact on the lives of the people. This has  resulted in the emergence of extremists such as Zhirinovskiy,  who are considered very dangerous. With such forces coming into  power, not only Russian reforms but the stability of the region,  Europe, and the world are in danger. We are interested in  having good relations with Russia. We want to expand such  relations with Russia and Ukraine on the basis of respect and  safeguarding reciprocal interests. We want our relations to be  based on mutual respect and the preservation of the interests of  both sides. [passage omitted]    As president of Romania, I wish to congratulate the Iranian  nation on its auspicious celebrations of victory over the shah's  regime and hope that you are successful in consolidating society  and every department of your country. The people of Romania  welcomed the struggles of the people of Iran and interpreted  them as the wishes of the Iranian nation.</p>

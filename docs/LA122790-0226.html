			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: HEARST JR. TO REPORT ON FAMILY DYNASTY IN NEW BOOK  </P> <P> TNT BROADCASTING celebrated Christmas Day by running the epic Orson Welles  movie "Citizen Kane," which sent those of us who remember the late William  Randolph Hearst Sr. running back down memory lane. (The movie was said to be  based on Hearst's life.)  </P> <P> Now comes word that William Randolph Hearst Jr. is writing a revealing insider  account of the Hearst dynasty, to be titled "The Hearsts: Father and Son,"  coming from Roberts Rinehart Inc. in August, 1991. Publication will coincide  with the 40th anniversary of Hearst Sr.'s death.  </P> <P> Hearst Jr. will not only write about his rags-to-riches grandparents, George  and Phoebe Hearst, who struck it rich in gold, silver and copper out West, but  the remarkable newspaper empire built by his famous dad. And he will tell how  he and his four brothers grew up in the shadow of their father's genius.  </P> <P> The book will be studded with colorful anecdotes about Winston Churchill,  Konrad Adenauer, Jawaharlal Nehru, Margaret Thatcher and almost every American  President of the time.  </P> <P> Hearst Jr. selected Rinehart as his publisher because of the company's long  publishing history, beginning with George Doran in the 19th Century.  </P> <P> Rinehart has its fingers crossed that "The Hearsts: Father and Son" will become  a new "Anthony Adverse." (That was the novel that became the first best seller  of the decade of the '30s.)  </P> <P> SHOULD (God forbid) the U.S. and Israel become entwined in some kind of joint  defensive conflict in the Middle East, we don't have to worry about our  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff "communicating." Gen. Colin L. Powell  speaks fluent Yiddish, learned from a South Bronx shopkeeper when he was a  child.  </P> <P> WHY HASN'T Spy magazine done a "separated at birth' bit on President Bush and  Yankee President Robert Nederlander?  </P></p>

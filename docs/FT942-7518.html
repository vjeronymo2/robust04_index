			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Tighter conditions urged for executive pay deals Executive directors' contracts should bar them from receiving payment if they are dismissed for poor performance, a leading shareholders' group urged yesterday. The Association of British Insurers, whose members form a significant portion of UK institutional investors, makes the suggestion in guidelines designed to encourage linking executive pay with a company's long-term performance. Among other guidelines, the ABI suggests that executives should have to wait at least three to five years before being allowed to exercise share options and that contracts should require that a portion of cash bonuses be used to buy company stock. 'Remuneration committees have a central role and responsibility in requiring that demanding targets be set in such schemes and that the rewards relate realistically and responsibly to performance in the context of such targets,' the ABI said. 'If the remuneration committee appears to fail to measure up to its responsibilities, shareholders should . . . ask for comment or explanation.' The guidelines urge an annual review of bonus arrangements and full disclosure of the terms to shareholders. Criticism of executive pay has focused not only on the very high rewards involved but also on the structure of remuneration packages which grant substantial amounts for short-term share price improvements. Shareholders have argued that large cash bonuses for directors based on a single year's improvement do little to encourage companies to invest heavily for the future. 'Any board that wants to look at the long-term performance should welcome these guidelines,' said Mr Huw Jones, chairman-elect of the ABI's investment committee. Bonus arrangements which link cash awards to a single year's improvement in say, earnings per share, could discourage executives from making greater investment in research and development, Mr Jones noted. The guidelines, developed over two years after consultations with leading industrialists, were also endorsed by the National Association of Pension Funds, the UK's other leading shareholder group. Some members of the NAPF's investment committee said, however, they would have preferred tougher stipulations barring executives from 'rolling' contracts which are automatically renewed every three years.

			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities slip as bond market suffers reverse Wall Street Cyclical stocks gave way to profit-taking yesterday afternoon as the bond market suffered a sudden reversal, writes Frank McGurty in New York. However the technology sector showed fresh vigour, bringing modest gains to stocks traded on the Nasdaq screen-based market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 16.84 lower at 3,829.89, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 0.95 to 468.08 in moderate NYSE volume of 284m shares. The American SE composite was 0.86 easier at 447.12. By contrast, the Nasdaq composite closed 3.08 firmer at 754.80, thanks to its heavy concentration of computer-related stocks. After the powerful advance staged by the blue chips in the previous session's final hour, stocks were expected to face at least some profit-taking as analysts struggled to make sense of a rally which had caught most equity investors flat-footed. Wednesday's upturn was linked to a late advance in bonds, though their improvement was mostly attributable to the success of a Treasury supply auction, rather than any fundamental developments that carried implications for stocks. Yesterday morning bond prices drifted lower, as traders largely ignored a pair of conflicting second-tier economic reports. The firming trend by the dollar continued to add support, with the greenback recovering more ground against the yen and the D-mark. Stocks in turn held steady. By late afternoon, however, the mood had turned full circle, a development which was nearly as baffling as the previous session's surge. Bonds were down sharply amid heavy selling driven by technical factors. Stocks followed suit, lurching deep into negative ground before recovering to show moderate losses by the end of the day. Some of the big cyclical stocks which had led the market forward on Wednesday fell victim to a concerted pull-back. Caterpillar retreated Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 111 7/8 and International Paper shed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 73 3/8 . Among the other Dow components, Kodak shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 49 3/8 . Coca-Cola failed to benefit from an upgrading by PaineWebber, finishing unchanged at Dollars 46 1/4 . IBM ran counter to the trend in cyclicals, advancing Dollars 2 to Dollars 69 3/8 . The gain followed news that Big Blue was slashing prices on many of its personal computers. The expectation of a price war in computers had a salutary effect on IBM's competitors and suppliers. Compaq gained Dollars 2 1/4 to 38 3/8 , while EMC, a computer hardware manufacturer, advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 17 3/4 . Digital was up Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 24 1/4 after agreeing to sell its database software business to Oracle. Semiconductor issues were in demand. Micron Technology gained Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 and Texas Instruments Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 81 5/8 . They were aided by a positive report from Goldman Sachs. Among the brightest lights on the Nasdaq, Cyrix gained Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 43 1/2 , a new 52-week high for the microchip design concern. Oracle was Dollars 1 5/8 ahead at Dollars 43 1/4 . Canada Toronto stocks ended slightly lower in active trading with the the TSE-300 composite index closing at 4,257.00, down 6.73 points, or 0.16 per cent. Declines led advances 393 to 365, volume slipped to 61.53m shares from 73.69m, and trading value was CDollars 884.5m compared with Dollars C1.04bn. Toronto Dominion Bank and National Bank of Canada both reported higher third-quarter earnings. TD Bank, however, lost  3/8 to 21 7/8 , and National Bank was unchanged at 9 5/8 . Argentina Prices on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange closed moderately higher in brisk trading. The Merval Index of leading shares rose 4.80 points or 0.8 per cent to end at 581.52 while the broad General Index closed 134.47 points, or 0.7 per cent, higher at 20,640.69. Molinos was among the biggest gainers, advancing 25 cents to 9.00 pesos. Heavily-weighted YPF was strong up 25 cents to end at 25.05 pesos. Brazil Sao Paulo rallied after two days of profit-taking on confidence that foreign investment will remain welcome in Brazil. The Bovespa index gained 1,469 points, or 2.8 per cent, to 53,546.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SECTION FINALS;  </P> <P> TENNIS;  </P> <P> BLOWOUT LOST, BUT NOT TITLE;  </P> <P> MARTINEZ STARTS FAST, HANGS ON TO WIN SINGLES  </P> <P> For a while Friday, it appeared as though St. Augustine's Ignacio Martinez was  going to blow Hilltop's Francisco Santillan off the court in less than an hour.  Santillan's unforced errors and Martinez's steady play were making for a very  uneven match.  </P> <P> But a funny thing happened on the way to Martinez's straight-set victory --  Santillan decided he wanted to play a little longer, picking up the pace and  the pressure. Martinez faltered but then held on to win the San Diego Section  boys' singles title, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), at the San Diego Tennis and Racquet Club.  </P> <P> Efrem Zimbalist and Jason Wurl defeated Torrey Pines teammates Mike Kestler and  Jim Sunderland, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), for the doubles championship.  </P> <P> Trailing, 5-1, in the third set and facing match point, Santillan suddenly  began to come in behind his backhand. The strategy enabled him to win the next  three points to force an eighth game.  </P> <P> Santillan, a junior from Cuernavaca, Mexico, held serve and then broke Martinez  again with a backhand passing shot down the line. After Santillan held again to  tie the set at 5-5, Martinez's throat began to tighten.  </P> <P> "I was feeling kind of nervous," Martinez said. "I lost my confidence."  </P> <P> And Santillan's began to grow.  </P> <P> "I thought I was going to get the set," said Santillan, who last played  Martinez some five years ago in a junior tournament in Mexico. "He wasn't doing  what he was doing early. I think he thought he had the match. He started to  miss shots."  </P> <P> But in the 11th game, Martinez started to make them again and held serve.  Santillan also held to force a tiebreaker.  </P> <P> Martinez went up, 4-1, before Santillan scored three consecutive points to tie.  Martinez hit an overhead winner, and Santillan netted a backhand volley to send  it to match point. Martinez closed it out by lobbing Santillan, who barely  netted a backhand.  </P> <P> "He did what he had to do," Santillan said. "He played the big points pretty  good."  </P> <P> Martinez plans to play the Southern California sectionals later this month and  the Mexican national tournament in Guadalajara in August. Santillan wants to go  to Europe to play in some summer satellite tournaments. Both may return to this  final next year; each is a junior.  </P> <P> In doubles, Zimbalist and Wurl won the first set with ease, then had to fight  back from 4-1 and 5-2 deficits in the second set to force the tiebreaker.  </P> <P> Kestler, a senior, and Sunderland, only a sophomore, had a set point in the  eighth game but let it slip away. From there, Zimbalist and Wurl began to take  control.  </P> <P> "We noticed their frustration," Wurl said. "We just tried to keep it in play."  </P> <P> Zimbalist and Wurl, both seniors, had trailed, 3-0, Thursday in the third set  of their semifinal before coming back to win.  </P> <P> "Our pattern has been to win the first set easily then blow the next set and  then come back in the third," Wurl said. "We realized today we couldn't let  that happen."  </P> <P> Zimbalist and Wurl, who also played together last year, were seeded No. 3,  while Sunderland and Kestler were No. 5. The teams met in the Palomar League  finals last month, with Zimbalist and Wurl winning in a third-set tiebreaker.  </P> <P> "They were out to get us, but we wanted it really bad," said Zimbalist,  grandson of actor Efrem Zimbalist Jr.  </P> <P> Zimbalist plans to try and walk on at Northern Arizona next year. Wurl will  attempt to do the same at USC.  </P></p>

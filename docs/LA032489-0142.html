			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> GATES LAUDS DISMISSAL OF EX-REPORTER'S SUIT  </P> <P> Sheriff-Coroner Brad Gates said Thursday that he was "especially pleased" for  his deputies and Santa Ana police officers after a federal judge dismissed an  $11-million lawsuit brought by a former Orange County Register reporter who  claimed that he was illegally investigated for writing stories critical of the  sheriff.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Robert Kelleher ruled in Los Angeles that  former reporter Charles (Chuck) Cook waited too long to sue Gates over  incidents allegedly occurring between 1983 and 1985. Gates, the county and city  of Santa Ana were defendants in the case.  </P> <P> Cook, now editor of the Daily Signal in Santa Clarita, said he will appeal the  ruling.  </P> <P> "The frivolous nature of Cook's claims indicate the political nature of this  suit on Cook's part," Gates said. "This decision should be a message to Cook  and to others who bring lawsuits to achieve their political agenda to quit  wasting the courts' time and the taxpayers' money to pursue their political  objectives."  </P> <P> "If they don't like the way I run the Sheriff's Department, they should file as  a candidate and run against me and let the voters decide," Gates said.  </P> <P> In his lawsuit, Cook alleged that Gates and others conspired against him  because he had written articles critical of deaths in Orange County Jail and  other issues involving the Sheriff's Department. Cook claimed that Gates  threatened, harassed and attempted to discredit him to get him fired from the  Register.  </P> <P> Cook said he did not learn that he had been the target of Gates' investigation  until February, 1987, when documents were produced in another federal lawsuit.  That lawsuit was brought against the sheriff and the county by former Municipal  Judge Bobby D. Youngblood. Youngblood also alleged that he had been the target  of harassment because of opposition to the sheriff's policies.  </P> <P> The county settled the Youngblood suit out of court, paying $375,000 to  Youngblood and other plaintiffs without admitting that Gates had done anything  wrong.  </P></p>

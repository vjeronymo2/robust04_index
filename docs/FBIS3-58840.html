			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "eld": "Trust Agency Sells First Power </F> Supply Company"]    [Text] Berlin -- The Trust Agency has started to privatize  the east German power supply industry. The Preussen-Elektra AG  company in Hanover will take over the majority of five of the 15  regional supply companies. The five firms are: Oder-Spree  Energieversorgung AG (Oseag) in Frankfurt/Oder, Maerkische  Energieversorgung AG (Mevag) in Potsdam, Energieversorgung  Magdeburg AG (EVM) in Magdeburg, Hanseatische Energieversorgung  AG (Hevag) in Rostock, and Energieversorgung Mueritz-Oderhaff AG  (EMO) in Neubrandenburg.    The power supply enterprises Bayernwerk AG in Munich and the  Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk AG (RWE) in Essen  will take over 51 percent each of some regional east German  power supply plants on the basis of the electricity agreement  concluded in 1990. However, negotiations with the Trust Agency  have not yet been concluded. The east German communes will  receive the remaining 49 percent later.    Talks on privatizing the Veag Vereinigte Energiewerke AG in  Berlin are more difficult. The majority of the east German  enterprise is to be sold to the three large west German  electricity concerns Bayernwerk, Preussen-Elektra, and RWE. The  Veag is planning for investments worth approximately 30 million  German marks by the end of 2005 to modernize the east German  power supply.    In view of the economic crisis in the new laender, the Veag  must expect a lower sale of electricity. Establishing public  utilities also has a negative impact on the Veag's sale of  power. Thus, the Trust Agency might be forced to reduce the  price. According to the Trust Agency, the privatization of the  Veag is to be concluded by the middle of 1994, and the sale of  the second east German brown coal producer, Lausitzer Braunkohle  AG (Laubag), in Senftenberg is to be completed by the same time,  if possible.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: EL TORO;  </P> <P> VASQUEZ TO SPEAK ON TRAFFIC, DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez will discuss traffic, development issues and  construction of a water pipeline through South Orange County at a homeowners'  meeting tonight.  </P> <P> "Traffic is probably one of the No. 1 concerns of people in this area, and this  will give them an opportunity to talk about it with Supervisor Vasquez," said  Roger Thomas, a board member of the Lake Forest Drive Assn., which is  sponsoring the meeting.  </P> <P> The association represents about 200 homes in Sterling Heights.  </P> <P> In addition, a pipeline that will route water into Mission Viejo will be up for  discussion. Residents of the area are concerned that the pipeline, which will  be built starting Jan. 9, could add to South County's congested traffic.  </P> <P> The meeting will begin at 7 p.m. and will be held in the multipurpose room of  Serrano Intermediate School, 24642 Jeronimo Road, El Toro.  </P> <P> An open forum will follow Vasquez's remarks, Thomas said.  </P></p>

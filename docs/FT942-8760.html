			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Post Office raises fees for handling DSS payouts The Post Office increased the charges it levies on the National Insurance Fund for paying social security benefits by 57 per cent in 1992-93, a committee of MPs heard yesterday. Sir Michael Partridge, permanent secretary at the Department of Social Security, told the Commons public accounts committee that Post Office charges rose from Pounds 131m in 1991-92 to Pounds 206m in 1992-93. The amount of benefits paid rose by just 6 per cent. The charges are calculated by allocating a share of the Post Office's expenses to the National Insurance Fund. This means that the fund's costs rise when the amount the Post Office has to pay to the Treasury rises or if the Post Office loses other business. Charges made by the Inland Revenue for collecting national insurance contributions also rose steeply, from Pounds 69.9m to Pounds 113.7m. The 63 per cent increase was largely as a result of 'a revised method of costing', according to the Inland Revenue. The charge for paying benefits through post offices is negotiated annually between the Post Office and the Benefits Agency, the agency responsible for almost all social security benefits. Sir Michael said the charge reflects the amount of work done for the agency but also the amount of other business the post offices handle. 'They add up their costs and share them out among the customers,' he said. Mr John Horam, a Conservative member of the committee, asked Sir Michael if this meant higher charges if other types of Post Office business declined. 'That is so,' said Sir Michael. 'If their costs haven't fallen, they will apportion more to us.' Negotiating the contract was always a sensitive matter that went up to ministers for final approval, Sir Michael added. Exchanges often went on for the whole year before reaching a conclusion. Sir Michael also expressed concern over the increase in the charges made by the Inland Revenue for collecting National Insurance Contributions. He told the committee that he had been unable to find out why the Inland Revenue's costs had risen.</p>

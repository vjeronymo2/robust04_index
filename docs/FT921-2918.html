			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Accountancy firm settles lawsuit ARTHUR ANDERSEN, the accountants, yesterday agreed to pay an immediate Dollars 22m (Pounds 12.5m) in cash and to set aside a further Dollars 8m to settle an investor lawsuit charging the firm with improper behaviour that contributed to the collapse of Mr Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan. The out-of-court settlement is the latest in a series of claims against auditors, lawyers and other consultants who worked for Mr Keating, who was last year convicted on 17 counts of defrauding investors through the sale of worthless junk bonds and who faces other charges. The Arthur Andersen settlement results from a class action lawsuit by representatives of 17,000 bond investors who sued Mr Keating, Arthur Andersen and other firms including Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte &amp; Touche. The cases against those two firms are still pending. Arthur Andersen said last night it continued to believe that the allegations against it were unfounded. 'We have agreed to the settlement based on an overall business strategy to avoid escalating legal costs of protracted litigation and to get the matter behind us,' Arthur Andersen said. Last week, in a separate development, the New York law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler agreed to pay the US government Dollars 41m to settle a federal lawsuit from the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the savings and loan industry regulator. The OTS suit charged the law firm with withholding information about Lincoln from regulators.</p>

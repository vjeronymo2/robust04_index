			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lhasa, February 17 (XINHUA) -- To pray for good  harvests, Tibetans traditionally fly religious flags in five  colors over the roofs of their houses during the Tibetan Spring  Festival, which starts on February 11.    The blue stands for the sky, the white for clouds, red for  fire, green for water and yellow for the earth.    In recent years, however, locals have also raised the  country's five-star national flag together with Buddhist flags.    Under a bright sun and backed by white walls, the national  flag flutters in the wind at the gate and the colorful banners  fly on the rooftops.    Jodgu, a local guide to visitors, explained that hoisting  religious banners shows the Tibetans' centuries of devotion to  God while hoisting the national flag manifests their pride in  China, their strong country.    Purpu Zhaxi, from Xe village in the Lhasa suburbs, agreed  with Jodgu, saying that flying the flag is a token of  gratefulness to the government for the big changes in his family.    "By 1985, hardly a household in our village of more than 60  households had one TV set or could eat delicious meals," he  said, while a light tune to greet guests streamed from his  stereo system.    Atop the stereo cabinet were a butter lamp, qingke barley  liquor, oranges, apples, preserved fruits and other delicacies  beneath an image of Buddha.    "Now, however, most of the households have built new houses  and bought color TV sets.    "These were all brought about by the good policies of the  Chinese Government. With a comfortable life, don't you think we  should remember the government when we are enjoying ourselves  and welcoming the advent of a new year?"</p>

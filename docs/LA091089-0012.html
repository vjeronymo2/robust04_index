			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: ALL SHE NEEDS IS A SPORTING CHANCE  </P> <P> Throughout the years I have eliminated from my life one sport after another. It  began with skiing, when I didn't see the wisdom of pursuing any type of  recreation where an ambulance was parked at the bottom of the hill.  Synchronized swimming didn't do it for me either, as my best feature is my nose  and I don't necessarily need a nose plug attached to it.  </P> <P> I discovered tennis to be a sport that attracted people you couldn't trust. One  minute, they smiled when your serve tipped the net and shouted, "Take two." The  next, they purposely slammed a ball into the opposite side from where you were  standing waiting for it.  </P> <P> People who hop on a luge and bounce along out of control at 80 m.p.h. on a  sheet of ice are just real strange. And besides, my stomach sticks out . . .  even when I lie on my back.  </P> <P> You may now add rock climbing to my list. I remember the first time I saw a  rock climber on television. He weighed about 38 pounds and for no reason began  to scale a perfectly vertical slab of rock. If I had Velcro hands and Robert  Redford was hosting an Amway party at the top, you couldn't have gotten me to  do that.  </P> <P> You can imagine my surprise when I read a story the other day that said  climbers are now using artificial walls to "eliminate environmental damage."  </P> <P> I care about this planet as much as the next person, but how many people do you  know who go out on Sunday and hang onto a piece of rock with their fingernails?  Five? Ten? Twenty? Are we talking crowds here?  </P> <P> There couldn't be more than a handful with that kind of guts, and that doesn't  exactly add up to rock gridlock.  </P> <P> There are fears that go with every sport -- fear of having your bowling ball  bounce into the next lane . . . fear of knocking your tennis ball into the club  dining room . . . fear of having a leg cramp playing Goony Golf . . . and fear  of being the only person ever to ride a chair lift all day without getting off  once.  </P> <P> But rock climbing! I didn't figure on being afraid I'd destroy the environment.  I would prefer to wonder what would happen if you reached for a little "bolt"  to hang onto the rock and it turned out to be a snake's head. I'm sorry, but I  want a sport where I can show my broken nail to someone without having it be my  last words. As for adventure -- appearing in aerobics in a yellow leotard is as  crazy as I want to get.  </P></p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Child Support Agency Pounds 100m short of target The Child Support Agency is more than Pounds 100m short of its overall target of making benefit savings of Pounds 530m for 1993-94, forcing the government to alter its business plan and targets for the following year. The shortfall in savings will hit the performance-related pay bonus of Ms Ros Hepplewhite, the agency's chief executive. Whitehall officials stressed that it would be wrong to blame Ms Hepplewhite for the agency's failure to meet its targets. Ministers put the agency's disappointing financial performance down to changes forced by the Commons social security committee and a refusal by some fathers to pay maintenance. The Department of Social Security responded to Commons criticism of the agency by amending the formula for absent parents' maintenance payments in February. The changes also allowed fathers facing big bills to pay in stages during an 18-month period. Officials fear the shortfall in benefit savings could be significantly higher than Pounds 100m if the figures for April, the last in the agency's financial year, fail to meet the original target. In 1992-93, the CSA's forerunner, the Child Support Unit, made benefit savings of Pounds 313m, while in 1991-92 the Benefit Agency recovered Pounds 283m. The department has already decided to scale back the agency's business plan and targets for 1994-95 and subsequent years. 'We do not have a Stalinist five-year plan,' said one official. 'The subsequent targets will be set in the light of what has been achieved and is achievable in the future.' The Commons social security committee will launch a 'thorough review' of the agency's workings when it receives the CSA's annual report, expected in July. Ministers had hoped that any subsequent review of the agency would take place later in the year. Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman, was yesterday adamant, however, that the review would take place immediately on receipt by the committee of the CSA's report The social security committee expects to publish its second report on the agency in the autumn. After receiving 2,000 letters, Mr Field says he believes the anger expressed by the public necessitates a new inquiry to decide whether the formula, which determines how much parents should pay, should be changed. The review will also consider setting up an appeals tribunal with discretion on how the formula should be implemented. 'This is the biggest change in the welfare state since its inception in 1945,' said Mr Field. 'If the agency is to be strengthened, it demands a major review of its workings.'</p>

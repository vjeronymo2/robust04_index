			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by Charles </F> Lambroschini; place and date not given: "Austrians Will Say Yes  to Europe" -- first paragraph is LE FIGARO introduction]    [Excerpts] Banker by profession but socialist by  conviction, Franz Vranitzky has been chancellor since 1986. He  governed initially in coalition with the small Freedom Party,  but was was quick to dissolve this when his partner made  far-right nationalist Joerg Haider as its leader. Since then,  Vranitzky's Social Democrats have formed a grand coalition  government with the conservative Austrian People's Party. Born  in 1937, Franz Vranitzky earned a doctor of economics. In his  youth he was a member of the national basketball team. He is  married, with a son and a daughter.    [Lambroschini] The latest polls foretell a "yes" in the  referendum. But a close one. There is reason for concern when  we reflect back on the referendum on nuclear power which ended,  in November 1978, with Chancellor Kreisky's resignation. At the  time, 31 percent of the no vote three prior to the vote changed  to a 51 percent on voting day. What is your prediction this  time?    [Vranitzky] I believe that Austrians will say "yes" to  Europe, but I also believe that the outcome will be very close.  There are several reasons for this reticence. The euphoria we  experienced following the outcome of the successful negotiations  with Brussels could not last. Those who opposed Austria's  joining Europe thought that the discussions with Brussels would  never end. For this reason they concentrated their fire on the  negotiations, rather than immediately attacking the referendum.  Now that they have adjusted their focus, they are gaining  points, because the campaign is emotional, whereas, by the  nature of things, the government's arguments are founded on  reason. It is always easy to play on people's fears by  predicting the worst. Finally do not forget that, economically,  1993 was a very bad year. In Austria, as in the rest of Europe,  many people therefore reacted as if the economic recession was  the result of European integration. Despite this, I firmly hope  that the parallel between this referendum and Kreisky's will  remain a false one. [passage omitted]    [Lambroschini] Austria already enjoys all the trade  advantages which the European Union [EU] can offer, with the  Economic Economic Area between the European Free Trade  Association [EFTA], of which you are part, and the Europe of the  Twelve. Is not the real reason for your application for  membership a political one? Is not Austria, which was occupied  for 10 years by the Red Army, seeking for protection against  Russia? Is not Austria, which has particularly unstable  neighbors, looking to sign an insurance contract against the  risk of another Yugoslav conflict spilling over its borders?    [Vranitzky] I never said that our application could be  explained simply by economic reasons. If that were the case, we  could be satisfied with out participation in EFTA. I have  always thought that European integration should be a political  project. Europe has much more important tasks to accomplish than  the simple exchange of goods. Whether we are talking about  monetary union or the continent's security, the solution can  come only from a shared political will. To confront, as you  say, the risks of destabilization in East Europe, we need a  political decisionmaking power.    [Lambroschini] Do you really believe that if Europe had had  a  common foreign policy four or five years ago, the war in  Yugoslavia could have been prevented? Do you not rather think  that the failure was due to the refusal of the major European  countries -- France, Germany, Great Britain -- to accept their  responsibility and carry their partners with them?    [Vranitzky] We will always come back to the need for common  action. Today, in Yugoslavia, there are not just French and  British troops. There are also Belgians, Spaniards, and Danes.  Even if France and Germany have given the kick-off, the game  cannot be limited to these two players.    [Lambroschini] You therefore reject the view of the  British, who had hoped that the arrival of four EFTA members  would have the effect of weakening the camp of the partisans of  a political Europe.    [Vranitzky] I place myself among the proponents of political  union.    [Lambroschini] In joining Europe, will Austria renounce its  faith in the "state as provider of all?" Will you accept the  idea that combating unemployment requires you to abandon certain  social benefits, when confronted with international competition,  which makes labor costs too high?    [Vranitzky] Rather the opposite. For Austria, joining Europe  means both promoting its economic expansion and strengthening  its social welfare system. In order to meet the competition  from countries whose social welfare is not as good as ours, my  social-democratic convictions forbid me to call into question  our concept of social progress. We must meet this competition  by improving the training of our workers, by investing in  research, by getting out of less well-performing economic areas  in order to concentrate on leading-edge technology.    [Lambroschini] Hardly will Austria have joined the Twelve  then it will have to participate in the debate on the reform of  the European institutions scheduled to take place in 1996. For  you, what needs to be changed to enable the Europe of Sixteen to  find again the effectiveness which was already seriously  compromised in the Europe of the Twelve?    [Vranitzky] For me, the 1996 intergovernmental conference  will represent that next step in the process of defining the  objectives of European integration. First of all we will have  to work to eliminate the so-called democratic deficit. In other  words, improving the relationships between European Parliament,  the Council of Ministers, and the Commission. Second, we will  have to discuss common foreign policy and common security  policy. When, in the referendum campaign, people ask me: "But  why are you in such a hurry to join the EU?," the reply is  obvious. We need to act quickly because we are determined to  take part in the 1996 debate.    [Lambroschini] But given the differences in the approaches  of  the Twelve and in their very different economic situations, do  you not think that a two-speed Europe is inevitable?    [Vranitzky] I am absolutely against a two-speed Europe. Such  an approach would strike against the very idea of a united  Europe because it would provide an all too easy excuse to those  who do not want to accept the reforms.    [Lambroschini] In France, many people are afraid at the idea  that Austria's membership will strengthen the German bloc.  Certain of them are even talking of a new annexation. Without  going that far, shortly before the fall of the Berlin wall,  Francois Mitterrand had welcomed you at the Elysee [office of  the president] with the rather ambiguous words: "Austria, the  third German state, is welcome in the European Community."    [Vranitzky] Let us be clear. Austria is not a German state.  Austria is only an Austrian state. That is what I told Francois  Mitterrand, adding: "We do not see ourselves as members of a  German bloc." To which President Mitterrand replied: "All  right, we understand you. We will not insist." A second  comment: Comparing Austria's entry into the EU to annexation by  Hitler is to have really totally forgotten the terror involved.    [Lambroschini] Economic relations between Austria and  Germany  are already very extensive. When you join the EU, what will win  the day, the intensification of your relations with Germany, or  diversification?    [Vranitzky] Diversification will win the day. But remaining  outside the EU would, on the contrary, lead to an  intensification of relations with our largest partners.    [Lambroschini] Once Austria has entered the Union, what will  remain of its neutrality?    [Vranitzky] For Austrians, neutrality means that they refuse  to take part in a war. But I believe that we need to work  together to set up a system permitting joint action against  those who violate peace. Joining the EU does not therefore  impair our neutrality.    [Lambroschini] But if a common European security system  leads  to a common war, how will you be able to preserve your  neutrality?    [Vranitzky] Under the UN collective security system, as  provided for by the UN Charter, we have already taken part in  joint actions, without in this way violating our neutrality.  Hence, during the Gulf War, we allowed arms to pass through  Austrian territory and Austrian air space. We would certainly  not have permitted this in the case of a bilateral conflict.    [Lambroschini] Other neutral countries, Sweden and Finland,  have applied to enter the EU and are interested in NATO's offer  of a Partnership for Peace. What about Austria?    [Vranitzky] Long before NATO dreamed up this Partnership for  Peace, Austria had worked on developing its relations in the  military area with the East European countries. With a view to  peacekeeping operations, we wished to assist them with their  training programs. The fact is that the development of  relations with the former Warsaw Pact countries is the main  objective of the Partnership for Peace. We have told NATO that,  for the time being, Austria will concentrate its efforts on its  entry into the EU but that, once it has achieved this goal, we  will examine this Partnership for Peace very closely. That  being said, it is clear that, for Sweden and Finland, their  potential membership in this system will not call their doctrine  into question. These two countries remain firm in their refusal  to take part in military alliances.    [Lambroschini] Austria will therefore continue to refuse to  join NATO?    [Vranitzky] Precisely.    [Lambroschini] Your insistence on demanding the accelerated  integration of the new Central European democracies is another  subject which separates you from most of the Twelve. Here you  opposed Margaret Thatcher when she explained to you that the  Twelve would commit themselves to advanced cooperation with East  Europe only when it had built up a market economy.    [Vranitzky] My analysis, indeed, is the opposite of that of  the former British prime minister. I do not believe that these  countries will be able to establishing market economies without  first gaining the cooperation of West Europe. The Sixteen will  have to increase their cooperation with East Europe, and will  have to do so in a coordinated way. This is, moreover, a  further reason for insisting on the EU's political vocation.  Given the risks of destabilization in East Europe, limiting  European integration to the members of the EU and EFTA is not  enough. East Europe must be included in the integration process.    [Lambroschini] When do you believe that this enlargement of  the Union to include the East European countries will be  possible?    [Vranitzky] Perhaps by the end of the century.    [Lambroschini] And Russia?    [Vranitzky] First of all we need to concentrate on the  countries nearest to our borders. But later, in one way or  another, Russia too will have to be associated with this process  of European integration.    [Lambroschini] Are you not concerned to see former  communists  return to power in neighboring Poland and Hungary, and to  observe that they are the second largest political force in the  Czech Republic?    [Vranitzky] I have studied closely the programs of the  parties and the men who represent this new socialist or  social-democratic approach. I believe that most of them are  very clearly different from the communist movements of the past.  They have proved their desire to continue in the path of the  market economy.    [Lambroschini] And what is your analysis of the return of  another ancient peril, that of fascism, in Italy, another of  your neighbors?    [Vranitzky] Like a lot of people, I believed that what is  happening today in Italy could never happen again. The most  serious problem is that, unlike the new socialists in East  Europe, who have abandoned Stalin and Lenin, Italy's neofascists  continue to refer to the past, to Mussolini and his regime. But  we shall see what the Berlusconi government is going to do to  come up with convincing solutions. [passage omitted]</p>

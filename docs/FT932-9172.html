			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Explorers get set for diamond rush THE HANDFUL of companies with diamond mining expertise have been deluged with inquiries and proposals in the past year following the excitement generated by discoveries in Canada's North West Territories. Ashton Mining, the Australian company with a 40.1 per cent stake in the Argyle diamond mine, the western world's biggest producer in volume terms, has had more than a dozen offers to analyse, says Mr John Robinson, chief executive. 'The renewed interest in diamond exploration has flushed out many opportunities and we have been putting them through a stringent screening process.' Mr Robinson, insists that, if all the exploration activity produces a new diamond mine, it would not destabilise the market. He points out that world diamond output fell by 3 per cent in value to USDollars 6bn last year and 'production in Russia is falling, Zaire's output is down 25 per cent and in 1993 there has been only a trickle of diamonds from Angola'. Ashton has settled on three projects in Canada: the Lupin joint venture in the Northwest Territories where Ashton has the right to buy 51 per cent of a project covering 6,300 square km (2,400 square miles) in the Slave Lake province from Pure Gold Resources; some 15,500 sq km in the Peace River district of Alberta, where Ashton is earning 51 per cent, again from Pure Gold Resources; and the James Bay venture in Ontario where Ashton can earn 51 per cent from KWG Resources. Mr Robinson says that all this activity has forced Ashton into an abrupt switch of emphasis away from gold, in which it was getting more involved, and towards diamonds. Consequently, the company is to reduce its 90 per cent shareholding in the Mt Muro gold project in Indonesia which requires about ADollars 110m to bring into production. Outside Canada, Ashton is putting together a formal licence application after signing an agreement in principle for a diamond joint venture with the government in Karelia, western Russia. The area of the licence covers about two thirds of the republic. Ashton has 51 per cent of another diamond project in the Great Lakes area of Michigan, US, but Mr Robinson says the most prospective area in the portfolio  - because it is the most advanced  - is in the Northern Territory of Australia where the company has a 67.7 per cent interest. Samples from the Merlin prospect in the area last year produced 20 commercial size diamonds, one in four of them of gem quality and the largest of 2.44 carats. The Argyle mine's output this year is forecast to be close to the record 39m carats produced last year, says Mr Robinson, who is in London to talk to institutional investors.</p>

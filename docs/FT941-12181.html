			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Foreign outlay on property 'up 70%' Overseas investors increased their spending on UK commercial property by 70 per cent to Pounds 2.2bn last year, providing a further stimulus to the fast-recovering British property market. German, Middle Eastern and Far Eastern investors led the surge of investment in UK property, according to a report published yesterday by DTZ Debenham Thorpe, chartered surveyors. The resurgence of overseas interest in UK property, after two years of decline, was mainly inspired by the devaluation of sterling, the falling costs of borrowing and the high investment yields available on property. German investors, who spent a total of Pounds 700m, were the most prominent source of overseas finance. Middle Eastern investors spent Pounds 350m, much of which came from wealthy private individuals. Far Eastern investors spent Pounds 440m, 60 per cent of which was accounted for by Hong Kong and China. Just over half the money invested by overseas buyers went into central London, leaving Pounds 400m for Greater London and Pounds 475m for the regions. DTZ Debenham Thorpe said it expected overseas buyers to play a less important role in the UK property market this year, although their total spending was likely to remain at about Pounds 2bn a year for the forseeable future.

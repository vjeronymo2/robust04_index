			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  expressed regret Tuesday over North Korea's reported decision to  quit the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and reject  further inspections of its nuclear facilities.    In a related development, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher talked over the phone  Tuesday morning and shared concern over Pyongyang's decision,  government sources said.    Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a  statement  Tuesday morning, calling on North Korea to reconsider its  decision to leave the IAEA and reject further inspections of its  nuclear facilities, as reported by the official KOREAN CENTRAL  NEWS AGENCY on Monday night.    The spokesman said in the statement that the North Korean  action runs counter to the international community's calls for  Pyongyang to abide by the nuclear safeguards arrangements.    The Japanese reaction to the North Korean announcement came  as other world leaders were busy exploring steps to deal with  the looming crisis on the Korean peninsula.    In Washington, the White House said President Bill Clinton  talked with Russian President Boris Yeltsin over the phone about  an international conference on North Korea.    Yeltsin told South Korean President Kim Yong-sam in Moscow  on  June 2 that Russia, the United States, Japan, China, the United  Nations and the IAEA should join North and South Korea in  holding a conference to defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis.    At the UN in New York, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright  told reporters the U.S. will submit a sanctions resolution to  the UN Security Council in the next couple of days.    Kakizawa told Christopher that Japan intends to cope calmly  with the North Korean nuclear problem, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi Kumagai said at a news conference.    The top government spokesman also revealed that Hata will  talk to Clinton over the telephone, possibly later Tuesday.    The premier will seek to have a "frank" talk with Clinton,  Kumagai said.</p>

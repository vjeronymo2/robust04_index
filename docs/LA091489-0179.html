			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALLET FOLKLORICO'S NEW PRODUCERS HAVE BIG IDEAS  </P> <P> It's a plum gig -- producing the first U.S. tour in a decade of the original  Ballet Folklorico de Mexico -- as the latter-day Barnum and Bailey who've  landed the job know. And have they got a show for you: It opens tonight in the  Shrine Auditorium.  </P> <P> Legendary impresario Sol Hurok guided Amalia Hernandez and her company here for  20 years. When he died in 1979, Ballet Folklorico stopped touring the United  States, although it continued to perform elsewhere around the globe.  </P> <P> Co-producers Adam Friedson of Los Angeles and Julio Solorzano of Mexico City  came on board to handle the current tour after Hernandez "tested" them last  year with the company's limited engagement in Shrine Auditorium.  </P> <P> Now Friedson, a presenter with a long-term interest in U.S.-Latin America  exchanges, and Solorzano, a singer-songwriter and entrepreneur whom Friedson  describes as "the Sol Hurok of Mexico," have a four-year contract with  Hernandez.  </P> <P> "Here are two guys trying to find out the right people to host or produce with  us in all of these cities -- many of which I've never been to, much less has  Julio been to -- that's the risky side," says the modest but jocular Friedson.  </P> <P> "The secure side is we have the most important folkloric dance company in the  hemisphere, one of the two greatest in the world, with the Moiseyev."  </P> <P> Founded by Hernandez in 1952 and long an official cultural representative of  the Mexican government, the 400-strong Ballet Folklorico now operates under the  auspices of the National Institute of Fine Arts.  </P> <P> The company has inspired countless clones, both here and in Mexico. At home it  boasts a resident troupe -- directed by Hernandez's daughter Norma Lopez  Hernandez -- and a school, in addition to the 65-member touring contingent.  </P> <P> This year Friedson and Solorzano are taking the company to 33 Western cities  plus Chicago in seven weeks. And they're doing it with only a partial  sponsorship from Honda, counting on the box office to make up most of the $4  million in costs.  </P> <P> Still, the odds are better than those they faced the first time out. "Last year  we had no sponsorship at all," Friedson recalls. "I'd never done one  performance of a ballet, let alone four performances at the Shrine Auditorium  with 6,300 seats."  </P> <P> To make it worse, they'd been promised $250,000 in sponsorship from  Spanish-language media that fell through at the last minute. Three weeks before  the show, the producers had no underwriting and $50,000 in debts.  </P> <P> The Ballet Folklorico is "country, flag, mother and apple pie," Friedson says.  "As Julio likes to say, this is the Virgin de Guadalupe, but even that wasn't  going to fill the Shrine."  </P> <P> "We just did everything we could think of and we had three full houses and one  half house and it was a success. We had $300,000 in gross expenses for four  shows, with a 10% profit."  </P> <P> Now that the stakes are greater, people have cautioned the daring duo about the  scale of their ambitions. "The only reason we've tried it is because we didn't  know better," Friedson adds.  </P> <P> They're taking it on partly because they feel the support is there: "We knew  the marketplace has changed in the United States. There are many more Latins  who're more successful economically."  </P> <P> For Hernandez, it means the pleasure of returning to a country in which, she  says, "things are easier."  </P> <P> "We are well recognized here and the dancers love it because we are so close  (to Mexico)."  </P> <P> Both Hernandez and her producers hope to see the Ballet Folklorico become as  well-known in the United States as it is in Mexico, especially as 1992  approaches.  </P> <P> "1992 is a very important year for Latin American culture, because it's the  500th anniversary of the discovery of the Americas," says Solorzano. "Also,  it's the 40th anniversary of the Ballet Folklorico."  </P> <P> They want to appeal to a "crossover" audience, not just those of Latino  heritage, they say.  </P> <P> "Mexican art is perceived as interesting only for Mexicans or Mexican-Americans  and this is something we have to fight," Solorzano explains. "You wouldn't  think a Russian company would be appealing only for the Russian and Ukrainians  of New York."  </P> <P> Mogul-like as they may be, this is a team for whom the bottom line isn't the  bottom line. As Friedson explains, "Julio and I both committed to cultural  literacy. We're going to do a lot of things that are not about making a  profit."  </P> <P> "We want to make available to underprivileged children their own culture, so we  put together a free show for 3,000 Hispanic kids who are hosting black, Asian  and Anglo children at the Shrine on Friday," Friedson says.  </P> <P> "It's easier to get kids from different cultures together than it is to get  adults from different cultures together," Solorzano adds.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WITH BO BACK, ALLEN DOESN'T WANT TO BE FULLBACK  </P> <P> Bo Jackson is expected to join the Raiders next week, meaning we'll see the  famed twin-Heisman backfield with Marcus Allen at fullback, right?  </P> <P> Wrong.  </P> <P> Allen says he won't do it anymore.  </P> <P> "I have no intention of playing fullback," Allen has said. "I'll discuss it  with the coaches if they have other ideas."  </P> <P> Allen held out this summer and missed the entire exhibition season. When owner  Al Davis refused to negotiate, Allen gave up and came into camp the week before  the opener, but not happily. He is the leading Raider rusher, averaging 4.2  yards a carry, and is second in receptions with 14.  </P> <P> In the past two seasons, he has moved graciously to become a 205-pound fullback  when Jackson arrived, even playing the position last season with a cast on his  broken left wrist.  </P> <P> Allen is tired of being beaten up but says it's more than that.  </P> <P> "Put it this way," Allen said, "I'm not ready to be a role player yet.  </P> <P> "My problem is, I've been such a nice guy. I've been trying to make everybody  happy and I've been making myself miserable."  </P> <P> And if new Coach Art Shell implores him to make the switch?  </P> <P> "Art's my buddy," said Allen, laughing. "I don't know. Maybe we can talk." MARK  HEISLER  </P></p>

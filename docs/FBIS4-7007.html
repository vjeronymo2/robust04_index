			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA April 27 -- State Committee for  Cooperation and Investment (SCCI) held recently in Dong Nai  Province a conference to review Vietnam's cooperation and  investment with foreign countries over the past six years.  Since the promulgation of the foreign investment law six years  ago 895 foreign investment projects were licensed with total  prescribed capital of USD [U.S. dollars] 8.5 billion. These  investment projects involve more than 500 companies from 42  countries and territories. Of the 895 investment projects, 635  are joint ventures concentrated in three key areas: Ho Chi Minh  City-Dong Nai-Vung Tau in the south Hanoi-Hai Phong-Quang Ninh  in the north and Danang in the central. Thirty-nine of them  belong to overseas Vietnamese with total registered capital of  USD 72 million. The average of size of each project has  increased rapidly from USD 3.5 million in the first years to USD  9.9 million in 1993.    Up to now, the joint ventures with foreign investors have  created goods and service valued at USD 780 million, provided  nearly 50,000 jobs, and remitted to the state budget USD 211  million. Investment and cooperation have improved the capacity  of many existing establishments of Vietnam. Moreover they have  increased the capacity of some industrial branches, including  transport, post and telecommunications, and hotel services. The  telecommunications system in particular has been improved  greatly creating favourable conditions for economic development  in Vietnam as well as its all-round exchange with the world  outside.</p>

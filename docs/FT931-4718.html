			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Generators told to sell plants THE UK electricity regulator yesterday suggested to National Power and PowerGen, the main generators in England and Wales, that they offer for sale 11 power stations that they plan to close either fully or partly later this month. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the regulator, said putting them on the market would provide 'the best safeguard against the possibility or suspicion of monopoly exploitation.' It would also provide protection against a big generator closing economic plant with a view to driving up the price of electricity and, thus, the profitability of other plant. National Power, the larger of the two companies, strongly rejected Prof Littlechild's suggestion. It said overcapacity in generation was increasing and that retaining redundant plant would lead to the closure of more modern and efficient plant. Electricity production costs would rise and the environment would suffer. PowerGen said it did not rule out selling one of its four plants. City analysts said, however, it was unlikely that either company wanted to sell their plants. National Power's robust defence of its actions risks antagonising the regulator, who has already said he is considering referring the generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and will decide by 1995. Analysts believe it unlikely he will make a reference. They think he will seek a change in their licence which would give him powers to order them to sell plants. National Power's stance is a blow to such companies as Cabah Energy, which wants to buy surplus plant. Mr Chris Rowland, a director of Cabah Energy, said yesterday his company was interested in buying plant at five National Power-owned coal-fired stations with a 1,200MW generating capacity. He said: 'If we acquired all five we would be using 2.5m tonnes of coal a year.' That constitutes the production of up to two of the 31 threatened pits. Prof Littlechild's recommendation followed publication of a report by Touche Ross, accountants who he had appointed to be inde-pendent assessors on the closures. He endorsed their findings that while both companies' decisions to close plant were reasonable, there were several 'credible organisations' interested in purchasing stations. He also said the generators should even consider selling plant they considered viable. This would provide greater opportunity for diversification than the present industry structure allowed. National Power said it would consider on their merit any bids for plant not scheduled for closure. The 11 stations scheduled for closure have a total 2,263MW capacity, of which 1,737MW is from coal-fired plant.</p>

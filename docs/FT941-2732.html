			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Minister offers partnership role to unions Britain's unions were yesterday offered a new partnership with the government by Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, but he told them they would have 'no direct role in the determination of policy'. Responding to last week's relaunch of the Trades Union Congress he told a meeting of the Industrial Society that his door was 'always open for dialogue' with the trade unions. 'But unions must recognise their own limitations,' he said. 'There will be no preferential status for unions on the inside of government.' Mr Hunt highlighted the development of the government's proposed apprenticeship scheme to train about 40,000 young people a year in technical, craft and supervisory skills as an issue on which trade unions and government could have talks. He said it was 'heartening that unions may be shaping up and modernising' and urged them to support employers in achieving greater competitiveness and to concentrate on providing more individual services to their members. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, welcomed Mr Hunt's remarks. He said: 'It was good to hear that he and the government recognise the potential for a positive trade union role. I do see plenty of scope for discussion.' He was disappointed, however, that Mr Hunt had not acknowledged the big contribution unions had made to the success of 47 of the top 50 profitable companies in Britain. Eleven trade unions yesterday started judicial review proceedings for an injunction against Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, to try to stop his plans for changing the criminal injuries compensation scheme. They say that the new scheme will provide minimal compensation to victims of violent crime. The Law Society, although not a party to the action, said it supported the application. The hearing will be in the High Court on Tuesday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Horst Engelhardt: "Large Enterprises Not in </F> Demand"]    [Excerpt] The Berlin Trust Agency has practically closed  the chapter of "international relations." The countdown has  started: At the end of May, the last foreign office will close  down in Paris. At the end of this month, the remaining Trust  Agency commissioners for Austria and Switzerland will close  their offices.    The worldwide network for the marketing of former GDR state  enterprises was established in 1991. Since then, agreements  with almost 900 foreign investors involving about 20 billion  German marks [DM] have been concluded. A total of 146,000 jobs  have been promised. This is approximately 10 percent of total  investments and jobs in the Trust Agency's privatization balance.    Large enterprises were not in great demand. "The foreign  investors acquired mainly medium-sized enterprises with a work  force of 800-1,000," the director for international relations,  Wolfgang Vehse, said. The great majority of investors in the  new laender has come from neighboring European countries.    The number of Asians who signed take-over agreements with  the  Trust Agency is almost negligible. "Despite a permanent office  in Tokyo, we have not managed to change the traditional  procedure of the Japanese," Vehse said in an attempt to explain  this phenomenon. In many cases, they took a long time for  extensive examinations. Other investors reacted considerably  faster, thus attaining some offers from rival contenders from  the Far East.    Trust Agency Director Vehse expressed a certain respect for  the Americans who concluded an astonishingly high number of 70  agreements. For U.S. enterprises, in particular, the contract  regulations prevailing in Germany, such as investment rules and  the restraint on alienation, have been difficult to understand  at times. For some U.S. Trust Agency customers, the investments  in eastern Germany were in many cases the first leap across the  Atlantic. [passage omitted]</p>

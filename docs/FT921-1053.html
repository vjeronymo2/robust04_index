			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Rising costs behind 59% jump in Microvitec loss LOSSES jumped by 59 per cent at Microvitec, the USM-quoted computer terminal manufacturer which took over the Logitek computer services group in May 1991. Mr James Bailey, chairman, said the group had survived the 'worst conditions ever experienced by our industry'. However, Logitek had been successfully integrated and losses had been reduced substantially. The acquisition of Logitek - funded by a Pounds 2.6m rights issue last May - was behind the more than doubled surge in administration and distribution costs, from Pounds 5.95m to Pounds 12.3m. Those costs and higher interest charges of Pounds 747,000 (Pounds 196,000) led to deeper pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.8m (Pounds 2.4m). Turnover rose by 58 per cent to Pounds 36.9m, again the result of the inclusion for seven months of Logitek. Microvitec ended the year with gearing of 84 per cent. Mr Bailey said the group was commited to cutting gearing through working capital management and a Pounds 2m repayment of UK corporation and overseas tax. He also said Microvitec had been awarded Dollars 750,000 (Pounds 434,000) in its claim against Worldwide Technology, but the payment was subject to appeal and had not been included in the 1991 accounts. Mr Bailey said that the computer display division, which suffered heavier losses in 1991, had improved sales. Microvitec had also entered a 10 year joint marketing venture with Electrohome to provide monitors for the North American market. Losses per share eased from 6p to 5.3p. There is no dividend (0.3p).</p>

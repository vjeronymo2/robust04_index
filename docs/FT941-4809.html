			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P cuts ratings of Japanese banks Standard &amp; Poor's, the international credit rating agency, has lowered the debt ratings of Industrial Bank of Japan and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, two of Japan's leading long-term credit banks, because of their larger than expected exposure to bad loans. The agency lowered IBJ's senior debt rating from AA minus from A plus, while LTCB's senior debt ratings were cut from A to A minus. S&amp;P said substantial write-offs will ultimately be necessary by IBJ to resolve its bad loans to housing loan companies. However, the write-off process has been limited due to IBJ's earnings levels and the limit on the sales of its cross-shareholding portfolio. LTCB's downgrade reflects the large amount of restructured loans, or loans on which the bank has lowered or waived interest to help restructuring, on top of Y731bn in non-performing loans. Meanwhile, S&amp;P has also downgraded the claims-paying ability ratings of four non-life insurance companies and two life assurers. Japan's non-life insurance sector is suffering from reduced profitability due to higher loss ratios, insufficient premium rates and greater catastrophe costs. Increased competition is also expected to hurt the country's life assurers. The claims-paying ability ratings of Chiyoda Fire &amp; Marine, Dai-Tokyo Fire &amp; Marine, Nichido Fire &amp; Marine, Nippon Fire &amp; Marine, Yasuda Mutual Life and Meiji Mutual Life were downgraded to AA plus from AAA.</p>

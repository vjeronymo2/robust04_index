Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27664 (January 31, 1990), 55 FR 4297 (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;89&hyph;16). Subsequently, the Commission granted a number of extensions to the temporary approval to allow the Commission and NSCC sufficient time to review and assess the use of letters of credit as clearing fund collateral. Most recently temporary approval was granted until June 30, 1994. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32551 (June 29, 1993), 58 FR 36727 (File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;93&hyph;5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC is seeking permanent approval of a proposed rule change that modifies the amount of a member's required clearing fund deposit that may be collateralized by letters of credit. Specifically, the proposed rule change increases the minimum cash contribution for those members who use letters of credit from $50,000 to the greater of $50,000 or 10% of their required clearing fund deposit up to a maximum of $1,000,000. In addition, the rule change provides that only 70% of a member's required clearing fund deposit may be collateralized with letters of credit. The rule change also adds headings to the clearing fund formula section for purposes of clarity and includes other nonsubstantive drafting changes. The effect of the proposed rule change is to increase the liquidity of the clearing fund and to limit NSCC's exposure to unusual risks resulting from the reliance on letters of credit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since obtaining temporary approval of the original filing, NSCC has filed clearing fund composition reports with the Commission. NSCC states that since December 31, 1989, as a result of the new requirements, it has observed the following changes in the composition of the clearing fund: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Cash deposits have increased by approximately 225%; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The value of securities deposited has increased by approximately 205%; <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities eligible for deposit as clearing fund collateral include U.S. or municipal bonds in the first or second rating of any nationally known statistical service. NSCC Rule 4, &sect;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Letter of credit deposits have declined by approximately 40%. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In October of 1989 when the Commission initially granted temporary approval of NSCC's proposal, letters of credit accounted for 76% of the total dollar value of required clearing fund deposits. By May 28, 1993, letters of credit accounted for less than 30%. During the period from June 1, 1992 to May 28, 1993, letters of credit accounted for an average of 30.49% of the total dollar value of required clearing fund deposits, and for no month during that period did the portion of letters of credit used for required clearing fund deposits rise above 34%. Letter from Karen L. Saperstein, Vice President/Director of Legal &amp; Associate General Counsel, NSCC, to Jerry W. Carpenter, Branch Chief, Division, Commission (June 10, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC states that the proposal is consistent with its requirements under Section 17A of the Act because it enhances NSCC's ability to safeguard securities and funds in its custody or under its control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

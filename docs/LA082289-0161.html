Final  </P> <P> SEARS, ROEBUCK TO HELP NBC SELL ITS NEW FALL LINEUP  </P> <P> NBC will be selling its new fall television lineup with the help of the  nation's No. 1 retailer, Sears, Roebuck and Co., starting Labor Day weekend,  the network said today.  </P> <P> The publicity program, "America's Brightest Stars: NBC, Sears and You," will  attempt to attract viewers and advertisers to NBC's five new television series  through a combination of games, store displays, advertisements and direct mail.  </P> <P> NBC said it will run "prommercials" on closed-circuit sets at Sear's 850 retail  stores. Sears will also mail an eight-page brochure about NBC's shows to 20  million customers with Sears charge cards and will take out newspaper  supplemental ads.  </P> <P> Included in the promotion are weekly sweepstakes beginning Sept. 3 that offer  winners, among other things, a small part on one of the new prime-time NBC  series.  </P> <P> CBS and K mart Corp. announced a similar arrangement last spring, although  details have not been disclosed.  </P></p>

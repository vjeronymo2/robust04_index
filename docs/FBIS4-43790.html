			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes by Marc </F> Reynebeau and Hubert Van Humbeecks; place and date not given:  "A Little Moderation, Please"]    [Text] [KNACK] The European Union (EU) has been worrying  for a long time now whether it should first concentrate on  enlargement or greater integration. The decision now seems to  have been made for the former. Are you happy with that? Was  not Belgium in fact inclined to give priority to integration?    [Claes] No, we are certainly not happy with that. But the  circumstances dictated otherwise. Under pressure from the large  member states, we have accepted a compromise, with enlargement  limited to four countries: Austria, Norway, Sweden, and  Finland, countries which have much to offer both in  monetary-economic terms and politically. The number one  priority of the European enterprise, stability on the European  Continent, is being increasingly jeopardized by developments in  Central and East Europe. We cannot remain an island of  stability. But that must not rule out a deeper Europe:  Otherwise the European enterprise threatens to be diluted into  nothing more than a large economic area. The major, initial  ambition was for Europe to become a political entity for  everyone.    The 1996 intergovernmental conference is of historic  importance in this sense. It was still possible in Maastricht  to cover up the fundamental contradictions with shaky  compromises. That will no longer be possible in 1996. That  could result in a two-speed Europe, within which, in addition to  enlargement, a small group of countries opt for faster  integration. The other member states would then have to settle  for an economic area for the time being.    [KNACK] That is also the idea recently expressed by Mr.  Lamassoure, your French colleague for European affairs, in LE  MONDE.    [Claes] Yes, but he gives the impression that we were all  invited to come together to pledge support for the Bonn-Paris  alliance. I would like to say a few words about that, because  that does not serve the interests of more democracy in the Union.    [KNACK] Is the danger of this Bonn-Paris alliance not that  it  could prompt other alliances in response?    [Claes] It is only logical for alliances to result in the  formation of counteralliances. And that is not in line with our  concept of a Europe in which smaller countries have their proper  say and in which minorities are happy to go along with the view  of the majority. Whether they originate in Bonn and Paris or  London and Rome, these bilateral initiatives do nothing to  promote EU credibility.    [KNACK] How should we envisage a two-speed Europe?    [Claes] The economic area which we now have is a sound  basis.  I genuinely believe that a couple of member states can fulfill a  pioneering role. Provided that the door remains open to other  countries to join them when they have met the conditions. Such  a construction was already envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty:  Monetary Union is also to be achieved in stages. It could  result in a structure with two levels of decisionmaking,  depending on the competences. At the second level, only those  included would decide. Can you tell me how the present  institutional system can work if tomorrow we find ourselves with  20 or more members? How are the wheels going to turn? I do not  believe there is any alternative.    [KNACK] European Commission President Delors will be  outlining his white paper at the Corfu summit at the end of this  month. How can he develop a coherent employment policy if the  EU is unable to pursue a common fiscal and social policy, with  the fraud and social dumping which results? That can jeopardize  everything decided at Corfu.    [Claes] Most certainly. I will again be accused of looking  with regret to the past, but that is not true; I have no problem  with a market economy, provided there is sufficient control.  The market economy always neglects the long term; the focus is  more on profit than on people. I believe that any social or  economic policy should focus on people.    The Union is very ambitious in terms of economic  integration,  it even accepts that it cannot be achieved without sufficient  economic convergence, without a sufficiently concerted economic  policy. But the EU has too few resources to develop a  voluntarist policy as proposed by Delors. But that is what we  need. The latest most striking example is the failure of the  Commission in the steel sector. Commissioner Karel van Miert's  plans failed, because not enough players wanted to participate.  How is any coordinated cross-border policy possible in such  circumstances?    If it can't succeed in the case of steel, what chance of  success is there for modern technologies? These are going to  help determine the shape of society and no doubt open up  ideological debates. Delors is not exaggerating when he compares  in his white paper the development of modern technologies, the  combination of the written and spoken word and the image, with  the first industrial revolution. The increasingly concrete  applications of these technologies are creating new services as  well as changing the way of life of people in the West. We  cannot just leave all this to forces governed solely by the  short-term profit motive, and which are thus much less  interested in the very important side effects of this new  industrial revolution. A sound democratic institution such as  the EU must give direction to these forces.    [KNACK] Are you thinking of the success of Silvio Berlusconi  in Italy?    [Claes] I didn't need to wait for Berlusconi to come along  to  feel concern about what happens when the same people who decide  what information is to be circulated and what is not are also  responsible for deciding policy. That is a worrying development.    [KNACK] So you want to update [French philosopher]  Montesquieu and include the media as the fourth power in a  system of separation of powers?    [Claes] It is a long time since we have seen a proper  balance  in the functioning of the three perfectly separated powers, as I  am sure everyone will agree. Nothing is eternal, and perhaps  Montesquieu does need a little revision.    The Chinese also used to have a fourth power, the  administration. In our case it is the media.    [KNACK] The press as the fourth power, you are not having a  dig are you?    [Claes] No, but another question is whether what is  happening  now is good for the necessary independence of the individual  journalist.    [KNACK] The failure of the common foreign policy in the  former Yugoslavia has not much for the EU's credibility.    [Claes] Foreign policy must also be debated in 1996. The  problem is that a consensus must first always be obtained. The  second cornerstone of the Maastricht Treaty is the need for an  approach based on an intergovernmental philosophy. One article  in the Treaty also says, however, that a decision by a qualified  majority can be implemented, there is just a reluctance to apply  this in practice.    This does not alter the fact that under the Belgian  presidency, a number of joint actions were established, such as  in the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia, and South Africa.  That was not bad, but it was not enough. There is then the  question: Who is going to pay? As it is a common policy, there  must not be any doubts on this point, but this decision has not  yet been taken. You are therefore developing a policy without  knowing how you are going to pay for it. But we should also  remember that Maastricht has only been in force for seven  months. It is not therefore so surprising to find that national  policies are being pursued which are contradictory to the EU  directives. This should progressively improve.    [KNACK] But there is the feeling that EU diplomacy is not  taken seriously at the international level?    [Claes] In the conflict in Yugoslavia, there was clearly  going to be an attempt to achieve a common position under the  United Nations'supervision. Talks then developed with  Washington and Moscow, to which London and Paris were invited as  members of the UN Security Council. The EU as such was not  present, was not even invited.    Europe is not therefore a player on the world stage. For the  large member states, their membership of the Security Council  remains much more important than the EU as such. The Yugoslav  experience taught us that.    [KNACK] How difficult is foreign policy for a small  country? Belgium's actions in Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi have  not been outright successes.    [Claes] It would be pretty stupid to claim the opposite was  true. However, objectively speaking, it must be said that the  entire continent of Africa is a mess. In a recent report, the  United Nations also came to the conclusion that it is necessary  to move away from the policies being followed, not just for  countries that have bilateral relations with that continent, but  also multilateral relations, via major organizations.    Since the early 1970's, Africa has steadily moved backward  despite the impressive sums given it by the international  community. Politically, too, there is no glimpse of success.  The requirement of democratizing authoritarian regimes has not  yielded much, with the exception of South Africa.    So should we turn our backs on Africa? No. In humanitarian  terms, it is inexcusable to leave hundreds of millions of people  to their fate. Nor would that be a good thing politically.  Africa's instability can cause serious disturbances on other  continents.    Of course, I do not have a miracle solution, but I do still  believe in the need for a cautious democratization policy which  puts the emphasis squarely on the respect of human rights. It  would also be sensible to give policies a more regional flavor.  We will have to work in larger units, since bilateral  approaches have had too little success.    [KNACK] What does that mean for Belgium in concrete terms?    [Claes] It is not because the democratization process in the  three countries where we are very active has failed that we have  to reconcile ourselves to the preexistence of these corrupt and  authoritarian regimes. I am totally opposed to that. However,  Belgium cannot take up the challenge alone. Reconstructing even  small countries such as Rwanda or Burundi using Belgian  resources alone is impossible. We can indeed play a pioneering  role, and play the role of advocate for these countries  vis-a-vis the IMF, the World Bank, and major donors.    Moreover, I would like to raise the issue of the share of  blame which lies on the Africans themselves for this mess. At  the end of the day, they are the ones primarily responsible, and  in most cases they have not been paragons of ethics, democracy,  or efficiency. One cannot say that Africa does not have an  intellectual potential on which to draw. However, I cannot  really appreciate the fact that perhaps the majority of African  intellectuals trained in our universities opt to stay with us.  They must go back and assume their responsibilities. There  must be something other than the policy of the outstretched hand.    [KNACK] From the African side we hear the criticism that we  must not impose our values and institutions. Do you stick by  the universality of human rights.    [Claes] Yes. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is  part of the foundation of the UN Charter. The next century will  be more international than ever, so there must be some basic  rules, and these include universal human rights. I would like  to draw some distinctions as far as political systems are  concerned, certainly over time. I want to gain an understanding  of the problems facing political leaders in countries which  sometimes have hundreds of millions of inhabitants. The  situation cannot be turned around just like that. This calls  for pragmatic views, which must not lead us away from the final  goal.    [KNACK] They will tell you that it is easy for you to talk:  Human rights were invented by the West. Some Asian countries  assert other values, and put a fundamentally different emphasis  on things.    [Claes] It is generally the leadership groups in those  countries that do that. Massive proletariats are being created  in those countries, as was the case with us earlier. In the  medium term they will come to the conclusion which led to  emancipation in the West. So we are on the edge of a profound  movement. This does not mean that I have no eye for other  values or standards. For this reason I am not inclined to make  many concessions in the area of human rights.    [KNACK] In recent years, it has been hypothesized that the  conflicts of the future will be conflicts between large  cultures, for example between the West and the Islamic world.    [Claes] I do not believe in such a conflict. Mohammed's  teachings do not impose intolerance or blind hatred. However,  in the past we too have had to deal with religious radicals.  Moreover, fundamentalism is supported not just by religious  fanaticism, but also by social and economic abuses. How can we  fight that? Not by getting mixed up in discussions about the  interpretation of a belief, but by assuming our social and  economic responsibilities. The European troika was in Algiers  recently. We had to help those people there who view universal  human rights as an end goal. They are working to form a system  of democratic pluralism. We must help them improve the social  and economic situation of the people.    [KNACK] But the IMF has just imposed very tough conditions  on  Algeria which will surely not improve the lives of people in  that country. This is happening in many Third World countries.  Are we not part of the IMF?    [Claes] It is correct that the IMF has often imposed reforms  that resulted in young democracies suffering heavily, or which  dramatically worsened social situation. That is an old  complaint. I think that in the meantime there has been a  strategic move away from this approach.    In Algeria, the IMF action was inevitable for monetary  reasons. The question now is whether the West is prepared to  minimize the rough edges of this operation. In any case, a  major debt rescheduling program has been arranged. I believe  that a consensus has formed within the IMF for a more friendly  policy vis-a-vis the Mediterranean area, especially the Maghreb.    [KNACK] In a recent speech you warned against the legacy of  Byzantium. Did that speech not emphasize the clash of cultures?    [Claes] I simply wanted to say that it would be naive to try  and explain everything from a Western viewpoint. In countries  where the Byzantine civilization made its influence felt for  centuries, this is reflected in structures which differ clearly  from those of the West. This has little to do with the traces  of 70 years of communism, because before then the Byzantine  civilization had already put the emphasis on other areas.    It is not that I want to be proven right, but you cannot  ignore the warning of Czech President Vaclav Havel, when he  expressed his fear about populist reactions to the social  disappointments in the economic reform process. I still believe  that blindly moving to a market system must lead to unacceptable  social wrongs, which then play into the hands of  populist-reactionary politicians. The reform of the economic  system was and is necessary. However, this must be done  gradually. I have never believed in the so-called economic  blitz strategies. I can remember the great Russian professor  who came to my office to explain that he had a plan for  reforming his country's economy in 500 days. I told him: "With  all due respect, professor, you are forgetting that you are  working with people."    The postcommunist election successes in Lithuania, Poland,  and Hungary are undoubtedly a signal sent by a large proportion  of the population that they expect more attention to be paid by  their politicians to the social interests of the people.  Central Europe does not want to have anything to do with brute  liberalism, in which a small stratum of people will become  scandalously rich while the rest sink into unemployment without  any coverage for the major social risks.    [KNACK] Yes, and what about Russia?    [Claes] Russia presents the picture of a humiliated  superpower which does not intend to be left alone. The economy  has deteriorated, and is largely controlled by a new type of  mafiosi. There have been elections and there is a constitution.  That is good, but the text might as well have been written  especially for Boris Yeltsin. I try to imagine what would  happen tomorrow if Aleksandr Rutskoy or Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  were to become president. It is not encouraging. Washington is  flooding us with optimistic analyses of the situation in Moscow  which I have never shared. I am not saying that Russia no  longer has a chance to consolidate its democracy or to modernize  its economy, but what we know about it today does not lead to  optimism.    I am primarily concerned about Ukraine. It is a large,  strategically located country which has nuclear weapons. The EU  offered it a partnership as a way of giving it some basis for  gaining control of its social and economic shambles and to give  a boost to its democratic forces. Ukraine is not really making  any progress with denuclearization and is torn between an  eastern part that wants to join Russia and a western part that  does not want to belong to Russia. There is also the quarrel  about how to divide up the Black Sea Fleet and about control  over the Crimea. There is plenty of instability, and that can  make the much faster integration of a number of Central European  countries into our institutions inevitable. I hope it will not  lead to this scenario, but all the signals I receive every day  just push me toward certain intellectual exercises.    [KNACK] Could not our institutions have prevented things  from taking this course?    [Claes] I think that NATO and the Western European Union, on  the one hand, and the EU, on the other, could not have done any  more than they have done so far. What else could NATO have done  besides the cooperation involved in the Partnership for Peace?  The alternative was to offer some Central European countries  full membership, thus drawing a new East-West border on the map  of Europe. That would clearly have been a negative sign for  those countries which did not qualify. In actual fact, they  would have been pushed back into the Russian sphere of  influence. However, that does not mean that we must avoid a  dialogue with Moscow. With that kind of military superpower it  must be possible to make specific arrangements. The EU also  followed the only possible strategy: association agreements  with potential members, aid programs, and political dialogue.  These actions have prospects. Immediate accession was not an  option: That would have loosened European cohesion and would  not have done those countries a favor. Their economies are not  strong enough to follow the pace set by European policies.    We have made it clear to those countries which are not  called  upon to become members that we would go as far as possible with  them. This means partnership agreements, which involve  far-reaching cooperation in a wide variety of areas. Surely,  all this represents a responsible and homogeneous approach?  There is no other conceivable strategy at present, unless, I  repeat, unforeseen events rule out that scenario.    [KNACK] Is it correct to assert that the West has expanded  its institutions eastward, but that it is letting Russia keep  its "nearby foreign countries": i.e., the republics of the  former Soviet Union, with the exception of the Baltic states?    [Claes] No. We also offered partnership agreements to the  other republics of the former Soviet Union.    [KNACK] Not a whole lot of work was put into that.    [Claes] No, but they did not apply either. Moreover, you  have to draw a line somewhere. I do not agree with Russia's  definition of "nearby foreign countries." That seems to clash  with our concept of the independence and territorial integrity  of countries recognized by the international community. Of  course, there is the problem of the tens of millions of Russians  who live in other republics. They have to apply for a minority  status. However, Moscow feels that that is no reason to take  military action on the territory of other countries, unless they  asked for it themselves.    [KNACK] Has Russia already taken action in Georgia?    [Claes] That is a delicate question. To what extent can  these kinds of operations take place, whether or not behind the  screen of the CSCE? Only if the CSCE procedures are respected.  However, if the CSCE acknowledges that there is reason for an  intervention, then those people, who today criticize Moscow,  must dare to admit that no single European country can give or  wants to give the CSCE the resources it needs to play its role.  We said quite clearly to [Russian Foreign Minister] Andrey  Kozyrev: "A little moderation please." If he asks whether we  are prepared to send troops or provide financial support,  nothing will come of it. We have to tell things like they are.</p>

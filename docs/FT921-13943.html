			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Appointments: Tenuous tenure for Gunn? Robert Gunn has just been appointed to a job which circumstances may prevent him from taking up. Legislation to establish the Further Education Funding Council should be passed shortly, but if Labour wins the election it may well be repealed. Gunn's tenure as chairman would therefore be rather short. If set up, the FEFC will take over from local authorities a Pounds 2bn budget for financing the 563 further-education, tertiary and sixth-form colleges in England, which cater predominantly for the 16-19 age-range. It will also have responsibility for monitoring colleges' financial planning and performance - likely to be an onerous undertaking, given their financial inexperience. Gunn, 65, spent 39 years with Boots. As chairman for the five years until July 1990, he was responsible for the spending-spree which brought to the retail chain car-parts and do-it-yourself companies, among others. Given the state of many further education colleges, this background would seem pertinent. To be fair, though, Gunn is no stranger to the education debate having done a stint on the Polytechnics Funding Council (PCFC). However, with only a day or so a week to give to the FEFC, Gunn will be heavily dependent on the chief executive, William Stubbs, also appointed yesterday. Stubbs moves sideways from the PCFC, where he is widely credited as a force behind the polytechnics' rapid expansion in the past four years. 'We need to create a national system for 16-to-19 education which ranks with the best in the world,' says Stubbs - not exactly a modest strategy.</p>

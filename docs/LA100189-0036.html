			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUG BUSINESS;  </P> <P> DEMAND FOR COMMERCIALLY PRODUCED INSECT PREDATORS HAS NEVER BEEN HIGHER AS  FARMERS SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO PESTICIDES.  </P> <P> The tools are simple; the task is anything but.  </P> <P> Entomologist Don Norlund is holed up in a bug-filled Weslaco, Tex., laboratory,  armed with nothing but cardboard grids and swaths of filmy organza cloth,  trying mightily to drag the insect industry into the 20th Century.  </P> <P> "Right now, the industry is not using neat technology to produce beneficial  insects," said Norlund, a research entomologist for the U.S. Department of  Agriculture. "It is not automated to any extent whatsoever. It's a lot of  manual labor."  </P> <P> Thanks to aldicarb, a pesticide that contaminated watermelons in 1985, and  alar, a chemical growth regulator that frightened consumers in 1989, an  increasing number of farmers are searching for non-chemical methods of pest  control, and breeders of beneficial bugs throughout North America are having a  field day.  </P> <P> Demand is outstripping supply for the first time in the industry's short life.  And nowhere is the bug boom more evident than in California, which has a corner  on the creepy-crawly market.  </P> <P> But it's no simple task to breed beneficial bugs -- like green lacewings --  that eat bad bugs -- such as aphids. The process is low tech and labor  intensive. There are no quality-control standards. Only one in three  insectaries actually rears the bugs that it sells.  </P> <P> And while interest in so-called biological control -- pesticide-free methods of  growing crops -- is at an all-time high, some say the infant insect industry is  not up to the challenge.  </P> <P> "Mass rearing methods have to be developed and maintained and quality control  programs must be worked up," said Marjorie Hoy, professor of entomology at the  University of California, Berkeley. "The industry is going to have to police  itself . . . or people will go back to chemicals. We don't want this to  happen."  </P> <P> Enter Don Norlund, the bug world's Henry Ford wanna-be. For the past year,  Norlund has been trying to find a way to mass produce green lacewings, a  predatory insect that will attack nearly any soft-bodied bug that crosses its  path.  </P> <P> His project is the nation's first large-scale attempt to automate the bug  business, to "gear the system up to a commercial level," he said.  </P> <P> Right now, feeding the bugs is extremely inefficient. Because they are  cannibalistic, they must be kept apart in half-inch square compartments in  small cardboard grids, he said. The grid has no top or bottom, but is covered  with strips of organza, a thin, stiff fabric commonly used for women's hats and  bridal gowns.  </P> <P> To feed the lacewings, strips of flannel are soaked in synthetic liquid food  and laid underneath the grid, and the bugs suck the liquid out through the  organza. The problem is that up to 90% of the food stays in the flannel and is  wasted. So Norlund and his research group are trying to create a diet for the  lacewings that resembles insect eggs -- prepackaged, intact, cost-effective and  efficient.  </P> <P> Harvesting lacewing eggs for sale is also a problem. The bugs secrete a  substance that forms tiny "stalks" on which they lay their eggs, presumably to  keep them off the ground and away from ants, which will eat the pale green  ovals.  </P> <P> "We are trying to design a cage that . . . would allow you to mechanically  harvest the eggs off their little stalks," he said. "Right now, it's being done  by hand. We brush the eggs with a little piece of wadded nylon cloth. It breaks  the stalks of lots of them, but it also squashes lots. We're looking at ways of  creating a hot wire to burn the stalk below the eggs and suck the eggs up with  a vacuum cleaner."  </P> <P> When you figure that it takes up to 20,000 lacewings per acre per season to  bring aphids, whiteflies, scale and mealybugs under control, you can see why  technology is so important to the insect industry.  </P> <P> Without it, bug watchers say, insectaries will never be able to supply the  number of insects necessary to make biological control a viable alternative to  chemical pesticides.  </P> <P> Rincon-Vitova Insectaries Inc. of Ventura County is cooperating with Norlund in  his attempt to automate the industry. Arguably the oldest, largest and most  established insectary in North America, Rincon-Vitova is also the most  efficient producer of the dozen species of insects that it rears and sells.  </P> <P> "These guys are some of the best producers of beneficial insects in the  country," Norlund said, "but it's still not the type of technology that you  need to produce the numbers of beneficials that it will require to replace a  significant amount of insecticide."  </P> <P> Still, it's enough to give Rincon-Vitova customers in all 50 states and six  foreign countries and to generate more than $1 million in sales for the company  annually -- a good chunk of a market that's estimated at $25 million worldwide.  That figure would be larger, but for the Soviet Union and China, where  biological control is a government, rather than a private enterprise.  </P> <P> The USDA and the California Department of Food and Agriculture list 68  suppliers of beneficial organisms in 19 states and Canada. California is atop  the insect heap, with 29 of those enterprises. Texas is next with five.  </P> <P> "California is a pretty progressive state," said Jake Blehm, Rincon-Vitova's  vice president for marketing and communications. "There isn't a farmer here who  doesn't know what biological control is. But there are a lot of places in the  country where they don't have an inkling, the middle-aged farmers who started  during the chemical era when pesticides were wonder drugs."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bug Shortages  </P> <P> Still, in the past several years, grocery shoppers have clamored for  pesticide-free produce like never before, and many farmers have responded by  kicking their chemical habits and buying beneficial bugs from insectaries such  as Rincon-Vitova.  </P> <P> "Last year, we had a predatory mite shortage because of demand from strawberry  growers," Blehm said. "We've also had lacewing shortages. We had to quit taking  orders in June, July and late May."  </P> <P> A lack of ladybugs has also been a problem since 1987, Blehm said, but only in  part because of consumer demand. Ladybugs -- the aphid-eating Hippodamia  convergens -- do not reproduce well enough on a synthetic diet to make them  economical to rear.  </P> <P> So suppliers depend on roving bands of bug-pickers who trek through the High  Sierra in search of the orange-and-black insects. Hippodamia convergens  hibernate through the California winters in inches-thick beds at the base of  pine trees, hidden beneath layers of dead leaves and pine needles. Harvesters  scoop them up and sell them to suppliers such as Rincon-Vitova and Fountain's  Sierra Bug Co., which is based in Rough and Ready, Calif.  </P> <P> "Ladybugs are getting so scarce, you can't get enough to keep people happy,"  said H. H. Fountain, the company's owner. "From 1974 to 1977, we sold three to  four times as many bugs as we do now. There were a lot more bugs to be had to  begin with."  </P> <P> Forest fires, logging and urban encroachment are the major culprits in the  ladybug shortage, Fountain said. "Loggers tear the beds up completely to where  the bugs won't come back," he mourned. "Forest fires will burn them out."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Research Needed  </P> <P> And then there's research support -- or the lack thereof. An estimated $450  million in mostly private funding is spent each year on research and  development for chemical pesticides, according to Kenneth Cook, director of a  Washington-based environmental research group called the Center for Research  Economics.  </P> <P> In contrast, he said, the USDA spends only about $20 million each year on  biological control research. Concern is so great that a recent National Academy  of Sciences study called for an additional $40 million annually to be spent on  research into alternative methods of agriculture.  </P> <P> "Biological control has been seriously neglected," Cook said. "The $20 million  is an optimistic number. The potential has not nearly been exploited. When you  look at pesticides, which are ranked by the Environmental Protection Agency as  one of the great health risks, it's really ludicrous that we're spending as  little as we are on biological control."  </P> <P> Hoy of UC Berkeley has spent years breeding an improved strain of predatory  mites -- beneficial bugs that clear fields of pest mites. While she has shared  the better bugs with commercial insectaries, she said there is far too little  of that give and take. As a result, Hoy said, it's tough to get new bugs from  the lab to the marketplace.  </P> <P> "First of all, you have to convince someone that it's going to work and that  it's worth their while to learn how to use it and mass rear and sell it," she  said. "The transfer of information from researcher to consumer is really  difficult."  </P> <P> Adding such problems as the ladybug shortage and the dearth of research support  to the sheer drudgery of insect rearing, makes it easy to see why there aren't  more producing insectaries. For not only must insect breeders rear beneficial  insects, they often must rear the pests, too, to give the beneficials something  to eat.  </P> <P> "It's surprising," Blehm said. "Probably 75% of the time, effort, labor and  resources goes to rearing host insects. We could get rid of 75% of our space if  we didn't have to do that."  </P> <P> It's not unlike feeding humans, he said, whereby it takes expanses such as  Kansas and Nebraska to sustain an island such as Manhattan. Rincon-Vitova sells  fly parasites, so it has to breed common houseflies. The company sells  lacewings, so it has to breed a moth called sitotroga, too.  </P> <P> "If we had a reliable source for insects," Blehm said, "we'd get out of  production and go entirely into retail and consulting. That's the neat part of  the business. The growing part is the drudgery. But at this point in time, we  haven't found anyone as reliable as we are."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1 THE LADYBUG  </P> <P> Also called ladybird, it was introduced in California in the late 19th Century  to help save the fruit crop from a scale infestation. Since 1987, the bugs have  been growing scarce as habitats and breeding grounds disappear.  </P> <P> 2 DIET  </P> <P> Feeds chiefly on aphids  </P> <P> and scale insects. Does not  </P> <P> reproduce well on a synthetic diet.  </P> <P> 3 THE FAMILY  </P> <P> A small round beetle, usually bright red or yellow with black, red, white or  yellow spots. Belongs to the order Coleoptera and make up the family  Coccinellidae. There are about 150 species.  </P> <P> 4 LIFE CYCLE  </P> <P> Ladybugs hibernate through the winter by crawling under pine needles and  leaves.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CRYPTOLAEMUS  </P> <P> Known as the "Mealybug Destroyer." An Australian import and member of the  ladybug family, adults are black with orange head and tail.  </P> <P> PREDATORY MITES  </P> <P> Beneficial varieties feed on pest mites, consuming between 5 and 20 mites -- or  their eggs -- a day. Adults are orange with a pear-shaped body.  </P> <P> GREEN LACEWING  </P> <P> A voracious predator that feeds on virtually any soft-bodied insect. Adults are  a delicate green and about three-quarters of an inch long.  </P> <P> Source: Rincon-Vitova Insectaries Inc.  </P></p>

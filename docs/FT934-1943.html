			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pouring cold water on hopes of boom for oil supertankers Sir, It is to be hoped that potential investors in oil tanker shares will take any prospectus offering a bright future with a supertanker of salt ('Hopes launched of uplift in tanker shipping', December 9). The tanker business has only 'boomed' since the second world war as a result of major conflict: Korean war, first Suez, second Suez, etc. Normal standards of supply and demand are irrelevant to it. A new VLCC (very large crude carrier), the crude oil workhorse, costs Dollars 90m to build and requires a daily hire of Dollars 40,000 over 10 years to make a reasonable profit. Current hire, in an admittedly unusual seasonal dip in freights, stands at about Dollars 12,000. It has not once been above Dollars 30,000 a day for any period in the past 20 years. Wherein lies the sudden enthusiasm for public subscription? That so many existing VLCCs reach 20 years of age between now and 1997 while the replacement programme of new vessels remains unsatisfactory is insufficient reason to anticipate higher freight rates, unless it is assumed that another Exxon Valdez occurs and in a place where it is noticed - the Florida coast, Cote d'Azur or Yokohama Bay. Relying on knee-jerk public and government reaction to ban old tankers after such an event seems a somewhat casino approach to investment, but that's the only way profit will accrue. If there is no Exxon Valdez repeat, old tankers will continue to trade at freight rates the new cannot match. Scrapping of ageing VLCCs has resumed this autumn after a lull, but a notional overall surplus of tonnage still exists in the market. Increased scrapping in 1984 will bring balance almost within grasp if the world recession fades and oil consumption growth re-sumes. Meantime a growing number of economists believes the oil industry has peaked. Gas is taking ever more of the energy market and, unlike oil, it is not flexible. Markets lost to gas are lost for 20 years, or until the gas runs out. The truth is that old salts in the tanker business smell the possibility of a boom, want to be part of it but cannot make the figures fit to a banker's eye. Caveat emptor. Or leave it to the professionals. K D Shilleto, director, Internaft, Collier House, Suite 312, 163/169 Brompton Road, London SW3 1PY</p>

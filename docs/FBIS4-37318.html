			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Baghdad, 18 Jun (INA)--Muhammad 'Abdallah  al-Kibsi, head of the Yemeni House of Representatives delegation  [visiting Iraq], has stressed that those who are conspiring  against the unity and independence of the Yemeni people are the  same who are conspiring against the unity and independence of  the people of fraternal Iraq.    Addressing a news conference attended by Arab and foreign  press and television correspondents, as well as an INA  correspondent, al-Kibsi said the Yemeni people and the  legitimate and constitutional government today face a  manifestation of the secessionists' opposition to the will of  the Yemeni people, with their various segments and political and  social forces. It is a manifestation of their rejection of the  democratic option Yemen has chosen since the realization of  immortal unity. [passage omitted]    He stressed that in the recent battles, the legitimate and  constitutional forces achieved successive victories against the  remnants of the separatists, who have been forced to retreat  into Aden. He said those victories have provided new pieces of  evidence that prove conspiratorial and treasonous coordination  between the secessionists and Saudi Arabia and other Gulf  states. He said the legitimate and constitutional forces have  seized sophisticated weapons and military hardware, comprising a  squadron of Sukhoi-22 planes, a battalion of T-72 tanks, in  addition to 18 heavy guns, each worth over $5 million. He said  the secessionists do not have money to purchase such weapons,  adding that these weapons, which have been seized by the  legitimate and constitutional forces, are categorical proof of  the subordination of that secessionist gang to the powers that  do not want Yemeni unity to last. [passage omitted]    Asked by INA about Yemen's concept regarding the Arab stand  on Yemeni events, the stand of the legitimate and constitutional  Yemeni leadership regarding formulas to end the war completely,  and the military developments on the battlefield, al-Kibsi said:  When fraternal Iraq was exposed to American aggression and to  the blockade that is still imposed on its people, the Arabs took  positions ranging from those who understood the Iraqi position  and were opposed to the aggression and the blockade, to those  who adopted the opportunistic and reactionary position of a  lackey who did not want the Arab nation to rise via the rise of  the Iraqis. The latter stood by the aggression on Iraq and  mobilized all their political, material, and military resources  against Iraq. They are repeating this stand now against the  constitutional Yemeni government and people because they do not  want the nation to unite. Moreover, they took this stand because  Yemen stood by its Arab brothers in Iraq during the unjust  aggression, despite the fact that the Yemeni events are an  internal issue and not a dispute or war between Yemen and  another external power.    Al-Kibsi said Iraq's position on the current Yemeni events  is  an honorable national and pan-Arab position and has had a great  effect on the morale of the united Yemeni people.    Al-Kibsi said Yemen rejects any kind of interference in its  internal affairs, including interference in the recent events,  because what is happening in Yemen today is that secessionist  forces are standing against the nationalist and constitutional  forces of legitimacy, something that should be rejected by all  patriotic, noble, and zealous Arabs.    Al-Kibsi said: While we are tightening the grip militarily  on the besieged secessionists in Aden, we also support peace  from a position of military and political capability. We are  ready for a peaceful solution to save our people in southern  Yemen from the perils of bloodshed. This is because the  renegade secessionist al-Bid compels innocent citizens to  withdraw along with him whenever there is military pressure by  the forces of constitutional legitimacy. These forces are now  no more than 25 km from Aden, the secessionists' major  stronghold.    He said a constitutional and legitimate Yemeni dialogue  should be held with the unionist and nationalist elements in the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and not with its renegade  secessionist elements. He pointed out that many nationalist and  unionist socialists are now fighting alongside the forces of  constitutional legitimacy against the secessionist gang on  various combat fronts. Others in Aden are facing pressures by  the intelligence elements and henchmen of the renegade  secessionist al-Bid.    Al-Kibsi explained that the secessionists declared a  government that no one recognized and that is rejected by the  nationalists and unionists in the YSP itself. Some elements in  this party were sentenced to death by the YSP itself. He  pointed out that the secessionist group, which claims that it is  the government in southern Yemen, is actually an agent of Saudi  Arabia and it only consists of those who were in Saudi Arabia.  No one has recognized or will recognize this group because the  whole world, including the United Nations and the Arab League,  recognize only the Republic of Yemen.    The head of the Yemeni House of Representatives delegation  said each Yemeni citizen throughout the Yemeni homeland has much  love and appreciation for Iraq and its leader and people for  their sincere and honorable nationalist positions. He explained  that his visit to Baghdad, along with the accompanying  delegation, is part of parliamentary efforts designed to clarify  facts about what is taking place in Yemen.</p>

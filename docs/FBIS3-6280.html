Thai and US officials  are scheduled to hold their third round of talks this month.  They are expected to focus on the illegal shipment clause as it  is the last crucial and contentious issue to be resolved in the  negotiations.    The United States has already proposed some wording it would  like to see included in the agreement, but the Thai side did not  want to see the final agreement based on a US draft alone. The  wording proposed by the US may conflict with some of Gatt's  multilateral trade principles. And Thailand's agreement to such  a clause might have put the country at a disadvantage on other  issues in the future.    A source in the Thai Garment Manufacturers Association said  the US proposed very tough penalties for circumvention of the  country-of-origin rules. Thai garment exporters would stand to  lose portions of their quota if their products are found to have  been trans-shipped to third countries before entering the US.    The condition suggested by the Americans would give the  United States the rights to inspect any plant in Thailand  suspected of trans-shipping its output to the United States  without advance notice. If any plant were shown to be guilty,  the firm would be subject to being punished by the reduction of  its quota by triple the amount of product illegally transshipped.    The General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (Gatt) calls for  giving accused countries the chance to clear themselves by  submitting documentation in support of their innocence. The US  wants to be able to check things out at the source.    The source said two previous negotiating sessions had failed  to extend the textiles and garments agreement because the Thai  side could not accept the US proposal.    Many other textile and garment exporters like Hong Kong and  China have agreed to sign bilateral textile quota agreements  with the United States. The circumvention penalties insisted on  by the United States differ for each country such an agreement  has been concluded with.    The old bilateral agreement which allowed for a limited  amount of Thai textiles to be exported to the US without harming  its domestic garment industry expired on Dec 31 of last year.    Wirot Amatakunchai, president of the Thai Garment  Manufacturers Association, said Thailand proposed a 20 per cent  increase over its former quota of 202 million square metres for  the new agreement, since Thailand used up all of the quota  granted under the old agreement last year.    The upcoming third round of negotiations have been delayed  until April or May after a big meeting of the Thai Chamber  Commerce.    Phongsak Atsakun, president of the Thai Textile  Manufacturing  Association, said the 30 per cent decrease in sales of cotton  products around the world would affect exporters only in the  short term. Prices of imported raw cotton, of which Thailand  imports 300,000 tonnes annually, have risen by 40-50 per cent  over the past two month.    Wirot said the finished-clothes industry has also been  affected. Cotton thread is currently priced 30 per cent higher  with TC thread priced 10 per cent higher as well. Cotton  clothing is expected to increase in price by 20 per cent as a  consequence.</p>

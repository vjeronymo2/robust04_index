			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWING CONCERN;  </P> <P> PRIVATE CARE FOR RETARDED -- A GAMBLE  </P> <P> It was that rare social program, promising to be both economical and humane.  </P> <P> The idea was to take thousands of mentally retarded patients out of  California's big, dismal state hospitals and place them instead in less  expensive, more homelike settings in the community.  </P> <P> But now that the program has been in operation for about two decades, it is not  at all clear how much money is being saved, and there is growing concern that  private facilities can be a lot more dangerous for patients than state  hospitals, where living conditions for the retarded have greatly improved.  </P> <P> Many parents of retarded patients throughout California are in fact fighting to  keep their children in state hospitals and out of privately-run homes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Russian Roulette'  </P> <P> "I would say generally this game of placement in the community is Russian  roulette," said John Chase, a veteran advocate for the retarded and a member of  the advisory board of Camarillo State Hospital, where his daughter is a  patient.  </P> <P> "My daughter might go to a community facility and get excellent care," said  Chase, "and she also might go to a community facility and get killed."  </P> <P> An investigation by The Times into care for the mentally retarded in California  shows that placing patients in privately run facilities can indeed be a deadly  gamble. Although many such facilities appear to provide quality care, many  others do not.  </P> <P> Licensing and court records, visits to private facilities and interviews with  officials, parents, patients and care providers show a widespread pattern of  lethal neglect, physical and sexual abuse and financial exploitation of  retarded people living in privately-run facilities throughout the state.  </P> <P> The Times found that retarded people in private facilities in California often  are housed in substandard conditions in the care of poorly paid, untrained  employees, some of whom have criminal records. The retarded residents of these  facilities sometimes are blind, deaf or crippled and so impaired mentally that  they are unable to speak for themselves or to complain. At the same time, state  and private agencies responsible for ensuring safe and proper care often are  slow to remove patients from apparently dangerous facilities.  </P> <P> For example:  </P> <P> * On Nov. 19, 1987, a retarded 29-year-old woman was discovered dead in her bed  in Sylvia's Cultural Center, a run-down home for retarded and mentally ill  clients west of downtown Los Angeles. The young woman's abdomen was so swollen  that investigating officers mistakenly thought she was pregnant. She had died  of peritonitis in what state licensing officials say must have been an  excruciatingly painful death. Her bladder -- diseased by a neglected infection  -- had burst and filled her abdominal cavity with poisonous fluids, according  to official reports. Lois Maria Miller, manager of the home, said the victim  was seen by a doctor every month and denied that there was neglect. Some  patients were removed from the home a month later and the license of the  facility was suspended last May.  </P> <P> * El Rancho Calimesa, a facility for cerebral palsy victims and the retarded in  San Bernardino County, faces a hearing before a state administrative law judge  into charges by the state Department of Social Services that the brother of a  former staff member sexually molested a patient in the home on July 10, 1987,  and that "on numerous occasions" the former staff member "threatened clients .  . . with a gun to their heads as a method of controlling behavior" and used a  gun to threaten other staff members into bringing him drugs and alcohol. The  home is still operating.  </P> <P> * A retarded woman gave birth to a baby while in a bathroom of the Lois L.  Jones Family Home in South-Central Los Angeles in January, 1986, according to  police and licensing reports. The infant was drowned, apparently in the toilet,  and was left outside in a trash can, according to police and coroner's reports.  Licensing inspectors, seeking an emergency closure of the home, also said that  the memory of the proprietor was so impaired that she could not care for the  residents. Officials also complained that the proprietor's son, who has a long,  violent criminal record, was staying in the home. The license of the facility  finally was suspended in March, 1987, more than a year after the death of the  newborn child. An attorney for the state said the delay was caused by a  shortage of legal staff.  </P> <P> * In February, 1986, three retarded residents of a home near San Diego died in  a fire at the facility. Nayoma Jeannette Raleigh, manager of the home, was  accused of turning off the fire alarm a week before the blaze and was  subsequently convicted of manslaughter. David Giles, a former resident of the  home accused of setting the fire, pleaded guilty to manslaughter.  </P> <P> * A 16-year-old autistic boy in the care of the Horizon House in Long Beach  died Aug. 29, 1987, when staff members of the home allegedly delayed getting  emergency medical treatment for the youngster after he began throwing up blood,  according to state licensing reports.  </P> <P> Five days before his death, licensing inspectors had sent documents to  Sacramento seeking emergency closure of the home because of alleged neglect of  residents. Horizon House was closed by state officials 2 1/2 weeks after the  death.  </P> <P> Mark Katz, former executive director of Total Living Continuum Inc., a chain of  homes that included Horizon House, acknowledged that staff members of the home  were relatively young and inexperienced but denied that they were negligent.  </P> <P> Katz's chain of homes has gone out of business.  </P> <P> * From May to July, 1987, residents of a Behavior Research Institute home in  Orinda in the San Francisco Bay Area were beaten by a staff member who has a  criminal record of arrests for attempted murder and convictions for burglaries,  according to a complaint by state Department of Social Services attorneys  seeking revocation of BRI's license. The staff member beat one resident with a  "belt and/or a stick" and struck another resident in the face with his hand,  according to a formal state accusation. The home was voluntarily closed.  </P> <P> BRI attorney Roderick MacLeish said he does not know whether the abuse  allegations are true. He said BRI had sent the suspected employee's  fingerprints to the state for a background check as required and was not  informed of the criminal record until after the alleged beatings.  </P> <P> * A June, 1987, state licensing inspection of the Golden State Habilitation  Center for the retarded in Baldwin Park -- operated by nursing home chain Care  Enterprises -- found that despite repeated citations for poor conditions in  previous years, "clients and facility personnel continue to live and work in an  atmosphere of uncleanliness, foul odors, disrepair and roach infestations."  </P> <P> A subsequent inspection last spring resulted in 75 pages of cited deficiencies,  including allegations of neglect of patients who were unkempt and suffered from  eye and heavy nasal discharges, dozens of patients below ideal body weight,  lack of development programs, spoiled food stored in the refrigerator, lack of  a proper diet, medication errors and lack of supervision.  </P> <P> Care Enterprises, which filed for bankruptcy last spring, nevertheless reported  a profit of $34,861 on the Golden State Habilitation Center in 1987. The chain  reported making $123,272 on the facility the year before.  </P> <P> The home is still in operation.  </P> <P> "We have made significant staff and management changes," said Bill Izatt,  spokesman for Care. "We've spent a considerable amount of time and money in  correcting the problems and we now feel this facility is doing quite well and  providing quality care to our residents."  </P> <P> * In November, 1987, the International Castle Guest Home for the retarded, an  old run-down two-story house on South Avalon Boulevard in Los Angeles, was  cited by licensing officials in connection with two deaths.  </P> <P> In one case, inspectors cited the home operator after staff members of the  facility allegedly failed to administer proper first aid or promptly call  paramedics when a 48-year-old retarded male resident choked to death on a steak  bone Sept. 11, 1987. The citation carried no fine.  </P> <P> Bessie Anderson, operator of the home, maintains that all her staff members are  properly trained in first aid and had promptly summoned paramedics.  </P> <P> The previous April 2, a 52-year-old severely retarded male resident of  International Castle was hospitalized at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical  Center with multiple fractures after being hit by a car, according to state  inspectors. On April 22, he was released back to the home and six days later he  was readmitted to the hospital in a comatose state, according to a coroner's  report. He died April 30 of sepsis caused by his infected car accident wounds  and complicated by pneumonia, according to the coroner's report.  </P> <P> Licensing inspectors indicated that the hospital may have released the resident  back to the home prematurely and cited the home for admitting a patient in a  condition that the staff was unqualified to care for. The citation carried no  fine.  </P> <P> "We did not admit him," Anderson said. "They brought him, left him on the porch  and took off. . . . We got him back to the hospital as soon as we could." The  home is still in operation. Anderson maintains that "there was quite a bit of  repair done on that facility."  </P> <P> Anderson also operates a larger facility on South Main Street that houses 33  retarded residents, some of whom are severely handicapped physically as well as  mentally impaired and some of whom are blind.  </P> <P> The facility -- a cluster of run-down apartments with walls covered by gang  graffiti -- was cited last March with 18 pages of licensing violations,  including general disrepair, broken-down furniture, inoperable lamps, a toilet  with no seat and rodent droppings on food storage shelves. Anderson refused  comment.  </P> <P> The home is still in operation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lanterman Act  </P> <P> The list of such conditions and occurrences goes on and on throughout the  state.  </P> <P> This was not the way it was intended to be, of course.  </P> <P> California's Lanterman Mental Retardation Act, adopted in 1969 and regularly  amended since then, provides that mentally retarded people have the right to  treatment in "the least restrictive" setting possible.  </P> <P> The subsequent reduction in the number of mentally retarded patients in state  hospitals paralleled the "deinstitutionalization" of the mentally ill.  </P> <P> But when mentally ill patients were released from state hospitals, relatively  little in the way of community care was provided for them, and many former  mental patients joined the ranks of the homeless wandering city streets.  </P> <P> Deinstitutionalization of the retarded, on the other hand, helped to create a  more than $400-million-per-year private care industry in California funded by  state and federal dollars -- at least in part because parents and other  advocates on behalf of the retarded are better organized and politically more  effective than those of the mentally ill.  </P> <P> At the same time, a bewildering -- and, according to critics, frequently  unresponsive -- bureaucratic web of state and quasi-official agencies evolved  to develop and oversee programs and care for the retarded.  </P> <P> The new bureaucracy created its own jargon. The term deinstitutionalization was  scrapped in favor of normalization and the term developmentally disabled was  used to describe the patients -- who were called clients. At the same time, the  state hospitals that served these clients became developmental centers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 81,000 Californians  </P> <P> More than 90% of the 81,000 people in California categorized as developmentally  disabled suffer from some degree of mental retardation, although the term also  includes victims of cerebral palsy, epilepsy and autism.  </P> <P> The Department of Developmental Services is in charge of care for the  developmentally disabled and contracts with 21 private nonprofit agencies known  as regional centers located throughout the state. The regional centers, in  turn, contract with private operators -- both for-profit and nonprofit -- to  provide care and programs for the clients. The regional centers then place  selected clients in these community facilities -- ostensibly selecting the  program best prepared to meet a client's needs.  </P> <P> Not all the clients living in community care homes came from state hospitals.  Many came from their own homes, where 57% of the state's developmentally  disabled people live.  </P> <P> Still, the number of developmentally disabled patients in state mental  hospitals was reduced by half during the last 20 years, dropping from 13,355 in  1968 to 6,818 in 1987. More than 24,000 developmentally disabled people live in  privately run facilities in California. More than 12,000 of these patients live  in homes housing six or fewer residents. Another 6,700 live in larger homes,  and about 4,500 others live in facilities that provide medical care, some of  which are large institutional-style complexes resembling nursing homes.  </P> <P> The state pays private home operators from $572 to $3,493 per patient per month  for housing and care, depending on the severity of the client's disability and  the services offered by the provider.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cost Comparison  </P> <P> It is difficult to compare the cost of keeping patients in the seven  developmental centers to the actual cost of running the community care system,  including paying for the operation of regional centers, medical treatment and  all the other costs connected with private care.  </P> <P> The cost of keeping a client in a developmental center, including everything  from janitorial service to police to medical care, is $64,666 per year,  according to state figures.  </P> <P> The cost of keeping a client who needs minimal to moderate care in a private  facility is far less, but private intensive care can run as high as $41,916 per  year, plus thousands of dollars more per year in medical costs, transportation,  training programs and other expenses.  </P> <P> Studies seeking precise comparisons in cost have been inconclusive.  </P> <P> "Lots of honest-to-God research types have spent lots of years and lots of  dollars doing this task of trying to find comparability (between state and  private care costs), and most of the results have been lousy," said Roberta  Marlowe, assistant director of planning and development for the state  Department of Developmental Services.  </P> <P> As the private care system grew, something not entirely expected happened:  </P> <P> The old state hospital wards for the retarded were largely transformed.  Dormitories were broken up into smaller, more home-like living quarters. Staff  members received better training and pay. Quality treatment programs became  available. These new developmental centers have been accredited by the  Accreditation Council on Services for People with Developmental Disabilities, a  highly regarded private agency headquartered in Boston.  </P> <P> </P> <P> It's Not Nirvana  </P> <P> Despite these improvements, the state hospitals have not achieved nirvana.  Obstreperous patients frequently are tied to their beds, sedated or put in  isolation rooms. The accreditation council survey noted, for example, that a  patient at Lanterman Developmental Center in Pomona was "was in blindfold and  restraint for a period of 90 minutes on Nov. 12, 1987."  </P> <P> State health officials fined Lanterman recently for an incident in which a  staff member slapped a patient. Earlier, health inspectors accused the facility  of negligence in the death of a patient who choked on food and also cited the  hospital for neglect of some patients' hygiene, unclean conditions -- including  feces on a wall -- and inadequate staff.  </P> <P> Even so, the 1,000-patient facility appeared clean and well-run, with patients  receiving intensive training during a tour conducted for The Times.  </P> <P> Most observers of the developmental centers see no resemblance between current  conditions and the old image of state-run "snake pits." In fact, many parents  of retarded patients in developmental centers are in an ongoing dispute with  state officials who want to move their children into private care.  </P> <P> Twice each year, developmental center patients are evaluated by a team of  professionals in the field of mental retardation to determine whether the  patients might benefit from living in the community. The team examines such  factors as how independently clients are able to function and whether they are  self-abusive, assaultive or destructive. But in reality, there seems to be  little difference between patients in state hospitals and many of those sent to  private facilities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parents, Conservators  </P> <P> The Times observed, for example, profoundly retarded patients with grave  physical impairments and serious behavioral problems in both state hospitals  and private facilities.  </P> <P> The deciding difference between those transferred and those who stay in state  hospitals is often whether the patient has parents or conservators who object  to a transfer.  </P> <P> If a parent or conservator protests, the state usually backs off.  </P> <P> Gary D. Macomber, director of the state Department of Developmental Services,  acknowledged, "We haven't thus far, to the best of my knowledge, moved anyone  out (of a state hospital) where there was a significant parental objection or  conservator's objection."  </P> <P> Macomber also acknowledged that private facilities do not offer the same  consistency in quality of care that is provided by the state developmental  centers.  </P> <P> "Generally," he said, "when we have a problem and we get a (licensing) citation  in a developmental center, it's a situation where our policies are in place,  the person was trained appropriately, adequate staffing was there, but that  human being (staff member) does something incredibly stupid.  </P> <P> "I'd like to get to that point in the community," he added.  </P> <P> Even so, Macomber is a proponent of community care and pointed out that many  parents find that their retarded children make significant progress in private  facilities.  </P> <P> "We continue to believe that people ought to live in the least restrictive  environment. Developmental centers play a role in getting people ready to live  in the community," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not 'Final Placement'  </P> <P> "We don't look at developmental center placement as a final placement for  anyone. We ought to always look at the opportunities for community placement."  </P> <P> That is exactly what frightens Matthew Guglielmo and many other parents of  retarded children.  </P> <P> Guglielmo is president of the parents group at Fairview State Hospital in  Orange County, where his daughter is a patient.  </P> <P> Guglielmo's 26-year-old daughter is profoundly retarded, partially blind and  deaf. She has been at the developmental center at Fairview for more than 12  years.  </P> <P> "It's like a little Leisure World," said Guglielmo. "Fairview to me is a  delightful place today compared to what it used to be."  </P> <P> His daughter was once in a small private facility, he said, where she did not  receive proper care or nourishment.  </P> <P> But Guglielmo is 68 years old and is afraid that when he dies and is unable to  protest, his daughter might again be sent to a private facility.  </P> <P> "I'd be afraid some do-gooder would come along and say she belongs in the  community," he said. "There are . . . good facilities out there, but they are  few and far between."  </P> <P> These community care facilities are regulated by a maze of state and private  agencies that sometimes have parallel, overlapping and even conflicting  concerns.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Rife With Advocates'  </P> <P> If patients require medical care or supervision, they may be placed in homes  supervised by the state Department of Health Services, but most homes for the  retarded come under the jurisdiction of the state Department of Social  Services.  </P> <P> Each regional center also is responsible for the quality of care provided to  clients within that center's jurisdiction. In addition, there are agencies  called area boards throughout the state that are made up of citizens who are  supposed to oversee regional centers.  </P> <P> There is also Protection and Advocacy, the legal agency responsible for  protecting clients' rights. And there are public ombudsmen throughout the state  who investigate complaints regarding care in various community facilities,  including nursing homes and homes for the retarded.  </P> <P> "This system is rife with advocates," said Macomber.  </P> <P> But critics say the system is so fragmented that the responsible agencies often  don't communicate and sometimes fail to cooperate with one another.  </P> <P> The state Department of Social Services has the authority to close facilities  that it licenses, and each regional center has the authority to remove clients  from homes within its area of responsibility.  </P> <P> These agencies often are at odds. Frequently, Social Service officials seek  revocation of licenses of homes in which regional centers continue to place  clients.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Different Perspective'  </P> <P> "We have a different perspective," said Gail Sass, associate director of the  Harbor Regional Center in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> "They (Social Services) tend to think the most difficult clients we have don't  belong in community facilities," she said. "I think we have a somewhat basic  philosophical commitment that developmentally disabled clients have the right  to live in the community and take risks rather than live in the state  developmental centers."  </P> <P> But Fred Miller, chief of community care licensing for the Department of Social  Services, believes that regional centers should take more responsibility to see  that homes for the retarded are adequately staffed and administered.  </P> <P> He also contends that regional center officials, who are responsible for making  regular progress reports on individual clients, are in a better position to  spot dangerous conditions in homes than licensing officials who might make only  one visit a year.  </P> <P> "I think there has to be a shared responsibility," he said. "And the placement  agency is certainly there (in the homes) more often than community care  licensing (officials)."  </P> <P> In addition, parents and other critics frequently complain that regional  centers often are reluctant to remove clients from poorly run homes because  facilities for difficult to handle clients are scarce and because regional  centers are guided by the state mandate of keeping as many clients as possible  in community care rather than in state hospitals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Vested Interest'  </P> <P> "The regional center does placement, monitoring and pays the bill," said the  head of a citizens' area board, who asked not to be named, "so they definitely  have a vested interest in keeping people in placements that may not be  appropriate, because there may not be another (community facility available)."  </P> <P> But regional center officials argue that it is often preferable to work with a  home operator to improve a facility than it is to remove clients.  </P> <P> The South Central Regional Center came under heavy criticism from the area  board and the state Department of Developmental Services in 1987 for allegedly  failing to monitor conditions in group homes where cases of severe neglect and  at least one death occurred.  </P> <P> Under threat from the state of losing its contract to operate, the regional  center subsequently reorganized its administration and board of directors.  </P> <P> "South Central has improved," said Developmental Services chief Macomber, "but  it still has a long way to go." In the end, with all the advocates for the  retarded, enforcement of standards in homes for the retarded usually comes down  to licensing officials of the Department of Social Services.  </P> <P> Critics say the process of revoking a license is dangerously slow, and some  licensing inspectors complain that the system of fining operators for  violations is ineffective.  </P> <P> For example, under the state Department of Social Services enforcement system,  home operators are allowed to simply correct dangerous conditions after being  cited, without paying a fine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Temporary Repairs  </P> <P> "You can cite over and over and over for the same violation," said a license  inspector who spoke on condition of anonymity. "As long as they (temporarily)  fix the violation, they'll never be fined. I could literally go to the same  place once a month and cite the same violation."  </P> <P> When fines are levied for uncorrected violations, the state must go to court to  collect them if the operator doesn't pay.  </P> <P> Miller, chief of Social Services licensing, argues that citations are meant to  prod operators into correcting poor conditions and that for serious violations,  such as physical or sexual abuse, the remedy should be closure of the facility,  not fines.  </P> <P> Miller said that a facility in which abuse occurs could be closed within a day,  under emergency procedures, but that usually much more time -- frequently  months -- is needed to gather evidence for such an action, and that revocation  of a home's license can take years.  </P> <P> In addition, say state officials, the closure of allegedly dangerous homes and  the relocation of residents is sometimes delayed because there is a shortage of  facilities for the developmentally disabled and because sometimes parents  resist the relocation of their children.  </P> <P> Many advocates for the retarded -- such as the Greenline Parent Group at  Camarillo State Hospital -- believe that uniform quality of care for the  developmentally disabled could be provided in community settings if the state  operated the homes and provided trained, well-paid staff members.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'System Is Unstable'  </P> <P> "The state has really abdicated its responsibility in not taking a larger hand  in operating these community facilities," argued John Chase, a member of  Greenline.  </P> <P> "The community system is unstable," he continued, "because they pay minimum  wages and have no career ladder to offer people. They (staff members) just stay  until something else comes along."  </P> <P> Macomber says state-run community care facilities is an "option," but he is  cool to the idea.  </P> <P> Macomber is instead hoping to improve the quality of care in private facilities  in the future by hiring the Accreditation Council on Services for People with  Developmental Disabilities in a pilot project to see if the accreditation  process used to improve state hospitals can be applied to private homes.  </P> <P> In the meantime he is banking on better quality of care through a project  called the Alternative Residential Model, which is already in operation in  selected regional center areas and is expected to be in effect statewide by  January, 1991.  </P> <P> Basically ARM, as it is called, provides more money to home operators and  demands standardized documentation of quality of care criteria, monitored by  regional centers.  </P> <P> But there have been client deaths of a questionable nature in ARM homes.  </P> <P> And, not surprisingly, there is some skepticism in the field that Macomber's  plans will solve the community care problems.  </P> <P> In a letter this fall to the department, the Greenline Parent Group  acknowledged that the ARM and accreditation projects are "a step in the right  direction" but added that "the step is too short and too slow."  </P> <P> "When the helpless suffer," says the letter, "the able must not delay relief."  </P></p>

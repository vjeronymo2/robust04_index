			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 28 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Nicaraguan  Government has appealed to six former Nicaraguan "contras" who  today peacefully occupied the Colombian Embassy in Managua,  urging them to leave the building and "make use of legal  procedures to demand" their claims.    A group of former "contras" led by Luis Arguello, alias  "002," entered the diplomatic mission at 0945 (1545 GMT) and  immediately requested political asylum because they fear for  their lives.    Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal, through a press  release, said that in this country "there is no need for  political asylum," adding that this incident displays a  misguided position (on the part of the former "contras").    Leal stressed: "During Violeta Chamorro's government, in our  country there are no, nor will there ever be, politically  persecuted individuals." In addition, the head of Nicaraguan  diplomacy said the occupants of the Colombian Embassy "can  perfectly well leave" the site and make use of all media and  every legal means to present their demands.    It was reported today from Colombia that the Foreign  Ministry  of that South American nation is studying the political asylum  request by the six former "contras" who are inside their embassy  in Managua.    With regard to the occupation of the headquarters of the  International Commission of Support and Verification of the OAS  (CIAV-OAS) by 17 former "contras," who also claim they fear for  their lives, the Chamorro government still has not made any  official statements.    The Colombian Embassy and the CIAV-OAS headquarters are each  guarded by two patrol cars and five police officers.    At the CIAV-OAS headquarters, located near the Government  Ministry Building, an unspecified number of CIAV-OAS personnel  continue to be detained by former Nicaraguan resistance members  who in the 1980's combated the Sandinist regime.    According to a Government Ministry official, talks are  continuing with leaders of the groups occupying the buildings to  find a negotiated solution to this new problem in Nicaragua.    In recent months, former "contras" and former Sandinist  soldiers have engaged in a number of occupations and protests to  demand the government's compliance with agreements on their  reinsertion into civilian life. Venezuelan, Italian, and United  Nations diplomatic facilities, as well as the Managua and Esteli  cathedrals, have been occupied on previous occasions by these  groups as part of their attempts to call the government's  attention to their demands.</p>

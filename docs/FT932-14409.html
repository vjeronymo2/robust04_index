			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Fashion for the thinly veiled rights offering: How companies are saving on ACT For the institutional investor, the thought of earning higher dividends subsidised by tax receipts is tantalising. This pleasant situation has become a reality, thanks to a structure pioneered by Barclays de Zoete Wedd which allows companies with unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax to offer enhanced scrip dividends instead of cash, offering enormous tax savings to the issuer. 'We don't object to these at all,' said the manager of one large industrial pension fund. 'It seems to us to be a transfer from the taxman to the shareholder.' However, the new twist on dividends has ominous implications for many other shareholders. The Association of British Insurers, one of the UK's most influential shareholder groups, is seeking a meeting with the Confederation of British Industry to underline its view that it does not wish to see companies habitually issuing their dividends in shares instead of cash. The ABI fears that, while corporate earnings initially get a big boost from the scrip dividends, issuers may find a few years later that they do not have enough money to pay cash dividends on the increased share capital and will have to cut payouts. 'These are like ice cream,' said one member of the ABI's investment committee. 'They glisten at first but after they've sat in the sun for a while they don't look so good.' So far, seven companies have proposed enhanced scrip dividend schemes, and most have seen their share prices rise on the announcement. The schemes are conditional on shareholders approving special resolutions, requiring a 75 per cent majority of votes cast, a permission which will have to be renewed if the companies wish to offer the schemes again next year. The scheme is only of interest to companies with unrelieved advance corporation tax. Companies pay ACT to the Revenue when they pay a dividend to shareholders; they can reclaim it against the corporation tax they pay on their UK profits. But companies which earn much of their profits overseas end up paying ACT they are unable to reclaim. Scrip dividends avoid this problem. As ACT is not payable on such dividends, companies can save tax, as well as retaining cash, if their shareholders can be persuaded to take paper. On Friday, BICC, the cables and construction group, became the latest company to offer an enhanced scrip dividend. BICC said that if half its shareholders took up the scrip offer, it would increase earnings per share for the year by 1.5p and save Pounds 12m to Pounds 13m in unrelievable ACT. Under the scheme, companies offer shareholders the choice of a cash dividend or a 50 per cent higher scrip dividend. Shareholders who take the scrip dividend can use a facility provided by the brokers to sell the new shares at a 5 per cent discount to the scrip value, free of dealing costs, enabling them to take nearly the full scrip value in cash. However, those shareholders taking the cash options will find their stake in each company has been diluted. The new stock could dilute issuers' share capital by as much as 5.5 per cent, according to Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Shareholders say they view scrip issues as a thinly veiled rights offering; effectively they are surrendering cash to take up new shares in proportion to their existing holdings. Thus, those companies with coherent strategies for investing the cash they raise have received the warmest reception from shareholders. However, if issuers were to offer the option at every dividend, it would become little more than a rolling rights issue and shareholders say they would object to constant calls for capital. Investors also say the securities can be used as a kind of fudge which allows a company short of cash to pretend it is raising its dividend when it is not. Criticism in particular has been levelled at Forte, the hotels group, which cut its cash dividend and then announced an enhanced scrip offering. 'Companies which can't afford to pay a dividend shouldn't pay a dividend and that's that,' said one shareholder. 'Otherwise the scrip dividend is nothing more than a fiddle to disguise the fact that the company has run out of cash.' 'If I want a company's shares I'll go out into the market and buy them, thank you very much,' said Ms Caroline Burton, investment director at Guardian Royal Exchange. 'In the meantime, I'd like my cash.' Historically, UK institutions have steered shy of scrip dividends. The average take-up of optional offers has been no more than 5 per cent. For one thing, tax-exempt investors, such as pension funds, have been able to reclaim an additional 25 per cent (20 per cent after the Budget) from the Inland Revenue representing the ACT due on cash dividends - something they cannot do with scrip dividends. But the new structure offers the opportunity for an enhanced dividend and allows the company effectively to raise cash by cutting its tax bill, and that has put scrip dividends in quite a different light. BAT, for instance, a company with large overseas earnings, will save Pounds 97m in ACT alone. Mr Michael Perry, assistant director at BZW, said the cash savings can be reinvested to provide sufficient returns to cover the cost of future dividends on the new shares. The extra 50 per cent on the dividend more than compensates tax-exempt funds for the loss of the tax credit, while taxpayers can gain even more, depending on individual tax positions. Some shareholders, while enthusiastic about the opportunity to cut their tax charges, view the securities with mixed feelings. Among other things, some have complained that because the enhanced dividend was in some cases announced after the ex-dividend date, there was effectively a false market in the shares. Share prices have tended to rise after companies have announced an enhanced scrip dividend scheme; so those who sold after the ex-dividend date but before the announcement could have missed out on a profit. Several institutions said they plan to take the matter up with the Stock Exchange. The Stock Exchange said that in some cases, the scrip offer had not been decided until after the dividend dates had been set. 'We didn't wish to tell the companies they couldn't issue the scrip offer,' it explained. However, it said that if shareholders expressed concern about the announcement, it would consider whether companies should be required to announce scrip dividends at the time of the ordinary dividend announcement. While enhanced scrips are enjoying a burst of popularity now, that may be shortlived because the tax structure which gave rise to their creation is about to be scrapped. The March budget proposed a new 'foreign income dividend' scheme which might get around the ACT problem faced by companies with a high proportion of overseas profits, the very companies for which the scheme is interesting. For investors, the question is whether the short-term gains offered by enhanced scrip dividends are overshadowed by their detractions in years to come.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    THE EFFECTS OF SCRIP DIVIDENDS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Assuming 100% take up  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Dividends                 ACT saving                    (pounds million)          (Pounds million)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BAT                    334.7                      97 RTZ                      135                      39 Costs Viyella             24                       7 Ladbroke                  68                      20 Forte                     39                      11 Redland                   80                      23 BICC                      44                      13  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: BZW  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Imro gives boost to new watchdog Another change in the structure for regulating retail financial services announced yesterday should give further impetus to the setting up of the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect the private investor. Imro, the self-regulatory organisation for the investment management industry, said it was reducing its scope to cut down the overlap between organisations that could be regulated by it instead of by the PIA. It estimates that about 40 of its 1100-member firms fall into this category. The arrangements remove the option of staying with the existing regulator from some members of Imro. Instead, they will have to choose between joining the new regulator - the more likely course - or insisting on exercising their right to be regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog.</p>

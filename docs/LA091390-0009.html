			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIGOTRY WATCH;  </P> <P> UNFAIR WAYS  </P> <P> It is to be hoped that the decision of the Augusta National Golf Club to admit  its first black member will inspire the oh-so-white private country club world  of the United States of America to swing open its doors more widely.  </P> <P> But hope is just about all anyone has to lean on.  </P> <P> Shoal Creek Country Club, you may recall, agreed to accept its first  African-American under the less than graceful circumstances of a $2-million  advertising walkout by major corporations from the network telecast of the PGA  Championship there.  </P> <P> Since then, three of golf's governing groups issued new guidelines requiring  clubs that want to host approved tournaments to prove that their membership  practices do not discriminate against minorities -- or women.  </P> <P> That clarion call prompted two major private golf clubs -- one in St. Louis and  the other near Chicago -- to withdraw as hosts of planned PGA events.  </P> <P> Even the Augusta Club is likely to hear the applause of no more than one hand  clapping. Its decision was triggered when the corporate sponsors of next year's  Masters -- held every year at Augusta, Ga. -- threatened to pull out. The  sponsors are The Travelers Companies and Cadillac.  </P> <P> Faced with the reality of this sorry overall performance, every male American  -- i.e., the subgroup that constitutes the vast bulk of private golf club  membership -- needs to examine his conscience with some care and determine  whether continued membership in his club, if it is discriminatory, is worth the  moral erosion of his soul.  </P></p>

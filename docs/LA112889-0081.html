			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METALS;  </P> <P> GOLD DECLINES IN A ROUND OF PROFIT TAKING  </P> <P> The price of gold, which soared last week to a high for the year, suffered a  setback Monday in a round of profit taking -- but analysts remain optimistic  that the precious metal will soon resume its rise.  </P> <P> In lively trading on the New York Commodity Exchange, gold futures closed  Monday with losses amid heightened worries about the political upheaval in  Eastern European countries.  </P> <P> "Gold had six days of consecutive increases, and, on the seventh day, the  market needed a rest," John Brimelow of Keane Securities said.  </P> <P> Gold futures settled $5.20 to $6.10 lower, with the contract for delivery in  December down $5.20 at $414.10 an ounce.  </P> <P> "It's all profit taking that is long overdue, and traders are capitalizing on  the lower prices," said George Nickas, a trader at Geldermann Inc.  </P> <P> Gold leaped $25 an ounce last week and hit a 1989 high of $419.70 Friday,  eclipsing the previous high of $413 an ounce set in January, as investors  snapped up the metal for its safe-haven status, wary of the economic impact of  continuing East Bloc upheaval.  </P> <P> A weaker dollar last week also boosted the price of gold, which is seen as a  solid investment in times of economic or political uncertainty.  </P></p>

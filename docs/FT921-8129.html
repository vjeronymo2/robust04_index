			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Philippines 'opportunity' for miners THE PHILIPPINES offered some of the world's best exploration opportunities because there had been so little mineral exploration in the past decade, said Mr Tony Robbins, a Western Mining Corporation exploration manager, yesterday. Even though the country was very well-endowed with copper, gold and other minerals, it had been left behind when the rest of the world was experiencing a gold-driven exploration boom. This presented mining companies with 'a window of opportunity which no longer exists in many parts of the world'. The Philippines had missed out mainly because of the political instability associated with President Marcos's removal from power. Mr Robbins said there had been no systematic, grass roots exploration since the early 1970s since when significant advances had been made in technology. He was speaking at a seminar in London on to mining opportunities in the Philippines and organised by the United Nations' Department of Technical Co-operation for Development, and Mining Journal. Mr Robbins said that, despite the lack of recent exploration activity, the country remained among the world's big metals producers, ranking eighth in gold, tenth in copper and sixth in chromite. The country also had deposits of nickel, iron, lead, zinc, platinum, manganese, molybdenum, cobalt, aluminium and mercury. However, although Western Mining was exploring in the Philippines in preference to Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, there were disadvantages. Most important was that it was enshrined in the constitution that Filipino companies had to be 60 per cent domestically-owned. 'The result is that in the Philippines the foreign investor has to carry all the risk and all the costs and only receive 40 per cent of the prize if the exploration is successful,' he said. However, a strong body of responsible opinion in the country recognised the detrimental impact of the ownership rule and he hoped the new government would change it after the May elections.</p>

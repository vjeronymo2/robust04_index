			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / European puzzle still unsolved: There is no clear or simple message to be derived from the fragmented results of recent elections 'Men wiser and more learned than I have discerned in history a plot, a rhythm, a predetermined pattern. These harmonies are concealed from me' - H A L Fisher, in the preface to his History of Europe (1936). 'No generalisation is ever absolutely true, and neither is that one' - Anon. The cartoon on the front page of Le Monde summed it up best. It showed Mr John Major on his soap-box, giving the victory sign. President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl stand by with black eyes and bloody noses, holding the empty ballot boxes from their regional elections. 'I told you, Helmut,' Mr Mitterrand is saying, 'never expect solidarity from the Brits'. The British election result makes nonsense of any attempt to discern a clear pattern in current European politics. If there had been a hung parliament, with 'fringe' or 'protest' parties holding the balance of power, it would have been so easy to depict Britain as afflicted by the same 'malaise' as France, Germany and Italy. There would have been the same dilemmas - whether to build coalitions or to soldier on with a minority government, daring the other parties to vote you out - and the same accusations about unholy alliances, secret deals, or nods and winks to obtain the support, or at least the abstention, of parties supposedly beyond the pale of respectability. As it is, Britain has to be treated as an exception to any sweeping generalisation about 'the fragmentation of political systems' or 'the crisis of the traditional governing parties'. At best it may, with the Labour party's fourth successive election defeat, be taken as an example of 'the crisis of the left'. That there is such a crisis no one can dispute. As Stanley Hoffmann, a veteran American observer of European politics, put it in an interview with the International Herald Tribune: 'Nowhere do socialists do very well. They have not recovered from the general loss of faith in a traditional dirigiste, welfare-state approach, and they haven't been able to find a substitute.' It should be noted that the crisis of social democracy antedates the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union. It was already clearly visible five years ago. The whole story of the 1980s was that of a revolt against excessive taxation and regulation, a dismantling of traditional social democratic policies even though carried out in some countries (notably France and Spain) under nominally Socialist governments. So it is no good west European socialists complaining that they have been unfairly tarred with the brush of Soviet communism. They have been, in some cases, but that is not the main reason for their discomfiture. The end of the Cold War has helped to destroy the familiar framework of party politics, especially in countries like Italy, and to a lesser extent France, where the Communist party had been a central feature of that framework since 1945. Together, these two phenomena have undermined the traditional left-right polarisation which gave post-war European politics its essential shape. At its simplest, this meant you voted for a left-wing party if you wanted action by the state to produce a more egalitarian society, and for a right-wing party if you feared that such action would encroach unacceptably on your personal freedom. To that extent, the British election should perhaps be seen as a last gasp of the old politics rather than an example of the new, because it was still essentially about the old left-right issue. The Labour party was still putting forward the old social democratic recipe, albeit in a much watered-down form, and fear of the consequences of this proved, in the end, strong enough to give the Conservatives a working majority. In other countries, the right, deprived of a credible left-wing bogeyman, has begun to fragment. The governing Christian Democrats lost ground to more radical right-wing parties in the German Lander elections, and to regional protest parties in the Italian general election. In the French regional elections, the mainstream conservative opposition did not benefit as it might have expected from the Socialist party's debacle, the stray votes going instead to the far right Front National, to rival ecology parties, and to local candidates. Clearly voting systems had something to do with this. Britain's first-past-the-post system makes it peculiarly difficult for minority parties to win seats, unless (like Plaid Cymru or the Ulster Unionists, or in Scotland the Liberal Democrats) their support is heavily concentrated in a small number of constituencies; and voters are naturally reluctant to waste their votes on candidates who stand very little chance of being elected. If last week's election had been held on a proportional system with party lists, like those on the continent, a more politically 'fragmented' Britain would almost certainly have emerged. It is certainly striking that in the French cantonal elections, held at the same time as the regional ones but on a two-ballot single-member-constituency system, only one seat out of 2,000 was won by the Front National, and only four by ecology candidates, while the mainstream conservative opposition won a comfortable majority of the votes cast (53.75 per cent). So it is premature to conclude, even on the Continent, that the crisis of the left has produced a general crisis of the right. France still lacks a single powerful conservative party capable of dominating the political scene as the Tories do in Britain or the Christian Democrats in Germany and Italy, but that is an old problem. So long as they can work together, Gaullists and Giscardiens do provide a credible alternative to the Socialist government, and they can be pretty confident of winning an overall majority in the next parliament now that the use of a proportional system to elect it has been ruled out. It is where conservatives are already in power, but socialists no longer offer a credible alternative, that the dangers of fragmentation seem most acute, especially if proportional voting systems continue to be used. The test year for Germany will be 1994, when there will be elections for the Bundestag, the European parliament, and for many state parliaments as well. For that year, Mr Gerhard Frey, leader of the German People's Union (DVU) which broke through into the Schleswig-Holstein state parliament last week, is promising 'a breakthrough on the widest front'. But he may be deluding himself. The far right is itself fragmented, with Mr Frey and Mr Franz Schonhuber, whose Republican party made an even more spectacular breakthrough last week in Baden-Wurttemberg, never missing an opportunity to put each other down in public. Even united they would be far from certain of reaching 5 per cent of the national vote, which is required for representation in the Bundestag. In Italy, some similar modification of the proportional system may be adopted before the next elections. But whether that happens or not, it is much too soon to write the epitaph of Christian Democrat dominance. Although the Christian Democrats have fallen below 30 per cent of the national vote for the first time since the war, the much worse fragmentation on the left has widened the gap between them and their nearest rival, the ex-Communist party, making it less than ever imaginable that any government could be formed without them. Perhaps the most striking feature of Europe's political fragmentation is that the picture itself is fragmented. Generalisations break down as soon as one examines each country's circumstances in detail. Even the superficially similar results in France, Germany and Italy are less similar than they look. In Germany, the main beneficiary of the government's unpopularity is the far right; in France the far right shares the spoils with ecology parties with which it has nothing in common; in Italy the neo-fascist vote went down, and it seems too facile to lump together the devolutionist, pro-European Lombard League with xenophobic nationalist parties like the Front National or the Republikaner. Nor should one forget those European countries which have not held elections this year. Neither in Spain nor in the Netherlands is there a sense of political crisis, or any sign that the extreme right is about to make a breakthrough. In the Netherlands, it is business as usual, with friction between the Christian Democrats and their Labour coalition partners. In Spain, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the 'Socialist' prime minister, adopts more and more draconian anti-socialist policies and is more or less reconciled to losing his overall majority next year, but expects to remain in power by forming a coalition with a powerful regional bloc (probably the Catalans). If there is a European 'malaise', no doubt recession and unemployment are important factors in it. Clearly there is concern about immigration in many countries, and that is usually associated with unemployment, housing shortages and high crime rates. Unemployment is indeed unacceptably high (8.9 per cent in 1991) throughout the Community, but it was higher still in the mid-1980s (10.8 per cent in 1985). Moreover, the countries with the highest rates, Spain and Ireland, are not the ones most obviously suffering from political malaise, still less those where immigration is a burning topic. (Spain has dealt with the problem simply but effectively by providing road signs in Arabic, pointing the way to France.) Economists can make out a case, without much difficulty, that growth throughout Europe is being held back by high interest rates, which in turn are dictated by the Bundesbank in its efforts to contain domestic inflation. Thus we are all paying the price of German unity, through the European exchange rate mechanism. That would be a good reason for political malaise, and may partly explain the second thoughts about agreements made at the European summit at Maastricht last December being expressed in some countries. But no party made this a main theme of its campaign in any of the recent elections, and there is no evidence that the connection has yet been understood by voters. If the recession continues it is unlikely to escape them much longer. The worst of the malaise may well be yet to come.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Japanese reforms under threat as Hosokawa quits: Fragile coalition hit by further allegations of financial impropriety Leaders of Japan's coalition government will try again today to find a successor to Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, whose resignation yesterday as prime minister threatens the country's planned political and economic reforms. He quit after allegations of financial impropriety, made by the opposition Liberal Democratic party. The allegations had fatally damaged his image as an anti-corruption campaigner, on which he was elected eight months ago. Mr Hosokawa lamented that he was leaving at a 'critical' time for the country, which faces difficult decisions on economic policy and its trade relationship with the US. 'The situation surrounding Japan-US ties requires urgent action,' warned Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister for international trade and industry. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister and joint founder of the conservative Japan Renewal party, emerged last night as a possible candidate, but there may be several more days of haggling before the seven-party coalition can reach agreement. The resignation sets back attempts to introduce a more open style of democracy and could further frustrate the US as it seeks better access for imports. The Nikkei 225 index fell 370 points as reports began to circulate that Mr Hosokawa's resignation was imminent, but it rebounded to finish 44.01 higher on the day at 19,934.99. The yen was sold heavily, falling to a low of Y105.85 against the dollar, but recovered to close in London at Y105.21, slightly below Thursday's close of Y104.82. Mr Hosokawa's resignation signals another round of realignment among Japan's shifting political groups and represents a tactical kill for the LDP, which has been seeking revenge for its election defeat last summer after 38 years in power. Mr Hosokawa was Japan's fifth prime minister in the past five years and the third during that time to resign because of a personal scandal. The LDP had boycotted the current year's budget for the past month, putting pressure on the prime minister to disprove suspicions of wrongly accepting an undeclared Y100m (Pounds 658,000) loan to fund a political campaign, and covering up a share purchase for tax reasons. Mr Hosokawa denied the allegations but decided to resign late on Thursday night after discovering another, separate problem, over investments made on his behalf since 1981. He disclosed no further details. A grim-faced Mr Hosokawa yesterday took 'moral responsibility' for the budget blockage and regretted having to resign at a time when Japan was in a 'critical situation'. Only two days ago, Mr Hosokawa called a midnight press conference to deny two independent MPs' suggestions that he had joked with them about quitting. Mr Hata, the only member of the cabinet with ministerial experience, maintained last night he would rather operate behind the scenes than be prime minister. Mr Hata has the support of the conservative wing of the coalition, including his own JRP plus Komeito, the Buddhist-backed Clean Government party, and the assent of the moderate wing of the SDP. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, SDP chairman, said his party would co-operate with a coalition consensus on a new prime minister. Mr Michio Watanabe, an LDP faction leader and former foreign minister, was seen as a possible alternative candidate.

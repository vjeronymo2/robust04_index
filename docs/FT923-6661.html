			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / International Company News: Honda falls 26% as weak markets take their toll SLUGGISH car sales pushed consolidated pre-tax profits at Honda Motor, the Japanese car maker, down by 26 per cent to Y34.18bn (Dollars 270.24m) in the first quarter of the financial year, which ended in June. Sales, which includes motorcycles and other products, declined from Y1,149.6bn to Y1,111.9bn, owing mainly to weak markets in the US and Japan. Honda's performance in North America was particularly bad, with car sales off by about 20 per cent to 203,000 units. The company said it had been hit by tough competition from Ford, General Motors, and Toyota, all of which gained market share at the expense of other Japanese makers. Honda also said it was hurt by the economic troubles in California, where it has a high concentration of sales. In Japan, Honda's sales declined by 11 per cent to 168,000 units. Total revenues from car sales fell by 5.3 per cent to Y897.1bn, while unit sales were off by 10.9 per cent to 466,000 vehicles. Unit sales of motorcycles rose by 6.4 per cent to 892,000 units, while revenues grew by 6.4 per cent to Y149.9bn. Net after-tax earnings declined from Y21.35bn to Y16.52bn. In spite of the poor performance, Honda said yesterday it expected to meet its net profits forecast for the full year of Y60bn, a 7.4 per cent decline compared with last year. SANYO Securities, a second tier Japanese securities house, yesterday said it was considering asking its leading creditors for additional financing, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The move comes at a time when the slump in Japanese share prices and low volumes on the Tokyo stock market are hurting revenues at the smaller Japanese brokers. Many Japanese brokers are expecting heavy losses for the interim term to September. Sanyo said it had made a pre-tax loss of about Y9bn for the three months to July, excluding depreciation costs. Sanyo said it would ask Daiwa Bank, Bank of Tokyo and Nippon Credit Bank for loans to boost its cash flow. The broker also said it was currently planning a restructuring programme including the closure of its 12 domestic branches.</p>

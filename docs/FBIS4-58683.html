			<p>BFN     [Text] The Central Security units in Aden City (?mounted) a  (?surprise) rocket and artillery attack that was aimed at Aden  international airport. That coincided with another treacherous  attack launched by brigades of the Republican Guard and the  Central Security against the Martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade, as well  as an attack launched by units of the 2d Armored Brigade,  stationed in (al-Kibsi) Camp, in Lahij Governorate against the  command of the southern operational axis and the Bakil Air Base.    In the early hours of this morning, the situation was  finally  settled by the Central Security units and the military police in  Aden Governorate, and the situation was completely controlled  after large numbers of those forces joined, despite the fact  that (?executive) al-Ahmar family in Sanaa tried to use them to  strike at the homeland, unity, and democracy. Forces also  joined the ranks of our valiant armed forces, while others  surrendered. Sporadic battles are still going on with some  pockets of the 2d Armored Brigade after some troops surrendered  and others joined the ranks of the units of the southern  operational axis.    In Dhamar, units of the Martyr Ba Suhayb Brigade managed,  after waging fierce battles and rare heroisms and deluged by  various combat acts, to resolutely confront and completely foil  all the intensive attacks and campaigns carried out by the  forces of apostasy, treason, and conspiracy. They retreated  under the effect of the [word indistinct] precise strikes to  rear positions. Some turned back, defeated. [passage indistinct]    In al-Dali' axis, a battalion from the Martyr 'Abbud  Brigade,  supported by crowds of valiant citizens from the sons of the  areas, managed to stop an attack from several directions in  which various types of heavy weapons, armored vehicles and  artillery were used in an attempt to penetrate inside the former  border areas. Our valiant forces, through the steadfastness of  the masses, managed to destroy 15 tanks and other losses are not  yet known. The battles are still most intensive in this area  which is at present under intensive artillery shelling of  villages and populated quarters. In the Mukayris axis, units of  the 20th brigade are still continuing their confrontation  valiantly against the attacking forces that tried to direct  their strikes with various heavy weapons at Mukayris town and  the neighboring villages. Heavy losses and damage were  inflicted on innocent citizens and their property.    In another dangerous development of the military situation,  the bloody gang of al-Ahmar family, with the aim of striking at  important vital economic (?institutions) of the economic and  commercial capital Aden, embarked on launching numerous air  raids at Aden international airport and the power station, Aden  port, the radio and tv corporation building, and the Aden  refinery. However, our air defense, which is always vigilant,  was lying in wait for them and shot down three hostile war  planes. Those raids did not succeed in achieving their expected  aims, with the exception of the travelers' lounge at Aden  international airport where a number of civilians were killed  and wounded as a result of this hit.</p>

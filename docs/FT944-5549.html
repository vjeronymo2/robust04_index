			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Arts: Put not your trust in gods - Theatre Parental neglect, childlessness, rape - these are the themes of the Actors Touring Company's new production at the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith. Yet this is not a dour new play by a contemporary playwright, but Euripides' Ion. Perhaps it is not surprising then that, like its protagonist, Ion is now suddenly the focus of attention after languishing for aeons. Hard on the heels of the RSC's production comes this appealing, determinedly playful staging, which both stands and falls by its rough handling of the play's modernity. As well as the striking contemporaneity of the emotional issues it tackles, Ion has the great appeal of brevity. Euripides dispenses with most of the story before the play opens, sending Hermes on first to fill us in, so that, when the action starts, things are just reaching boiling point. Some years ago, we learn, the god Apollo raped Athens' Queen Kreousa. She, in shame, left the child to die, but he was rescued by Hermes and allowed to grow up in Apollo's temple as caretaker. Kreousa, ignorant of her child's fate, has been unable since to produce an heir for her husband, and so is eaten away by a double anguish by the time the play opens - just as she and King Ksouthos arrive at Apollo's temple to appeal for a child. Of course, they do not know, as we do, that the young man sweeping the steps is in fact Kreousa's son. And so the stage is set for an evening of ironies and misunderstandings that nearly, but not quite, end in tragedy. It has to be said that Apollo comes out of all this pretty badly. In fact, as absent fathers go, he takes some beating. First he rapes a woman, then he brings the child up in ignorance as a servant. When he does allow mother and son to meet again, he introduces such confusion that they almost end up killing one another. And when all is finally resolved and Kreousa and Ion beg him to confirm his paternity, he is too much of a coward to show up and sends his sister Athene instead. As Ion says at one point, if you cannot trust the gods, who can you trust? But then, perhaps it is the mortals' haste that throws the god's plan off course; we are left to make up our own minds. Nick Philippou's production handles Euripides' scepticism with great relish. Kenneth McLeish's jaunty, slangy translation keeps the laughs coming and pinpoints the ironies, while the production is full of funny moments. But the play's great strength is that its cynicism frames a serious, moving heart. Euripides writes with raw openness about the pain of childlessness and his three main characters are driven by yearning. Ion longs for parents, Ksouthos for a son and Kreousa, through the twists of the plot, suffers both childlessness and the anguish of having lost a child. To begin with, Shelley King's elfin faced, passionate Kreousa expresses this grief well, striding restlessly round the stage and frequently giving vent to years of suppressed pain. But by the time we reach the central reconciliation scene between mother and son, she has left herself nowhere to go. Neither she, nor the production, can change gear fast enough to give this scene the quiet intensity it deserves and needs to really move you. This is the price the company pays for its lively production. And there is a worry too about McLeish's translation: mostly admirably accessible and witty, it is sometimes so slangy that you feel the production is unnecessarily intent on convincing you that this is not some dusty old classic. But it is a staging full of lovely comic touches. Ann Firbank is delightful as Queen Kreousa's aged nurse, a feisty old party who would clearly be happier if she could get a transfer to one of the tragedies. 'God did this. He started it. Burn down his temple,' she says, rubbing her hands in outrage as she learns of Apollo's shabby behaviour. It is this affectionately playful tone that is ATC's strongest suit.</p>

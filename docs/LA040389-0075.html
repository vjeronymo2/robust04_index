			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bhopal Settlement Set Aside: India's supreme court set aside a $470-million  settlement to victims of the Bhopal gas-leak disaster until it determines the  validity of a law making the government the sole representative of all victims.  But a spokesman for Union Carbide, which owned the plant where 3,400 people  were killed in 1984, said Friday's action was not official. Justice Sabyasachi  Mukherjee said the settlement "stands stayed for all practical purposes."  Mukherjee presides over the five-judge panel hearing petitions challenging the  constitutionality of a 1985 law that made the federal government the  representative of all victims of the disaster.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL ORDERS GAZA CURFEW, SENDS WORKERS HOME  </P> <P> The army Monday imposed an indefinite curfew on 700,000 Palestinians in the  occupied Gaza Strip, and it ordered all Gazans employed in Israel to return to  the seaside area immediately, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> The army also blew up or sealed the homes of 13 Arabs in the occupied  territories who are suspected of attacking suspected collaborators and Israeli  soldiers.  </P> <P> The army command gave no reason for its orders to laborers from Gaza. It was  the first time such an order has been issued during the Palestinian uprising.  </P> <P> Many Palestinians employed in Israel prefer to spend the night near their  places of work instead of returning home, where they can be caught in  Palestinian strikes or army-imposed curfews.  </P> <P> "If people are supposed to be under curfew, they should not run around, and  that pertains to those working in Israel, too," a military spokesman said. He  said the curfew will remain in effect "until further notice."  </P> <P> The curfew order followed stone-throwing clashes in Gaza. In one clash in the  Khan Yunis refugee camp, a 40-year-old man was fatally shot in the chest, Arab  hospital officials said.  </P> <P> Thirteen Palestinians were reported wounded in half a dozen confrontations with  soldiers Monday in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said.  </P> <P> Also in the Khan Yunis camp, a 6-year-old girl was reported shot in the left  shoulder and a 50-year-old man was in serious condition with a gunshot wound in  the back.  </P> <P> Troops demolished four houses and sealed nine others to punish Palestinians  accused of attacking Israeli troops or killing suspected collaborators with  Israel, the army spokesman's office said.  </P> <P> Six of the sealed homes are in Nablus, the West Bank's largest city. The city's  120,000 residents were put under curfew to prevent protests, the army said.  </P> <P> Western nations, including the United States, have condemned house demolitions  and sealings as a violation of the right to due process because the punishment  usually comes before trial.  </P> <P> Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, army commander of the West Bank, defended it as a  deterrent.  </P> <P> "These are murder gangs, and some of them got their orders from outside to  carry out murders of people considered to be helping Israel," Mitzna said on  Israel Radio. "We will punish them severely."  </P></p>

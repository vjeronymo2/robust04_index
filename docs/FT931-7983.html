			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Tories divided on public deficit DIVISIONS among Conservatives over how to curb Britain's public sector borrowing requirement emerged yesterday as the Treasury confirmed that Whitehall departments are studying the impact of a hypothetical cut in spending of up to 5 per cent. No clear consensus was found in a survey of 106 Conservative MPs for BBC Television - although there was a slight majority of 55 in favour of tax increases. However, 80 said the government needed to take action this year to cut the deficit. Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, has written to departments as part of this year's public spending review, asking them to calculate the impact of 2 1/2 per cent or 5 per cent cuts in 1994-95 spending. His letter was described by Whitehall officials as 'routine' and no different from those sent out at the same stage during previous public spending rounds. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said on BBC Television: 'All spending departments are making sure that they have looked at the options.' However, she reiterated that the Conservative manifesto promise of real increases in spending on the health service would not be breached. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's Treasury spokesman, protested that Mr Portillo's letter 'threatens the most serious breach yet of election promises after a precise commitment from the prime minister that spending plans would not be reduced.' Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, faced conflicting calls from Tory MPs as he canvassed opinion ahead of the Budget. The BBC survey showed that among backbench Tories the most popular form of tax rise would be in VAT, which was supported by 54 MPs. An increase in National Insurance contributions was backed by 24, and a rise in income tax by 22. However, many Tories warned that an increase in income tax would jeopardise economic recovery and undermine the Conservatives' election credibility. The total of local authority job losses since the beginning of February is 18,534 in 140 authorities, a report published yesterday by Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, shows. Mr Straw said that 2,434 job losses were announced in the past week. The report is part of a Labour-commissioned monitoring exercise by the Centre for Local Economic Strategies.</p>

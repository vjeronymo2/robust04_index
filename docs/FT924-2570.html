			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC qualifies quota proposals in move to break banana trade reform deadlock EC farm officials have moved decisively this week to break the deadlock on reform of the banana trade, formally cutting adrift from a wholly quota-based proposal which has split the Community in two. In its stead, British officials holding the EC presidency have tabled a combined tariff and quota arrangement which will be debated by farm ministers on Monday. The UK compromise would involve a 20 per cent tariff on banana imports up to a quota level that has yet to be negotiated. Above this level 'very high tariffs' would be imposed - perhaps significantly higher than the 70 per cent previously discussed. The proposal calls for 'generous access' for traditional exporters, mainly from the Caribbean, and a system of import licences. The proposal follows circulation on November 20 of a British 'non-paper' on reform, and a whirlwind visit last weekend to a number of Caribbean exporting countries by Mr John Gummer, Britain's agriculture minister, to test responses to the idea. There has been mounting concern that deadlock would create chaos in January once the creation of the European single market allows free movement of goods across the Community. This is because suppliers to countries like Germany, which import cheaper 'dollar' bananas from Latin America, would be able to flood countries like France and Britain, which buy comparatively expensive bananas from former colonies, most of them in the Caribbean, under under the Lome Convention commitments. UK officials backed away from a pure tariff-based import regime, apparently convinced that this could not protect traditional suppliers with any certainty. They are confident that a combination of quotas and tariffs can protect Lome commitments, and - unlike a pure quota scheme - would not clash with obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) for tariffication of all farm trade.</p>

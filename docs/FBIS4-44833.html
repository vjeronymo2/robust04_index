			<p>Steel   <F P=102>   94WS0364D Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG/BLICK DURCH DIE  WIRTSCHAFT in German 20 May 94 p 8 </F>  <F P=103> 94WS0364D </F> <F P=104>  Frankfurt/Main FRANKFURTER ZEITUNG/BLICK DURCH DIE  WIRTSCHAFT </F>  <F P=105>  German </F> CSO     [Text] Frankfurt. With the help of a new process from the  French company Agicom, tools made out of iron, cast iron and  steel can now be cold polished. The technique is much more cost  effective than the usual [method of] polishing at a temperature  of 140. Furthermore, the manufacturer can dispense with the  strongly alkaline solvent which was previously necessary and  required special safety precautions.    The tool is immersed in a cold alkaline solution only for  cleaning. The actual bath in the polishing fluid is amazingly  brief: the process is completed in one to three minutes.  Protective rust-resistant and water repellent films can be  applied in additional steps.    The comparatively small investment costs for the  installation  of such equipment make polishing castings affordable for the  first time to small and medium-sized companies, according to  Agicom (13 rue Louis Gameray, F-06300 Nice). Smaller quantities  can also be processed at reasonable cost, because the immersion  bath always stands ready [for use] and requires less energy than  the previous, hot techniques.    In addition, the method does not require elaborate safety  measures: there is no fear of hot steam which could lead to  undesirable side reactions. Finally, it is argued that polishing  at room temperature also benefits the tools, which are easily  deformed in heat.</p>

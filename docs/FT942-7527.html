			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Observer: Tony's scoop Not many media tycoons would turn to one of their competitors when looking for a non-executive director. But then Tony O'Reilly, owner of 60 per cent of the Irish Press, is not yet playing in the first division - which may explain why he has added Ben Bradlee, the legendary editor of the Washington Post, to the board of his Independent Newspapers. O'Reilly, who sat on the Washington Post board until very recently, is one of those people who think that the Post is the greatest paper in the world. Adding the Post's 72-year-old vice- president-at-large to his board ought to give him a bit more credibility with the hacks - if not with fellow newspaper proprietor Conrad Black, who has been quoted as saying that O'Reilly can 'schmooze his way with the bankers, but there's an element of horse feathers'.</p>

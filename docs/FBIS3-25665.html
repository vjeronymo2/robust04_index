One condition, however, is that they  produce an opinion poll showing they have at least 2 percent  support regionally or nationally.    According to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), the  electoral fund -- consisting of State funds and donations from  the international community -- has been divided in two. One  half is earmarked for pre-election campaigning and the other for  parties gaining seats in Parliament afterwards.    If a party produces a petition with at least 10,000  signatures instead of an opinion poll attesting to at least 2  percent support, it will be entitled to half the full money  grant. A party standing regionally only, and showing a 2  percent or more support poll, can get a quarter of the grant. A  party standing regionally only, and showing a 2 percent or more  support poll, can get a quarter of the grant. If it can only  raise signatures -- at least 3,000 are needed for a regional  party -- it will get one-eighth of the amount.    The second half of the electoral fund has also been divided  in two, with 25 percent earmarked for parties which obtain one  or more seats (they will get equal amounts) and another 25  percent to be distributed between parties in Parliament on a  proportional basis depending on support. "In other words, the  smaller parties, while they might get the same amount as the  bigger parties initially, will end up with much less at the end  of the election process," the IEC said.    Aside from the fund, each political party is being funded by  its own donors. The ANC, in particular, is receiving  substantial assistance from foreign governments. Sources could  not give a figure for the amount in the electoral fund, but it  is expected that each voter will cost a party between R[rand]1  and R3 in campaign money. There are 22 million eligible voters.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Executive Committee of the League of the Sons  of Yemen Party has stated its commitment to all national  constants -- national unity, democracy, and constitutional  legality.    In a statement released today, the committee called the  traitor al-Bid's declaration of secession a step without any  basis in legality. In this move, al-Bid only speaks for himself  and his renegade circle, which includes certain leaders of the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. The traitor al-Bid's measures are  illegal, and the actions taken by him and his coterie amount to  national treason, the statement added.    'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri [member of the League of the Sons of  the Yemen Party who has allied himself with al-Bid] has brought  about his dismissal from the party, having turned his back on  the party's principles, rules, and bylaws. The statement  emphasized that whoever fails to safeguard his citizenship in  our united Yemen forfeits his membership in the League of the  Sons of Yemen Party. The statement called on the party leaders  and rank and file in all the Republic of Yemen's governorates to  abide by the letter and spirit of the party's bylaws and to  implement its executive committee instructions.    Meanwhile, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the Nasirite  Popular Unionist Organization, the Yemeni Unionist Grouping  Party, the Right Party, the Democratic Nasirite Party, the  National Democratic Front, the Social Nationalist Party, the  Leading Committee of the Fattah Corrective Stream inside the  YSP, the Yemeni Socialist Party faction in the (?al-Maqwin)  Governorate, the secretariat of the YSP in the Ibb Governorate,  the Yemeni Human Rights Organization, the Yemeni Council for  Peace and Solidarity, and the Disabled Society, have all  denounced this criminal move on the part of the traitor al-Bid.  They emphasized that this proclamation runs counter to the will  of the people. They appealed to national public opinion and  regional and world organizations to work to expose the plans  seeking to discredit the homeland. They made plain that, far  from mirroring the will of the YSP's rank and file, the decision  only represents the secessionist gang led by al-Bid.    They emphasized that this secessionist step is illegal and  that it violates the Republic of Yemen's Constitution on which  the entire people of Yemen are agreed. They urged all popular  forces to put up vigorous resistance to this band in the  interest of safeguarding the homeland's unity, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity.    The statement warned that any recognition of the  secessionist  regime by any country would amount to interference in the  Republic of Yemen's domestic affairs and a blatant violation of  international law.</p>

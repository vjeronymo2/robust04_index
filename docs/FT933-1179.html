			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (44): Asia the main driving force - Motors / Kevin Done looks at the reasons for the downturn in demand in the leading industrial countries THE long upward trend in worldwide new car sales has been halted first by the fall of demand in the North American market in the late 1980s and then by declining sales in Japan and now in western Europe in the early 1990s. Growth in newly developing markets has been unable to compensate for the downturn in demand in the main industrial countries. For the rest of the decade, however, the strongest expansion worldwide both in sales and production is expected to come from outside the leading traditional car-consuming regions of western Europe, North America and Japan. According to a recent study by DRI Europe, the UK-based automotive analysts, 'the 1990s are expected to be a decade of structural changes in the pattern of global car sales towards newly developing markets'. The US is already a mature market where new car sales are increasingly a function of replacement demand, and the same will be true of western Europe by the end of the decade. While the DRI report forecasts a 21 per cent increase in global car demand from 1992 to 1998, the main impulses for this growth are expected to come from South Korea, China, Thailand, Latin America and eastern Europe. The Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan) is also expected to be the main focus for growth in car production for the rest of the 1990s with output set to jump from 2.25m last year to 4.81m in 1998. In western Europe new car sales are forecast to fall by 16 per cent this year to 11.3m from 13.5m in 1992. The outlook for next year is also gloomy with the prospect of only a minimal recovery. The decline in western Europe in 1993 will be steeper than during the recession following the first oil crisis in the early 1970s. Japanese carmakers have fallen under unaccustomed pressure in their domestic market, where sales this year are suffering an unprecedented third successive annual decline. In the US fragile consumer confidence continues to threaten the pace of recovery from recession, but car sales are rising again in 1993 after four years of decline. Car sales (excluding light trucks) are forecast to rise by around five per cent to 8.79m in 1993 but will still be nearly 3m units below the 1986 peak. New car sales worldwide are expected to contract by 3 per cent to 33.02m this year, the second significant decline in the last three years. Global sales are forecast by DRI to recover next year, however, with a rise of around 5 per cent. The auto industry plays a crucial role in the world economy in terms of shaping trade flows, creating employment, contributing to research and development, and in acting as a customer for other industries. According to a study prepared for Acea, the European Automobile Makers Association, the auto industry accounts for around 21 per cent of sales of ferrous metals, 19 per cent of rubbers and plastics sales, 14 per cent of metal products and 9 per cent of basic chemicals. With the enormous growth in importance of the Japanese auto industry in recent decades, the trade balances of the three main industrial regions of the world, have been shifted fundamentally. As the Japanese automotive trade surplus more than tripled during the 1980s from Ecu13bn in 1979 to Ecu43bn in 1990, the US automotive trade deficit ballooned from Ecu7bn to Ecu35bn in the same period. The European Community's automotive trade surplus remained fairly constant at around Ecu18bn through most of this period, but the EC has a substantial automotive trade deficit with Japan, and the imbalance has been worsening significantly. According to Acea the EC automobile trade deficit with Japan was Dollars 6bn in 1991, representing some 21 per cent of the total EC deficit with Japan. The automobile deficit increased by 25 per cent last year and rose to 24 per cent of the total deficit. These large and persistent automotive trade imbalances continue to put heavy pressures on trade relations between Japan and the EC and the US. The tensions are being intensified by recession in the three regions and by the growing burden of overcapacity. Carmakers are being forced to close plants in North America, Europe and Japan, but the industry has also invested heavily in new capacity with Japanese carmakers in particular adding new production plants in Japan and in North America and western Europe. Mr Jacques Nasser, chairman of Ford of Europe, warned recently that the problem of overcapacity was 'a major strategic concern' for all carmakers in Europe. Ford did not expect new car sales in western Europe to return to the trend level of 1990/91 until the late 1990s. 'The potential for excess capacity in the mid to late 1990s will be around 7m units.' This amount of overcapacity would pose 'severe structural problems' for the European auto industry. The wave of restructuring in recent years in the world auto industry is forcing vehicle makers and automotive components suppliers to eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs. The German automotive industry alone must shed a further 100,000 jobs in the next two years according to Mr Achim Diekmann, chief executive of the German Automobile Federation.</p>

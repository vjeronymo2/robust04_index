			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BTR may sell ADS Anker subsidiary BTR, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday indicated that it was considering selling ADS Anker, its German-based subsidiary which specialises in electronic point of sale systems. In response to a question at the annual meeting in London yesterday on whether BTR should dispose of the subsidiary, Mr Robert Faircloth, BTR's chief operating officer, said: 'It is a course that we are currently exploring but at the same time we are putting management and diligence into getting the best out of the business that we can.' According to Mr Faircloth ADS Anker has sales of under Pounds 100m and is making a small profit. Mr Norman Ireland, BTR's chairman, said the company's confident view for the current financial year, first disclosed in March, had not changed. 'America and Australia continue with strong order positions in most of their markets while in the UK, orders . . . have continued to improve.' However, overcapacity in a number of sectors was affecting the company's ability to improve margins.</p>

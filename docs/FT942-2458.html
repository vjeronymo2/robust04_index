			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Approval for Swans bidder delayed The French-owned company which wants to buy Swan Hunter has still not been approved by the Ministry of Defence as a suitable contractor, with only weeks to go before the MoD's award of a refit on which the Tyneside shipbuilder's survival hinges. Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said yesterday that negotiations between Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie and the MoD on the transfer of Swans' remaining frigate contract to CMN were continuing. Swan Hunter went into receivership in May last year after failing to win an MoD order for a helicopter carrier. CMN is the only potential bidder for Swans as a going concern, but the deal is conditional on Swans winning the 18-month refit of the landing ship Sir Bedivere. It faces keen competition from other UK shipyards and naval dockyards. Receivers Price Waterhouse have said that if Swans does not win Bedivere, closure of the company and the piecemeal sale of its assets looks likely. Mr Aitken's confirmation of continuing negotiations with CMN came in a Commons written answer to Mr Steve Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend. Mr Byers said it was still unusual for a foreign company to be allowed to do MoD work. 'A degree of caution is understandable, but they've had a long period to arrive at a conclusion and the delay is causing concern,' he said. Mr Fred Henderson, bid-team leader for CMN, said agreement on the transfer of the frigate contract, discussed since March, had been reached with MoD officials on June 1, but ministerial approval was still awaited. He dismissed as 'completely, absolutely and totally untrue' suggestions in a Commons question tabled by Mr Keith Hampson, Tory MP for Leeds North West, that Triacorp, a company controlled by CMN's majority shareholders, could have business links with the regime of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. On Thursday, Mr Henderson and Mr Iskandar Safa, part of the Christian Lebanese Safa family which owns most of the shareholding of Triacorp and of CMN's parent company Soffia, met MPs to rebut any suggestion of Iraqi links. Mr Safa said yesterday that he had acted as a marketing adviser to arms manufacturers in the Middle East, but not in Iraq. 'There have never been links and there are no links,' he said.</p>

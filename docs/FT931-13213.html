			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Pit rescue plan nearly in place: Treasury ready to borrow to meet costs of new coal subsidies THE TREASURY is reconciled to having to meet the cost of a pit rescue plan through borrowing rather than passing on the bill for coal subsidies to electricity consumers, it was claimed last night. As Mr John Major interrupted his tour of India to play down reports of internal cabinet wrangling over the rescue plan, officials in London privately confirmed that an outline package is now close to conclusion. However, the details as to how many pits might be saved, and at what cost, are still the subject of debate as government business managers attempt to calculate the minimum that needs to be done to prevent another humiliating backbench rebellion. The final cost could add more than Pounds 100m to a 1993-94 public sector borrowing requirement already estimated by City analysts at about Pounds 50bn. One MP close to the debate estimated last night that, at the very least, 15 of the 31 pits earmarked for closure before the political storm broke last October would need to be kept open if the government's Commons majority of 21 was to be adequate. Speaking on BBC radio, the prime minister tacitly acknowledged that the controversy had sparked a fierce debate at the highest level of government. But he insisted ministers were united in their determination to create a 'sustainable' coal industry. 'One man's squabble is another man's discussion,' he said. Downing Street officials travelling with Mr Major said the main goal now was 'managing transition' to enable as many as possible of the 31 pits under threat to improve their productivity in such a way as to become competitive with world markets. In London, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, also hinted that a compromise deal was near. He told the BBC: 'If you give British Coal a significant period of time and subsidise them through the process . . . they may get to a point where they are competitive.' But he added: 'All these options have a price tag.' An important factor in the government's calculations comes later this week when Mr Hesel-tine is presented with the report by the Commons trade and industry select committee. The 11 MP members still have two final days of deliberations before publishing what is being seen as one of the most influential reports in recent years by a select committee. The narrow Conservative majority and divisiveness of the pits issue mean Mr Heseltine will have to adopt at least some of the committee's recommendations if he is to steer his own proposals, due for publication next month, through parliament. Discussions in the select committee tomorrow and disagreements could delay the report's publication beyond Friday, the expected date. Health row sparks further cabinet infighting Page 6</p>

A conference attended by representatives of the regional  administration, the Pacific Fleet and Far Eastern scientific  institutions was held in Vladivostok on Tuesday to discuss  technical and economic aspects of this unusual project.    Experts believe that the high quality of domestic  technologies and a guaranteed system of maintenance will ensure  full radiation and ecological safety of the population.

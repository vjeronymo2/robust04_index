			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCTORS CRITICIZE CALL FOR HALT TO SPRAYING;  </P> <P> MEDFLY: A PROPOSED RESOLUTION BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSN. WOULD NEEDLESSLY  ALARM THE PUBLIC, SOME SAY.  </P> <P> A proposed California Medical Assn. resolution calling for the immediate halt  to malathion spraying was criticized by doctors Saturday, some of whom said the  measure would cause needless public alarm and "paranoia" over a pesticide they  insist has been proven safe.  </P> <P> The comments from nearly a dozen doctors attending the CMA's annual meeting in  Anaheim at the Disneyland Hotel mark the first public opposition by members of  the association to the resolution.  </P> <P> The measure will likely go before CMA delegates for a full vote Tuesday, the  day after a 26-square-mile section of Orange and Los Angeles counties is  scheduled to be sprayed.  </P> <P> The resolution, which alleges that the state has not proven the safety of the  pesticide used in Mediterranean fruit fly eradication, was supported by two  doctors at the CMA reference committee hearing.  </P> <P> However, one by one, doctors from Orange County and around the state spoke out  against the resolution, saying the chemical mixture used in the sprayings does  not pose a health risk.  </P> <P> "The malathion is extremely weak," said Kenneth Hayes, an association member  from San Jose. "The CMA should not (get involved) in this mass hysteria."  </P> <P> Several doctors noted that a series of studies found no long-term or short-term  health hazards associated with normal exposure to the malathion mixture, which  amounts to about 2.8 ounces of the pesticide per acre. The chemical can be  toxic to some insects and fish, but state officials say it is not harmful to  humans.  </P> <P> "This issue has been discussed and decided," CMA member Roger Kennedy said.  </P> <P> If the CMA wants to get involved in the issue, one doctor suggested, it should  try to ease the public's fears about malathion by going on record as saying  that the spraying doesn't pose a health risk.  </P> <P> A similar approach was taken in 1981 in Santa Clara County when a local medical  association cooperated with state officials in attempting to allay residents'  fears about Medfly spraying.  </P> <P> The CMA does not have a formal position on malathion. When Santa Clara County  faced spraying, the association decided the issue was a "matter best addressed"  by local doctors, according to a CMA staff report.  </P> <P> "If the CMA takes action on this . . . it says the doctors of California  believe (malathion) is unsafe," said Alvin Markovitz, a member of the committee  that heard the testimony. ". . . It sends the message that malathion is  dangerous and a poison."  </P> <P> Supporters of the resolution have said the spraying should be stopped until  malathion's effects can be assessed.  </P> <P> "It's not our burden to show that it's not safe," said H. Rex Greene, the  Pasadena doctor who introduced the resolution. "The state must prove that it's  safe."  </P> <P> Greene was joined by Jerome Marmorstein, chairman of the CMA's Committee on  Environmental and Occupational Health.  </P> <P> "I'm not comfortable with it," Marmorstein said. "It's a flagrant violation of  human rights to be (sprayed) when (people) don't want it."  </P> <P> Some doctors agreed that even if the spraying is a social issue, the medical  association should not try to halt the practice if a health risk can not be  proven.  </P> <P> The committee that heard testimony Saturday will likely recommend acceptance or  rejection of the resolution when the measure is voted on by the 440-member  House of Delegates later this week. The committee can also make changes in the  statement, which calls on the 38,000 members of the association to write  letters to state officials and lawmakers calling for a halt to spraying.  </P> <P> On Friday, a top committee of CMA leaders agreed to let the resolution be  discussed at the annual meeting. Officials believe the resolution is the first  in the country to deal with malathion spraying.  </P> <P> The resolution controversy comes on the eve of another round of spraying in  portions of Brea, La Habra and Fullerton.  </P> <P> Helicopters are scheduled to fly over the area for the sixth time starting at 9  p.m. Monday, said Frank Parsons of the Orange County agriculture office.  </P> <P> A 36-mile area around Garden Grove and Westminster is scheduled to be sprayed  for the third time Thursday.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County, spraying is scheduled Monday in the Irwindale, Glendora  and Duarte areas, Tuesday in the Downey area, Wednesday in the South Gate area  and Thursday in the Pomona area.  </P></p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / In-house bid advice for civil servants CIVIL SERVANTS have been given advice on how to improve their chances of keeping their jobs when government departments face competition from the private sector. Detailed advice on how to prepare an in-house bid has been included in the revised guidance on the market-testing programme, which was published yesterday by the Office of Public Service and Science. The new guidelines reflect experience since last autumn, when Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, announced a programme to test whether some Pounds 1.5bn of government activities would be performed more efficiently by officials or by the private sector. Officials in Mr Waldegrave's department admit privately that not all departments will meet the market-testing targets set for the end of September, but say that delays arise merely from the necessary procedures rather than a lack of enthusiasm. They emphasise that departments which fail to achieve the targets by the deadline will be expected to meet them in the following months. This is in addition to proceeding with the next tranche of the programme which starts in October and is intended to cover a further Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn of government activities. Earlier this summer Mr Waldegrave had to call on Mr John Major, the prime minister, to put pressure on departments that were falling behind in the programme. The guidance was revised after discussions with departments and Civil Service unions, and also takes account of private-sector suggestions. It does not include a revision of advice to departments on the impact of regulations designed to protect the rights of workers in takeovers and mergers. This will be updated as case law develops. The application of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, which guarantee the jobs and pay of existing workers in many cases when work is contracted out, has caused some confusion in Whitehall.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Responsible political sources have expressed  amazement at statements by the so-called source in the office of  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime minister, [as heard] on the  Presidential Council decision to dismiss him from office. The  sources said that such statements come from persons who have  lost all their legitimacy and legality.    The sources said: Al-'Attas has been officially indicted by  the state's legislative bodies, led by the House of  Representatives, which presented a recommendation for a decision  to stop the activities of the prime minister -- who says that he  is being treated in the United States -- activities aimed to  serve the views of the rebels in the international arena.    The sources denied that the decision to dismiss al-'Attas  was  a reflection of disorder or was an arbitrary move, as his office  claimed. The decision came within the national responsibility  which obliges the political leadership to carry out its  constitutional duties. The sources emphasized that the war  decision was that of the adventurist Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] secessionists, who created the crisis and continued to  carry out various provocations for nine months.    On the same level, parliamentary sources have voiced  surprise  at statements by the secessionist YSP leadership on the  constitution and said that it was these individuals who ignored  the constitution and did not abide by it. They fabricated the  crisis in order to avoid the constitution.    The parliamentary sources said that the House of  Representatives has the right to withdraw its confidence in the  government if the head of this government abides by the  constitution. However, the House has the right to issue a  recommendation for dismissal if the Presidential Council does  not exercise its rights in accordance with the constitution.  The sources added: The political leadership is responsible for  implementing the constitution in accordance with Articles 105  and 112 of the valid constitution. Therefore, the political  leadership made the decision to dismiss al-'Attas and to refer  him to interrogation. The sources noted that the decision does  not need the acceptance of anyone because it is supported by the  power of the constitution and issued by the state. It is also  in harmony with the commitment to the constitution of the  legitimate leadership and its care for national interests.    It is worth mentioning that al-'Attas was one of the leading  secessionist elements in the YSP and played a serious role in  continuing the crisis and igniting the fire of war by his  conduct, which was hostile to the unity state, and his following  al-Bid, the leader of the rebellion, in their moves to escalate  the crisis politically and militarily. Al-'Attas then fled from  the battlefield with all the money he could gather, leaving the  remaining rebellion leaders to face their fate alone.</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Lloyds / Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester: City debates the value of offer to C&amp;G members While Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester members might think Pounds 500 a good price for something they did not realise they owned, the Lloyds Bank offer prompted a debate in the City over how much the building society is really worth. On the most widely used measure, the price/earnings ratio, Lloyds is getting a bargain. On the basis of C&amp;G's 1993 net profits of Pounds 132m, after provisions for bad and doubtful debts of Pounds 75.9m, Lloyds is paying only 13.6 times earnings, while shares in Abbey National, the building society turned bank, trade on 15 times historic earnings. Yet both sides of the debate argue that this is the wrong yardstick and, given the lack of market comparisons, adopt more fundamental valuations. JP Morgan, C&amp;G's financial adviser, based its valuation on a dividend discount model. Mr Terry Eccles, a JP Morgan managing director, explained: 'It is a company's long-term dividend paying capacity that really determines its value. Then you add something to give a reasonable acquisition premium.' The fundamental valuation was arrived at by taking management's five-year forecasts for growth in profits and assets, estimating the reduced capital to assets ratio the Bank of England would require of C&amp;G after converting to a bank and then calculating the excess capital it could pay out in dividends. Discounting the whole stream back to the present gives the valuation. Taking this valuation JP Morgan then compared measures such as the implied prospective price/earnings and price/assets ratios with those of a selection of banks, including Abbey National. 'The numbers were not too far out, although Abbey National was at a relative premium,' said Mr Eccles. But some analysts believe the valuation is far lower than a purchaser could afford. Mr Martin Hughes, banking analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said: 'When valuing a business you need to look at the internal generation of capital and C&amp;G is very capital generative. 'C&amp;G is likely to have retained profits of around Pounds 170m this year. So assuming 10 per cent annual growth in its balance sheet (which was Pounds 864m at the end of 1993) that leaves Pounds 90m of surplus capital.' Mr Hughes is assuming that C&amp;G's assets will have reached Pounds 1.04bn by the time the deal is concluded in 15 months, leaving Lloyds goodwill of Pounds 760m. But at that rate of generation of surplus capital, that sum would be made up in only eight years. Mr Hughes says a third party could afford up to Pounds 2.5bn, without accounting for C&amp;G's market position.</p>

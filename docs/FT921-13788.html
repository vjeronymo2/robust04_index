			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Labor poll victory leaves NSW on knife-edge AUSTRALIA'S most populous state, New South Wales, faces increased political instability after a weekend by-election defeat for the governing Liberal/National party coalition. The opposition Labor party won 55 per cent of the votes cast in the coastal seat of The Entrance, in spite of a strong campaign by Mr Nick Greiner, the state premier, and Mr John Hewson, leader of the coalition at the federal level. The result leaves Labor and the coalition with 47 seats each in the 99-member state parliament, with the balance of power held by five independents. It is unlikely to lead to an early state general election because the independents have agreed not to support a vote of no-confidence unless the government proves grossly incompetent or corrupt. However, the result will increase the government's reliance on the independents and encourage Labor to step up its efforts to force a general election or a parliamentary re-alignment. The result is also a setback for the coalition at the federal level. This used to see Mr Greiner's government as a launching pad for its campaign to oust Labor from the federal government in Canberra. The Entrance was one of 49 seats won by the coalition in a NSW state-wide general election in May. Labor took 46 seats, leaving the balance of power in the hands of four independents. The result in The Entrance was declared void after a court challenge by Labor.</p>

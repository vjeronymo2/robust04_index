			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Two years ago the special republican boarding school  named after Field Marshal Hamazasp Babajanian [Babadzhanyan], a  former Commander of the Armored and Tank Troops, was converted  into a boarding school for military training by the decision of  the Armenian Government. On October 18 the school will hold a  ceremony whereby 100 students who have passed their examinations  will take their oath to serve their homeland selflessly. Vrezh  Hovhannisian, the commandant of the [school] battalion, told the  correspondent of NOYYAN TAPAN: "The students at the school have  their own special military uniform. They specialize in military  science and physical education. The young men are trained in  judo, hand-to-hand combat, mountain climbing, swimming, light  athletics and skiing. The specialization subjects are taught by  officers and athletics instructors. Special attention is paid to  the teaching of English and Russian. In the future it is planned  to teach the languages of countries neighboring Armenia.    The school admits those 14 to 16-year-old young men who  possess the appropriate physical and mental capabilities." The  director of the school has visited a U.S. military base where he  observed first-hand the methods of training American  professional soldiers. According to the Commandant, some of the  school's graduates have entered the school of the Karabakh  liberation struggle and participated in numerous tough battles.  The school has also signed agreements with Russian military  training institutions, whereby the graduates of the school are  able to continue their education at those institutions. The  Armenian Ministry of Defense will pay for the expenses of such  continued training.</p>

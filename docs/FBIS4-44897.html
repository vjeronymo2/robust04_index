			<p>CSO     [Text]  <H5>  Conceptualization by Science and Technology Agency </H5>   Anyone would desire to have materials that can feel and  memorize changes in their environment, make judgments, and  respond accordingly. The development of these materials would be  the ultimate challenge for researchers. In fact, an R&amp;D  project  has been quietly under way to produce such materials, called  "intelligent materials."    In November 1989, the Council for Aeronautics, Electronics  and Other Advanced Technologies of the Science and Technology  Agency (STA), compiled a report titled "Promotion of General  R&amp;D  Concerning Development of New Substances and Materials Capable  of Manifesting Functions by Intelligently Responding to  Environmental Conditions" (Advisory No. 13 to Director-General  of STA). The ground work for the report was carried out by the  Material Technology Committee and the Intelligent Material  Subcommittee of the Council, and it took three years for them to  derive a new concept. In March 1989, in the middle of the report  compilation, the "International Research Forum Concerning  Intelligent Materials" was held in Tsukuba Academic New City,  and the concept was also recognized internationally. In May  1990, coinciding with the initiation of the STA project, the  Intelligent Materials Forum (IMF, President: Professor Emeritus  Toshinobu Takagi, Kyoto University) was established within the  Society of Non-Traditional Technology. With an emphasis on the  examination and propagation of intelligent materials, in April  1992, IMF sponsored the first international conference  concerning intelligent materials, to ask worldwide researchers  for cooperation. At the conference, the concept itself, the  mechanism of intelligent functions, the design (and creation and  application) of intelligent materials, and fundamental  technologies were discussed.    Three years have passed since the inauguration of the  project  and the establishment of IMF, and the concept concerning  intelligent materials appears to have been recognized not only  in Japan, but also worldwide. However, it is reasonable to  expect material development to require a considerable amount of  time, because it has heretofore never been tried.    Discussed below are examples of design approach for the  concept of intelligent materials that are actually under  consideration.  <H5>  Diversified Design Approaches </H5>   Historically, material development began with materials  themselves, which were made into structural materials.  Structural materials first became passive functional materials,  such as wear-resistant, friction-resistant, and  high-temperature-resistant materials, and then became materials  with active functions. Various approaches are under  consideration for designing intelligent materials from the  above-described historical viewpoint, i.e, the manifestation of  artificial intelligence at a material level; creation of  intelligent materials from the standpoint of material design;  incorporation of software functions into materials; creation of  materials approaching humans; and creation of materials  possessing the time base.    Here, the particular key points are the "dynamic" functions,  such as auto-restoration, auto-learning, life prediction, and  auto-decomposition, that are automatically altered in  correspondence with exterior stimuli and the time base.    For example, the phenomenon of rust formation on metal can  be  considered to be an auto-diagnostic function, and shape-memory  alloys can be defined as materials with a time-base function.  However, neither metal nor shape-memory alloys have sufficient  functions to be called intelligent materials.    On the other hand, there are materials that hint at the  steady progress of R&amp;D toward the creation of intelligent  materials: an insecticide that predicts the end of its  effectiveness by changing its color, and a biodegradable plastic  material that automatically breaks down when a certain period of  time elapses after being buried in ground.    Among R&amp;D targets in the field of structural materials,  there  are materials that communicate the imminence of the end of their  lives or abnormalities before a serious accident through color  change or noise by diagnosing the deterioration of their  internal structure and the occurrence of micro-cracks on the  surface. There are also materials that automatically repair  their flaws, e.g., by hardening the leading edge of a crack  through phase transition induced by change in stress, or by  filling a gap with a molten component.    On the other hand, as we pursue development of these  functions one after another for intelligent materials, the  materials themselves become so complex that we have to face a  new problem of how to dispose of them once they successfully  accomplish their missions. Thus, there is also a trend to  suggest the development of intelligently functional materials of  a simple composition. At any rate, there seems to be no doubt  that intelligent material development has begun with diversified  end uses and shapes.    A similar trend is also becoming visible in Europe and the  United States. In June 1994, the U.S.-sponsored Second  Intelligent International Conference is supposed to be held in  Williamsburg, Virginia. Moreover, the next conference after that  is scheduled to be held in France in 1996. Intelligent  materials, which were first proposed by Japan and whose concept  was first created by Japan, are being developed at a steady pace  with the support of other nations worldwide.</p>

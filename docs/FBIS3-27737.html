KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa took issue Monday [31 January] with a remark by the  chief government spokesman that it would be difficult to propose  income tax cuts in tandem with an increase in the consumption  tax. Hosokawa told reporters he did not understand what Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura meant when he said the two  issues should be considered separately.    Takemura made the remark Sunday at a news conference in  Takamatsu, western Japan. He said many leaders in the  seven-party coalition share the view that income tax cuts should  be implemented first. The increase in the consumption tax from  3 percent would cover revenue shortfall.    Takemura seemed to be feeling the political heat Monday  since  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii complained to him, saying he  wanted both topics dealt with as a single package. Fujii said  Takemura's remark made it difficult for him to fulfill his  responsibilities as finance minister.    Takemura tried to allay concern, telling reporters Monday  that what he meant to convey was that a general view on tax  issues had emerged within the seven-party coalition.    A government source, meanwhile, insisted on spelling out the  timing and the scale of raising the consumption tax in the bill,  saying to do otherwise would be irresponsible of the Finance  Ministry.    At Sunday's press conference, Takemura said that on  Wednesday  or Thursday the government plans to announce a comprehensive  package of pump-priming measures to lift the economy out of the  doldrums. Government sources said the business stimulating  measures will total 15 to 16 trillion yen and include 7 trillion  yen in income and resident tax cuts.</p>

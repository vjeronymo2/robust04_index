			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: Less commissions on UK equities  -There is growing concentration in a smaller number of brokers TOTAL commissions paid by British institutional investors buying UK equities dropped 15 per cent to Pounds 254m in the year to March 1993, according to a confidential market research study conducted by US-based Greenwich Associates. The study, which was released to subscribers last week and based on interviews conducted earlier this year, shows a growing concentration of equity business in a small number of brokers. Just three or four brokers dominate the market by control of commissions and on a range of assessment measures for effectiveness. The number of institutions buying equities fell from 235 in 1992 to 229 in 1993. That compares with 225 in 1991, when commissions generated totalled Pounds 245m. Of the 229 institutions, 48 per cent were each generating commissions for brokers of under Pounds 500,000 and a further 12 per cent of below Pounds 1m each. A further 23 per cent had business in the range Pounds 1m-Pounds 2.5m, and the remaining 14 per cent were of over Pounds 2.5m. Of the Pounds 254m in commissions dispersed by the institutions, 62 per cent was concentrated in those spending over Pounds 2.5m, and a further 21 per cent for those up to Pounds 1m, leaving just 17 per cent below this level. Most business was concentrated in the hands of five leading firms. Across all institutions, one-fifth of their business was placed with a single lead firm, and 71 per cent with just five firms. Among the 54 institutions generating over Pounds 1m in equity commissions, 16 per cent went to their lead firm and 63 per cent to the top five firms - up from 58 per cent last year. The most important factor in allocating commissions, at 59 per cent, was research. A further 24 per cent was determined by trading coverage and liquidity, 8 per cent from soft commission services and 2 per cent from equity derivatives. Portfolio managers were ranked most important in determining allocations, accounting for 79 per cent among all institutions and 63 per cent for large institutions. Analysts accounted for 9 per cent and 6 per cent respectively; and traders 5 per cent and 10 per cent. Among the top 15 brokers, Warburg was used most frequently by institutions for buying shares, followed by Smith New Court and James Capel. The pattern changes when looking only at the top five brokers each institution used for share purchases, which dominate so much of the market. That makes James Capel the dominant firm, with 78 per cent of institutions using it as one of the top five, followed by NatWest at 72 per cent and Warburg at 70 per cent. These same firms also had the greatest share when institutions ranked their top three firms for penetration: at 61 per cent for Capel, 51 per cent for NatWest and 48 per cent for Warburg. Among the dominant brokers used by the largest institutions, performance varies widely based on different detailed criteria. For research capability, NatWest receives the highest rating at 75 per cent, followed by Capel at 72 per cent, and Warburg, BZW and UBS jointly at 71 per cent. For sales service intensity - or frequency of calls by sales staff - NatWest is top at 75 per cent, followed by 71 per cent at Capel and Kleinwort Benson, and 70 per cent at UBS. For effectiveness of analyst service, NatWest scores 79 per cent, and Warburg and Capel 72 per cent. Capel scores highest for the frequency of contact from research analysts, at 63 per cent, followed by NatWest at 59 per cent and Warburg at 46 per cent. But judged by the effectiveness of visits and calls, NatWest rates highest at 63 per cent and Capel at 52 per cent. The next, at just 33 per cent, is Warburg. Best-written reports were from NatWest, at 63 per cent, followed by Capel and Warburg, both at 54 per cent. NatWest provided the most creative research at 51 per cent, followed by Capel 35 per cent and both Smith New Court and Warburg 33 per cent. For the quality of macro-research, all the scores are much lower. For portfolio strategy, NatWest is highest at 45 per cent, with Smith New Court second at 35 per cent followed by UBS at 34 per cent.</p>

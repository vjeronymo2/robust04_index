			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Food: A taste of Ireland in Mayfair - Two Emerald Isle gems in London NOT SO many years ago London could boast among the many oddities of the capital, an excellent Irish restaurant in Minogues, named after one of its proprietors, Ethel Minogue, who renounced an academic career in favour of cookery. The success of the tiny Islington restaurant was so great that Ethel and her partners decided to acquire a local pub and christen it Minogues Bar. Irish food was served in the pub and that too became an overnight success. Sadly, however, disputes among the owners led to the closure of the restaurant and ultimately to pub's sale to an Irish chain. Fortunately, the company had the vision to retain Ethel's services as a consultant and Minogues bar still serves good Irish food to anyone who can put up with the pub's other speciality: heavily over-amplified folk music. In their heyday, the two Minogues establishments were breaking new ground. I recall taking an Irish friend to the restaurant and him exclaiming: 'Is there nowhere like this in Dublin?' I have travelled as far afield as the Dingle Peninsula to find such an authentic Irish dish of boiled bacon and cabbage. There is good news, however, for those who regret the passing of Minogues. Since June 1991 there has been a new London Irish restaurant in Mulligans of Mayfair. Taking full advantage of its Cork Street location to lure in lingering art dealers; Mulligans combines an upstairs pub with a downstairs restaurant. The chef, Richard Corrigan, describes himself of the non-romantic school which treats the Irish culinary vocabulary with realism: after all, bacon and cabbage might be considered a little infra dig in Mayfair. If the Irish peasant tradition is to be used it has to be used inventively. First courses include some Irish standbys in Rossmore oysters from Cork Bay and Ballycotton smoked salmon. Some Crubbeens (pigs' trotters) had been pickled and deep fried; an idea which should make them more acceptable to the squeamish general public. Slices of black pudding had also been deep fried. His black pudding has earned him a considerable reputation and Irish chefs are not beyond attempting to steal his recipes. Mulligans' menu changes daily. This is particularly useful when it comes to fish, as the chef can choose from the best the market has to offer. On the night I was in there was John Dory (grilled), lemon sole (poached), haddock (smoked), and Irish salmon (roast). At this time of the year game is a big thing with wood pigeon and pheasant on offer. Among the more rustic dishes there was caramelised calves' liver with cabbage and boxty (potato cakes) and corned beef and ox tongue. Irish stew came with big pieces of lean meat rather than the usual scrag end or neck; a casserole of beef, Guinness and oysters came with the oysters quickly poached in the stock. Colcannon (a sort of Irish bubble-and-squeak) is served as a side dish. Another flexible feature of the menu is the Irish cheeses. The current revival of cheese making in Ireland makes it easy for Corrigan to serve an all Irish cheeseboard with some of the present stars such as Milleens, Cashel Blue and St Killian. It also allows him to make room for some new cheeses like the Ardrahan from Nanturk I tried that evening. Irish puddings tend to be wholesome and filling; these are no exception: treacle tart and clotted cream; rice pudding with homemade jam; lemon tart and fruit compotes. Suitably robust was the soda bread and butter pudding; very buttery with raisins few and far between. With the pub upstairs you may drink beer or stout with your meal and there is a full range of whiskeys from Irish distillers. One feature of the wine-list which will appeal to the sentimental Hibernian, is a selection of Irish wines from Bordeaux; those chateaux created by emigre Irish traders in the 18th century and which still bear the names of their first owners: Lynch, Boyd, MacCarthy, Kirwan and Barton.

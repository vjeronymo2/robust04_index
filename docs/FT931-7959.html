			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Small companies report upturn A MODEST upturn in business confidence is reported by the Small Business Research Trust in two surveys published today. In a survey for Lloyds Bank, 63 per cent of companies questioned said they were stronger or unaffected by the recession. More than half said sales had increased last year and almost as many expected sales to be higher this year. The report is the first of a series on companies in the manufacturing, retail, distribution and business services sectors. It excludes the construction sector. Only 4 per cent of com-panies said they had been weakened by the recession although it had had a strong impact on their ability to plan ahead. The second survey, for National Westminster Bank, detected signs of an end to the recession for manufacturers, wholesalers and the business services sector. It covered all business sectors and showed that sales, employment and investment levels had all recovered from their all-time lows. A special study for the survey showed that business rates had risen by 28 per cent over the past three years compared with an increase of 20 per cent in the retail prices index.</p>

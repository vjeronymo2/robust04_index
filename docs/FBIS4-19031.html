			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- France warned Russian  ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to behave himself  Tuesday [12 April] after he threw plants and clods of earth at  Jewish protestors and spat on them at a Council of Europe  session.    Zhirinovskiy also made threatening remarks inside the  Council  chamber in Strasbourg, denouncing NATO air raids against Bosnian  Serbs and suggesting Russia should bomb European cities.  [passage omitted]    In Strasbourg, Zhirinovskiy called the French warning a  "provocation" and said he was only doing his job. [passage  omitted]    On Tuesday the Union of Jewish Students in France called for  his immediate deportation.    Zhirinovskiy began the day Monday by barging in on a meeting  of liberal European legislators. They had written to him asking  him to stay away from Strasbourg because of his extremist  rightwing views.    Asked to leave the room, Zhirinovskiy berated the group as  "CIA agents afraid to have a democratic debate." He added, "I  was not invited here to drink champagne." The liberal MPs walked  out.    Later Zhirinovskiy took on a group of some 100 Jewish  students protesting outside the Russian consulate against his  visit. They yelled "Down with fascists" and "Zhirinovskiy is a  neo-Nazi."    Zhirinovskiy heckled the protesters from behind the iron  fence surrounding the consulate and then lost his temper,  ripping up plants from the consulate garden and flinging them at  the demonstrators and journalists.    He also threatened the demonstrators with his "atomic  revolver."    The Russian MP said Tuesday: "In fact I was attacked by  extremists. It was the duty of the French police to defend me  and they did not do it." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Need To Look at Question of Regional Autonomy --  Johannesburg  THE STAR in English on 16 February in a page-14 editorial  believes Mangosuthu Buthelezi is "using the Zulu king Goodwill  Zwelithini, to advance the Inkatha Freedom Party' [IFP] demand  for greater regional autonomy." The "latest ploy" is  Zwelithini's threat "to proclaim the restoration of the  independent 19th century Zulu kingdom." THE STAR notes that  secession has long been "a catalyst for war." "Buthelezi may be  raising the secessionist option to persuade De Klerk to agree to  greater power for the regions and to induce him to lean on the  ANC [African National Congress] to concur. There is a real  risk, however, that secession will acquire its own momentum and  drag South Africa into the abyss." De Klerk's response has been  to insist that Zulu demands for "`self- determination'" can be  "fulfilled within the Interim Constitution." But there is  dissatisfaction with the constitution which "extends beyond  Buthelezi and the king. They would not have been able to muster  thousands of Zulus to protest in Pretoria last month and Durban  on Monday if there was not genuine unease. For that reason it  is imperative to look again at the question of regional  autonomy."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Call for Entrenching Regional Powers -- A page-16 editorial  in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 16 February comments  on the IFP dissatisfaction with the constitution, saying "the  solution still lies in extending and entrenching regional powers  -- especially to kwaZulu/Natal and rural subregions, where they  may prove tempting to reasonable white rightwingers." BUSINESS  DAY points out that a year earlier a University of the Western  Cape academic had proposed "a Natal divided into three regions.  Buthelezi could then at least hope to win a regional poll in  northern Natal where he and the Zulu kingdom have traditionally  been based (contrary to Zwelithini's claim to the whole of  Natal)." This proposal is "worth exploring." The National  Party is "sufficiently flexible," but the ANC "may see further  concessions as distasteful. But the choice lies between this and  accepting that a new government will be preoccupied for years  with a major regional security problem, absorbing resources  which should be directed at the main priority of reconstruction  and development."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   Criticism of IFP Nonparticipation in Election --  Johannesburg  SOWETAN in English on 16 February in a page-8 editorial is  "impressed" by the respect that Zulus or members of the IFP have  for their king, Goodwill Zwelithini. However, having said that,  SOWETAN finds it difficult to understand that the king and his  people should be "so emotional about the coming elections." "We  still think the IFP and those who support King Zwelithini should  have taken part in the elections [as published]. They would  have done their standing in the eyes of the world enormous good  if they had. We have less sympathy with other members of the  Freedom Alliance, who do not have half the type of support shown  to the Zulu king in Pretoria and Durban."  <H6>  CITY PRESS </H6>   Time To Stop Talks With Right Wing -- Johannesburg CITY  PRESS  in English on 13 February in a page-14 editorial warns that the  coming election "bodes ill for us all," due to the Afrikaner  National Front's (AVF) decision to boycott the election and  their talk of a "`little bit of violence'" to stop the election.  "Now that the rightwingers have made it plain to all of us that  no matter what concessions they are given, they were merely  using negotiations to dismember the country and are prepared to  use force to achieve their goals, we must question the wisdom of  continuing talks with them."</p>

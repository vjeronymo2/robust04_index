			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE HEART AND HUMOR OF FRESNO STATE SOFTBALL;  </P> <P> COLLEGE SPORTS: HUNTINGTON BEACH NATIVE MARTHA NOFFSINGER IS IN THE NCAA RECORD  BOOKS. NOW, SHE WANTS TO BE ON A NATIONAL CHAMPION.  </P> <P> A screeching howl echoes across the Fresno State softball field, surely the  plaintive wail of a soul in mourning. As it turns out, however, it's just  Martha Noffsinger "singing" Happy Birthday to a teammate.  </P> <P> If you live in Fresno, further explanation is probably not necessary. Those  unfamiliar with the team, however, will need to understand that Noffsinger, a  senior shortstop from Huntington Beach, is much more than just an offensive  catalyst and a defensive key. She's the heart and humor of the Fresno program.  She's entertaining, to be sure, but it's her abounding love for the game that's  so clearly contagious. Nobody should have this much fun doing anything.  </P> <P> It's great to watch her play during a game, but it's even more fun to watch her  play during a rain delay.  </P> <P> "I guess my favorite was the time she and (catcher) Shelly Stokes and (former  player) Kathy Mayer put towels on like big diapers and then went out and sang  and danced in front of the fans," said teammate Gina LoPiccolo, a junior third  baseman from Sunny Hills High School.  </P> <P> Noffsinger also started a between-innings ritual at Fresno, a variation on the  high-five theme. Each infielder has her own personally choreographed, elaborate  handshake that includes all sorts of gyrations, patty-cake moves and even  elbows and noses.  </P> <P> This Bulldog hand-jive has been featured often on local television and is  sweeping the softball society.  </P> <P> "(Pitcher) Carie Dever and I started it as freshmen, just fooling around in  practice," Noffsinger said. "It was good for us. We were starting and we felt  good. Then, pretty soon everyone on the team wanted to get in on it and it just  sort of evolved. We do it on the bench now, too.  </P> <P> "It keeps us relaxed. Even in the most tense, pressure situations we do it and  it keeps us loose. It's like, 'Hey, we can do this.'  </P> <P> "Now, every team we play is doing it."  </P> <P> At first, Fresno State Coach Margie Wright wasn't sure she liked all this  celebrating. "I like to let my players be themselves as long as it doesn't come  out in a negative way," she said. "When this started her freshman year, a lot  of the older players didn't know how to handle it and I wasn't too happy to see  them make a mistake and then do the handshake.  </P> <P> "But no one is more competitive than Martha and she showed me that it wasn't a  way to laugh off a mistake, it was a way to release the feelings players  usually repress. And that's a very positive action."  </P> <P> It certainly seems to be working for the Bulldogs. They are 56-13 this season  and the No. 2-ranked team in the nation going into the West Regionals scheduled  Friday and Saturday at a site to be determined Monday.  </P> <P> Don't be surprised if the Bulldogs -- whose 1,017 average attendance leads the  country for the second year in a row -- end up with some more home games this  season. And they will gladly thank crowd-pleaser Noffsinger for yet another  contribution. Talk about home-field advantages. There's nothing else in  softball to compare to a 3,000-strong gathering of devoted, vocal Red Wave  boosters.  </P> <P> "All the stuff Martha does works for the crowd and it works for us because she  knows just how to ease the tension," said Stokes, who has roomed with  Noffsinger for four years. "I'm really kind of intense and I'll come out to the  mound in the late innings of a big game and I'll be saying things like, 'OK,  let's be tough. Let's bear down,' and Martha will say, 'Oh, shut up.'  </P> <P> "Then everyone will laugh and we'll be relaxed."  </P> <P> And then they usually win.  </P> <P> Opposing pitchers tend to find Noffsinger less humorous, however. She recently  established the NCAA career hits record (320) and has a .387 batting average.  </P> <P> There wasn't much pressure involved as she "chased" the record, considering she  had eclipsed the mark by more than a dozen hits before the NCAA statistics  department, after some extensive research, officially recognized her as the  all-time hits leader. Brenda Woodward had 288 career hits at Texas-Arlington in  1983-86.  </P> <P> Noffsinger has Fresno career records in batting average (.337), hits, runs  (151), sacrifices (88) and at-bats (949). She was co-Big West player of the  year and an all-College World Series selection last season as the Bulldogs lost  to UCLA in the championship game for the second consecutive year.  </P> <P> Noffsinger was not on either the first or second All-America teams, however, an  omission that infuriates Wright.  </P> <P> "Martha took the snub much better than I did," Wright said. "I try to be very  objective about these things and if better players are picked over mine, I  never say a word.  </P> <P> "Let's just say Martha's statistics speak for themselves and knowing the impact  she's had on this team's success, that made it doubly frustrating."  </P> <P> Noffsinger just smiles and shrugs. She says team honors far outweigh personal  glory. You've heard it before, but when she says it, you believe it.  </P> <P> "Sure, it was a little disappointing," she said, "but I don't know of any  individual awards that I wouldn't trade for a national championship. You can  take an All-American plaque home and show it to your kids some day, but a  national championship you can share and that's so much more fun."  </P> <P> Noffsinger's team-oriented attitude has helped her gain great individual  success. Her unselfish approach to batting, for instance, has made her into a  downright nuisance at the plate.  </P> <P> She controls the bat with the same poise she handles a crowd during a rain  delay. Once a switch-hitter, she now bats exclusively from the left side. With  her speed and that extra step toward first, every ground ball is a potential  infield single.  </P> <P> She has become the master of the run-and -- slap technique, a sort of swinging  drag bunt. The batter actually steps toward first before making contact with  the ball. She's also an expert bunter. Barry Smith, Fresno's assistant sports  information director, estimates that more than 200 of Noffsinger's 320 career  hits never left the infield.  </P> <P> "Martha's the hardest kind of hitter to pitch to," said sophomore Terry  Carpenter, an All-American pitcher for the Bulldogs who was also Noffsinger's  teammate at Edison High. "She has so many options. She can bunt or run-and-slap  or hit for power."  </P> <P> Well, maybe not a lot of power. She has hit just one ball over the fence in her  career at Fresno.  </P> <P> "I was a freshman and I was sprinting into second when the shortstop told me it  was over the fence," Noffsinger said. "I said, 'No way!' But then I saw  everyone cheering and laughing at me, so I knew it was really gone. Nice  home-run trot on my only homer, huh?"  </P> <P> One day soon, Martha Noffsinger, the softball player, the embodiment of Bulldog  softball, will be gone, too. Who said the fun never stops?  </P> <P> No more dancing in the rain. No more wails echoing across the field.  </P> <P> For Bulldog fans -- and especially Wright -- the silence will be sickening.  </P> <P> "I'd seen her play a lot during the summer when she was in high school and I  really wasn't surprised to see her come in here as a freshman and be an  immediate leader," Wright said. "Martha's one in a million. I don't see any  young players out there that have the same kind of whole package, the talent  and the personality.  </P> <P> "We've talked about life after softball and making sure that you don't start  feeling sad until it's over. You want to go out in style. But Martha's got so  much going for her, she'll be just as successful in whatever she does as she is  out here."  </P> <P> They held Senior Day last Sunday and Noffsinger was duly honored by fans and  teammates alike. She ran through rows of saluting teammates with a yellow rose  in her teeth and playfully turned away when Dever tried to give her a kiss. She  never let down the happy clown facade, but she said there were some tears  underneath the makeup.  </P> <P> "It was hard because I got so many cards and gifts that all said, 'Thank you,'  and I wanted to be able to say, 'No, thank you.'  </P> <P> "I've been working hard at keeping it all in perspective. We won the Big West,  but we still have a regional and the World Series to go to reach all three of  our goals.  </P> <P> "I'll be fine until the team banquet on June 3, then I'll probably lose it  there. It's sad to think it's ending, but my life is really just beginning."  </P> <P> Noffsinger will still be on campus for at least another year while she gets her  teaching credential. She wants to teach elementary school -- "second to fourth  grade," she says -- and, considering the depth of her dedication and that  reserve of verve, there's little doubt she will be an inspiration for a  generation of future students.  </P> <P> Let's just hope she decides against serenading them on their birthdays.  </P></p>

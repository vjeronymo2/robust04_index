			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Man in the News: Survivor out to settle an old score - Franjo Tudjman It was known as the silent republic. For nearly two decades, Croatia nursed its humiliation and injured pride after Tito crushed the Maspok, the Croatian mass nationalist movement, in 1971. The movement, backed by Croatia's Communist party and Matica Hravtska, the nationalist cultural organisation, had tried to gain greater political and cultural freedom for the republic from the federal/central authorities. But Tito's tolerance level for nationalism which harboured the slightest hint of autonomy was low. He imprisoned scores of students, academics and journalists, and purged Croatia's Communist party. The republic was closely controlled by the secret police until last year, when each of Yugoslavia's six republics finally went to the free ballot box. Franjo Tudjman's moment had come. For the Croatian president, now 68, thrives on reawakening Croat nationalism. It is an easy sentiment to tap. In the neighbouring republic of Serbia, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the staunch nationalist Communist president, provided the perfect excuse for Croats to revive thoughts about settling old scores with Serbia in their quest for revenge and autonomy from the centre. For Croats, the federal authorities are perceived to be dominated by Serbia, a republic antithetical to Croat aspirations and outlook. Serbia is communist, Orthodox by religion, Cyrillic in script, steeped in the Ottoman tradition, and centralist. Croatia is Catholic, right-wing, uses the Latin script and is influenced by the western tradition. Croats also saw how Milosevic's uncompromising nationalist rhetoric directly challenged their own quest for sovereignty. Who better to defend the Croats from the Serbian leader's centralising goals than Tudjman? He has risen magnificently to the occasion. His election campaign in April 1990 was wrapped in the paraphernalia of Croat nationalist symbols. The republic's citizens proudly draped the once-banned chequered red-and-white flag on the city's 19th-century buildings, which were modelled on Habsburg architecture. The Croatian diaspora from Canada, the US, Australia, and the UK had finally found a personality for its cause. It poured more than Dollars 4m into the Croatian Democratic Union (CDU), Tudjman's right-wing Catholic party. For emigres, and indigenous Croatians alike, Tudjman would make Croatia a proud, free and independent republic. But more circumspect Croats were worried by the overt, nationalist rhetoric of Tudjman. Mr Drazen Colic, the editor of Danas, the republic's weekly magazine, called him 'Croatia's le Pen', (a reference to France's demagogic right-wing politician) because of his fiery denunciations of Serbs, who make up 11 per cent of the republic's 4.6m population. Tudjman, used to enduring criticism over the years, shrugged off attempts at character assassination. He had waited a long time for the moment when Croatia's Catholic bourgeoisie could find its voice. Born in 1922, Tudjman joined Tito's communist Partisans during the second world war. There seemed no going back for this fervent Marxist. Tito rewarded him by putting him in charge of cadre policy in the Yugoslav Peoples' Army. In 1961 he became the country's youngest general. But a stint by Tudjman at the War History Institute in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, destroyed his ideological convictions and transformed him into an ardent nationalist intent on setting Croatia's historical record straight. He set out to re-interpret what is the historical event which poisons relations between Serbs and Croats: namely to suggest that the murder during the second world war of tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews and gypsies by the Ustasha, Croatia's Nazi-backed fascist government, was carried out by just a handful of Croats; and that many Croats had been killed by the Cetniks, or royalist Serbs. Tito, a Croat, resented Tudjman's metamorphosis from Yugoslav ideologist to Croat nationalist. He was sacked from the army in 1967, and imprisoned after 'Croatia's Spring' in 1971. His election as president last year revealed his great capacity to survive. But his critics are beginning to think he might be weakening. If Tudjman is vulnerable, it is because - like Milosevic - his nationalist constituency is becoming more radical and his authoritarian style of governing is alienating liberals. 'Tudjman likes to control the political agenda - and this includes the nationalist agenda as well,' explained a Croat academic who has worked closely with the president. 'The problem is that he is obsessed with creating a cult of personality which is embedded in nationalist rhetoric, symbolism and patronage at the expense of tackling other issues. After a year in office, the CDU has done nothing to reform the economy or, for that matter, the political institutions in the republic,' he added. Tudjman's record in the economy has undoubtedly disappointed the republic's reformers. Instead of introducing property, ownership rights, and a privatisation programme, he has placed the republic's five largest enterprises directly in the hands of the state. 'We have seen no signs of a programme aimed at decentralising the economy,' explained an economist from Zagreb. His supporters try to defend this poor record. 'Tudjman has had no time to think about the economy because Serb nationalism will not allow him to focus on other issues,' said an official from the republic's foreign ministry. His aides are also quick to dismiss criticism that Tudjman has created his own nomenklatura from the ranks of the party and nationalist opposition which was quashed in 1971. But what Croat liberal intellectuals are increasingly concerned about is that Tudjman is losing control of the very constituency that catapulted him into power. 'Croat nationalists are angry with this week's agreement by the presidency to send in the army to disarm Croats and Serbs in our republic,' commented a journalist from Zagreb. 'Tudjman does not seem to realise that nationalism has its own momentum. Other political parties in Croatia will try and get on the nationalist bandwagon and weaken the CDU. I don't think he will be able to control all these Croatian hotheads who want independence tomorrow, and whose nationalism is directed against decent, non-militant Serbs in the republic.' If Tudjman panders to these elements, he will play into the hands of Milosevic's nationalist supporters who want to believe that the Serb minority is being persecuted in Croatia. If Tudjman tries to temper the very constituency which created him, he will be accused of betraying Croatia to pressure from Serbia. Milosevic is caught in the same dilemma.</p>

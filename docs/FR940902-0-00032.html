			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, a number of commenters asked whether ongoing JTPA contracts with a company must be stopped or interrupted when the company relocates work from another facility. The Department believes any such contracts with the business within the SDA to which the company has relocated must be ended for the duration of the time work is being relocated, since ongoing JTPA assistance was not meant to accommodate business needs which are the result of work relocation from another facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional clarification was also requested on the treatment of relocation scenarios where large retail store chains close down some sites sequentially and then open others in widely dispersed locations. The Department believes that the Act only applies to such cases where a company closes a retail store in one location in order to move that retail store's business to another location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 627.215(d) requires a pre-award review to be completed to document compliance with section 141(c) of the Act. Several commenters asked for clarification, and one recommended that the States be responsible for developing the standardized pre-award format. Others voiced concern about whether SDA's should be held liable if relocation occurred despite pre-award assurances to the contrary; several stated that a properly completed pre-award review should prove due diligence on the part of the SDA and that sanctions otherwise are unduly harsh. The Department believes that these reviews are for the protection of the State and the SDA/SSG. Section 627.215(d) is revised to provide additional guidance for States and SDA's in developing standardized pre-award review procedures and to indicate items which should be included in a review. Information should include the names under which the facility does business, including successors-in-interest, the name, title, and address of the employer supplying the information; the name and address of the facility in the other geographic area which is being closed or from which business is being transferred; the nature of the products or business being transferred to the new location; the date the facility will commence or expand operations; and a statement from the employer about job losses at the old location. The SDA also should check with the former location to verify the employer's statements about job loss. The Department believes that a review based upon the suggestions in the regulations is evidence of due diligence, but does not hold the SDA harmless when it is subsequently shown that the statute was violated because the Act provides that the Secretary shall require repayment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to note that assistance to relocating businesses is not an entitlement. Once the State complies with the minimum requirements set out in these regulations, it may be more restrictive in its assessment of the company's situation or its determination of policy regarding relocating employers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stressed the importance of monitoring to ensure the use of consistent pre-award reviews and also recommended that the SDA/SSG consult with all affected parties, including union representatives at the original and relocated site if relocation is indicated and JTPA assistance is sought. Although not required by the regulations, the State should consider incorporating such procedures in its guidelines for the pre-award review. Before engaging in negotiations with any company interested in moving to the area which seeks future JTPA assistance, the SDA/SSG should initiate a pre-award review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a few commenters asked what constituted ``inducement'' or ``encouragement'' to a company to relocate. The Act provides that ``[N]o funds provided under this Act shall be used or proposed for use to encourage or induce the relocation, of an establishment or a part thereof, that results in a loss of employment for any employee of such establishment at the original location.'' Thus, JTPA funds cannot be used in any manner for this purpose. Similarly, JTPA funds cannot be used under the prohibitions concerning employment generating activities (Section 141(q)). One commenter asked whether written material containing a general description of JTPA programs could be distributed to the local Chamber of Commerce. The Department does not believe that providing material to a Chamber of Commerce which provides a general description of JTPA programs would fall within the prohibition of the Act unless the purpose of the material were to induce or encourage relocation. This regulation is not intended to affect what the Chamber of Commerce does, as long as JTPA funds are not used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Guidance on the Issue of Duplicate and Overlapping Payments Among Federal, State, and Local Programs, Including Pell Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 627.220 clarifies the interpretation of sections 107(b) and 141(b) of the Act. This section also highlights the importance of coordination with programs under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), in view of the new coordination provisions at sections 205 and 265 of the Act, which require SDA's to enhance the provision of services through coordination with other programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of coordination requirements is to preclude duplicate or overlapping payments among Federal, State, and local programs to participants and training institutions and to ensure that the best mix of programs and funds is available to the JTPA participant. Accordingly, &sect;627.220 assigns responsibility to the SDA's to coordinate the sharing of information that affects JTPA-funded programs with the school's financial aid officer, provides for contractual safeguards to prevent duplication or overlap of services and funding among programs, and emphasizes the requirement for assessing the JTPA participant's financial needs and available resources as part of the individual service strategy (ISS). These matters will also be addressed through technical assistance and guidance jointly developed between DOL and U.S. Department of Education officials in order to guide both systems in the development of constructive working relationships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

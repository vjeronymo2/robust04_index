			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Le Anh Dung] </F>   [Text] The 1993-94 winter-spring rice crop of Quang Tri  Province has been a serious failure. More than 50 percent of  20,372 hectares of the crop have been completely damaged due to  low temperatures (16-18 decree Celsius) caused by a cold spell  and prolonged bad weather in March this year. The weather was  especially damaging as the rice were about to grow ears and has  resulted in total crop failure.    According to a preliminary survey, the province has a  shortfall of 30,000 tonnes of paddy and 20,000 tonnes of  subsidiary food crops. The province has thus far produced only  32,000 tonnes of rice or 48.4 percent of the set target. Nearly  200 agricultural cooperatives have experienced a sharp decline  in rice production. On the average, they have produced only 15  quintals per hectare or 48.09 percent of the expected yield.  With the exemption of Huong Hoa District where there was little  damage to its 600 hectares, more than 50 percent of the crops  were damaged in the rice growing districts such as Trieu Phong,  Hai Lang, and Vinh Linh. As a result, 30 percent of households  in the delta and 39,000 ethnic minorities in Van Kieu and Tra Oi  villages, where most of them are under social welfare, are  facing serious hunger.    Quang Tri has not experienced such abnormal weather for the  past several decades. The drought in 1993 destroyed  30,000-40,000 tonnes of summer-fall rice, while the  winter-spring rice this year has been a total failure. This has  adversely affected production, threatened the livelihood of  people, and put up severe obstacles to the restoration of  production.    In face of this, the provincial party and people's  committees  and the people's council have instructed various sectors and  echelons to mobilize the people to collect whatever paddy they  can from the remaining winter-spring ricefields. The people  have also been instructed to strengthen unity, and be thrifty in  order to overcome numerous difficulties, while waiting for the  1994 summer-fall rice crop. As an immediate measure, the  provincial people's committee has spent one billion dong buying  rice varieties, and corn and green beans for distribution to  peasants. The province has also strived to improve water  conservancy projects, and provided more loans to two seed  producing stations to increase output for the next winter-spring  crop. It has also instructed the local agricultural service and  agencies concerned to coordinate with localities to provide  sufficient seeds and essential materials for the summer-fall  crop, and to exploit the capabilities of various districts and  towns to urgently serve production. The province has also asked  for 50 tonnes of seeds as a loan from Quang Nam-Da Nang and Nghe  An provinces. It has also radically changed the summer-fall  crop pattern to suit its unique conditions, prepared for the  next winter-spring crop, and determined the number of households  facing serious hunger for prompt assistance.</p>

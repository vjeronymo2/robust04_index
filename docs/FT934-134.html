			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Banesto seeks to raise fresh capital The new board at Banco Espanol de Credito installed by the Bank of Spain after it dismissed Mr Mario Conde as president, plans to keep Banesto independent and is likely to try to raise fresh capital. A member of the five-man board now running Spain's fourth-largest bank said it hoped to publish a restructuring plan early in the new year, which could include a temporary equity injection from other big Spanish banks. Banesto raised Dollars 775m of new equity this year before its problems emerged. Mr Luis Angel Rojo, governor of the Bank of Spain, told a parliamentary committee yesterday that the removal of the former Banesto board on Tuesday was triggered by the discovery of a Pta500bn (Pounds 2.38bn) overvaluation of the bank's Dollars 61bn assets in an inspection made in September. He said the inspection had found that the bank's rush to increase market share between 1988 and 1991 had burdened it with a dangerously high level of doubtful and non-performing loans. Banesto's loans rose by 109 per cent in that period, compared with just 55 per cent at other large Spanish banks. The potential deficit includes the underfunding of a pension scheme - thought to amount to Pta80bn - and a revaluation of its industrial portfolio. The scale of the loan problems emerged when inspectors began examining loans of Pta250m and upwards compared with an earlier threshold of Pta750m. Although Banesto has only Dollars 2.8bn of equity and so would be unable to absorb the whole revaluation immediately, Mr Rojo said it would be able to phase any adjustment of its assets. He also said that fresh capital could be raised by selling more industrial holdings. 'The bank has clear prospects to advance but only to the extent that its current weakness is overcome with the explicit support of the entire Spanish banking system', Mr Rojo said. But he did not give details of how Banesto would be restructured, or whether it would be taken over. The Banesto board member said the bank had not yet decided to retain as a corporate finance adviser JP Morgan, the US commercial bank which advised Mr Conde on this year's capital increase. JP Morgan has also invested Dollars 175m in Banesto equity. The board member said Banesto would try to keep intact its core banking business. But it might try to raise capital by disposing of its remaining equity stakes in industrial companies. Banesto may ask other banks for new equity, which could be later floated, and may try to raise fresh capital from issuing subordinated debt. Smaller loans that broke Banesto's back, Page 16</p>

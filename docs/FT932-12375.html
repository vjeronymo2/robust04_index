			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / IG Metall to pick targets for strikes THE leaders of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, will decide tomorrow where in eastern Germany to call strikes in support of higher wages in the region. Where the strikes are held will depend on voting by steel industry members throughout the five eastern German states and by members in the metal and electrical industries in Saxony and Mecklenburg Western Pomerania. Union officials, and Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers' association, expect more than 75 per cent to back strike action. Gesamtmetall said: 'The trends show that IG Metall will get what it wants - support for a strike - despite the high economic cost.' IG Metall saidits information from the steel sector indicated strong support. Results of the balloting will be known today. The strikes could start as early as May 3 and will be the first of their kind in eastern Germany since the 1930s. They are intended to put pressure on Gesamtmetall and Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers, to change their minds about ending a contract designed to equalise western and eastern wages by April 1994. The contract was signed in March 1991 between west German employers, eastern German managers, and IG Metall. But the employers have said they can no longer meet large pay claims because of recession in the west and lower economic expectations in the east. The contract envisaged giving employees in the metal and electrical sectors in eastern Germany a 26 per cent pay rise, and a 21 per cent rise for those in the steel sector, beginning April 1 this year. These increases are calculated on wage levels which existed in March 1991, as well as west German pay increases since that date. Wages for east Germans in these two sectors are below 70 per cent of west German levels.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Property: VAT may fuel a move to greener homes - How to improve the energy-efficiency of your house - and save money on heating bills The Vatman cometh in April to claw 8 per cent on domestic energy bills from every house and flat in the country. A year later he will take 17.5 per cent. They are painful charges. But despair not. You can ease their impact. In the short-term, fill the oil tank (if that is the fuel you use) in March and pre-pay as much as you can afford for gas, oil and electricity. Over the long term be prepared to be strict. Sit down and work out your annual costs. Then think hard how to make a more energy-efficient home. How can it create less carbon dioxide, the chief agent of the greenhouse effect, and save you pounds? All three fuels affect the environment. If you think electricity must be cleaner, remember that it starts at the power stations. Pre-payment gives temporary relief to the household purse, but does nothing for the environment. As cash flow, it will delight suppliers but not Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, since it cuts the tax take. Pay before VAT on fuel comes into force and you will not be liable for the tax until your credit with your supplier runs out. You forfeit use of the money but, with interest rates on cash well below 8 per cent it has to be a bargain. And you have the comfort of knowing the bills are paid. How much can you manage? A year's worth, or two or three? If you pay a monthly average through the year, it may be more complicated. But it should still be possible to pre-pay between now and March. Then check on how to cut your heating bills permanently. The first steps are easy. Wear more clothes, lower the thermostat, draw the curtains earlier and turn off unnecessary lights. Long-life, low-wattage bulbs are expensive but better value in the long run. If your home is stuffed with electrical gadgets, from coffee-makers to video recorders, need they be on all the time? Payback is the vital concept for the next stage for improving insulation and heating water in the most efficient way possible. Heating costs account for more than half the typical fuel bill. Woolwich Building society has estimated that, if the thermal jacket around the hot water tank is less than three inches thick, a new, denser, foam-insulated jacket will pay for itself in a year (payback: one to two years). What you may need most is a new efficient gas or oil boiler. Gas and oil-fired condensing boilers are far more efficient than older types (payback: three to six years) If you replace your boiler with a gas condensing model, you may qualify for a Pounds 200 grant from the Energy Saving Trust (details from the Heating and Ventilating Contractors Association). For best use, have individual thermostatic controls fitted to radiators, or room thermostats (but not the two together), and a thermostat for the hot water cylinder. A shelf over a radiator under a window forces hot air back into the room, and aluminium foil fitted behind a radiator, especially on an outside wall, reflects the heat inwards and stops it escaping into the wall. A cheap way of starting a home insulation programme is to put draught excluder strips on doors and windows. Going further and insulating the loft and the spaces below the floors and in the wall cavity (if possible) are more expensive and have a payback of several years. If you are thinking of putting in double glazing or adding external cladding to the building, and you live in a listed building or conservation area, consult the planning authority first. If you are uncertain about what to do, call in an independent assessor under the National Home Energy Rating (NHER) scheme which measures home's energy efficiency on a scale of 0 (very poorly insulated) to 10. Your home will be rated and you will be advised what to do and what it costs. The national average rating is about four but new homes built to current regulations score about seven. Authorities in Milton Keynes, the London overspill town which is full of new houses, have adopted a minimum rating of 7.5. The National Energy Foundation that runs the NHER scheme is based here. When buying a new home, ask for its NHER score as new properties should have energy efficiency built-in. The Woolwich, comparing two end-of-terrace three-bedroom houses, estimates an annual fuel bill of Pounds 1,205 for the typical Edwardian house (rated 2.7 and emitting 14.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide) while for the brand new house of similar size, with cavity wall and 6in loft insulation, it would be Pounds 560, with 6.2 tonnes of CO2 and rated 7.5 NHER. The saving is Pounds 645. The Woolwich has also estimated how insulation can cut annual heating costs (see chart). In new homes such as those at the Wimpey development at West Moor, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, (prices from Pounds 99,950) the NHER score is around 9. Admiral Homes, building in the south-east England (in the Pounds 155,000 to Pounds 170,000 range) has a similar average, with some homes reaching a 10 rating. Top-rated homes are usually found to be two-bedroom houses in the middle of a terrace, and buyers most concerned with energy efficiency tend to be those making their second or third purchase: first-time buyers seem less worried about running costs. In the Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method (the Breeam scheme) which examines the total environmental impact of new homes and not just the heating and insulation, Admiral believes it is the only developer to have gained a rating of 'excellent'. The demands are stringent. As far as possible, the new home must be on a site of low ecological value (such as an old building site) and use recycled materials. It avoids CFC and HCFC gases that deplete the ozone layer and the timber in the property has been pre-treated with wood preservative (rather than treated on site). Admiral's houses have smoke alarms and secure cupboards for storing hazardous substances. There are four bins for different types of household waste and a rainwater butt. Lavatories have a maximum flushing capacity of 6 litres: a good lavatory can work well with 3.5 litres of water. In the long term this is how most houses will be: cheaper to run and far more frugal with the earth's resources and will maintain their resale value. Even solar heating may help. But solar energy can never be as successful in Britain as it is in Cyprus, for example, where you can be sure of a bath hotter than any you have had from conventional heating in Britain, especially if you clean the solar panels regularly. Lastly, plant trees, if you have a garden. Year after year they soak up CO2. In the meantime, if VAT on domestic fuel concentrates the mind on energy saving, it may have a beneficial side-effect.

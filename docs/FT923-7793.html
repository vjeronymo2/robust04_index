			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises for first time in seven days SMALL-LOT short covering and index-linked buying supported share prices, and the Nikkei average rose for the first time in seven trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed up 52.08 at 14,820.25, down 4.5 per cent on the week. Option-related selling, linked to the settlement of August option contracts, brought it down in the morning to the day's low of 14,657.27, but as dealers and investors tried to cover short positions in the afternoon and the index hit the day's high of 14,928.54. Volume swelled to 280m shares from 197m. Traders said option related activity accounted for about 90m to 100m shares. Advances led declines by 568 to 350 with 152 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks rose 5.63 to 1,123.13 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 2.50 to 935.84. Traders noted small-lot bargain hunting by US pension funds. 'They are interested in averaging down prices on their holdings of blue chips, but the orders are not large enough to support the overall market,' said Mr Ross Purdie at SG Warburg Securities. Issues which had been sold heavily recently rebounded on short covering. Nippon Housing Loan, the financially troubled housing loan company, surged Y16 to Y118, along with Nippon Credit Bank, the long-term credit bank facing increasing property related problem loans, which advanced Y250 to Y3,950. Dealers bought back speculative theme stocks, previously lower on profit taking. Okamoto Industries gained Y80 to Y930 and Meiji Milk Products rose Y21 to Y770. Highly-priced issues, previously sold by investors facing margin calls, rebounded on bargain hunting. Sega Enterprises gained Y30 to Y7,680 and Seven-Eleven Japan added Y140 to Y6,290. Motorcycle makers advanced on the sharp rise in last month's motorcycle exports to the US. Yamaha rose Y21 to Y822 and Suzuki Motor Y3 to Y736. Suzuki has outperformed the market by over 25 per cent during the last three months, due to rumours of an acquisition by a leading US car company. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 97.13 to 15,770.22 in volume of 13.2m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Basin markets had a mixed performance ahead of the weekend. HONG KONG was disappointed by Hang Seng Bank's first half results and the index lost 34.52 to 5,822.59, a 0.5 per cent loss on the week. Turnover jumped to HKDollars 4.47bn after a low HKDollars 1.93bn on Thursday. Hang Seng Bank lost HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 54.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Paivi Repo: "European Comparison: Finland Has </F> Strictest Drug Policy and Fewest Users"]    [Text] "Finland's drug policy is the strictest in Europe,  although we have the lowest number of drug users," said  Assistant Professor Osmo Kontula. He has compiled information  about the drug situation in Finland for a report covering the  situation in 13 European cities.    There are 500-1,000 drug users in Finland who use hard  drugs.  The figure is 10 times higher in the other Nordic countries.    During the period studied, hundreds of grams of drugs were  seized in Finland, while, in other parts of Europe, hundreds,  sometimes even thousands, of kilos were seized. Death by  poisoning is not caused by heroin, but by medication abuse, and  of the individuals who are HIV-positive, only 10 percent are  intravenous drug users.    "In a civilized nation, the number of drug users does not  determine the country's drug policy, but instead it is  formulated from the perspective of the individual users. We have  forgotten the users and their problems, and the few existing  treatment institutions are fighting for their survival,"  emphasized Kontula.    Drug users have been watched more intensely in Finland than  in Sweden, and monitoring has been as extensive as the law  allows. Drug users have been arrested, and their homes have been  searched, in a way that Kontula does not feel would have been  found appropriate in any other Western European country.  <H5>  Tighter Controls Needed </H5>   "I would like to encourage the supervisory authorities to  use  more common sense than before, and to contemplate which would be  more appropriate in lessening the negative effects, control or  treatment. Drug addicts have become the victims of the policy  chosen, and this has caused major problems for users," explained  Osmo Kontula.    In his view, the monitoring of users could be reduced and it  could be directed toward cases "where the users themselves may  experience problems, or where other criminal activities are  involved."    According to Kontula, at the beginning of this decade,  Finland had three full-time drug enforcement officials for every  drug user, while there was only a minimal number of treatment  personnel. "Joining the European Union will increase the need to  humanize the monitoring process and move the focus from customs  and police services to the areas of social and health services.  We moved in an opposite direction from the rest of Europe, when,  during the last few years, we decided to reduce treatment  facilities," he added.  <H5>  Narcotics Do Not Compete With Alcohol </H5>   The Finn's intoxicant of choice is alcohol. Mixing alcohol  and medication is a fairly common practice. The abuse of medical  drugs is four times as common as the use of narcotics.    Psychoactive drugs prescribed for medical use are also  considered narcotic substances. According to Kontula, in the  rest of Europe, only addictive drugs are considered to be  narcotics.    The drug problem is not very large, as there are still few  displaced people in Finland. Another obstacle, in Osmo Kontula's  view, is a feature of the Finnish culture where intoxication is  a conscious means of establishing contact with other people.  According to him, because narcotics lead to social isolation,  they can not compete with alcohol.</p>

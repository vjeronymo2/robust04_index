			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> TAKING THE SHIRTS OFF STARS' BACKS FOR CHARITY  </P> <P> If you want to get something on your chest, here's your chance. The fourth  annual Celebri-T-Shirt Auction will be May 4 at the Kona Kai Club on Shelter  Island. Once again, more than 250 T-shirts autographed by celebrities, most of  them pop stars, will be auctioned off to raise money for the Storefront, San  Diego County's only emergency shelter for homeless youth.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the first auction, in May, 1987, were used to finance the  February, 1988, reopening of the Storefront. The downtown shelter -- jointly  operated by San Diego Youth and Community Services, Catholic Community  Services, and METRO, the social-service agency of the United Methodist churches  -- originally opened in October, 1985, but was forced to shut nine months later  due to a lack of funds.  </P> <P> Last year's auction boosted the Storefront's coffers by nearly $50,000. The  five priciest shirts, and their winning bids, were those signed by the late Roy  Orbison ($1,275), Jimmy Buffett ($725), the Beach Boys ($650), the Grateful  Dead ($625), and Hollywood Rat Packers Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, and Frank  Sinatra ($600).  </P> <P> At this year's affair, Storefront volunteers will put more shirts signed by  Orbison (two), Buffett (two), and the Beach Boys (one) on the auction block.  Other pop stars whose autographed T-shirts will be up for bid range from Chet  Atkins to Ozzy Osbourne, from the Fabulous Thunderbirds to the Fine Young  Cannibals, from the New Bohemians to New Order.  </P> <P> "Typically, we go through the business managers of the pop stars," said event  coordinator Cynthia L. Perry. "We write them, explain what the cause is, and  just make the request. For the most part, we do OK; we have stuff coming in all  the time."  </P> <P> Also scheduled to be auctioned off is an assortment of rock 'n' roll  memorabilia, including autographed photos of De La Soul, Debbie Gibson, Billy  Joel, Elton John and George Michael; a soccer ball signed by Rod Stewart; an  autographed Doobie Brothers concert program, and a pair of drum sticks and drum  gloves used by Motley Crue's Tommy Lee.  </P> <P> "I just called Madonna to see what she'd be giving us, and we're hoping for a  bustier, fancy bra, something slinky," said Storefront volunteer Salli Stiner,  who's in charge of acquisitions. "And we're 90% certain we'll have a Fender  guitar autographed by Eric Clapton.  </P> <P> "I also just got off the phone with Bob Dylan's people. I was initially  thinking of getting this book that contains all his artwork, poetry and songs,  and having him sign that, but then his press people said, 'Why don't we just  let Bob pick out something he thinks will be wonderful?'  </P> <P> "It's kind of exciting -- I'm just sitting here waiting, wondering what it's  going to be." An auction preview party will be May 1 at Tom Fat's Tropical Cafe  in Middletown.  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: January and February were busy months for Hit Single Recording  Services, the local studio in the basement of the Marketplace at the Grove  shopping center in East San Diego. Polydor Records recording artist Mildred  Douglas from Holland stopped in to cut basic tracks for her next solo album.  Guest session-men included singer Greg Walker and drummer Walfredo Reyes of  Santana and ex-Weather Report bassist Alphonso Johnson. Then came Country Dick  Montana of the Beat Farmers, overseeing post-production of an upcoming live  album by the Pleasure Barons, a touring revue he fronted last year with  ex-Blasters guitarist Dave Alvin and fellow San Diegan Mojo Nixon. In the  meantime, local bands the Harpoons, the Tell-Tale Hearts, Healing Arts, and the  Holy Love Snakes dropped by to record demonstration tapes. . . .  </P> <P> Alligator Records, a tiny independent blues label from Chicago, has just  released the third album by San Diego roots-rockers the Paladins. Saturday  night, the trio is throwing a record-release party at San Diego State  University's Backdoor. They'll be performing live versions of most of the 12  songs on "Let's Buzz," an invigorating blend of rockabilly, blues,  rhythm-and-blues and country. The album was recorded in Los Angeles, at the  private recording studio of 1970s soulster Leon Haywood, who topped the charts  in 1975 with "I Want'a Do Something Freaky to You." Haywood plays keyboards on  the album; other guest stars are legendary New Orleans saxophonist Lee Allen,  currently with the Blasters, and Los Lobos saxist Steve Berlin. Berlin  co-produced "Let's Buzz" with Mark Linnett. . . .  </P> <P> A May 5 performance by Julio Iglesias kicks off this year's second annual  concert series at the Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park.

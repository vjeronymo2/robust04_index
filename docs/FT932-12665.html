			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Five resign from Hyogo Bank board FIVE board members resigned yesterday at Hyogo Bank, a local Japanese bank, taking responsibility for the institution's deteriorating bad loan burden, reportedly the worst among regional Japanese banks. Mr Minoru Yamada, the bank's president, is among those to resign, and will be replaced by Mr Masateru Yoshida, a former director-general of the banking bureau at the ministry of finance. The appointment of a former official of Mr Yoshida's calibre highlights the difficulties at Hyogo Bank, based in the western city of Kobe. The bank was crippled by its lax control over financial affiliates, which pumped funds into property-related projects during the late-1980s. Hyogo has become a symbol of the over-ambitiousness of some Japanese regional banks, which expanded beyond their home territory during the late 1980s and were big lenders to property developers and, in some cases, stock market speculators. However, Hyogo was not alone in using so-called 'non-bank affiliates' to cultivate customers outside the traditional range. Much of the bad loan burden faced by big city banks is also linked to the lending of affiliates. The bank's 10 largest affiliates have outstanding loans of Y1,600bn, and an increasing percentage of these loans are turning bad. Hyogo has also accepted reduced interest payments from customers which have avoided collapse, but which are in need of intensive care. The extent of Hyogo's problems are such that the Bank of Japan has pumped in loans at the official discount rate, now 2.5 per cent, allowing the troubled bank to profit from the difference in market rates. Central bank officials were concerned that there could be a run on Hyogo after its deposits fell 16.5 per cent in the first half last year. Hyogo is expected to announce another restructuring programme tomorrow as the present plan, scheduled to last until 2002, has been unable to stabilise the bank. Apart from Mr Yamada, who announced the resignations, Mr Nobuo Ishikawa, the vice-president, and Mr Tamenobu Nakatsu, senior managing director, will leave the bank.</p>

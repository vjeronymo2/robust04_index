			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Pivotal role for headmaster Kohl - Germany MR Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, adopts at European summits the air of a convivial headmaster shooing a class of errant schoolboys into line. One senior British diplomat calls Mr Kohl's relationship with his host at Edinburgh, Mr John Major, 'avuncular'. 'It's a bit like a football manager who's seen a favourite player come good,' the diplomat adds. Mr Kohl played a pivotal role in Edinburgh in several ways. First, and most important, he backed key elements of Mr Major's policy - just as he had done at Maastricht a year ago, when his support allowed Britain its 'opt-outs' in monetary union and social policy. Mr Kohl's willingness to allow Mr Major time to overcome ratification hurdles in the House of Commons was already clearly expressed when the two leaders met in Oxfordshire last month. Although the chancellor does not want to give the UK unlimited leeway, he accepts that a formal deadline would stoke up rather than diminish parliamentary opposition. He is confident that Mr Major will be able to put the Maastricht bill on course for full ratification by the summer - even though the closing stages of passage through the House of Lords and the royal assent may not be completed until later. Mr Kohl repeated several times that he could not wait 'for years' for the Maastricht laggards to ratify. But he showed no enthusiasm for the rest of Europe leaving Denmark and Britain behind. He also stressed that the start of enlargement negotiations with Sweden and Finland next month would boost pro-EC feeling in neighbouring Denmark as campaigning for the new Maastricht referendum there gets under way in the new year. In another crucial area, Mr Kohl backed Mr Major's insistence that Britain's EC budget rebate, negotiated in 1984 and worth about Pounds 2bn a year, should not be renegotiated. Mr Major's Maastricht ratification difficulties made it 'a favourable time' for Britain to encourage its partners not to spark a new EC row over the rebate, Mr Kohl remarked whimsically on Friday night. Mr Kohl's personal links with other EC leaders came to the fore during Saturday's late-night argument with Spain over the share of the Community budget channelled to the poorer countries. Mr Kohl said he had made 'a substantial verbal contribution' to try to calm the row with Mr Felipe Gonzalez. On Friday Mr Kohl disarmingly said that he regarded himself as a friend of the Spanish prime minister, but none the less could not explain Mr Gonzalez's summit outbursts over the cohesion fund. Over the question of economic and monetary union, Mr Kohl showed himself in no hurry over a decision on the site for the proposed European central bank  -an institution Germany badly wants in Bonn or Frankfurt. Before the negotiations, German officials said they did not expect the matter to be agreed in Edinburgh. Mr Kohl said the question could perfectly well be settled next summer. He believes the question of when the site of the institution is decided is secondary - as long as, in the end, it is in Germany.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Call to save US motor industry THE US vehicle industry is dying and needs government help to survive, according to a new report by the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based think tank. 'Detroit is basically going out of business and is being displaced by Japan. When the auto industry goes down the tubes, so do a lot of other American industries,' said Mr Clyde Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department official under the Reagan administration and institute president. The call for government intervention came on the eve of President George Bush's arrival in Japan. The president has taken with him the heads of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler in an attempt to persuade Japan to ease market access for US cars and to persuade voters that he cares about the US recession. US carmakers suffered one of their worst years in 1991. The big three lost Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) between them in the first nine months, and last month GM said it would close 21 plants and cut 74,000 jobs. Ford yesterday said it sold only 2.87m cars and trucks last year, down 14 per cent from 1990. The report says US carmakers have improved quality and efficiency but still suffer a cost disadvantage of Dollars 1,481 a car against Japanese competitors because of differences between the two economies. Around Dollars 505 of this difference comes from the cost of health care, usually borne by the employer in the US but is covered by the state in Japan. Organisational costs, including pension plans, contribute Dollars 660, and labour costs are Dollars 316 per car higher in the US. The report says the US government should give an income tax credit to people who buy US-built cars this year, and should use Dollars 2bn of military research money to provide low-interest loans to the car industry for research into energy conservation, safety and pollution control.</p>

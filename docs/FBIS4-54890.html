			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sonja Kiridzievska: "The Grey Economy Is </F> Destroying Textile Workers"]    [Text] The mass smuggling of textile products for  which turnover taxes are not paid is putting textiles in a  regular shop only for display, while they are sold on the  streets and sidewalks; 130 enterprises with 47,000 employees are  working in the textile industry.    The textile industry is sewing for "small change." In spite  of all the efforts of this labor-intensive economic sector, most  of which is export-oriented, to create the conditions for bigger  deals, it still remains at the level of working under the Lon  system [arrangement in which foreign company supplies materials  and possibly equipment and receives part or all of goods  produced by local labor], which is promoted by cheap labor. Last  year this industry, in which 130 enterprises with 47,000  employees work, had its volume of physical production reduced by  1.33 percent in its base part, and had a 0.6 percent larger  decline than Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM] industry. Production capacities, up to 30  percent of which were used by spinners, 40 percent by weavers,  60 percent by the knitting industry, and 80 percent by the  clothing industry, were not an obstacle to textile workers'  achieving exports worth $122 million last year and accounting  for 14 percent of the country's total exports.  <H5>  Loss of the Market </H5>   Under the conditions of the application of UN sanctions  against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], commercial and  transportation blockades, the growth of costs and high  competition from East European countries, exports can hardly be  achieved unless other incentive measures are introduced in  addition to the realistic exchange rate. The textile industry is  operating with obsolete equipment, whose extent of depreciation  in the base sector ranges above 80 percent, and above 60 percent  in the finished product industry. Because of unresolved  ownership relations in the last three years, there have been  almost no investments, and thus, if this lag continues, the  sector will soon also lose its main market abroad, especially in  the European Union [EU]. The blackmail tactics of foreign  partners which, knowing about our situation, are offering  humiliating prices for Lon-system cooperation, are contributing  to this. It is thus happening that Macedonian garment makers are  agreeing to sew certain pieces of clothing for only one mark,  even though they know that they are being sold for 50 times as  much in the market. With the implementation of the Stabilization  Program, it can be seen that the textile workers will not be  prospering this year. As several directors in this branch of the  economy have noted, it is illogical for a country to borrow  foreign exchange and repay it with denars. Likewise, they wonder  about the logic by which interest rates continue to grow under  the conditions of a realistic exchange rate for the German mark  [DM]. That is confirmed by the fact that in January the DM rose  by only 2.9 percent, but interest rates were between 15 and 16  percent.    After all of this it appears that those faring best in all  of  the textile industry are garment makers, which is also confirmed  by what was exhibited at the Modest 94 fair. The spinners are in  the same branch, but there 75 percent of the capacity is  standing idle. The reason for this lies in the fact that the  Macedonian processors of cotton and wool do not have enough  funds to provide themselves with raw materials for a longer  period. The foreign suppliers are offering Macedonian spinners  cotton at prices up to 30 percent higher than the regular ones.  This problem can be solved if the Directorate of Commodity  Reserves purchases a larger amount of semifinished products and  provides the spinners with a longer period of peace. In view of  the constant illiquidity of the spinners, the illiquid  enterprises are dragging along with them those that are in a  somewhat better condition, since they cannot pay their debts to  them. And since we are already talking about unpaid bills, the  Macedonian textile workers, just like the construction workers,  cannot get their money from Iraq. With the passage of time, that  amount has reached the figure of $19 million, and the state, in  spite of all its promises, has not yet collected it.  <H5>  Textiles on the Streets </H5>   Struggling with overemployment, which is estimated to amount  to 20 percent of the total number of employees, low wages far  behind the average for the economy, by as much as 36 percent, as  well as additional withholdings from wages, so that for a net  wage of 100 denars the same amount is given in taxes, the  textile workers also have to struggle with the gray economy.  Mass smuggling of textile products, for which the 25 percent  turnover tax is not paid, is the only reason why textiles are  displayed in regular shops, but sold on streets and sidewalks.  It is not clear to textile workers how textiles could have been  left out of the ban on the sale of goods in marketplaces.    In the sea of problems afflicting this sector, one of the  urgent ones is technological obsolescence and the high degree of  the amortization of equipment, almost 80 percent of which is  ready to be written off. Likewise, it is absurd that machines  which are not produced here should be exempt from customs  duties, while spare parts for the old machines, which are  likewise procured through imports, are still subject to customs  duties. It is precisely for that reason that textile workers are  demanding that they be exempted from these duties, regardless of  the cheaper value of the parts, under $1,000. At the same time,  it is necessary to reexamine the present mechanisms for  incentives for exports, which, in their current versions, are  insufficiently stimulating exports in this sphere. Also  essential is financial assistance for financing the preparation  of production for export and the reexemption of profits achieved  through exports. In a situation in which textile workers even  have the profits from exports taxed, why should they have any  interest in continuing to export? Accordingly, the new  institutional measures are assessed by textile workers as solely  aimed at ensuring a more comfortable life for the state, without  providing a single denar more for incentives for those who are  doing a good job. With the curtailment of all privileges for  those who are export-oriented, the textile workers think that  the branch that they are sitting on is being cut from under  them, and also add that the new fiscal policy lacks not only a  developmental function but also a social welfare function. The  textile workers are demanding compensatory solutions, and also  that other permits for imports and exports be valid for one  year, and not partial and for shorter periods of time, and that  they be issued within the framework of the Chamber [of Commerce]  institution. In the area of wages, all the enterprises that have  an average wage below than the average for the economy should be  allowed to increase them up to that average, while the process  of transformation should be accelerated, giving workers an  opportunity to participate for free in purchasing some of the  enterprise shares.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Row over Kinnock Euro job LABOUR'S ambivalent response to the Danish 'no' vote on the Maastricht treaty ended Mr Neil Kinnock's hopes of becoming president of Confederation of Socialist Parties of European Communities, it was claimed last night. But while Mr George Robertson, Labour's European affairs spokesman, insisted last night that the outgoing leader's decision to withdraw his candidature was his alone, socialist group officials in Brussels said there was mounting opposition to his candidature from the Germans and French. Both sides agree that it was equivocation by Labour MPs and the leadership in Westminster last week over ratification of the treaty that, in effect, halted Mr Kinnock's election to the prestigious post. 'As soon as the Danish vote came through Kinnock's chances were over,' a socialist group official said. 'The Dutch were continuing to support him, but the lack of clarity of Labour's views on Maastricht made his position impossible.' The official added that there was wide-ranging irritation within the group at Labour's 'lack of seriousness' on the Maastrict agreement which is firmly backed by all the other members of the confederation. There is now a move to draft Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister, Mr Antonio Guiterres, the Portuguese socialist leader or Mr Frank van der Broeken, a Flemish socialist to take the post. A Labour party official in London confirmed that European socialist parties had 'great difficulty' in understanding how Britain's parliamentary system worked and the requirement on MPs, including former leaders, to accept party discipline. There seems little doubt that Labour's current refusal to vote in support of ratification of the Maastricht accord is damaging its carefully-nurtured relations with other European socialist parties. Further evidence of Labour's difficulties emerged yesterday when Mr Kinnock appeared to shift position by refusing to rule out backing for a British referendum on the treaty.</p>

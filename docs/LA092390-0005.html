			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: WHO DID WHAT  </P> <P> The producers of Orion Pictures' "State of Grace" are taking the unusual step  of promoting the writing contributions of a second writer on the project -- not  something that happens everyday in an industry sensitive about rewrites.  </P> <P> A Writer's Guild arbitration committee awarded sole screen credit to playwright  Dennis McIntyre, who died Feb. 1 of stomach cancer at age 47.  </P> <P> But at the end of the film -- a dark look at New York's Irish-American gangs,  starring Sean Penn -- the producers give "special thanks" to another  playwright, David Rabe, for his "contributions to the film."  </P> <P> They also note Rabe's rewriting efforts in the movie's press kit, which is  highly uncommon.  </P> <P> Co-producer Ron Rotholz explains that director Phil Joanou felt both writers  deserved credit, and the producers agreed, but that McIntyre appealed to the  WGA. Rotholz, who began developing the movie with McIntyre three years ago,  says McIntyre definitely "wrote the movie," but adds that McIntyre also "worked  hand-in-hand" with Rabe, primarily on dialogue.  </P> <P> "We felt (Rabe) made a great contribution," Rotholz says. "We wanted to  acknowledge that, even though his own guild didn't." David J. Fox  </P></p>

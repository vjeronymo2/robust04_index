			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Company News: Austrian banks see rising bad debts THE Austrian economy has been a rare star performer among industrialised countries in the past year. But bleak announcements this week from the country's two largest banks, Z-Landerbank Bank Austria and Creditanstalt Bankverein, make clear that the good times have come abruptly to an end. Creditanstalt, which in July looked forward to a better second half, said yesterday it would slash its annual dividend by 60 per cent to Sch6 per share and eliminate the staff bonus to build reserves for rapidly mounting bad loans. Bank Austria would not comment on its dividend plans, but forecast a 6 per cent slump in its pre-tax profits for the year to about Sch1.9bn (Dollars 172m) and provisions of close to Sch5bn. Mr Guido Schmidt-Chiari, chairman of Creditanstalt, said the sudden deterioration of the finances of small and medium size companies in Austria 'came as an unpleasant surprise to all banks'. He said three years of a very strong currency and high real interest rates were taking a heavy toll. A record number of business failures was expected this year. In some cases, there were extraordinary factors at work. Textile and clothing producers were being badly hit by European Community association agreements with eastern European countries that came into effect this year and discriminate against non-EC producers. The forest products industry was suddenly facing tougher competition as a result of devaluations in Scandinavia and sluggish demand in its principal export market, Italy. Mr Rene-Alfons Haiden, chairman of Bank Austria said: 'Inland credit risks have grown in all areas, and I fear that the situation will be worse next year.' The Creditanstalt dividend cut shocked investors, and the ATX index of 18 leading shares on the Vienna Borse, fell 1.7 per cent to 738.77, its lowest point since August. Creditanstalt preferred shares dropped Sch14 to Sch421 and the ordinary shares were off Sch11 to Sch460. The cut was particularly surprising in the light of the bank's forecast of roughly unchanged pre-tax profit of Sch2.1bn for the year and a 10 per cent rise in operating profits to Sch3.2bn. 'We had a long discussion about it, but my feeling is that we are not living in a period for half-measures,' Mr Schmidt-Chiari said. The cut will save Sch355m and the elimination of staff bonuses another Sch200m. The bank has set a preliminary figure of Sch800m for provisions compared with last year's Sch577.7m. It made clear that provisions for foreign borrowers would be lower this year. Mr Haiden said he expected Bank Austria to make an operating profit of Sch2.9bn-Sch3bn, down from Sch3.31bn. Earlier, the bank, which will seek London and New York listings for its shares next year, said its pre-tax profits would fall to Sch1.9bn from Sch2.05bn in 1991. Both banks are cutting costs and eliminating excessive marketing practices in the domestic market. Creditanstalt said it expected the payoff to begin to appear next year, and was budgeting for higher profits for 1993.</p>

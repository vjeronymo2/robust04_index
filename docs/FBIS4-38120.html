			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tripoli, Al Sayf [June] 25, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS  AGENCY -- The leader of the revolution visited the residence of  the children of Bosnia-Herzegovina being hosted by the Great  Jamahiriyah as a result of a humanitarian gesture by the leader  to lessen the losses suffered due to the fighting between  warring factions in the former Yugoslavia. The visit of the  leader of the revolution came as the children were (?soon) to  leave the Great Jamahiryah upon the request of the Bosnian  Government which confirmed that the areas the children will  return to have become safe areas. During the visit, the leader  of the revolution met with these children in an encounter which  showed the human interest extended by the leader to them and  their well being and provision of all the necessary resources  and comfort in the Great Jamahiryah.    On this occasion, the leader of the revolution made the  following speech:    "Firstly, we are pleased that you are returning to your  families who are now in safe areas. But we are sad to see you  go for you are our children [words indistinct] too you were in  your home and with your fathers and mothers who are Libyans.  Now you have mothers and fathers both in Libya and Bosnia.  Your home is Bosnia and Libya. Also we are happy at your return  to your families. We are sad at the plight suffered by the  Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is a hard lesson not  only for the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina but to the  international conscience. A bitter lesson for all mankind. But  this bitterness leads us for further struggle against religious  and racial discrimination. This was responsible for this  tragedy hence we must fight for the eliminaion of the enemies of  mankind. We fight against those who enjoy the suffering of  children. The killing of fathers and mothers of these children  constitutes a horrific crime and so was the separation of a  little child from his mother and father in Europe which fooled  us with the its [as received] claim of being civilized while it  was without any conscience. The whole peaceful population of  Yugoslavia was subjected to an ugly crime. This people was  united and Yugoslavs were living next to each regardless of  their religion. Muslims were living with Christians. It was  one people living in one country. However, criminal power and  influence seekers did not hesistate to torture you and render  you homeless. What is the value of any new action if only  achieved on the dead bodies of these children? What is the  worth of any objective if achieved only at the expense of these  children and as a result of torturing them? You were not the  only victims of torture. Human conscience was tortured and all  honourable peoples in the world felt your pain. You have  provided a history lesson. You showed the consequences of war  and religious discrimination. You have rendered a service to  mankind for by being separated from your parents and the torture  you endured you showed that war is a harmful and renounced act  and that religious and racial discrimination is a despicable  [word indistinct]. We are sad at your leaving and God willing,  we will meet with you when you are older and stronger when you  would have forgotten this difficult period. We hope to see you  when you are happier."

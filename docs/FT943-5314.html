			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / This Week: Sport Football September 7, International Match, England v USA, Wembley, London Two years ago, the Americans beat Graham Taylor's England 2-0 in Boston. They have been offered a Dollars 25,000 bonus if they repeat that victory at Wembley, where current England manager Terry Venables begins his build-up to the 1996 European championship finals. As hosts, England do not have to qualify for that competition. But the other home countries are playing in qualifying rounds. Scotland go to Finland, Wales host Albania and Northern Ireland take on Portugal. Jack Charlton's Republic of Ireland are in Latvia Athletics September 9-11, World Cup, Crystal Palace, London Sally Gunnell, the 400 metre hurdler, will lead Britain's women into the event, following the British Athletic Federation's refusal to withdraw the team over the Diane Modahl drug taking affair. The International Amateur Athletic Federation wanted Britain to withdraw but has no power to order the team out. It has warned, however, that any success achieved could be wiped out if a ban on the 800m runner was confirmed. The British mens team is well placed for a title challenge, with Linford Christie (100m), Du'aine Ladejo (400m) and Colin Jackson (110m hurdles) leading the line-up. Motor Racing September 11, Italian Grand Prix, Monza This season has had more than its fair share of drama - both on and off the track. Every week brings fresh controversy. In the last race in Belgium, runaway title leader Michael Schumacher was disqualified on a technicality after finishing in first place. As Schumacher is suspended for two-races for ignoring a black flag at the British Grand Prix, Damon Hill will get a chance to close the 21-point gap by which he trails Schumacher in the championship. If Hill wins in Italy and again in Portugal, on September 25, he will have only a one-point deficit with three races left. Not that that will be uppermost in the minds of the passionate Italian fans who will be hoping for a Ferrari victory and just glad that the event is being held at all. The sport's governing body, the FIA, had threatened to cancel the event because Italian authorities refused to cut down about 100 ancient trees to widen a run-off area and meet new safety specifications. Heavy lobbying by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusoni's government was needed for the meeting to be reinstate. Remaining grands prix after Monza are: Portuguese, September 25, Estoril; European, October 16, Jerez, Spain; Japanese, November 6, Suzuka; Australian, November 13, Adelaide.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / World Trade News: US hopeful of agreeing new chip pact with Japan US semiconductor industry officials are optimistic that the US and Japan may reach a new semiconductor trade agreement at talks in Tokyo later this week. The talks are aimed at renewing a 1986 pact between the US and Japan on semiconductor trade which expires at the end of July. In the original agreement Japan undertook to increase imports of foreign-made semiconductor products and to end 'dumping' of memory chips in US and other markets. In a side letter to the 1986 pact, Japan acknowledged the US goal of achieving a foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market of 'at least 20 per cent' by the time the agreement expired. Currently, however, the foreign share of the Japanese market stands at about 13 per cent, according to US calculations. A new agreement is expected to restate the 20 per cent figure as a 'goal' to be achieved over the next two years. Japanese officials initially opposed the inclusion of any market share target in a new agreement, but now appear ready to compromise. The officials said they would consider a US request that a new pact specify a 20 per cent share but on condition the figure is not a guarantee. In return, the US may be be willing to eliminate trade sanctions imposed in 1987 when the US charged that Japan was failing to live up to the terms of the original semiconductor pact. The 1986 agreement also created anti-dumping measures including a price monitoring system under which the US Commerce Department determined 'fair market value' prices for each Japanese producer of memory chips. The FMV system, which was blamed by some computer industry officials in the US and Europe for a steep rise in memory chip prices, is not expected to be included in the new trade agreement. US semiconductor industries now favour alternative anti-dumping measures that are 'less government intrusive'.</p>

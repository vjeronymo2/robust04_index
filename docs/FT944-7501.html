			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Granada Granada has become the latest British group to toy with the idea of buying back its shares or paying special dividends. Doing so is clearly not its priority. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive, would much prefer to find more acquisitions into which to pour his energies. Indeed, the evidence to date on the LWT and Sutcliffe purchases seems to show that Granada is adept at adding value through acquisition. The snag is that suitable avenues for expansion are hard to find. During the summer, caterer Gardner Merchant spurned Granada's advances; moreover, the government is unlikely soon to change rules preventing the group buying another ITV company. As a result, Granada is having to scout around for catering acquisitions on the continent  -so far with no luck. Meanwhile, the company generates cash at a prodigious rate. If no further acquisitions are made, Granada will be debt-free in three years and still hold a Pounds 400m investment in BSkyB. Under such a scenario, share buy-backs would clearly be sensible. Investors should also be reassured by the implication that the management is not so desperate for deals that it will overpay. Yesterday's preliminary results show how tightly the business is being managed. The improvement in margins was particularly gratifying. But it is hard to argue that Granada is undervalued. The predictability of its rental and catering arms may compensate for their dullness. But a prospective price/earnings premium to the market of around 10 per cent looks large enough.</p>

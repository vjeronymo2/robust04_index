			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: British Gas bills policy a dangerous precedent Sir, The British Gas monopoly has set a dangerous precedent in establishing a tiered price menu for its settlement charges on our gas supplies ('British Gas sets prices to reward good payers', November 18). By discriminating price levels it seeks to channel payments to the direct debit system, through the high-street banks, to the detriment not only of cheque payments made in good time but also to the detriment of straight cash payments across their counters. People paying bills by cash, immediately, are penalised by 5 per cent in comparison with direct debit customers. What is now to stop British Gas increasing this differential, by say, 10 per cent and forcing payments through direct debit? Is it to be in its gift to control such matters? Will others now think this is a very good wheeze? Has cash payment ever been so forcibly denigrated? The banks admit that a high proportion of their consumer complaints are concerned with mistakes originating from direct debit arrangements, and of course these problems will now increase. Good customers of British Gas, that is the majority, who pay their bills at the proper time either by cheque or cash and have done so for years, should not be set upon by schemes such as this. What can the consumer do about it? Surely the thinking consumer might decide to change his policy too and, instead of paying his bills on time, delay them, keep the money in his building society to the last legal moment and use the interest so gained to claw back some of the 5 per cent penalty so unfairly laid against him. And so, by its dangerous unilateral precedent, British Gas converts veteran blue-chip cash customers into payment laggards. The very thing it sought to avoid] Keith Z Ord, Arbour House, 13 The Mount, Fetcham, Surrey KT22 9EB</p>

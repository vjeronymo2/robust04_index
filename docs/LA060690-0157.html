			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DONAHUE PUTS OFF SENATE BID  </P> <P> Amid speculation that he is ready to quit television to run for the U.S.  Senate, Phil Donahue says don't count on it -- yet.  </P> <P> "I'm obliged to do the show until 1992, so any political plans I might make  would not go into effect until the 1994 elections," the talk show host said in  the June 9 issue of TV Guide. "I'm really very undecided at this time."  </P> <P> The 23-year TV veteran, a Democrat, said he wonders "how electable I'd be in  the age of 'read my lips.' I'm pro-choice. I support gay rights. I think the  invasion of Panama was a bad idea, and I think we ought to be able to burn the  flag."  </P></p>

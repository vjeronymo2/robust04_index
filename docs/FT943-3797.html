			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Survey of The Philippines (12): More anchor at Subic - Industrial estates are reflecting economic revival The economic recovery of the past two years has stirred activity in various parts of the country, particularly in the industrial estates being put up to capture investment flows. The most notable is the Subic Special Economic and Freeport Zone, which is rising from the former US naval base along Subic Bay on the western fringe of the main island of Luzon. Since its conversion into an industrial estate in November 1992, the Subic zone has signed up 73 companies to set up a range of industrial and commercial operations within the 6,000-hectare facility. Of these, 44 have actually started operations. The Subic estate sits between a deep natural harbour opening up to the South China Sea and a mountain range. These features, industrial planners say, make the facility an ideal anchorage. Having been a jump-off point for American military operations in the region, the zone has an airport, shipping berths and a well-maintained road network, along with fully-operating utilities (power station, telecommunications, water and sewerage systems) and structures that can quickly be converted into warehouses, residential buildings and offices. All these make the area ideal for investors in a hurry. Its location also makes it suitable for ventures aiming at the Asian market. Subic's twin military base, Clark Field, located to its east in the central Luzon province of Pampanga, has also seen increased interest in recent months. Thirty-five companies have formalised deals with the Clark Development Corporation to set up shop in the zone. Clark is initially developing a core area of 4,440ha, of which 1,620ha have been roped off to become an aviation centre and another 1,020ha for industry. The project will be expanded by another 23,600ha to accommodate light and medium industrial and agro-industrial ventures. The aviation complex will include an international airport, to be developed from the facility left behind the US air force that withdrew from the area just before the June 1991 eruption of nearby Mount Pinatubo. Like Subic, the Clark industrial estate offers locaters immediate infrastructure facilities, including a power plant, telecommunications and a water system. Incentives await locaters in Subic and Clark. There is exemption from taxes and duties on all imports of capital goods, machinery, raw materials and finished goods; exemption from local and national taxes except for a final 5 per cent corporate tax on gross income; and tax holidays of four to six years. A highway to link the two industrial zones with metropolitan Manila is near completion, and will reduce travel time within the area. Closer to metropolitan Manila are the privately-run industrial parks that have sprouted in the Calabarzon area, which groups the five provinces surrounding the national capital - Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon. In 1990, the government designated regional industrial centres (RICs) in each of the 12 regional groupings outside metropolitan Manila, leading to the Calabarzon concept. The Calabarzon project aims to create a business corridor south and east of the national capital, to capture the city's overspill population without causing additional poverty and other social problems. The corridor has a combined land area of nearly 16,230 square kilometres, or 5.4 per cent of the whole Philippine land area, and a population of 6.35m. It is already accommodates a range of manufacturing operations set up by big US, Japanese, South Korean and European groups. The area also has an industrial base composed of oil refineries; manufacturing operations in industrial gases, non-alcoholic beverages, paper products, flour and feeds, metal products and other consumer goods; shipbuilding; food processing; and power generation. Among the first industrial estates that are now offered to investors are: Dasmarinas Industrial Estate, Gateway Business Park, GMA Industrial Estate, Cavite Industrial City, Laguna International Industrial Park, Laguna Technopark, Light Industry and Science Park of the Philippines, along with the government-run Cavite Export Processing Zone. Farther out of the capital, the government has identified the following growth centres: The Cagayan-Iligan corridor, in northern Mindanao, which is being developed as a heavy industrial centre, and a major agro-industrial and trade centre in view of its access to hydro-power sources and industrial base. el,3.5 The north-west Luzon quadrangle, said to be a potential financial centre and tourist haven, given its proximity to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and Japan. The Cotabato-Davao-Zamboanga crescent, which is being promoted as an agribusiness centre to become a major exporter of fresh and processed food and other products. The Panay-Negros pole, in the central Philippines, now being developed for light and medium manufacturing activities specialising in furniture, jewellery, toys, handicrafts, kitchen and hardware. The Leyte-Samar zone, also in the central Philippines, which is being considered as another heavy industry centre, because of its access to geothermal and hydro-power sources. The west-central Luzon zone and baselands, which may be tapped to specialise in ship and aircraft manufacturing and repair, warehousing and transshipment, defence industries, and other light-to-medium industries.</p>

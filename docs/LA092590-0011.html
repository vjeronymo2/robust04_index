			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOFTON ON MORAL INSANITY  </P> <P> In his column, Lofton admits that humans are pillaging, plundering and  obliterating not only the animals and plant life, but also each other. He has  the impudence to place this callous, greedy and destructive species in a  "higher order." Now that is moral insanity.  </P> <P> L. MASON  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Daily Mail rejects offer for Chiltern Daily Mail and General Trust has rejected the offer by CLT, one of Europe's largest private broadcasters, for its shares in Chiltern Radio, which broadcasts in the north and the Home Counties. DMGT, which recently acquired an 18.5 per cent stake in Chiltern, claimed that the offer significantly undervalued Chiltern's prospects. Luxembourg-based CLT has offered 242p per share valuing the company at Pounds 16.9m. DMGT also announced that it was buying up to 9.99 per cent of Chiltern's shares in the market at 300p each. DMGT and European Media Associates, a company formed by DMGT with European Media Partners, are seeking to buy up to 648,587 Chiltern shares. Chiltern said it planned to have talks with both DMGT and CLT.</p>

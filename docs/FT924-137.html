			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / International Company News: Soeryadjayas lose majority stake in Astra THE SOERYADJAYA family yesterday lost their majority stake in Astra International, Indonesia's dominant automotive company, when they sold 26.5m shares for Rp265bn (Dollars 129m). The buyer of the stake, 10.9 per cent of the company, has not been revealed, but brokers say it is the pension fund of state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia. Astra has been engulfed by an ownership crisis following the mid-November suspension of Bank Summa, privately owned by the Soeryadjaya family, with outstanding obligations of Rp1,600bn. On December 14, the central bank ordered Bank Summa's liquidation. Yesterday's sale leaves the Soeryadjaya family holding about 111m Astra shares, or a 46 per cent stake, most of which is pledged to banks against loans on which the family is currently in default. 'The sale shows the government is committed to supporting Astra and should provide comfort to Toyota and banks with exposure to Astra', explained one foreign broker. Toyota vehicles accounted for about half Astra's Rp4,933bn turnover in 1991 and the company is considering the purchase of 20m shares offered by Soeryadjayas. Astra has more than Dollars 900m in outstanding loans from foreign banks. Brokers said yesterday's transaction involved shares pledged to Bank Universal, which is 51 per cent owned by Astra International. Business colleagues of the Soeryadjayas said the shares were pledged against loans of about Rp250bn, equivalent to 30 per cent of the bank's total loans as of last December. Astra officials have denied details of the loans. To cover Bank Summa's obligations, the Soeryadjayas have also been negotiating the sale of at least 100m shares to a consortium led by Mr Prajogo Pangestu, a timber tycoon. An agreement was signed last week but was then blocked by Mr Sumitro Djojohadikusomo, chairman of Astra, who has since resigned his post. Talks with the consortium are continuing, although Mr Pangestu said at the weekend he valued Astra at Rp7,000 a share, against the Rp10,000 price of yesterday's deal.</p>

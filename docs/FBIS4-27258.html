			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Military Intervention"] </F>   [Text] We were surprised by the statement of the Armed  Forces Chief of Staff for Social and Political Affairs,  Lieutenant General R. Hartono, before a labor seminar on Tuesday  that the military would again take part in coordinating the  resolution of labor problems. The new policy came about just  three months after the government revoked in January a  ministerial decree allowing the Armed Forces to break up strikes.    Hartono cited the need to maintain stability, the weak  organization of the All Indonesian Labor Union (SPSI) -- the  only trade union recognized by the government -- and the lack of  labor rules to accommodate the aspirations of all parties  involved in labor issues as the main reasons for the  reinvolvement of the military in labor problems. The Armed  Forces apparently now sees labor unrest as one of the major  threats to national stability. Hartono however, warned that the  involvement should not be seen as military intervention into the  labor movement.    The new policy seemed to have been prompted by the  labor-related riots in North Sumatera which had turned into acts  of vandalism against Indonesian Chinese during the last two  weeks of last month. The incident once again shows how vital  stability and security are not only for economic activities but  for the further existence of our nationhood.    Highly-agitated workers, a high frequency of labor strikes  and street demonstrations can easily be turned by irresponsible  persons into riots and vandalism. These types of situations do  not help solve our labor problems. Instead, such scenes will  scare away investors. In fact, the labor riots in North  Sumatera have caused some potential investors to reconsider  their plans to invest in Indonesia as the incident showed how  vulnerable our stability could be.    Businessmen, either domestic or foreign, will sink their  capital in the country only when we can maintain a sense of  stability and security. Without their investments, the economy  will stagnate and no new jobs will be created for the estimated  three million unemployed and 30 million under-employed as well  as the 2.8 million new entrants to the market annually.    The question, though, is whether the high rush of labor  strikes has really required direct military involvement. We  fully agree that it is the fundamental task of the Armed Forces  to prevent labor protests or strikes from degenerating into  riots and acts of vandalism. But we wonder if that task should  be executed by directly intervening into labor issues.    We think we should instead focus our attention on the roots  of the labor unrest, that is the need for humane treatment of  workers. The trigger of most labor strikes has been the failure  by employers to adhere to the minimum wages, which are already  among the lowest in the world. We should also realize that the  greater prosperity the country has gained from its high economic  growth over the past two decades has led to rising expectations  among the people. The mood of our labor has also changed  significantly in recent years as an increasing number of  blue-collar workers are graduates or dropouts of secondary  schools who are much more vocal and outspoken and more aware of  their basic rights than those who have only primary schooling.  Obviously, the authoritative management style which was  effective in managing meek workers in the past is no longer  suitable now.    We think labor protests or unrest can be prevented by the  strong enforcement of the minimum wage levels and other manpower  regulations to protect the workers' rights. The mechanism for  company or plant-level labor management has been established in  the requirement for companies to have a collective labor  agreement. What is quite lacking though is the quality of the  tripartite negotiations and consultations for such an agreement.    We have learned that in many companies such negotiations are  in fact no more than a formality because the management has made  up its mind before consulting with the workers' representatives.  Given the weakness of the SPSI trade union and the weak  bargaining position of the workers, it is the responsibility of  the officials of the manpower ministry to help workers strike  mutually beneficial labor agreement.</p>

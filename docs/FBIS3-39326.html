The agreement eased international tensions which had been  tightened another notch a day earlier by the most unequivocal in  a series of claims that Pyongyang has an active nuclear weapons  programme.    But the accord makes no provision for inspection of the two  Yongbyon sites where the suspected nuclear arms facility is  based.    IAEA spokesman David Kyd said the two sides had reached an  accord on inspecting seven identified sites and that a six- or  seven-strong IAEA mission of two to three weeks' duration would  enter North Korea as soon as visa formalities had been dealt  with.    Welcoming the accord, Kyd said that, if all went well, the  mission could get under way in the next few days, adding that  Pyongyang had accepted all IAEA demands concerning the nature of  the inspections.    He stressed the agreement did not cover the two undeclared  sites at Yongbyon, where the IAEA suspected that Pyongyang was  illegally stockpiling liquid and solid nuclear waste.    He said those sites would be the subject of future  negotiations.    The accord comes six days before a meeting of IAEA governors  at which future relations with North Korea are due to be  discussed.    Kyd added that the aim of the inspections at the seven  declared sites was to "verify that nuclear material in these  facilities has not been diverted since earlier inspections."    "In addition, inspectors will take certain measures, such as  reloading of cameras and changing of seals, to facilitate future  verifications." [passage omitted]    Earlier Tuesday in Tokyo, Japan's JIJI Press quoted official  South Korean sources as saying Pyongyang's absolute leader Kim  Il-Sung had proposed a meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton  over the nuclear issue.    Kim made the proposal through U.S. Southern Baptist  evangelist Billy Graham, who met the North Korean president and  party chief when he visited Pyongyang in late January, the  sources said.    Russian researchers told JIJI Monday that the former Soviet  Union had been engaged in a joint plan with North Korea to build  a nuclear bomb until 1985, and that Russian scientists continued  to provide clandestine assistance to Pyongyang.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Howard to pay costs after raid The High Court yesterday ordered Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, to pay court costs estimated at between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 150,000 for unlawfully authorising the police to seek a warrant to raid a leading London law firm. The court ordered that documents seized during the raid on the offices of City solicitors Theodore Goddard and accountants Stein Richards be returned. Mr Howard had denied that he or the Home Office had acted unlawfully in responding to a request from the Australian government for mutual assistance in a criminal investigation. The court said, however, that he had failed to follow the correct procedures for handling such a request under the 1990 Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act. In August last year Mr Howard received a request from the Australian director of public prosecutions for assistance in obtaining information wanted in connection with an investigation involving the Sydney-based company, Scheinberg, owner of the Best &amp; Less retail chain. After vetting the request Mr Howard passed it to the Metropolitan Police, giving them a free hand in deciding what procedures to follow. Following a further request in October, which was passed by the Home Office to the police without vetting, the police obtained search warrants from an Old Bailey judge and raided the offices of the two City firms. Both act for Scheinberg. The documents seized were then handed by the police directly to the Australians, in breach of the terms of the 1990 Act which requires the home secretary to check first that they are the correct documents and are not privileged. Theodore Goddard immediately obtained an injunction to stop the Australians removing the documents from the UK and applied for a judicial review of the home secretary's original decision to authorise the police to seek the warrants. Quashing the judge's decision to issue the search warrants, Mr Justice Laws said the home secretary had been wrong to give the police a free hand in deciding how to execute the request for help. The act required him to provide direction. He said Mr Howard's decision to allow the police to hand the documents directly to the Australians without checking them was also unlawful. The home secretary said last night that he was considering an appeal.</p>

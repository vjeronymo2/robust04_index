			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Nuclear Electric presents Pounds 1bn subsidy plan Nuclear Electric, the state-owned electricity generation company, has outlined an option for financing a new power station at Sizewell in Suffolk which would require an initial government subsidy of up to Pounds 1bn. The company says the subsidy would enable it to offer rates of return which would attract private-sector investors to fund the remainder of the Pounds 3.5bn cost (in 1993 prices) of building the station. The Pounds 1bn up-front payment is just one of a series of options for building the 2,600MW station, the company has stressed in a series of briefings with politicians on the government's nuclear review. Other ways for the state to encourage the construction of Sizewell C with largely private-sector finance could include continuing the nuclear levy on electricity consumers after its planned expiry in 1998. According to the company the amount needed would be less than a fifth of the total of more than Pounds 1bn a year now collected through the levy. Nuclear Electric's opponents will argue that the company's estimates are further evidence of nuclear power's inability to compete in the market. The Treasury is firmly opposed to providing the company with more state funds. It is continuing to press strongly for the company's early privatisation even though Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, has said a sell-off before the next election is highly unlikely. Treasury ministers believe the government could sell both Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear without new legislation by using privatisation measures approved by parliament in the late 1980s. Nuclear Electric sees privatisation as its priority in the review. It says that in presenting options for funding Sizewell C and other stations it is responding to the government's request for suggestions on building new plant. 'We are not asking for government money to build Sizewell C,' said Mr Mike Kirwan, finance director. 'We are merely explaining the possibilities for building it.' New nuclear stations could play an important role in reducing UK emissions of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide, the company argued. Nuclear Electric said that if the government subsidised Sizewell C with an initial Pounds 1bn, it is possible that no more money would be needed from the state if market prices per unit of electricity were 2.7p or above when the station started to produce electricity. Anything below that might need an extra injection of funding either from electricity consumers or the taxpayer. Prices in the wholesale market are likely to average 2.4p this year and the plant would not produce electricity until after 2000. But many electricity market analysts think prices may not rise much in the next decade or so because of the abundance of gas supplies. Nuclear Electric has also floated the possibility of building a smaller station at Hinkley in Somerset at a cost of Pounds 2bn. Although the state support needed for this would be less, unit costs would be higher because it would not benefit from the same economies of scale as the twin-reactor Sizewell C. The company's figures are based on the assumption that the private sector would require a return on capital of 11 per cent.</p>

Esteemed members of Government!    For several days there have been reports in various mass  media and on television and the radio concerning the closure of  the newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, the inaugurator of which was  the former Russian Federation Council of Ministers. The reason  for the destruction of a newspaper which in the course of the  past year has become one of Russia's leading publications, and  one, moreover, with its own identity (which is very rare for the  present rich newspaper market) is the decision of the  journalists' collective to become the founder of its newspaper.  In our view the arguments for and aims of this decision are set  forth with full justification in published items (ROSSIYSKIYE  VESTI Nos. 250, 254, and 1-2).    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's desire to become an autonomous and free  representative of the mass media, independent of organs of  power, cannot and should not be viewed as a compromise or an  attempt to enter into opposition with the government. On the  contrary, we are sure that the theme of power and society, the  theme of the establishment of Russian statehood, which have been  the main ones in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI and its supplement -- VEKHI,  the newspaper of the independent intelligentsia -- must remain  leading ones. It is this free and open expression of feelings  and profound thoughts about Russia's paths, its economy,  politics, and culture, and about man above all, which must not  be fettered by any bureaucratic pressure or membership of the  apparatus.    In the democratic state which we have proclaimed and in  which  we are all learning to live there should be no "vassal press."  Otherwise we shall return again to the obedient semi-official  organ of PRAVDA and authoritarian methods of leadership.    As readers of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI we cannot fail to note that  the VEKHI supplement is as of today the only platform to express  the views and arguments, positions and creations of the most  diverse writers, journalists, critics, historians, philosophers,  and art critics.    Do not allow the destruction of a child in whose birth you  yourselves were involved! Defend the interests of our fellow  citizens and readers who have chosen ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. And  there are 600,000 of them.

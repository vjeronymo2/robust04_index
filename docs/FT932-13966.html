			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Letter: External threats to America's competitiveness Sir, Michael Prowse ('Revolutionary talk in Wisconsin', April 19) reports John Diebold talking of the need for a new word: 'infostructure'. It is perhaps a testimony to the truth of the adage that nothing can stop an idea whose time has come, that I came to a similar conclusion, independently, last year when writing The Race to the Intelligent State (Blackwell Business, 1993). I use the word, perhaps in a slightly broader sense than does Mr Diebold, throughout the book. It is curious, as your article suggests, that the US government should have taken such a laisser-faire approach to the issue of integrated broadband networks, which is generally thought to be of great significance to America's future competitiveness; however, such a resolutely non-interventionist attitude in the face of a growing problem is hardly unprecedented. It was only, for example, the launch of Sputnik in 1957 which propelled America into the space race and, to paraphrase Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (commander in chief of the Japan's war-time combined fleet), some external threat is often needed to awaken the sleeping giant. If Mr Al Gore is seeking an external threat to justify government initiative, he need hardly look further than Nippon Telegraph and Telephone's plans for a nationwide broadband network to serve the whole of Japan by 2015. The Japanese do not share the American aversion to co-ordinated planning and seem likely to ensure that the competitive stakes will remain high.

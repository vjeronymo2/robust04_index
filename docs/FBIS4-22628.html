			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Economic report using data of the Russian State Committee </F> on Statistics: "Production Output and Dynamics of Prices as of  15 March"]    [Text]  <H5>  Prices of Consumer Goods and Services </H5>   Over the period 5 through 15 March 1994 a growth of 2.4  percent was observed in the prices of consumer goods and  services, including a growth of 1.7 percent for food products.  Food products in cities of the Northern Caucasus and Eastern  Siberia experienced the greatest price increases (2.7-3.1  percent), while virtually no change was seen in food product  prices in cities of Western Siberia, the Urals, and Central  Chernozem. The rate of growth of prices for nonfood products was  3.1 percent, for services--3.5 percent.    The following table shows price indexes for goods and  services in the consumer market (as a percentage of the previous  date):                    28 Feb     5 Mar      15 Mar     Average      Average                                                   daily        daily price                                                   price        growth in                                                   growth in    February                                                   March   Consumer        101.5      101.7      102.4      0.27         0.34  goods and  services   including:   Food products   101.2      101.5      101.7      0.23         0.32    Nonfood         101.9      101.5      103.1      0.32         0.34  products   Paid services   101.7      104.8      103.5      0.54         0.48  to the  populace      Over the first 15 days of March, prices for goods and  services increased by 4.1 percent (since the beginning of the  year--by 38.4 percent), including the prices of food  products--by 3.2 percent (36.7 percent), nonfood products--by  4.7 percent (29.5 percent), and services to the populace--by 8.5  percent (2.2-fold).

Prices for vegetable oil,  meat products, and sugar stood virtually unchanged.    In nonorganized trade, as in organized trade, the largest  increase in prices was recorded for vegetables and fowl (4-9  percent). Prices for dairy products virtually remained at their  previous level. The average price of oranges dropped 4 percent.    The cost of a selection of 19 basic food products rose 1.8  percent over the week, amounting to 43,000 rubles [R] per month  as of 15 March. The differentiation factor between observed  cities was 3.6. St. Petersburg and Moscow rank 35th and 36th out  of 132 observed cities with respect to cost of the selection  (R47,020 and R46,960 per month).    Nonfood products. Over the period 5 through 15  March, the greatest price increases were observed for fabrics  and medicinal preparations (4.7-6.2 percent), and garments and  knitted articles (2.8-3.4 percent).

Rates increased 5-8 percent for  certain varieties of everyday services (shoe repair, barber  services, baths, and a number of other services).  <H5>  Costs of Producers of Industrial Production Output </H5>   The index of wholesale prices for producers of industrial  output was lower in February than in January, amounting to 116  percent. Prices increased 37 percent over the first two months  of this year (as compared with December 1993). The following  table characterizes changes in wholesale prices in February for  sectors of industry:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |February 1994 as compare-|February 1994 as compare-|  |                         |d with January 1994, per-|d with December 1993, pe-|  |                         |cent                     |rcent                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industry, total          |116                      |137                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |including:               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Electric power           |116                      |143                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fuel industry            |122                      |152                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ferrous metallurgy       |112                      |121                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nonferrous metallurgy    |111                      |125                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chemical industry        |113                      |141                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Petrochemical industry   |118                      |136                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Machine building         |117                      |141                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Timber, woodworking, and |113                      |136                      |  |pulp and paper industry  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Building materials indus-|116                      |140                      |  |try                      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Light industry           |116                      |130                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Food industry            |112                      |128                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The rate of growth of prices was lower in February than in  January in practically all sectors of industry (except in  ferrous metallurgy, the petrochemical industry, and light  industry). At the same time, high rates of price growth were  continued for fuel industry output. Prices for oil increased 28  percent in February, natural gas--24 percent, oil products--19  percent, and coal--9 percent. As of 28 February, the average  price of coal was R13,000 per tonne, oil--R52,000, gas--R3,200  per thousand cubic meters, gasoline--R143,000, and diesel  fuel--R132,000 per tonne.    The increased prices for energy resources and their  byproducts continued to exert an influence on the cost of  electric power. Electric power rates increased 1.3-1.4-fold over  the January-February period. As of 28 February, the cost of one  kilowatt-hour of electric power came to about R25 on the average  for all categories of consumers.    In the machine-building sectors in February, the most  significant price increases were observed in the output of  tractor and agricultural machine-building (by 41 percent on the  average), railroad, mining, and ore-mining machine-building (by  27 percent), and the bearing and bushing industry (by 29  percent).    The price index was 116 percent for light industry--4  percentage points higher than in January, primarily due to the  large price increases for cotton and flax fabrics, rugs and  carpets, leather goods, sportswear, and certain other items.    The price increase for food industry output in February was  12 percent (15 percent in January). The price rise was within  the limits of 10-15 percent for basic food products--bread and  bakery products, meat products, fats and oils; 18-20 percent for  dairy products and butter. No change was observed in the prices  of sugar and certain varieties of canned fruits and vegetables.    On the whole, the increase in prices was lower for consumer  goods over the two months than for technical production output.  These indexes were 28 and 40 percent, respectively.    Acquisition costs. The increase in costs, February  over January, for basic varieties of material-technical  resources acquired by industrial enterprises was 13 percent,  including 12 percent--from suppliers in Russia, 22 percent--from  CIS member states, and 16 percent--from countries of the far  abroad. Over the first two months of this year, prices for the  material-technical resources acquired by industry increased 34  percent.    Costs for the acquisition of fuel resources rose by 13  percent over the month, including for oil--by 19 percent,  natural gas--by 14 percent, furnace fuel oil and diesel fuel--by  15-18 percent. Enterprises of the oil processing industry  procured oil at the price of R80,000 per tonne on the average in  February (production cost--R52,000). The cost of natural gas  used in the electric power industry came to R32,000 per thousand  cubic meters on the average (production cost--R3,200); the  average cost of energy-producing coal was R19,000, and coking  coal--R50,000 per tonne, while the production cost of coal was  R13,000.    The price index for sale of livestock production output by  procurement organizations in February of this year was lower  than the January level and amounted to 112 percent. The average  price (not taking subsidies into account) of one kilogram of  livestock and fowl (live weight) in Russia was R773; a liter of  milk--R145; 10 eggs--R688. Prices increased 29 percent over the  two months (as compared to December 1993).    The seasonal reduction in milk purchases was followed by a  high rate of price increase with respect to milk sales in  January-February (16-18 percent). Prices for livestock, fowl,  and eggs increased 9-10 percent in February.    Costs for the producers of agricultural output rose 10  percent in February, 28 percent--since the beginning of the  year. This includes an increase of 27-38 percent for machinery  and equipment used in plant-growing and livestock-breeding,  trucks, and mixed fodders, and an increase of 46-51 percent for  mineral fertilizers and electric power.    Costs in capital construction. Actual costs for  capital investments rose 17 percent in February of this year  over the previous month's levels; for construction and  installation work--12 percent. The increases over levels of  December of last year were 46 and 50 percent, respectively.    The rise in cost of building materials was more significant.  Over the month, prices for materials acquired by contractor  construction organizations increased by 26 percent. The increase  was 51 percent since the beginning of the year. The costs of  enterprises that produce building materials increased by 16 and  40 percent, respectively.    The following table shows price indexes for the acquisition  of main groupings of building materials:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |February 1994 as compare-|February 1994 as compare-|  |                         |d with January 1994, per-|d with December 1993, pe-|  |                         |cent                     |rcent                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Construction brick       |145                      |198                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Crushed stone and gravel |145                      |194                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cement                   |154                      |201                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ceramic tile             |122                      |172                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Linoleum                 |138                      |178                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Window glass             |126                      |139                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Paints and varnishes     |140                      |161                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      One of the basic reasons for the galloping price increases  in  acquisition of certain varieties of materials is the swift rise  in cost of transportation, supply, and sales services. In  February of this year, their share came to 14 percent of the  acquisition costs on the average for basic types of materials,  for crushed stone and gravel--about 50 percent; their share of  the acquisition costs for cement, asphalt-concrete mix,  asbestos-cement sheeting, and construction brick was over 15  percent.  <H5>  Industrial Production </H5>   Over the first 13 days of March 1994, of 163 production  varieties taken into consideration for periodic reporting, the  average daily production volume as compared with the same period  of March 1993:    --increased for 16 entries, or 10 percent of the  total (including city telephone network cable, polypropylene,  movie film, magnetic tape, cotton fabrics, knitting machines,  school notebooks, pencils, fatty cheeses and feta cheese, toilet  soap, filter and nonfilter cigarettes, and shaving cream);    --decreased for 142 entries, or 87 percent of the  total.    As compared to the same period of February 1994, this  average  daily production volume:    --increased for 54 entries, or 33 percent of the  total (including electric power, motor vehicle gasoline, diesel  fuel, cast iron, steel, finished rolled metal, sulfuric acid,  mineral fertilizers, soda ash, synthetic ammonia, wheeled  cranes, automobiles, tractors, sawn lumber, cardboard, slate,  asbestos-cement pipes, sleeves, and joints, video cassette  recorders, color televisions, knitting machines, cameras,  motorcycles, flax, hemp, and jute fabrics, raincoats, footwear,  butter, fatty cheeses and feta cheese, canned meats and milk,  confectionery items, salt, food concentrates, and mineral water);    --decreased for 104 entries, or 64 percent of the  total.    Proceeding from the dynamics of output of the most important  production varieties, the average daily volume of industrial  production for the period of March 1994 which transpired is  estimated to comprise 73 percent of the level for the same  period of March of last year.

Due to  insufficient sowing of winter crops, adverse wintering  conditions, and reduced autumn plowing, the volume of field work  to be accomplished this spring is great. Winter crops for this  year's yield were sown over an area of 15.5 million hectares (20  percent less than last year), including 14.3 million hectares  (20 percent) for grain. According to data from the Russian  Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental  Monitoring, the condition of winter crops on the whole across  the Russian Federation can be expected to be unsatisfactory over  an area of 2.0-2.5 million hectares, or 13-16 percent of the  total area of winter grains and green forage, as opposed to 1.9  million hectares (9 percent) on the average for the past five  years. Autumn plowing was accomplished over 41.9 million  hectares--6.2 million (13 percent) less than in the fall of 1992.    The degree of provision of farms with seeds of spring grain  crops is somewhat worse in general than last year (especially  with respect to buckwheat, rice, and legumes). In  January-February 1994, agricultural clients were supplied 0.9  million tonnes of lime-containing materials (55 percent less  than during the same period last year), 0.4 million tonnes of  motor vehicle gasoline (49 percent less), 0.8 million tonnes of  diesel fuel (52 percent less), and 10.3 million tonnes of peat  (56 percent less).

Remaining fodder per standard head of livestock amounted 8.2  feed-unit quintals on average at the beginning of March of this  year, as opposed to 7.5 feed-unit quintals as of this time last  year.    In January-February of this year, procurement organizations  effected purchases for state resources, from all producers, a  volume of livestock and poultry 28 percent less than during the  same period last year, milk--21 percent less, and eggs--6  percent less. In this regard, agricultural enterprises increased  their sales of livestock production at markets, through their  own stores, through the public kitchen system, and through other  channels. In all over the two-month period, these enterprises  sold 13 percent of the total sales volume of livestock and  poultry outside the state procurement network, 4 percent of the  milk, and 7 percent of the eggs.

The coefficient of income concentration (Gini coefficient)  in  February 1994 was 0.301 (in January--0.343).    Values of the subsistence minimum for the Russian Federation  populace (determined in accordance with Russian Ministry of  Labor methodology) are as follows:                   Average monthly per capita figure, rubles                  Entire           Working          Pensioners       Children                 population       population   October 1993   32,400           36,600           22,800           32,400    November       37,900           42,800           26,700           37,900  1993   December       42,800           48,400           30,200           42,800  1993   January 1994   51,400           58,000           36,200           51,300    February       56,600           63,700           39,900           56,900  1994      Monetary income for a portion of the population was even  lower than the cost of the food product selection taken into  account when calculating the subsistence minimum.

The amount of pension  equalization was increased. As a result, there was a significant  decrease from the January level in the numbers and percentages  of the population with disposal incomes lower than the  subsistence minimum. In January 1993, the proportion of the  population with monetary income lower than the subsistence  minimum was 35.5 percent; in February 1993 it was 27.2 percent.    According to estimates, the average wage accrued by  employees  in February was R150,000, an increase of 6 percent over December  1993. The amount of real wages in February of this year,  calculated taking into account the consumer price index, was 80  percent of the level for December 1993.    The following table shows data on the average wage for  January of this year, both overall and for certain sectors of  the economy:                       Average monthly wage (not including     Social payments                     material aid or social benefits)        (material                                                             assistance, food                                                             supplements,                                                             transportation                                                             supplements,                                                             etc.), in rubles                       Rubles      Factor       Percentage                                 increase     of December                                 over         1993                                 January                                 1993   Total              134,200     8.6          95             7,900   including:   Industry           138,600     7.5          95             10,800   Agriculture        58,100      6.8          66             3,100   Construction       171,400     8.7          88             13,800   Transportation     224,000     10.4         106            8,400   Public health,     122,500     10.7         109            5,400  physical  training, social  protection   Education          113,600     9.0          116            4,400   Culture and art    101,100     9.5          119            7,300   Science and        94,700      9.3          99             5,700  scientific  services   Credits and        326,200     8.9          69             62,100  insurance   Apparatus of       165,600     10.3         101            18,900  government  organs      The reduction in wages in January of this year in a number  of  sectors of the economy is related to lump-sum payments for  annual results which were made at the end of last year.    As of the beginning of 1994, there were 36.1 million  pensioners in the Russian Federation registered with organs for  social protection of the populace. There are 244 pensioners for  every 1,000 in population (as of 1 January 1993, this figure was  238; as of 1 January 1991--222).</p>

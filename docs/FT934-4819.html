			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After the Budget: West coast rail bids to be invited Plans to proceed with much-delayed moves to involve private companies in a Pounds 400m-Pounds 600m modernisation of the west coast mainline railway were announced by the government yesterday. Private companies are to be asked 'within the next few days' to bid for a contract to draw up performance specifications for the line, which runs between London and Glasgow, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said. That work is expected to take nine months. Once detailed specifications have been agreed, the private sector will be invited to bid late next year to carry out the work on the track and signalling. Work on the line will start in 1995 and take between seven and 10 years. The companies concerned will earn a return on their investment in the form of service payments from Railtrack, the company which has been set up to own and manage British Rail's track and signalling. The level of fees will depend on the quality and reliability of the service they offer and be subject to penalties and bonuses. Involving private companies will take no longer than if the project had been financed from public funds, Mr MacGregor said. But the work will have to take into account the need to keep services running on the line. No government funding will be put into the project. Government funding will meet only half of the money needed to maintain and modernise London's Underground system over the next three years, Sir Wilfrid Newton, London Transport chairman, said yesterday. Despite Department of Transport efforts to spare it the worst of spending cuts in the Budget, the Underground will still not be given enough money to maintain 'a decently modern metro', he said.</p>

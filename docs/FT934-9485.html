			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: US metals merger cleared THE US Justice Department gave the all-clear on Monday for a merger, announced in May, between two US metals and mining giants, Colorado-based Cyprus Minerals and New York-based Amax. The department cleared the sale of the two companies' molybdenite units. But to satisfy anti-trust concerns raised by the merger, the companies, along with others involved in the molybdenite business, were told they are subject to an ongoing investigation into violations of anti-trust laws. Molybdenite is a metal used to produce heat-resistant alloys used primarily in the aerospace and defence industries. Cyprus and Amax produce the metal as a by-product of other mining operations and both process molybdenite. In the Justice Department decision, they agreed to sell operations in Idaho and Pennsylvania. Amax said the decision makes way for a Friday shareholding vote on the merger, which will form the second largest copper producer in the US and give it a dominant presence in the US coal industry. Pending shareholder approval, Amax will distribute 40 per cent ownership in Amax Gold to shareholders, spin off its Alumax aluminium unit in a tax-free distribution, and combine its remaining assets with Cyprus Minerals.</p>

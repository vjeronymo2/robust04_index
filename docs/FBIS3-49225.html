			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UP Sejm Deputy Ryszard Bugaj by Jan Bazyl </F> Lipszyc; place and date not given: "Lack of a Broader Concept"]    [Text] [Lipszyc] After the Sejm speech of Prime Minister  Pawlak, you said that the Union of Labor [UP] could not support  a budget that is a continuation of its predecessors. Are you  going to vote against the bill that has been submitted in the  Sejm? If you are, why?    [Bugaj] We have not discussed this yet; however, I believe  that we really could not support such a budget. After the prime  minister's statement, I said that we would try to work on the  budget, to look for a formula that would be acceptable. The  version that we received includes some insignificant changes,  but they do not correspond to the possibilities offered by the  state's finances.    If we believe these estimates, then, for the first time, the  drop in the budget's revenues is supposed to be curbed; it is a  certain effort to increase those revenues. The only thing is, it  is a pity that it is supposed to be done at the cost of  middle-class taxpayers. This could have been done differently.    We have three kinds of urgent needs: social expenditures  (Minister Leszek Miller speaks about minimum amounts of money  that he needs--for example, for social care, which is quite a  lot); considerable aid for the restructuring of industry (the  budget earmarks proverbial peanuts for that), and the Army  because the international situation is quite complex. If we  realize what a dramatic situation is caused by these shortages,  we should look for the money, even if we were to take  controversial measures.    [Lipszyc] If I understood you correctly, you believe that we  need several dozen trillion zlotys [Z] more.    [Bugaj] I suppose that it is a sum in the area of Z30-50  trillion.    [Lipszyc] How can the budget receive additional money, and  why did neither this government nor its predecessors take  advantage of such a possibility?    [Bugaj] I cannot really answer the second part of that  question. I think we could have greater revenues from excise  taxes; they could yield even more than a dozen trillion zlotys.    [Lipszyc] Some people are surprised that the government  predicts fuel price raises that are supposed to be lower than  the inflation level. I gather that you are equally surprised.    [Bugaj] I certainly am. The excise also comprises some  luxury  goods; however, what we must bear in mind is the demand barrier.  Nevertheless, in my opinion, we are separated from this barrier  by a few trillion zlotys that could be collected. There will be  no revolution because of higher vodka and cigarette prices.    Another issue is the maximum VAT [value-added tax] rate. It  is quite high, but not the highest. The previous government  proposed that VAT rates on energy carriers be raised....    [Lipszyc] And it was rejected by the opposition, including  UP.    [Bugaj] And rightly so. What we could consider, however, is  the idea of raising the average rate by one point, or even a  little less. This would not threaten to fuel inflation; it would  charge everyone just a little in this difficult situation. Now,  the third issue: We could take some money from well-off citizens  for future privatization. It would be some kind of a  privatization loan. As a result of this, people would buy fewer  imported luxury goods because such an operation would take some  of their money away from them.    Another thing that could be done is introducing a small  Treasury fee for crossing the border. It would have to be small  enough--for example, Z100,000. It could not greatly affect the  costs of those who cross the border once a year; however, it  would have to be quite a sum for those who cross the border many  times, doing things that are not really favorable to Poland.    [Lipszyc] Why, then, did neither the previous authorities  nor  the present ones reach for those revenues, even though they  differ from each other so much?    [Bugaj] I think I am close to the banal conclusion that all  of the budgets of the past four years were prepared by Minister  Misiag; therefore, what is confined by his imagination also  determines the imagination of the government.    I have said enough about revenues. Now let us talk about the  size of the deficit. There is one argument of the opponents of a  big deficit, and it cannot be underestimated: the problem of the  increasing domestic debt. However, to an insignificant extent,  we could afford to do what Leszek Balcerowicz did in 1991--that  is, to monetize the deficit, certainly on a much smaller scale.    [Lipszyc] This means the Central Bank printing money. What  about the danger of increasing inflation?    [Bugaj] In 1991, the budget deficit increased, whereas  inflation decreased. Those who speak about a close correlation  between inflation and the deficit in the Polish circumstances  must be hard pressed to explain it when they compare these data.  This is not such a simple interdependence.    We can afford to slacken financial policy a little bit,  keeping our foot on the brake pedal. This is the last moment  because there is still a chance to start a simple production  increase. It is the last moment because the wealth of  enterprises is undergoing decapitalization, and, in two or three  years' time, money will have to be invested to increase  production.    [Lipszyc] Can the budget, as proposed by the government, be  implemented at all?    [Bugaj] I do not feel up to answering this question right  now. I warned that last year's budget was underestimated as far  as revenues were concerned, and I was right. However, I said  that after I checked various data and after some things were  explained to me by the finance minister. Now I have some doubts.  However, I must find out more about it. For example, what is the  chance that investment facilitations will result in a  considerable increase in investments, which quasi-popiwek [tax  on excessive wage increases] measures the government wants to  introduce.    The materials we received take up more than 500 pages;  however, the key issues are described only in general terms. For  example, what is the government's concept, what is the  calculation of the global demand for domestic products?    [Lipszyc] What is this budget like, then? Is it once again  the result of compromises and pulling a small blanket in all  directions?    [Bugaj] It was prepared not as a result of adopting some  kind  of an economic policy; it is the result of the demands of the  various ministries, which have their needs and fixed  expenditures, as well as the result of the efforts of the  finance minister, who warded off any attempt to increase  expenditures.    The most horrible addition to the budget is the annex on  privatization. I have not seen such a nuisance for quite a long  time. There is nothing there that can serve as a good argument.    Thus, the budget bill is the result of the lack of a broader  concept; it is the effect of looking only at tomorrow, without  trying to show what may happen until the end of the year.    [Lipszyc] UP would like to make solid changes in the bill in  the Sejm. Is this possible?    [Bugaj] We will propose that individual problems be  discussed. If the government agrees, we will be able to do some  real work. If it turns out that there is no chance to make any  substantial corrections, we should vote against the budget. Let  it be the budget of the government and that is that.    [Lipszyc] Can the coalition fall apart because of the  budget?    [Bugaj] I do not think so. The coalition realizes that the  self-government elections will be held in the spring. Now, the  tactics of the deputies of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement  lies in the following: Make a lot of noise, but back out at the  most important moment. I would like the coalition to crack: If  it gets rid of the liberal wing, it will offer a possibility of  carrying out a little different policy and of introducing more  radical changes. Then we could support the coalition more  strongly, which we cannot do now. However, the time for that has  not yet come. It must turn out first that the optimism  concerning the economic prospects within the policy of  continuation is not really justified.</p>

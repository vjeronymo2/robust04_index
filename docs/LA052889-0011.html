Knopf: $16.95; 175 pp.)  </P> <P> "Anyone who lives in California and yearns to find good new writers will fall  upon this book with glad cries . . . because of (Gummerman's) uncanny  management of dialogue and the luminous texture of lives that the rest of us  barely give a thought to." -- Carolyn See  </P> <P> AMERICAN GENESIS  </P> <P> A Century of Invention and  </P> <P> Technological Enthusiasm  </P> <P> by Thomas P. Hughes  </P> <P> (Viking: $24.95; 349 pp.)  </P> <P> "The central thesis is simple and compelling.

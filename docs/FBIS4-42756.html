The waste stems from chemicals, paint  residues, and other dangerous substances from a closed-down  plant of the former GDR. After news of the illegal transport  had been received, the approximate 200 tonnes of waste were  placed in temporary storage in Hungary. It was said in Budapest  that those responsible for the toxic waste scandal cannot be  made answerable for it, because the relevant legislation  contains loopholes and the persons responsible have disappeared.  The toxic waste, which Germany is getting back "after long  talks," is to be handed over at the Austro-German border.  Storage and transport costs amount to about 170,000 marks.    In 1993, Lower Saxony exported almost half its toxic waste  to  other German laender and abroad. Altogether, some 417,562  tonnes of special waste were disposed of, said Schulze-Rickmann,  the general manager of the Lower Saxon Company for the Disposal  of Special Waste, yesterday. In addition, there were several  hundred thousand tonnes of toxic waste that were disposed of by  producers internally.</p>

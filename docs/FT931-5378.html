			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Almost 3.5m out of work in Germany RECESSION and harsh winter weather drove German unemployment up to almost 3.5m last month. An increase of 42,000 in the west was partly offset by a 10,000 drop in the east, but short-time working increased by 200,000 to almost 1.25m. Meanwhile, the Bayer chemicals group unveiled plans to put 3,000 people on short time, and Porsche, the sports car maker, confirmed the loss of a further 1,800 jobs during the course of this year. The rise in unemployment, taking the rate to 7.5 per cent in the west and 14.5 per cent in the east, is expected to continue for at least another year. According to new Deutsche Bank forecasts, the total will hit 4m in early 1994. Yesterday's news was accompanied by further evidence of the rapid advance of recession into manufacturing. In Baden-Wurttemberg, home state to Daimler-Benz and Porsche, industrial output during January was 22 per cent lower than a year earlier. This compared with an average fall of 13 per cent in other Lander (states), the regional government said. Output from the motor industry, hit especially hard by short-time working, fell more than 50 per cent. Turnover in the west's wholesale trade slumped a real 12 per cent in January, the federal statistics office said. No breakdown of the figure was available, although analysts said the drop was caused partly by a shopping boom late last year in advance of an increase in value added tax on January 1. Mr Johann Eekhoff, a top Economics Ministry official, said wage increases should be held below the rate of growth in productivity for an 'extended period'. The labour market had to undergo a 'massive structural change', he said. In addition to those unemployed and working short time, a further 300,000 east Germans were being kept off the jobless register in government-subsidised work creation programmes. He also complained that large numbers of people were employed in uneconomic state-subsidised industries.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / League table for Names' agents SHARP DIFFERENCES in the performances of members' agencies at the Lloyd's insurance market are disclosed in a survey published yesterday by the Association of Lloyd's Members, the organisation which represents more than 9,000 Names. Members agents handle the affairs of Names whose assets support Lloyd's. Two small agencies - Hardy and Gravett &amp; Tilling - come top of the ALM league table, producing average pre-tax profits (before Lloyd's and agency charges) of 9.8 per cent and 8 per cent (of gross capacity or allowable premium income) respectively in the five years 1986 to 1990. The best performing larger agencies were Kiln, Roberts &amp; Hiscox and Murray Lawrence, which produced average returns for Names of 5.2 per cent, 4.8 per cent and 4.4 per cent in the same five years. Some 65 agencies are currently active in the Lloyd's market compared to 250 in 1984.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Arthur Winspear, a pioneer on Lex: Obituary ARTHUR WINSPEAR, one of the creators of the Financial Times Lex Column, and for many years a corporate finance executive at SG Warburg, has died aged 70. Arthur Winspear began his career at the Investors Chronicle and moved to the FT in the mid 1950s to become a specialist Lex writer. He brought both a keen intelligence and a sharp critical faculty to the job, developing the style of logical analysis and sharp opinion which has become the hallmark of the column. He was also, however, noted for a certain eccentricity, working in an office with files piled to the ceiling, and being notoriously late with copy, which was often written out longhand with a pencil. This led to a much-related episode when, having missed the deadline for Lex, he sought to make up time by tossing the copy out of an upper window at the FT's old premises in Coleman Street to a courier waiting below to take it to the printers. Unfortunately the Lex Column became lodged on an inaccessible window-ledge. The high point of Winspear's FT career came with the famous 'Aluminium War' between November 1958 and January 1959, when the old guard of the City of London sought to block a bid by Tube Investments and Reynolds Metals for British Aluminium. Winspear pursued a fiercely independent line, unaffected by the commercial links between the FT's new owner Pearson - which had bought the paper in 1957 - and Lazard Brothers and Whitehall Trust, which were heavily involved in the campaign to block the bid. He attacked a plan for the issue by British Aluminium of a blocking shareholding to Alcoa, and finally advised the rejection of another defensive device, a consortium offer by leading City institutions. The affair is remembered at the FT particularly for establishing the paper's editorial independence. Victory for TI brought fame to its previously little-known adviser Siegmund Warburg, and in 1960 the merchant banker recruited Winspear himself to help establish a more enduring presence in the rapidly developing field of corporate finance. He became a director of Warburgs in 1965, a position he retained until his retirement 20 years later. He was involved in innumerable takeover battles, and colleagues particularly remember his close involvement in the building up of the Reed group, including its takeover of Wall Paper Manufacturers. The exceptional powers of analysis and great clarity of expression which had become apparent on the Lex Column also served him well at Warburgs. He became popular for his Yorkshire sense of humour, although his wayward observation of deadlines continued to create anxiety among his colleagues. Arthur Winspear had undergone several major operations in the past few years and his health remained poor, although he continued to be active. After his retirement he took pride in helping to fend off repeated takeover bids for Johnson Group Cleaners, of which - along with The Development and Realisation Trust - he remained a non-executive director until his death. He leaves a wife, Joan, and two daughters.</p>

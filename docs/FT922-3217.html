			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Lyonnaise des Eaux sees 20% recovery LYONNAISE des Eaux Dumez, the French water utility-to- construction group, yesterday forecast a 20 per cent profits recovery for the current year and said more asset sales were on the way. Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, said that the group expected to achieve the earnings improvement despite the continuing poor climate in building and construction. Net profits last year fell to FFr1.17bn (Dollars 218.3m) from FFr1.4bn in 1990. Mr Monod said the group was planning to sell a 2 per cent stake in Havas, the French media group, next month and its remaining 1.9 per cent in Havas some time in the next year. The group was also planning to sell United Westburne, its lossmaking Canadian building materials subsidiary, but not before 1993, by when United Westburne should be breaking even. The group made a FFr1.87bn profit from asset sales last year, in line with its policy of focusing on its main businesses and curbing debts. Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of Saint Gobain, the glass and pipe-making group, yesterday forecast that net profits this year would exceed last year's FFr2.5bn. The US economy showed clear signs of recovery and sales in Germany were holding up well, he told a shareholders' meeting.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Leading Article: Weakness at the Tory heart BRITISH BUSINESS over-whelmingly desires an outright Conservative victory in next week's general election. As a consequence, there is growing dismay at the quality of the effort being directed to achieve that end. On paper, the Conservatives can comfort themselves that until last night they were on average only a couple of percentage points behind in the opinion polls. It may yet be that, in the privacy of the marginal seat polling booth, the combined alarm at Labour's personal tax plans and fear of the unknown will save Mr Major from eviction. Yet when the campaign began three weary weeks ago, the Conservatives had every reason to think they could overhaul a party committed to tax increases and with a leader whose personal rating has oscillated between the cool and the downright hostile. Mr Major, by contrast, remains a well-liked, trusted figure. What has gone wrong? The campaign, to put it mildly, has lacked focus. Was Mr Major to be a bar-stool crooner or a soap-box firebrand? Both continue to be tried. Was Mrs Thatcher in exile from the campaign or at its heart? She began on the edge, moved to the centre and is now in America. What is Mr Michael Heseltine up to? Before the election he was made minister of everyone else's portfolio. He has yet to make an impact on the campaign. Other dogs of war have been unleashed, only to slink back to their kennels. Mr Christopher Patten, the party chairman, spends half his time fighting his own marginal seat in Bath and is therefore dependent upon mobile phone and fax contact with his inexperienced team at central office. On the rare occasions when the also permanently itinerant Mr Major and Mr Patten sit down to think, their fatigue can only be guessed at. Frankly, the Tory front bench looks exhausted. Endless confusion There has also been endless confusion about the desired terrain of the Tory campaign. Initially, the focus was tax and Mr Major. After Labour's shadow budget, it became obvious that Mr Lamont was no campaigning match for his shadow, Mr John Smith, and the Tories slipped back in the polls. Then came the diversion caused by Labour's mishandling of its health campaign, which ironically led to a modest narrowing of the Labour lead. How did central office respond to that? By relaunching the week-one tax theme, with the same tired advertising, thus bringing Mr Smith back into the spotlight, since when he has cruised up and down the River Thames shelling unfortified Tory positions at will. Journalists have been briefed that the Tory campaign would become more aggressive towards Labour - more 'negative'; then that it would be more positive. If household appliances were wired in this manner the whole of central office would have been electrocuted by now. Unpunished mistakes Meanwhile Labour has been allowed to make unpunished mistake after mistake. Most obviously, the Tories' response to Labour's unscrupulous health broadcast was fluffed, but every day brings new errors. The prime minister promises annual tax cuts. The chancellor says Britain can't afford them. Mr Kinnock virtually pledges to index public sector pay to private sector wages; central office manages, just, a fax to the press by teatime. Labour's own campaign has been tight rather than brilliant. It has benefited from a single sustained message - 'it's time for Labour'  - and unshakeably solid salesmanship from Mr Smith. Mr Kinnock is mainly seen parading grandly, but when he has emerged for big television interviews, he has done well, handling hard questions on the economy and public finances with a suavity many thought beyond his capability. Mr Major now has a mountain to climb and looks short of oxygen bottles. As he gathers his advisers for a last, desperate attempt at the peak, he will need more than a new advertising agency and a good night's sleep. He needs to decide, in a way which his manifesto failed to do, whether he stands for softly spoken Thatcherism or something identifiably different. Although a popular man, his campaign has exposed to the British public his party's identity crisis. This is not just a matter of presentation: it is the weakness at the heart of the Tory campaign.</p>

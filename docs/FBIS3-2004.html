			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Jie (1327 2638) ] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 26 Feb (XINHUA)--Our country's nonferrous  metals industry scored brilliant achievements last year: The  output of 10 common nonferrous metals reached 3.268 million  metric tons, thus surpassing the output target of nonferrous  metals industry on the "third high plane" two years in advance.    In our country, experts from the nonferrous metals industry  are used to setting every million metric ton of annual output of  nonferrous metals as an output target. Last year, the annual  output of our country's nonferrous metals industry exceeded 3  million metric tons, which implies that China's nonferrous  metals industry has advanced its production forces and technical  standards to another new level.    Nonferrous metals, which have a wide application, are  important resources for economic construction. As far as the  electric industry is concerned, 800 metric tons of  copper-aluminum are needed to generate every 10,000 kw of power;  whereas 90 percent of structural materials of aircraft are  aluminum-magnesium alloy. For quite a long period after the  founding of new China, our country's nonferrous metals were  treated as important strategic resources and the nonferrous  metals industry was treated as a classified industry. At that  time, information on the production and consumption of  nonferrous metals was considered a secret, and the nonferrous  metals industry developed slowly. In 1978, the output of our  country's nonferrous metals was 996,000 metric tons, which had  trouble meeting the needs of state construction. The nonferrous  metals industry became a "bottleneck" industry which hindered  the development of our national economy and society.    Our country's nonferrous metals industry has achieved  unprecedented large-scale development since China's National  Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation was founded in 1983.  Over the past 11 years, our country's nonferrous metals  industry achieved 2 million metric tons of net output increase  and also doubled or redoubled taxes, fixed assets, and profits  retained by enterprises.    The brilliant achievements can be attributed to reform and  opening up. It was precisely during the 15 years of reform and  opening up that our country's nonferrous metals industry  achieved rapid development. Up to 1988, the output of  nonferrous metals surpassed the "second high plane" of 2 million  metric tons, and, during this period, the output showed an  annual average increase of 7.5 percent. On the other hand, only  five years were spent moving from the "second high plane" to the  "third high plane" of 3 million metric tons of annual output,  with the annual average increase at 10 percent. Apart from  output increase, the variety structure has also been optimized,  and a more rapid development of varieties which have great  market demand, such as aluminum and zinc, has been achieved.  When the output of our country's nonferrous metals reached 1  million metric tons, aluminum accounted for 30 percent, and zinc  accounted for 20 percent. In 1993, the proportion of aluminum  and zinc increased to 38 percent and 23 percent respectively.    In the 1990's, China National Nonferrous Metals Industry  Corporation has accelerated the pace of bringing enterprises to  the market. At present, products which are priced according to  the state plan only account for 1.5 percent of the total output;  almost all products have entered the market; and the domestic  and international markets have basically been merged into a  single whole. Moreover, the China National Nonferrous Metals  Industry Corporation took the first step by setting up our  country's first metal exchange in Shenzhen.    In particular, it is worth mentioning that, apart from the  10  percent increase in output last year over that of the previous  year, our country's nonferrous metals industrial sector also  fully implemented the "three systems" reform in its subsidiary  enterprises and vigorously called for "diversification with one  business at the core." As a result, 10 percent of the total  personnel of the whole industry were transferred to other trades  and professions, and labor productivity was improved by 11  percent. People from economic circles consider that this  phenomenon has major practical significance.    Fei Ziwen, president of the China National Nonferrous Metals  Industry Corporation, said a few days ago that our country's  nonferrous metals industry is now deliberating a major reform:  The Corporation will turn over the function of administering  the industry to a professional association, which is currently  being organized, and will carry out the experiment of setting up  state holding companies. It was learned that the professional  association of China's nonferrous metals industry is expected to  be founded during the first half of this year. The professional  association, which nonferrous metals institutions and  enterprises are going to join on a voluntary basis, will be a  legal person which is an institution in nature and which will  act as an intermediary between the government and enterprises.  The government will entrust the professional association to  administer the industry. When the professional association is  officially founded, the China National Nonferrous Metals  Industry Corporation will go all out to run economic entities  properly and will no longer administer the industry.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / No retreat for inflation buster At the end of a normal day at the Bundesbank, Helmut Schlesinger generally departs from his 12th-floor office well after the rest of the bank's seven-strong directorate. As the president's armour-plated Mercedes purrs through the bank's gates en route to his modest home in the hills around Frankfurt, he leaves behind a thick crop of news agency reports listing the impact of the Bundesbank's tough and increasingly controversial monetary policies on the financial markets. It has become a cliche to say that, the more unpopular the effect of the Bundesbank's stern interest rate action, the better Mr Schlesinger is doing his DM600,000 (Pounds 215,000) a year job. The president, however, knows that life is more complicated. The Bundesbank is statutorily obliged to maintain a low German inflation rate, preferably between zero and 2 per cent, compared with the underlying level of 4 per cent caused by the demand pressures of German reunification. But, in using its celebrated independence to fulfil that aim, Mr Schlesinger knows that even Europe's dominant central bank faces political limits. As the feeling grows among politicians - both in Germany and abroad - that the Bundesbank may be growing too powerful, Mr Schlesinger's task is to remain true to his anti-inflationary brief - without too obviously overstepping those political constraints. The angular Mr Schlesinger has been following this week's unrest on the foreign exchanges from his holiday retreat in Greece. After 3 1/2 weeks in the sun, he will be back in the office next week, ready to celebrate his 68th birthday on Friday. He knows, though, that the pressures of his job are mounting. The president has three particular problems. The central bank remains highly sceptical about the European Community's efforts to achieve economic and monetary union by the end of the decade. But it cannot risk taking any action which appears to be a direct attempt to sabotage that goal. The Bundesbank has been worried for some time about the lack of flexibility of exchange rates in the European Monetary System (EMS), where the last full-scale realignment took place in January 1987. The Bundesbank believes that some currencies - above all the lira, and perhaps sterling - are overvalued. Again, for political reasons, it cannot afford to be seen to be touting the idea of realignment. Most importantly, the Bundesbank believes that its anti-inflation policies are being stymied by excessive German public sector budget deficits. Central to the Bundesbank's predicament is its relationship with Bonn. In several policy questions during the past two years over German unification, the Bundesbank's advice was either ignored, or not sufficiently heeded, by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's administration. The Bundesbank's  3/4 point increase last month in its discount rate to 8 3/4 per cent was therefore not simply a bid to flex monetary muscles. It was also an attempt to strengthen its own flagging policy-making credibility. Mr Schlesinger did his best to keep the impact of last month's rise within bounds by prevailing on the Bundesbank's policy-making council not to increase the internationally more important Lombard rate, currently at 9 3/4 per cent. The belief on the foreign exchange markets that an increase in the Lombard rate may simply be a matter of time, together with qualms about the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on September 20, have contributed to this week's fresh rise in the D-Mark. As the German economy enters a period of stagnation, complaints about the Bundesbank's policies are also rising at home. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has been voicing his belief that the Bundesbank's concern about overshooting this year's money supply target is overdone. The central bank up to now has managed to brush aside a call by Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the head of the IG Metall metalworkers' union, for the Bundesbank to be made more 'democratically accountable'. But if the economic slowdown continues - and especially if export-dependent industry is hit harder by the fall in the dollar - Mr Steinkuhler's arguments may strike a wider chord. In responding to criticism from home and abroad, Mr Schlesinger habitually replies that there is no alternative to combating inflation in the country which is Europe's monetary lynchpin. He also says that countries, such as Britain, which have pegged their currencies against the D-Mark within the EMS are free to take action to change their exchange rate if they find the constraint too great. As he put it cryptically last month: 'We are not in a (European) monetary union.' Mr Schlesinger is too polite - and cautious - to spell out his feelings directly. But his fundamental message to the UK government is it has two choices: either to take all necessary action (including raising interest rates) to defend sterling's parity, or to carry out a devaluation. In the war of nerves over the EMS, there is perhaps a third option. Mr Schlesinger's Achilles' heel is his fear of exposure to disruptive currency inflows from abroad. He admitted earlier this month that if weak currencies fell to their floors against the D-Mark within the system, 'a critical situation' would arise. This is because the Bundesbank would be forced to intervene in theoretically unlimited amounts to defend weaker currencies - action which could add large amounts of liquidity to the banking system. When obligatory large-scale intervention was last necessary - to boost the French franc - in January 1987, Mr Schlesinger quickly prevailed upon Mr Kohl to accept a D-Mark revaluation. Depending on what happens to the lira and sterling, the German government may yet be pushed into accepting the need for a D-Mark revaluation. However, with the EC yesterday ruling out an EMS currency realignment, it is apparent that governments and central banks will strain every sinew to make sure that no action is taken before the French referendum on September 20.</p>

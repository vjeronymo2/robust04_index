			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PROBE OF NURSING HOME INSURANCE ABUSE URGED  </P> <P> Vulnerable older Americans are being duped into buying expensive nursing home  insurance policies that fail to deliver the promised protection against  staggering long-term care costs, a private advocacy group said today.  </P> <P> The Families USA Foundation called for a government inquiry into what it said  are widespread abuses in the long-term care insurance market, including  misrepresentations by insurance agents, company refusals to pay benefits and  extensive payment delays.  </P> <P> "There is so much evidence of insurance industry abuse of frail elderly  consumers that the Federal Trade Commission should investigate," said Ron  Pollack, executive director of the foundation. The problems include top-rated  companies as well as fly-by-night operations, the foundation said.  </P> <P> In one case, it said, an insurance agent visited a 74-year-old widow in  Minnesota in the hospital to collect her first premium and later denied her  nursing home benefits because she was hospitalized when she bought the policy.  </P> <P> In another, an elderly Iowa man was promised that he need never worry about  paying for a nursing home if he bought a policy that turned out to be so  restrictive it would not cover 97% of the nursing home beds in Iowa.  </P> <P> The Health Insurance Assn. of America issued a statement in response that said  it would welcome an FTC investigation "because we are convinced it will reveal  that abuses are the exception, not the rule."  </P> <P> It said Families USA was calling for a government inquiry in hopes of promoting  "an outdated, big-government approach to long-term care."  </P> <P> Families USA believes the best solution to the long-term care problem is a  broad-based social insurance program akin to Social Security or Medicare, with  private insurance playing only a supplementary role.  </P> <P> An estimated 40% of all elderly will spend some time in a nursing home, with  half of all stays lasting six months or less and the other half averaging 2 1/2  years, according to the health insurance association.  </P> <P> Rep. John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who chairs the House Energy and  Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said the foundation's  report is in line with what his investigators are finding.  </P> <P> "When untamed avarice and constant prevarication become the trademarks of a  product, it is time for reform," Dingell said.  </P> <P> Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), also on the subcommittee, said the report would  provide added impetus for federal regulation of the nursing home insurance  market.  </P></p>

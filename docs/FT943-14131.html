			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Equities (Building a portfolio) (16): Targets are missed as the market turns down - There were two purchases and two sales in a quarter that saw the portfolio fall slightly The young man strapped me into the Sega R360 simulator - a space capsule-like machine that looked so fearsome that even Sing Yu, my normally-adventurous 12-year-old daughter, refused to go in it. Soon, much to the amusement of an ever-increasing crowd, I was rapidly moving upwards, downwards, sideways and upside down. At the same time, I was using several of the controls to try to destroy a number of enemy vehicles. At the end of the game, the machine came to a stop and the young man helped me out of the capsule. 'Are you all right?' he inquired, anxiously. 'It's the first time anyone has landed the capsule upside down.' 'Daddy,' said Sing Yu, 'you only managed to hit three of the targets - and there were hundreds of them.' My experiences in the Sega R360 are rather like my adventures in the stock market during the past quarter. The portfolio has missed a number of its targets, moved in several directions, and ended gently down. However, I did warn in the last issue of the Review that I felt there would be a downturn in the market. I therefore set stop-loss limits for the portfolio's holdings. I also suggested buying-levels for certain shares, in the hope that a market fall would bring them to more attractive levels. Although there was a steep market fall, none of the portfolio's holdings breached its stop-loss level. But my Market Eye share-prices screen did bleep when Meggitt (an engineering company) and OIS International Inspection Services reached the levels I had set for them as possible 'buys': 80p and 60-65p respectively. As mentioned in the spring Review, I was also keen on market research group Taylor Nelson AGB. But what could I do? The portfolio had ended the last quarter with only Pounds 1,276 in cash: not enough to spread around three new investments. Fortunately, by the time Meggitt's share price approached 80p, I had received a copy of its annual report. The chairman's statement, dated April 27, mentioned that the market for Meggitt's products had 'continued to be somewhat erratic'. As the portfolio has to adopt a relatively cautious approach, I decided not to 'buy' any Meggitt shares. If Meggitt looked as if it was finding business rather tough, it was likely that some other engineering groups, too, might be experiencing similar conditions. The portfolio had a rather heavy weighting towards the engineering sector, with shares in EIS and Alvis, so I decided to sell all the shares in EIS for 405p each in May. EIS's chairman, in the company's annual report dated May 6, commented: 'Overall there is no sign of recovery in the demand for capital goods, and the aircraft and defence manufacturing sectors remained particularly depressed.' Although EIS's 1993 profits were higher than in 1992, I felt it best to take a modest profit on a holding originally 'bought' for 375p per share. Had I sold at the time I wrote my last Review article (April 5), I could have achieved a price of 433p. I also contemplated selling Alvis shares, especially when the company announced, on June 16, its interim figures. For the six months to March 31, pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.24m, compared with Pounds 2.19m for the similar period the previous year. These figures disappointed the market, and the shares dropped 6p in one day. But they did not fall to my 50-52p stop-loss level. I feel Alvis is a share to be held for the longer term, particularly in view of its large shareholding in the separately quoted Avimo Singapore. Also, there remain many trouble spots around the world where Alvis's new versatile wheeled utility vehicle ought to do well. I was less patient with Pointon York BRI Director Dealings unit trust. The portfolio bought units in January at 109.11p each. By the end of the last quarter they had dropped to 101.29p. When they fell below 100p, I thought the portfolio should sell, bearing in mind market conditions at that time. The portfolio therefore sold its holding at the beginning of June for 96.01p per unit. These sales produced a useful level of cash, so the portfolio could take another look at Taylor Nelson AGB. John Treasure, chairman of the company, stated in the annual report (dated April 5): 'With increased confidence and even stronger finances than last year, we aim to continue our planned growth in 1994.' Operating profits for the year to December 31 were Pounds 4,149,000 - an increase of 41 per cent on the previous year. The portfolio therefore 'bought' 8,000 shares at 30p per share. At the end of April, when the last Review was published, OIS International shares were 66p each - having fallen from 82p earlier in the year. When the shares fell within my 60-65p buying range, it seemed clear that market conditions would drive them even lower, so I waited until the market showed signs of slightly more stability before 'buying' 6,000 at 55p each in June. I still like Renishaw, mentioned in the last Review, but there are also a number of other companies that I shall be monitoring for the portfolio, in case further market falls present good buying opportunities. The companies which, at lower levels, might have some appeal are Portals, now that the De La Rue bid hopes have faded; Hi-Tec, the sports footwear and leisure wear group; speciality chemicals companies Canning Group and Yorkshire Chemicals; British Polythene Industries, Cadbury Schweppes, Nestle and United Biscuits. Obviously, the portfolio has insufficient funds to buy shares in more than one of these, unless it sold one or more of its current holdings. Although Pentland's performance has so far proved rather disappointing for the portfolio, hopefully, in the longer term, it might outperform. Allied Colloids announced its full-year figures to April 2, on June 7 and confirmed my faith in the company's strong management: profits up by 3.5 per cent to Pounds 45.9m, in spite of a 15 per cent drop in interim profits. There was also a forecast of 'better growth in profits' in the current year. To safeguard the portfolio against any sharp falls in the market, I will set stop-loss levels as follows: Allied Colloids (210-215p), Alvis (40p), OIS (40-42p), Pentland (80p), William Ransom (38p), Taylor Nelson AGB (24p) - although, in the event of any bad news, the shares could be sold before they reach these levels. The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative. The opinions expressed are his own. He states that his personal pension fund has a small holding in Alvis, William Ransom, OIS and Pentland.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- How the Pounds 10,000 portfolio stands after 11 quarters  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                       Number   Purchase      Cost    June 30   June 30 Company            of shares  price (p)  (Pounds)  price (p)     value                                                               (Pounds)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Colloids        1,000        215     2,150        258     2,580 Alvis                  6,250         40     2,500         64     4,000 Pentland               3,500         99     3,465         93     3,255 William Ransom         3,000         52     1,560         49     1,470  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Shares bought: OIS International      6,000         55     3,300         55     3,300 Taylor Nelson AGB      8,000         30     2,400         30     2,400  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash*                                                            1,031  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                                                           18,036 Total at April 5                                                18,430 Change over the quarter                                          -2.1%  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes: 1. *Cash figure allows for interest and dividends. 2.

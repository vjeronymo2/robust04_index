			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> But Will He Triumph?: Producers commonly screen their pictures for potential  distributors, but Arnold Kopelson ("Platoon") is going to unusual lengths to  showcase his new film, "Triumph of the Spirit," to land a distribution deal.  He's holding a special screening tonight at 8 at the high-tech Samuel Goldwyn  Theater of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Members of the  Academy, the L.A. Film Critics Assn., the Hollywood Foreign Press and other  industry figures have been invited to attend -- along with several major  distributors. Inspired by a real-life story, "Triumph" stars Willem Dafoe as a  Greek boxing champ forced to fight for his life at the Auschwitz death camp  during World War II in Poland. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

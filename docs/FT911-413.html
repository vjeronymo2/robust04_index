			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Letter: Dealing with the Arab boycott Sir, The removal of Coca-Cola and other American companies from the Arab League blacklist of companies dealing with Israel ('Things go better for Coca-Cola in Arab world', May 6) is to be welcomed, if only because it recognises that these companies have had no intention of succumbing to the Arab boycott and have continued trading with Israel. The move also underlines the ability of companies to trade successfully with both Arab countries and Israel. American companies expanding in Middle East markets are encouraged by US laws to ignore the boycott. Indeed, many European companies also manage a growing business in both Arab and Israeli markets, primarily because of commercial good sense and a dislike of commercial blackmail, but increasingly because of the encouragement given by European governments through the introduction of anti-boycott legislation. It is regrettable, however, that, against this background, the UK government still steadfastly refuses to encourage, through legislation, British companies to ignore the boycott. A recent survey by one of the DTI's own export advisory boards suggests that British companies were annually losing to their competitors more than Pounds 350m worth of non-military business with Israel. The effects of the Arab boycott, such as they are, do not prevent Israel obtaining the products it requires in world markets. What it has done is to demonstrate a lack of moral fibre by the British government and many British companies which is resulting in a valuable and growing overseas market being lost increasingly to overseas competition.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Arias Cardenas said  today at Miraflores Palace none of the accused in the 4 February  and 27 November events have been pressured by the executive for  their discharge.    The meeting between Arias and the president lasted more than  half an hour. In an atmosphere of cordiality, Arias told  President Caldera of some of his beliefs on what has happened in  the country. During a lengthy news conference after the meeting,  Arias told journalists of the president's receptiveness toward  his proposal. He affirmed his confidence in the president's  capability to lead the country. The military officer ruled out  any possibility of a coup in the new political scenario in  Venezuela.    [Begin Arias recording] All the proposals I made to the  president were received honestly and sincerely, very openly and  frankly. I informed him of the large number of officers who  want only to return to the Armed Forces. Most of the officers  who remain in prison have no political designs; they have no  aspiration to power. They only want to serve their country, and  they believe they can best do so in the Armed Forces.    I also told the president the reconciliation process is not  the victory of old ways. I told him the vision I, and many  others, have about this pacification and harmonization process  is one of a united Armed Forces. The Armed Forces, which for a  long time have been considered the country's moral reserve, have  had the capacity for division so as to originate this new  situation the country is beginning to experience. [sentence as  heard] [end recording]    Arias expressed support for a pacification based on pardons  and a concerted effort to build a dignified and honest country.  He said that although for the time being he will not work to  build his political career, this idea has not been totally ruled  out.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Independent plan to be announced A consortium led by Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, main founder of The Independent newspaper, is expected to announce today that it has reached agreement on a package to restructure the loss-making company. Under the deal, Mirror Group Newspapers has agreed to take a 40 per cent stake and the two main existing continental shareholders, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, will increase their stakes from a present total of about 38 per cent to 51 per cent. The remainder will be held by the founding directors and staff. It is believed a price has not yet been agreed for the shares. Under the proposed new arrangement, Mr Whittam Smith will become chairman of a seven-strong board and remain editor-in-chief. O'Reilly's standpoint, Page 9</p>

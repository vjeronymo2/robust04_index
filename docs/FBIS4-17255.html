			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, 21 Apr, BNS -- Estonian Defense Minister  Indrek Kannik and his Ukrainian counterpart Army Gen. Vitaly  Radetsky signed Wednesday [20 April] in Kiev an agreement on  cooperation between the two countries' defense ministries.    This is a framework agreement that stipulates different  forms  of cooperation in defense matters, including consultations on  the formation and financing of defense forces, and joint action  within the NATO Partnership for Peace program and in security  policy.    Kannik told reporters after signing the agreement that it  will promote further development of Estonian-Ukrainian  relations, which "are sound enough at present." "We have a  number of problems in common, as we both derive from such an  abnormal country as the Soviet Union was," Kannik declared.    The Ukrainian defense minister said the security of Estonia  and Ukraine can be ensured only through joint effort. "At  present there are no big or small, strong or weak states: all  countries must be treated on an equal footing," Radetsky claimed.    The defense ministers discussed in meeting opportunities for  exchanging information about international peacekeeping  missions. Kannik introduced to Radetsky the Baltic states' plans  for establishing a Baltic peacekeeping battalion.    The Ukrainian defense minister observed that his country  already has experience of keeping peace, since the Ukrainian  blue helmets have for the past two years participated in  peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia.    Kannik spoke about the current state of Estonian-Russian  relations. Radetsky, on his part, acquainted the Estonian  defense minister with the relations between Russia and Ukraine  and the tensions stemming from the division of the former Soviet  Black Sea fleet and the subordination of the Crimean peninsula.    The defense ministers' meeting touched on the reduction of  conventional and nuclear armaments in Ukraine. Kannik voiced  the opinion that Ukraine might consider donating or selling its  superfluous military hardware and supplies to Estonia. "We  decided to set up a group of experts to solve the issue, but  made no concrete decisions as yet," Kannik told BNS.    The defense ministers discussed the implementation of NATO's  Partnership for Peace program in their countries. Kannik  affirmed that Estonia hopes the program will lead to eventual  full membership in the NATO. The Ukrainian defense minister  said his country's parliament has blocked Ukraine from joining  any military bloc for the time being, including military  organizations of the Commonwealth of Independent States.    Radetsky told BNS that Russian troops must withdraw from  Estonia by the agreed-upon deadline. "Russian military bases on  your territory are your domestic affair and you must yourself  decide whether to let them remain or not," he stated.    In the Ukrainian defense minister's opinion, Estonia  shouldn't give Russian military retirees any special status.  "Everything must be done in conformity with the requirements set  by international organizations," Radetsky said.    Kannik is scheduled to meet today with the Ukrainian Deputy  Foreign Minister and Deputy Defense Minister Col. Gen. Ivan  Oleinik, and several other high-ranking officers. His program  for today also includes laying a wreath at the tomb of the  Unknown Soldier in Kiev.    The Estonian defense minister will tomorrow visit the  Ukrainian Institute of Land Forces and meet with members of the  general staff.    Kannik is accompanied by the parliamentary Defense  Commission  Chairman Rein Helme, Estonia's charge d'affaires in Ukraine  Andrei Birov, Defense Ministry Chancellor Tarmo Molder, and  Defense Ministry and general staff officials.    The Estonian delegation returns to Tallinn 23 April.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HISTORIAN GATHERS LEGEND AND LORE OF ANGELES FOREST  </P> <P> Environmental historian Donn E. Headley, midway through a 15-month project to  probe legend and lore of the Angeles National Forest, had a confession.  </P> <P> "I'm terrible with dates," the U.S. Forest Service historian said, as he  reached into a gray metal cabinet in his Arcadia office, fishing for tales of  how natural and man-made disasters have shaped the history of the Angeles and,  in turn, greater Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Headley's occasional uncertainty is understandable. His task these days is as  formidable as the San Gabriel Mountains themselves.  </P> <P> He is compiling a historical portrait of the Angeles, whose 100th anniversary  will be celebrated in 1992. And his deadline is December.  </P> <P> Before it was called the Angeles, it was the San Gabriel Timberlands Reserve,  the eighth such forest to be created, and the first one established in  California. Today, overseen by the U.S. Forest Service, the 650,000-acre  preserve is one of the most heavily visited national forests in the country.  </P> <P> Headley's inquiry encompasses a wide range of politics, science, ecology,  governmental affairs and geology. He is most fascinated with the interaction of  human beings and the natural world. "The thing that interests me most is the  relationship between the (Angeles) forest and the city."  </P> <P> Indeed, much of the impetus to set aside the land came from Los Angeles  officials who saw the mountains' value principally as a source of water rather  than a playground, and therefore a key in the development and marketing of  Southern California.  </P> <P> Headley, a UC Riverside doctoral candidate in history, is researching old-time  stories of gold rushes and bandits and modern-day tales of how urban life has  affected the flora and fauna. He was hired last September to work in the  forest's Arcadia headquarters and is one of several historians who work for the  Forest Service.  </P> <P> But he spends more of his time in front of a word processor and in reading  rooms of the Huntington Library and Pasadena Public Library than he does in the  forest, assessing how the Angeles affects millions of people, physically,  psychically and emotionally.  </P> <P> What impresses him, he said, is "that for all the urban growth, the little  effect that humans have had on the San Gabriel Mountains. They tend to endure.  </P> <P> "This idea of Los Angeles as the center of an island with mountains around it,"  he said, "has been a central point in Southern California history for 150  years."  </P> <P> Already, Headley, 36, has begun writing his historical narrative. It will  appear in a short popular history for the public and in another, more lengthy,  volume to be used within the Forest Service.  </P> <P> Some of Headley's historical tidbits have also been appearing in the  "Grapevine," an in-house newsletter for Angeles employees.  </P> <P> In the newsletter, Headley, whose area of expertise is water's role in Southern  California, has discussed the 19th-Century water wars among feuding and  drought-stricken residents of Duarte, Azusa and Covina. Gunfire and scuffles  were often used to settle disagreements.  </P> <P> Water shortages also affected those who lived in two turn-of-the-century  utopian societies along the forest's borders: Los Terrenitos, which predated  Tujunga, and Llano del Rio, a socialist community in the Antelope Valley.  </P> <P> "Set at the edge of a vast continent, California has given rise to a restless  search for new beginnings and perfection amid the region's unique environment,"  Headley wrote in a discussion of these communities, which by World War I had  lost their utopian identities.  </P> <P> He is also exploring the stories of people who shaped Los Angeles and the  development of the Angeles. Prominent among these is Benjamin D. Wilson -- Mt.  Wilson is named for him. He was an early Los Angeles mayor and the maternal  grandfather of World War II hero Gen. George S. Patton Jr.  </P> <P> And he is probing the scientific role of Mt. Wilson as a leading astronomical  observatory site and how the San Dimas Experimental Forest in the Angeles has  led the way in research on such topics as the effects of forest fires.  </P> <P> The forest's past has provided a rich lode of disastrous happenings, including  a 1900 fire known as the Big Fire, which burned for three months and destroyed  22,000 acres.  </P> <P> And the Great Flood of 1938, he said, killed 88 people. One hundred and  twenty-seven more were never found.  </P> <P> In his research, Headley has come across some poignant passages. One, recorded  in a guest book from the San Gabriel River fishing camp of prominent Los  Angeles attorney H. W. O'Melveny, was written in 1923 by George S. Patton,  father of the general.  </P> <P> "I saw this canyon first in 1868, when, as a boy of 12, I . . . caught my fill  of big fish along the lonely stretches of virgin solitude," Patton wrote. "That  was 55 years ago, and today as I walked alone in the same joyous silence, I  experienced a deep sense of gratitude. . . ."  </P> <P> Musing about this exceptional sylvan retreat and the woods around it, Patton  urged, "May God guide our footsteps aright." And he wondered: "What of the  future? The world is in dire distress. . . . "  </P> <P> Ten years later, with the advent of flood control and hydroelectric power on  the San Gabriel River, the Morris Dam flooded the land where the O'Melveny  cabin stood.  </P> <P> "These men hoped to have a balance between urban life and nature," Headley  said. "But as time has gone on, the urban has taken over. Today we're possibly  at a point of no return."  </P></p>

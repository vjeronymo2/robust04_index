			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BARR'S HUSBAND SUES HER EX  </P> <P> Roseanne Barr's husband wants a gag to work -- one from a court, not from her  hit TV show.  </P> <P> Tom Arnold filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Superior Court charging that Barr's  former husband and his attorney violated a court order by discussing the  comic's divorce publicly.  </P> <P> Arnold said ex-husband William Pentland and his attorney, palimony lawyer  Marvin Mitchelson, discussed the divorce on the "Donahue" show in November.  </P> <P> Arnold's lawyer, Martin Singer, asked a judge to sentence Mitchelson to 30 days  in jail and Pentland to 15 days for contempt of court. Singer said Mitchelson  "has engaged in a widespread publicity campaign to try to maliciously disparage  and defame Tom Arnold in direct violation of the order."  </P> <P> Mitchelson said he would file a countersuit, saying it was Barr who called into  "Donahue" and discussed the divorce. She also made disparaging remarks about  the divorce on Arsenio Hall's talk show, he said.  </P> <P> Pentland, who was married for 14 years to Barr, filed a palimony lawsuit in  August seeking at least $15 million from her and $3 million from Arnold.  </P></p>

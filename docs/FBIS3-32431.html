			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 7 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The Guatemalan  Government denied here today that military sectors carried out a  new coup attempt in the past hours.    Presidential spokesman Felix Loarca said the rumors about  top  military commanders planning tactical movements to oust the  former human rights ombudsman were "groundless." He said:  "Ramiro de Leon is working at the presidential residence and  carrying out his routine activities." "The president has  reiterated that peace prevails in the country and that its  institutions are stronger than ever today," he added. Loarca  pointed out that the Guatemalan officers accept their role in  the democratic system and that the reports are simply rumors,"  he pointed out. [no beginning quotation marks as received]  Loarca called on the population not to pay attention to the  coup rumors that attempt to destabilize the country's  institutions.    This past weekend, the local PRENSA LIBRE and SIGLO  VEINTIUNO  morning newspapers reported on troop movements in different  areas in Guatemala City. Such movements are similar to the ones  that have preceded previous coups d'etat in the country.    The Defense Ministry has reported that the military  movements  were routine actions and reaffirmed its full support for  Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon. "Our objective is to  further the consolidation of the democratic process and to  ensure, as the institution in charge of the country's security  and sovereignty, that institutional order is maintained,"  Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez stated.    On Sunday, SIGLO VEINTIUNO hinted at the possibility of "the  military coup ghost in Guatemala" and advanced that "a very  important general" in the Armed Forces had stated at a secret  meeting that "it was impossible for a victorious Army to be led  to the losers' territory." The officer, thus, referred to the  president's decision to accept the presence of a UN  representative at the peace negotiations with the Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) rebels.    According to the newspaper, if a coup d'etat occurs now,  when  the rebels are almost annihilated, it would give the URNG some  air, mainly in the international sphere where its position has  deteriorated after the fall of previous President Jorge Serrano.    In a parliamentary election early on 6 June 1993, de Leon  assumed the Guatemalan presidency which was left vacant by  Serrano who, after a brief self-inflicted coup d'etat, abandoned  the country and took asylum in Panama.</p>

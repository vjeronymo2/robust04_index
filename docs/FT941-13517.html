			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Boeing parades twin-engine widebody Boeing's new 777 twin-engine widebody airliner, photographed here for the first time, has just made its maiden ground voyage - across the factory floor of Boeing's huge Everett facility north of Seattle. The formal roll-out of the completed aircraft will take place in April with first delivery to United Airlines in May 1995. The 777, with a price tag of around Dollars 130m, is the biggest twin-engine widebody ever developed, at a cost of around Dollars 4bn. It is powered by a new generation of very large thrust engines developed by General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US and the UK Rolls-Royce group. The aircraft, with seating capacity ranging from 320 to more than 400 passengers depending on cabin configuration, is challenging the Airbus A340 four engine and Airbus A330 twin-engine widebody airliners as well as the McDonnell Douglas three engine MD11. Boeing has won 147 firm orders for the 777 and options for an additional 108 since the programme was launched in October 1990.</p>

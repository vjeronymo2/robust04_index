Minister of Defense Najib bin Tun Razak said that the  reorganization also has the objective of ensuring better  management of the organization at every level in the force.    He said that with the changes in the organizational  structure  of the Air Force one person will be responsible if an error is  made.    He told a press conference in Kuala Lumpur on 4 January: "An  investigation made by the Inspectorate of the Royal Malaysian  Air Force has brought out the fact that there is no single body  in the organization which is responsible for collecting,  analyzing, and assessing the most recent data and information  regarding aircraft and aircraft components.    "The procurement of spare parts is based on information on  stores obtained when the aircraft is purchased and has not been  available for a long time."    According to the minister, the reorganization is based on a  number of weaknesses that became apparent and that were  identified by the chief of the Royal Malaysian Air Force  Inspectorate during the investigation of the Super Puma  helicopter accident at Sungai Petani on 31 December, which took  the lives of four members of the Air Force.    The minister said that the accident was a serious misfortune  for the seven aircraft which the Royal Malaysian Air Force  purchased in 1993.    He said: "The initial investigation of the accident was  concerned with the cover of the gear box which was separated  from the aircraft.    "Based on evidence obtained so far, the Royal Malaysian Air  Force has rejected the possibility of human error as the direct  cause of the accident. However, the investigation is still going  on."    Najib said that the logistics control system of the Royal  Malaysian Air Force is still essentially done by hand, and there  is no system for checking on the more than 200,000 items of  equipment presently managed by the logistics section.    According to the minister, he will review the latest report  to the cabinet concerning the Super Puma accident to determine  the cause of the accident and the steps for the Royal Malaysian  Air Force to take to prevent such an accident from being  repeated.    He said that the investigation is concentrated on two  aspects. That is, the direct cause of the accident which is  being investigated by Air Force inspectors and a review and  consideration of procedures for handling, controlling and  administering the helicopter unit.    The task of investigation is being assisted by foreign  experts, including the makers of the aircraft, Industri Pesawat  Terbang Nusantara (IPTN) [Nusantara Aircraft Industry] of  Indonesia, and Eurocopter of France, a company that designs  helicopters.    The investigation of the accident is still going on, and  portions of the aircraft which have been found have been  delivered to the Defense Science Research Center in Kuala Lumpur.    Asked whether the report on the accident will be made  public,  Najib said that that depended on a decision by the government.    Answering a question regarding the possibility that the  purchase of the Super Puma helicopters was influenced by  political pressures, Najib said: "I do not know. What we can see  is that there was nothing wrong in our decision to buy the Super  Puma, and there is no evidence indicating that this decision was  unwise."    Regarding a government commitment to buy two more Super Puma  helicopters, he said that the Royal Malaysian Air Force has no  plans to do that.    Asked about the possibility that the government is reviewing  its original decision to purchase CN2353 aircraft made by IPTN  to replace Caribou aircraft, Najib said: "For any purchase made  from whatever source we must be sure that the item concerned  meets the standards of quality and cost established by the Royal  Malaysian Air Force.    "In the future any purchase of equipment will be required to  satisfy these aspects. I do not reject the possibility that we  will buy another aircraft from IPTN, provided the company meets  our needs."    Najib also said that the government has not yet made a  decision on a commitment to purchase several transport and  helicopter aircraft from Indonesia. He said: "We have not yet  made a decision. However, discussions are still going on."</p>

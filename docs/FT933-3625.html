			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due CURRENCY effects should help Inchcape, the international services and marketing group, to report today a rise in half-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 117m to more than Pounds 140m. The recovery in UK car sales will be balanced by the downturn in the continental European market. Continuing growth in Hong Kong will also mask more difficult trading conditions in Japan, but the group will be quizzed closely over the future of China's experiment in rapid economic development. British Aerospace is expected to return to the black when it reports interim results on Wednesday. Analysts expect it to show a small pre-tax profit - between Pounds 20m and Pounds 50m - against an interim loss of Pounds 129m last time. The figures will confirm the company's gradual turnround, although core military profits are likely to show a decline. Losses in the civil aircraft side of the business will be covered by the hefty provisions made last year. Interim pre-tax profits at Kingfisher, the retail group which includes the Woolworth, Superdrug, Comet and B&amp;Q chains in the UK, and now Darty, France's largest electrical retailer, are expected to rise from Pounds 64.9m to between Pounds 72m and Pounds 85m when the figures are announced on Tuesday. The spread is largely accounted for by different estimates of the contribution from Darty. Analysts are hoping for good news from the French business, and about the performance of Depot, the new DIY warehouse chain. The interim dividend is expected to be lifted from 4.2p to 4.5p. Monday also sees Dalgety announcing its full-year results. Something between Pounds 119m and Pounds 123m is expected, though the pre-tax figure will mask a motley collection of divisional results. Agribusiness and ingredients should be good, though the consumer goods, snacks and petcare sides will probably have performed less well in tough and ever more competitive trading environments. The final dividend is forecast at between 12.3p and 13.65p for a total between 20.2p and 21.55p, compared with 19.5p last time. On Thursday, United Biscuits is expected to report only a modest first-half recovery after the profits collapse inflicted by the US cookie wars a year ago. Forecasts range from Pounds 70m to Pounds 78m, compared with Pounds 70m last time. Any improvement by Keebler, the US snacks and biscuits division, is expected to be offset by margin pressures on McVitie's in the UK and a flat performance by Smiths, the Australian snacks business acquired last year. Also on Thursday, Laporte, the speciality chemicals group which in January snatched Evode, the chemicals and plastics group from the jaws of Wassall, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of between Pounds 46m and Pounds 49m. Last time it made Pounds 44.5m. The City will be looking for signs that the group has put behind it a long period of disappointing earnings growth. There could also be a rise in the interim dividend from 7p to 7.25p. On Wednesday Taylor Woodrow is expected to swing back into the black with interim pre-tax profits of around Pounds 10.5m compared with a Pounds 16m loss last year. Last year's loss came after a Pounds 21m provision to cover falling housing and commercial property prices and prompted the group to cut its interim dividend to 0.5p - a level which is expected to be maintained.</p>

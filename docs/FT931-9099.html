			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Mrs Fields quits London USM MRS Fields is quitting the London stock market, leaving UK investors in the controversial USM-quoted cookie company holding heavily diluted stakes in a private group. Seven years after its debut on the unlisted securities market, the US-based company said it had no viable alternative to a refinancing. The group's four US bankers have agreed to swap Dollars 96m (Pounds 68m) of debt and preference shares for Dollars 50m in loan notes and a stake of 79.1 per cent. Public shareholders will be diluted from 19.3 per cent to about 2.4 per cent following the swap and a one-for-eight consolidation of existing shares. As a result, Mrs Fields will not meet the regulatory requirements for a USM listing. However, a spokesman for the company said investors should 'regard this as a positive outcome given the circumstances. The reality could have been some form of administrative receivership.' The banks intended eventually to sell the business, offering the prospect of a return at some stage in the future, he said. The founder and person most publicly associated with the company, Mrs Debbi Fields, will remain as chairman. However, her stake falls from 18 per cent to 8.4 per cent. The banks intend to appoint a new board and management team. The refinancing was accompanied by a profits statement, the first since interims in October 1991. In 1992, the group reported a loss before tax and exceptionals of Dollars 3.6m. Pre-tax losses for the year to December 31, 1991, were Dollars 3.4m, although exceptionals pushed the net loss to Dollars 87.2m. The company said the exceptional charges related to its shift towards franchising. The company said the restructuring was likely to be approved at the extraordinary general meeting on March 3. Some 80 per cent of the shares had already been pledged to the banks in previous refinancing efforts.</p>

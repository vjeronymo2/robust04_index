			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VOLUNTEERS IN SIX CITIES JOIN IN TRASH RECYCLING EFFORT  </P> <P> Every week, an elderly Duarte widow hauls recycling crates full of cans,  bottles and newspapers to the curb for collection. Usually, she looks for help.  If no one's available, she does it herself. But she doesn't mind.  </P> <P> "I think it's a noble venture, but we're a little late in the game," she said,  assessing the curbside recycling program Duarte started in May. "With the  landfills filling up and the way things are these days, it's taken too long for  us to get going."  </P> <P> Once a week, the woman, who asked that her name not be published, and an  estimated 2,650 other Duarte residents participate in one of six such voluntary  programs operating in the San Gabriel Valley. With a crisis in waste disposal  expected by 1992, a growing number of cities are turning to recycling to reduce  the amount of refuse and to keep disposal rates from skyrocketing.  </P> <P> The San Gabriel Valley, county officials and disposal companies said, has more  curbside recycling programs in place or in the planning stage than any other  area of the county.  </P> <P> Duarte, Arcadia, Claremont, Diamond Bar, La Verne and Walnut have programs and  Pasadena is experimenting with a pilot project. Other cities are expected to  adopt programs within a year. Outside the San Gabriel Valley, seven cities in  the county have adopted curbside programs.  </P> <P> Recycling awareness may be heightened in the San Gabriel Valley because of  three local landfills fast approaching their capacities.  </P> <P> "It's really a hot topic out here because of the landfill closures," said  Jennifer Kellogg, recycling coordinator for Websters Disposal, a subsidiary of  Waste Management Inc., the nation's largest disposal company. The company  operates programs in Diamond Bar, La Verne and Walnut.  </P> <P> "When you have a landfill in your back yard, you're looking for ways to keep it  going or ways to keep it from expanding. People out here are really keyed into  the issue."  </P> <P> The BKK Landfill in West Covina is expected to close as early as 1992, and --  under an agreement with the city -- must cease all dumping operations by 1995.  Spadra Landfill near Pomona will reach the capacity permitted by the county  sometime before the year 2000, according to county officials. Puente Hills, the  area's largest landfill, will reach its permitted capacity in 1993.  </P> <P> In addition, the Azusa Land Reclamation Co., which was slated to reach capacity  at its landfill before 1991, received approval late last year for an 80-acre  expansion. The Main San Gabriel Valley Watermaster, a local water conservation  board worried about possible ground-water contamination, fought the expansion  and has an appeal pending with the state.  </P> <P> The county's landfill system is expected to reach its capacity in 1992 unless  recycling and alternate disposal methods are developed to slow the process,  according to Bill George, recycling coordinator for Los Angeles County  Sanitation Districts. Currently, 45,000 tons are dumped each day, and the  amount is expected to reach 60,000 tons within three years, George said.  </P> <P> "We will reach a point in 1992, when there will be more refuse put out than can  be buried in a day," he said.  </P> <P> The public and some city governments have staunchly opposed waste-to-energy  plants primarily over pollution concerns, making recycling one of the best  alternatives for extending the life of county landfills, George said.  </P> <P> In April, 1987, the developers of a large waste-to-energy plant in Irwindale  withdrew their proposal after facing stiff opposition from residents, a  coalition of seven San Gabriel Valley cities and Miller Brewing Inc., which  operates a brewery near the proposed site. The state Energy Commission, which  had been in the process of reviewing the project, subsequently voted to kill  the proposal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Readily Recyclable'  </P> <P> While no panacea, recycling "can make a big difference," George said. Each day,  about 20% of normal household garbage is "readily recyclable" material suitable  for curbside pickup, George said.  </P> <P> Aside from the county landfill problem, Pasadena, San Marino and South Pasadena  are facing pressure to decrease the amount of refuse they generate because of  restrictions Glendale has imposed on users of its Scholl Canyon landfill. In  hopes of extending the landfill's life, Glendale officials have given an  ultimatum to landfill customers to reduce their total waste output by 5%  starting in 1990.  </P> <P> In its most popular form, curbside recycling generally involves residents of  single-family households separating their newspapers, glass and metal cans from  their normal rubbish. Participation in all San Gabriel Valley programs is  voluntary, although each city adds the cost of the program, usually about $1,  to the trash bills of all residents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lower Trash Bills  </P> <P> Profits from the sale of recycled products are most often returned to the  residents in lower trash bills or rebates, but the returns have generally  fallen short of paying for the costs.  </P> <P> "There is no ideal program," said George, in assessing the various programs in  the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> Duarte's program, in which an estimated 60% of the city's 4,400 households  participate, has become the model for other area programs.  </P> <P> The city is subsidizing the program by paying its trash collector, Best  Disposal Co., $72,000, the amount the company was paying the city for the  garbage franchise before the program began in May.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stackable Containers  </P> <P> Residents place their newspapers, plastics, glass, aluminum cans and yard  clippings into stackable plastic containers, which are picked up once a week on  the same day as normal trash collection. As part of the garbage service,  residents receive a 60-gallon or a 90-gallon trash can.  </P> <P> But one basic problem with any recycling program, said Michael Miller community  services division manager for West Covina's program, is selling an often  unconcerned public on the need to recycle. "It's hard to convince the public  that we have limited resources; they just put it out on the corner and don't  think about it anymore," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Resource Revolution'  </P> <P> In February, the Duarte City Council authorized what city officials called a  "resource revolution" with the goal of attracting another 20% of the city's  households into the program. The effort will include weekly and quarterly cash  drawings and a Hawaiian vacation.  </P> <P> Walnut's Joyce said the city is trying to get community support for its program  by printing materials in Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese for its burgeoning  Asian population.  </P> <P> "From everything we've heard, if you don't continue to promote the program, it  won't work," he said.  </P></p>

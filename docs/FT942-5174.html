			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Biocure raising Pounds 0.8m in USM float Biocure Holdings, the pharmaceut-ical research company which produces diabetic healthcare products, is coming to the Unlisted Securities Market next month. It is raising Pounds 810,000 net through a placing of shares at 40p and is offering shareholders the chance to subscribe for extra shares under an open offer. The proceeds will be used for working capital. Having initially raised money through a BES, Biocure joined the third market in 1989. After this was wound up in 1991 its shares were traded under Rule 535 (2). Ahead of the USM flotation this facility has been withdrawn at the company's request. Biocure was formed in 1984 in Aberdeen to research anti-cancer and healing compounds discovered by Mr Neil Hendry, its main shareholder. In its early stages it was funded by Barratt Developments, the housebuilder whose former deputy chairman, Mr Bill Bruce, chairs the company. In 1992 Biocure acquired Hypoguard, a Suffolk-based company which makes blood glucose monitoring meters and test strips for diabetics. It exports to 30 countries. Hypoguard plans to double production capacity over the next year. Biocure Holdings incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.3m on sales of Pounds 1.9m in the year to June 30 1993 but is now forecasting profits. The placing and open offer is being sponsored by Allied Provincial Securities.</p>

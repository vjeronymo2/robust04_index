			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Treasury seeks to shed 23 mandarins The Treasury yesterday announced that it is seeking up to 23 volunteers for redundancy among senior staff, following endorsement of radical internal restructuring plans by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. The department wants up to eight volunteers among its grade 3 staff, who are just below the Treasury's directors in the hierarchy, and up to 15 at grades 4 to 5 - these traditionally count among the cream of Whitehall's mandarins. The aim is to reduce the number of senior management posts from 100 to 75.</p>

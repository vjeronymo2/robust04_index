			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUNNY SIDE UP FOR EGG AT THE ATLAS  </P> <P> Malcolm Forbes was "on his motorcycle somewhere" according to Hal Rubinstein,  the editor in chief of Forbes' new magazine Egg. The supreme no-show went  mostly unnoticed. The Atlas Bar &amp; Grill on the ground floor of the Wiltern  Theatre -- Mario Tamayo's latest restaurant -- was enough of an attraction to  make up for the less than star-struck Egg magazine fete.  </P> <P> The Atlas interior, a beyond-gilded extravaganza by designer Ron Meyers,  knocked out the guests. Enormous wrought-iron sculptures of the gods surround  an eating arena over which hang chandeliers the size of Rhode Island. The eye  is further accosted by enough gold leaf to please Louis XIV. Jeff Goodman, who  created most of the finishes in the cafe, said that, "it took two weeks to get  the gold paint out from underneath my fingernails."  </P> <P> Fox chieftain Barry Diller thought the place "looked like a museum." Actress  Marsha Mason proclaimed that "it's just too hip." Franco-American clothing  designer Michelle Lamy could only say "ooh la la, look at thees." Other too-hip  trendies ooh-la-la-ing included Barbara and Tim Leary, art collectors Tony and  Karen Barone, Trumps restaurant's Michael Roberts, composer Allee Willis, actor  Steve Antin, jewelry designer Diana Hammro and fashion designer Jef Huereque.  </P> <P> Jeff Yarborough, the West Coast editor of Egg, was pleased about the turnout.  "Egg is really bicoastal," said Yarborough about the New York-based  publication. "But we're only going to use Angelenos to talk about this city. No  New York writers here."  </P> <P> "It's stupid to avoid the pre-eminence of L.A. in a pop culture magazine,"  added Rubinstein. "Don't compare Los Angeles to anything."  </P></p>

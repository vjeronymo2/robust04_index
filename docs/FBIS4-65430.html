			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] President Glavkos Kliridhis called on Great  Britain, in its capacity as a permanent member of the UN  Security Council, to play an active role in considering  alternative ways to implement the UN resolutions on Cyprus.    Speaking at a ceremony for the presentation of the  credentials of David Madden, the new British high commissioner  in Cyprus, the president said the provocative defiance of these  resolutions by the Turkish side is likely to hurt trust in the  United Nations. President Kliridhis again attributed the lack  of progress in the Cyprus issue to the lack of political will by  the Turkish side.    Presenting his credentials, the new British high  commissioner  stressed that the division of Cyprus has lasted a long time and  that the British Government desires to see Cyprus converted into  a successful bicommunal and bizonal federation safe for all  Cypriots. Madden said his priority will be a Cyprus settlement  through negotiations between the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish  Cypriot communities and welcomed the constructive approach  maintained by the president toward realizing this goal.

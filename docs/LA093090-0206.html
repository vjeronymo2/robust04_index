			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUSSEIN'S MESSAGE TO AMERICANS  </P> <P> More and more it appears that we are moving toward war in the Middle East. And  the thought is frightening. We must not let it happen.  </P> <P> The charges and counter-charges by Hussein and Bush, the tit-for-tat moves by  each to gain advantage fill one with horror. If this continues, war is  inevitable.  </P> <P> We must find someone such as King Hussein of Jordan, PLO leader Yasser Arafat  or some Islamic religious figure to talk to Saddam Hussein to try to get him to  soften his position. We can't get him to change his mind by using belligerence.  He angers Bush; Bush hurls threats. The danger of war increases.  </P> <P> If we go to war, we can defeat the Iraqis -- but we won't win the war. No one  wins wars any longer. And once more we will fill body bags, and we will plunge  once again into that prolonged pain and suffering which always accompanies war.  </P> <P> DON RADEMACHER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Afanasyeva report: "Duma Passes Budget. Who Would </F> Have Thought It...."]    [Text] It would have been hard to call the deputies' mood  on the eve of the plenary session (it had been planned to devote  Wednesday and Friday this week entirely to the budget)  optimistic. For even the mechanical procedure of voting on the  250 amendments to the budget would take four hours. And then  only on the basis of a 10-second vote without the slightest  interruption, discussion, dispute, or break.    Many deputies knew from their experience of working in  previous parliaments that it would not be possible to discuss  more than 70 amendments in a day.    But journalists have noticed a new feature after five months  of the Duma being at work -- the more vexed a problem is, the  more unexpectedly and sharply the new parliament cuts through  these tangles. And this is what happened.    After some debate during the closed session Vladimir Isakov  spontaneously proposed moving straight to a vote to adopt the  budget on second reading as a whole, bypassing the tedious  matter of the amendments. This "sharp move" did not get through  (171 deputies -- 38 percent -- voted for it), but Ivan Rybkin  managed to tone down the formula to: "passing the budget on  second reading, taking account of the amendments adopted by the  Budget Committee, including those on the creation of a special  nonbudgetary fund for defense needs."    The idea behind this interpretation is that the Army will  immediately receive 3.5 trillion rubles [R] of the R18 trillion  already ratified from on high by redistributing expenditure  within the already ratified basic parameters of the budget. The  Army will get the rest of the money from the special fund, which  will collect the proceeds from post-voucher privatization, from  state apparatus spending cuts, and from the abolition of foreign  trade benefits. How much this income will come to is unknown,  since nobody knows how much privatization -- the procedure for  which has not yet been ratified -- will raise, and we all know  how we usually go about cutting our apparatus. Consequently,  the sums which the Army may receive for use on social needs are  unknown, as is the procedure for their distribution.    The toned-down formula suited the deputies, all the more so  as the government, as Deputy Finance Ministry Vladimir Petrov  put it, has withdrawn its last objection (the demand for R1.5  trillion to service domestic debt) and has totally supported the  Budget Committee's amendments.    The vote was 228 in favor and 40 against, with 32  abstentions. And...the budget, unexpectedly for many people, was  adopted. The coordination of the faction leaders' positions  bore fruit. Whereas such different people as Rybkin, Burbulis,  and Nevzorov voted in favor, "Yabloko" mostly did not vote. The  Zhirinovskiy faction was almost entirely absent -- accompanying  their leader in Krasnodar Kray.    The budget has been passed by the Duma. But this does not  mean that Russia now has a budget for this year. The budget now  has to be ratified by the Federation Council, which is  categorically insisting on allocating the entire requested sum  of R55 trillion to the Army and is demanding R23 trillion on its  own behalf for Federation components. The upper house's  disapproval of the lower house will have to be overcome by a  two-thirds vote -- which, given the "marginal" [pogranichnyy]  vote yesterday (51 percent in favor) will be very problematic.    Later the budget (after passing the Duma and the Federation  Council) will reach the president. And he, if you recall, has  already stated that he will not allow himself to fall out with  the Army.    Here is a riddle -- in what month of what year will Russia  finally get the ratified 1994 budget?    P.S. It transpired at the end of the day that the Duma will  have to vote once again on the draft budget. This time --  according to the procedure approved by it for the adoption of  the federal budget -- "as a whole."</p>

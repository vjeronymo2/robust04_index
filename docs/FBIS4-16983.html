			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [POSTFACTUM report under the "In Brief" rubric] </F>   [Text] Konstantin Borovoy, chairman of the Economic  Freedom Party [EFP], has advised that the EFP's attitude to the  Agreement on Civil Peace will be discussed at the party's  political council on 28 April. In his view, the signing of the  agreement would signify a conservation of the status quo,  whereas "putting today's situation, with all its negative sides  considered, on ice is a renunciation of the democratic process  of development." He appreciated the stance of the president who  seeks accord in society; however, in his words, the EFP "cannot  give up supporting citizens' interests," that is, waging  struggle.</p>

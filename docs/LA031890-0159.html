			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT / EAST REGIONAL;  </P> <P> CONNECTICUT'S DEFENSE TOO TOUGH FOR CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> Connecticut advanced to the NCAA tournament's round of 16 because of the press,  if not the place.  </P> <P> The Huskies, seeded first in the East Regional at Hartford, Conn., rattled  California and excited their home-state crowd with a press that produced a 17-0  run in the first five minutes and 16 steals overall and routed the Golden  Bears, 74-54, in the second-round game.  </P> <P> California was never really in the game. The Connecticut press, which led to 19  steals and a 21-1 run in Thursday night's first-round victory over Boston  University, was so effective that it seemed as if the Huskies had more players  on the court than Cal. Virtually every pass was challenged, if not stolen. Even  trying to dribble through it became an adventure and often resulted in a  turnover.  </P> <P> The press was the big difference, but the crowd didn't hurt the third-ranked  Huskies, either.  </P> <P> By being in Hartford, the Huskies (30-5) played the first two rounds only 28  miles from their campus in Storrs and where they went 9-1 this season.  </P> <P> "Being at home is a tremendous advantage," Cal Coach Lou Campanelli said.  "Whether the press would be as effective on a neutral floor in a neutral  setting is another thing."  </P> <P> The Huskies' press, their trademark as they tied for the Big East  regular-season title and won the conference tournament, was effective on nearly  every possession for the game's first five minutes.  </P> <P> If a Connecticut player didn't get a steal -- the Huskies had four in the run  -- he tipped a ball that led to a turnover.  </P> <P> California (22-10) averaged 13 turnovers per game this season. The Golden Bears  had nine in the run alone. They had 16 by halftime and 28 for the game.  </P> <P> Junior forward Roy Fisher had nine turnovers at halftime. As the player  assigned to take the ball out of bounds, he was called for one five-second  violation, avoided two others with timeouts and just beat the count several  other times.  </P> <P> "I've never had an experience like that. It was a learning experience," said  Fisher, who finished with 17 points, six rebounds and 10 turnovers. "It was  kind of a panic reaction. I'm thinking, 'There's a guy. He's open,' and I  didn't see the UConn guy hiding behind him."  </P> <P> Connecticut led, 42-26, at halftime, and the closest that ninth-seeded  California, which beat Indiana, 65-63, in the first round, could get in the  second half was at 44-32 with 17:46 to play. Nadav Henefeld then scored on a  drive, Campanelli was charged with a technical and the free throws by Chris  Smith made it 48-32.  </P> <P> California, which was making its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1960,  outshot the Huskies from the field, 48.7% to 38.1%.  </P></p>

"At the time when the regime is talking about  negotiations...we see an increase of assassinations of innocent  citizens in all parts of the country in order to drive fear and  terror among the people," said a FIS statement faxed to IRNA  from Germany. "The criminal cowardly act which was carried out  by the suppressive forces against the leader, mujahid and martyr  Sayf al-Islam Djaafar and some of his helpers, the best of  mujahideen heroes, expresses the real intention of the regime  which is imposed on the people by fire and sword," said the  statement issued by the Executive Committee of FIS in Europe.    "Let the regime and its helpers know that whenever a leader  falls other will take his place on the same path till god grants  us victory," said the statement in Arabic.    The Algerian regime this week said its forces had killed  Djaafar El Afghani and several other members of his group.    "There is no solution to the political dilemma in Algeria  except by total compliance with the will of the people to create  a just Islamic state which will deliver the people from tyranny,  oppression and corruption and return to them their freedom and  respect," it underlined.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [No date as received] -- A plenary meeting of  Ukraine's Supreme Council today approved the resolution "On  anticrisis measures in the agro-industrial complex," taking into  account proposals by government officials, ministries,  departments, and parliamentary commissions. The draft  resolution included a provision for exemption from value added  tax on fish, seed, and livestock products from 1 June 1994 for  agricultural procurement and processing enterprises.    The Supreme Council also approved amendments to the law of  Ukraine "On election of deputies and chairmen of village,  township, rayon, town, city district, and oblast councils." The  new law allows council chairmen to be elected on a  noncompetitive basis. Following proposals from a number of  deputies, parliament ruled that a council chairman is considered  to be elected provided at least 25 percent of the electorate  vote in his favor. A council deputy is considered to be elected  provided he is voted for by at least 10 percent of the  electorate.</p>

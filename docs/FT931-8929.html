			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Forum paves way for FM successor A NATIONAL forum to promote digital audio broadcasting (Dab), a new sound broadcasting technology, was announced yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. Describing Dab as an important development, he said the forum would involve broadcasters, equipment manufacturers, retailers and service providers. Dab is expected to replace FM broadcasts over a 15 to 25-year period, starting with the first commercial Dab broadcasts in 1995. Dab offers the prospect of compact-disc quality sound and improved reception in car radios and portable receivers. It also makes it possible to provide a greater number of services using the same radio spectrum. A preliminary specification for the technology, developed under the European collaborative research programme Eureka, is already before the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. Among the organisations collaborating on the project are the BBC, Philips of the Netherlands, Grundig of Germany and Thomson of France.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Breakaway Macedonia strives to keep economy afloat: No one has yet been able to work out the cost of independence SUNDAY is a working day for the Albanian currency dealers, slight dark men in overcoats who trade in D-marks and dollars in the cobbled bazaar of the Macedonian capital, Skopje. 'The difference at weekends is that you make your own market because you can't phone Vienna for the latest prices,' says one. Unofficial foreign exchange dealing is illegal but tolerated of necessity in Macedonia since it declared independence in January, becoming the third Yugoslav republic to break away from the collapsing federation. Remittances from an estimated 100,000 Macedonian migrant workers in Germany and Switzerland, many of them from the Albanian minority which makes up a third of the 2.3m population, underpin an economy struggling desperately to stay afloat. The monthly inflation rate is approaching 200 per cent, while unemployment is more than 20 per cent. Figures on foreign exchange inflows are hard to come by: the federal banking system is in disarray and cash-carrying emigres take an aircraft home every few months. However, economists estimate that Dollars 800m (Pounds 441.9m) arrived last year, equivalent to about a quarter of Macedonia's gross domestic product (GDP). No one has yet worked out the economic cost of becoming independent, but further economic deterioration is expected this year, with annual inflation likely to reach at least 2,000 per cent and living standards experiencing a marked decline. Even before the onset of civil war, landlocked Macedonia was the poorest of the six Yugoslav republics, contributing only 6-7 per cent of overall gross national product (GNP). The other republics were the main customers for its agricultural produce, while its chemical and metallurgical industries were dependent for raw materials on the former Soviet Union or the Yugoslavian republics of Slovenia and Croatia. Industrial production fell last year by 18 per cent. On the other hand, exports were up by 7 per cent in 1991, totalling Dollars 1.1bn. Initial fears that European Community sanctions against Yugoslavia would ruin the textile industry, which imports fabric from Germany to be made up for export, proved unfounded. A small but flourishing trade in early tomatoes and cucumbers to EC countries also survived almost unscathed. Macedonia has been fending for itself since federal subsidies were cut off three years ago. The Skopje government has not approved any payments to Yugoslavia's federal government for almost two years. Working out the trade balance with each republic is now one of the Economy Ministry's main concerns. 'We're trying to get precise figures, which is difficult because middleman companies are involved. But the balance is in our favour,' says Mr Petrus Stefanov, the deputy minister. Overall debt is estimated at about Dollars 80m. Economic missions from Skopje are making the rounds of the other republics. Macedonia is anxious to put ties with Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia on a new footing as soon as possible, for otherwise its chances of subsisting will be sharply reduced. Economy Ministry officials say that, in spite of political tensions with Serbia, it is still possible to hold talks on future transport arrangements, assessment of the Serbian debt to Macedonia, estimated at about Dollars 25m, and methods of payment. Plans to launch a Macedonian currency this year are well advanced, but, with foreign exchange reserves totalling under Dollars 30m and only a small amount of gold available, outside support will be needed. One idea is to peg the new currency to the D-mark. As one banker put it: 'The D-mark is already the unofficial currency. Everyone in Skopje uses it to calculate how much their salary can buy'. The alternative would be to seek a loan abroad, 'perhaps of about Dollars 1bn' to support the currency until the economy stabilises and foreign exchange remittances are deposited in the banks. However, little aid can be expected until Macedonia succeeds in obtaining international recognition. The government is waging a diplomatic campaign but so far has been recognised only by Bulgaria. Macedonia faces more obstacles than Slovenia and Croatia in winning EC recognition, despite the conclusions of the Badinter Report, prepared for the European Commission by a group of legal experts, that it meets Community requirements for sovereignty. While Italy is ready to push strongly for EC recognition, Greece objects, claiming that Macedonia's choice of name implies a territorial claim on northern Greece and should be changed. This position harks back to Macedonia's former Communist days. Skopje had kept up a propaganda campaign aimed at the Slav-speakers in northern Greece and calling for the uniting of Macedonia with the Greek province of the same name and the wealthy port of Salonica. Although Macedonia's new constitution was recently amended to underline that it has no territorial ambitions, Greek hostility persists. This worries the government, because a large percentage of Macedonian imports, including its oil supply, passes through Salonica. Plans are under discussion for building an oil terminal at Durres in Albania. Already, trucks from Skopje board ferries there for Italy, avoiding the hazardous route through Croatia.</p>

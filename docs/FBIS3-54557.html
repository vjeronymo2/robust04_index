			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Jan (MENA)--Palestinian and Israeli  negotiators held a fourth round of talks at 1100 today to  resolve the differences between them. The differences continue  to stall the implementation of the autonomy agreement in Gaza  and Jericho.    The Palestinian delegation to the talks, headed by Ahmad  Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', the head of the PLO's Economic  Department, comprises Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, and Palestinian Ambassador in  Cairo Sa'id Kamal.    The Israeli delegation is headed by Uri Savir, director  general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and comprises Uzi  Dayan, political planning director at the Ministry, and Yo'el  Singer, legal adviser at the Foreign Ministry.    The two delegations have held four sessions since the  Israeli  delegation arrived in Cairo. One session took place at  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's residence in the  al-Andalus Palace in Heliopolis.    Sources from the Palestinian delegation told MENA that the  basic points of difference still revolve around the issue of  security control over the crossings into Jordan from Jericho and  into Egyptian Rafah from the Gaza Strip. Israel rejects a  noticeable Palestinian security presence on the King Husayn  Bridge--the Allenby Bridge--crossing into Jordan.    The same sources said that Israel is demanding its own  security presence to observe people traveling to the autonomy  region even if Palestinian-Israeli agreement is reached on an  Israeli security presence in which Israeli security men are  hidden behind a screen and won't be obvious.    The same sources noted that the negotiations to have the  Israelis accept the symbols of Palestinian sovereignty over the  autonomy areas have finally culminated in Israel accepting the  Palestinian flag being hoisted over the special crossing for  travelers to and from the autonomy region.    As for the Jericho region, the same sources clarified that  Israel still refuses to hand over power to a Palestinian  autonomy to administratively control the areas of Jabal  al-Qarantal and al-Maghtis on the River Jordan. It only allows  religious control during religious celebrations. Israel also  refuses to place the area of Maqam al-Nabi Musa, which falls on  the main Jerusalem road, under Palestinian control.    The current Palestinian-Israeli round of talks is expected  to  end at around 1400 today and resume its meetings later in the  afternoon.    The same Palestinian sources also said in a statement today  that the points they will reach agreement on during this round  of talks, which is considered an attempt to support the  negotiations and propel them forward, will be presented to  president 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres  during their meeting on Saturday evening in Davos, Switzerland,  on the sidelines of the international economic forum that starts  its meetings there today.</p>

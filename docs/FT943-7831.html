			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Germany's plutonium smuggling saga turns into farce German police and secret service agents denied yesterday that they had been misled in their hunt for contraband plutonium. The federal and Hamburg police disowned a self-proclaimed undercover agent - a V-man in local jargon - arrested earlier this week in Bremen handing a faintly radioactive smoke detector component to a journalist. The journalist, who tipped off the arresting officers, is also being questioned. Although the federal police admitted the arrested man had been signed up two years ago as a sort of official agent, his services had been called on only once since then. The 'agent's' lawyer stood by his client, accusing the authorities of using undercover agents to gauge supply and demand in Germany for illicit nuclear material. Official hints suggest agents are trying to infiltrate the underground market. 'Our security people know would-be Russian smugglers have been testing the European market for months,' one said. 'It is important to discover how potent the would-be sellers are.' One foreign observer said the real problem was a lack of co-ordination and inter-agency rivalry between the galaxy of law and security enforcement agencies involved. 'I would be astonished if they were actually co-ordinating anything,' he said. Apart from federal and local police, the internal and external security agencies, frontier protection services and customs agents have a hand in stopping plutonium smuggling. Meanwhile, Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, security adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, flew to Moscow to address the issue of preventing the theft of nuclear material from Russian plants. Mr Schmidbauer was said in Bonn to have received 'very constructive signals' from the Russian anti-espionage chief. The meeting sought to build on a promise from Moscow to allow German experts to work jointly with Russian specialists to check security in a Russian fuel reprocessing plant. Further evidence of a constructive approach after a chaotic week of charge and counter-charge emerged from the Russian foreign secret service. 'The plausibility of the theft of nuclear material applies in every country and it cannot be excluded here,' a spokeswoman said. In Germany, broadcasters featured an interview with a Bulgarian who claimed the component seized in Bremen was really part of a poison gas detector from a factory under his control.

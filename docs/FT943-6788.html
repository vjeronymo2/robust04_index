			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region rises on Wall Street as Nikkei moves down Profit-taking by domestic institutions and arbitrage selling in the afternoon left the Nikkei index lower after the morning's gains. This was in spite of a fall in the yen against the dollar, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225 average fell 68.31 to end at the day's low of 20,443.29. It reached a high of 20,603.62 in the morning but soon declined as the sellers moved in. Volume totalled 247m shares, up from 273m. Overseas investors were attracted by steels and chemicals, but sold electric utilities and non-life insurance companies. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 4.93 to 1,633.77 while the Nikkei 300 fell 1.07 to 297.28. Declines led advances by 522 to 440 with 208 unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.24 to 1,327.31. Domestic institutions took profits on their holdings as the index hit the day's high to boost their valuations ahead of the interim book closing at the end of September. Traders said individual investors, meanwhile, were trying to raise cash ahead of the forthcoming offerings for Japan Tobacco and Japan Telecom. The auction for Japan Telecom yesterday drew an average weighted average price of Y5.44m, with bids totalling 78,801, against the 17,000 shares involved. DDI, the telecom operator on the second section, closed down Y1,000 to Y981,000. The stock had been sold earlier this week as investors raised funds for the Japan Telecom auction. Other telecom linked shares were stronger. Semi-privatised companies gained ground. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y2,000 to Y864,000 and East Japan Railway added Y1,000 to Y520,000. Steelmakers were lower, again on profit taking, with Sumitomo Metal Industries losing Y8 to Y330. Minebea, the ball bearings company facing financial problems due to its diversification projects in the late 1980s, fell Y30 to Y805 on reports of a press conference. After the market closed, the company said it would sell its consumer finance companies to GE Capital, the finance arm of the US group. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 11.57 to 22,821.88 in volume of 90.2m shares. Volume rose on trading by corporate investors realising profits ahead of the September book closing. Roundup Sharp overnight gains on Wall Street fuelled a firmer trend in most of the region while local concerns nudged the Bombay and Bangkok bourses lower. HONG KONG rode up on the back of the Dow's, the Hang Seng index closing 97.42 higher at 9,336.11. Selective bargain hunting by domestic investors provided an extra boost. Brokers said that expectations of relatively weak results for Cheung Kong - announced after the market close - had already been reflected in a recent fall in its share price. The stock advanced 80 cents to HKDollars 36, having slipped by 9.7 per cent by Wednesday from its most recent peak on August 1. The Hang Seng index fell 4.6 per cent in the same period. Interest in Cheung Kong bolstered other property issues, with SHK Properties rising HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 51.75 and Henderson Land adding 70 cents to HKDollars 40.60. Cheung Kong's affiliate, Hutchison, which announced a better than expected rise in first half net profit after the close, gained 30 cents to HKDollars 35.50. Among other blue chips, HSBC gained 50 cents to HKDollars 88 and Hang Seng Bank increased HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 52.75. SYDNEY also took its cue from a stronger Wall Street while a firmer resources sector did the rest. The All Ordinaries index finished 16.7 higher at 2,077.8, but was off its session peak of 2,088.7. Traders said that the continuing rise in commodity prices was lending underlying support to the market with offshore investors attracted to Australian metal miners. Key resources stocks like Western Mining, CRA and MIM led the resources sector higher. News Corp, the day's most active stock, fell 15 cents to ADollars 9. WELLINGTON held its morning gains, closing firmer after a day of solid, rather than spectacular trade with the NZSE-40 index up 16.28 at 2,118.99. Volume was solid at NZDollars 77m, but swelled by a crossing of 5.5m Fernz shares which amounted to Dollars 35m. Fernz ended 10 cents higher at Dollars 6.50. The leaders were mixed, with Telecom posting a nine cent gain to Dollars 5.06 and Brierley easing two to NZDollars 1.32. BANGKOK slid on heavy selling in the finance sector, led by Finance One on news of a big rights issue. The SET index dropped 29.86, or 2 per cent to 1,444.72, but was off its low of 1,425.59. Turnover was Bt22.57bn. Finance One, which resumed trading after a week-long suspension, fell Bt44 to Bt492 after announcing that it planned to raise its capital to Bt5.4bn from Bt1.64bn. Among other finance stocks, Dhana Siam plunged Bt44 to Bt752 and Prime Finance fell Bt11 to Bt169. MANILA lost steam after a strong start but closed marginally higher, again reflecting Wall Street's gains. The composite index strengthened 2.95 to at 3,127.06. JAKARTA share prices closed higher in active trading with foreign and local investor sentiment bullish. The official index advanced 2.11 to 489.54 and brokers said it looked set to break through the 500-point mark. BOMBAY edged lower in a session dulled by the end of account and concerns about the assassination of a Hindu local party chief in Bombay. The BSE 30-share index closed at a provisional 4,414.85, down 14.20 points. COLOMBO closed higher in thin trading dominated by retailers and foreign institutions, the CSE all-share index closing 12.24 higher at 1,000.77. Turnover was low at Rs79.6m compared with Rs121.9m on Wednesday. TAIPEI reversed early gains to end lower on late profit-taking; brokers said a downside consolidation would continue in coming sessions. The weighted index, which hit an intraday high of 6,945.08, slipped 4.13 to end at 6,858.01. Turnover declined to TDollars 90bn from TDollars 100.3bn on Wednesday.</p>

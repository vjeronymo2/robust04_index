			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Italians vow to end Craxi immunity ITALIAN magistrates yesterday pledged to fight parliament's decision not to lift the immunity of Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, amid protests and demonstrations in Milan and Rome. Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, Milan's chief public prosecutor, who has led the investigations into political corruption, said his team was prepared to appeal against the decision by MPs to approve only two of the six requests to lift Mr Craxi's immunity. An appeal to the constitutional court to overturn the decision would be unprecedented and mark a further escalation in a conflict of interests emerging between parliament and the judiciary. Mr Borrelli said he thought it would be possible to indict Mr Craxi 'within a few months' on the allegations so far sent to parliament. In a broad discussion on the state of the corruption investigations in Milan, he estimated magistrates had so far uncovered 'between 30 per cent and 40 per cent' of abuses. Mr Borrelli stressed that, although the initiative for paying kickbacks on contracts - had often come from politicians, businessmen had frequently been willing parties in what was seen as a 'reciprocally' beneficial relationship. However, he distinguished between small businessmen, often compelled to pay bribes to survive, and larger companies with a much greater 'capacity for resistance'. Mr Borrelli strongly denied claims that magistrates had granted managers of Fiat, Italy's biggest private company, special treatment. Lawyers for Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the former chairman of the Eni energy and chemicals group, and Mr Giuseppe Ciarrapico, a prominent Rome businessman, have accused the judges of having reached a secret understanding with Fiat. According to the lawyers, Fiat executives under investigation had been allowed to return to their homes while their clients remained in jail. This week, four senior Fiat executives, against whom cautionary warrants had been issued, returned to Italy from 'business' trips abroad. All but one including Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, Fiat's chief operating officer, were granted house arrest without being jailed. Mr Borrelli welcomed the more co-operative attitude shown this month by Mr Cesare Romiti, Fiat's managing director. In the past fortnight, Mr Romiti has appeared twice before the magistrates voluntarily, delivering a lengthy document on Fiat's involvement in political corruption. Explaining Fiat's change of heart, Mr Borrelli said: 'They probably hoped this investigation would have met the fate of other inquiries of its kind in the past'. Had the company changed tack earlier, 'they might have saved some people a few days in jail'. Last year, Mr Enzo Papi, then a senior executive at Fiat's Cogefar-Impresit construction subsidiary, spent a lengthy period in Milan's San Vittore prison before collaborating with investigations. His incarceration was followed by other Fiat bosses, notably its chief financial officer, Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli. 'The treatment given to the top management of the company is just the same as in other cases,' Mr Borrelli claimed. Rather than 'negotiating,' he said magistrates had been approached unexpectedly by Fiat's lawyers, who informed them Mr Romiti was prepared to come forward.</p>

			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: International consortium to seek oil in China's Tarim basin Agip of Italy and Texaco of the US, at the head of an international oil consortium, have initialled an agreement to explore in the vast Tarim basin area of China's remote western region. Mr William Doyle, Director of Texaco China, described the 9,814 sq km Tarim bloc as a 'world class opportunity' for the five-member partnership, in which Agip will be the operating company. Other members of the consortium include Elf of France and two Japanese companies - Japan Energy Company and the Japan Petroleum Exploration Company. Each partner will have 20 per cent. Mr Doyle said he was aware of suggestions that China was offering less prospective areas in the Tarim basin to foreign participation, but Texaco was 'very pleased' with the potential of its concession, which lies at the western end of five being made available to foreign companies. China announced about a year ago that it was inviting foreigners to explore in promising onshore areas including the Tarim, which had long been eyed by the international petroleum industry as potentially 'one of the world's last great oil plays'. Response from foreign companies has been lukewarm, however, compared to the enthusiasm that greeted the opening of China's offshore areas in the early 1980s. Among factors dampening enthusiasm have been worries about lack of infrastructure in the Tarim and uncertainty about the construction of a pipeline to transport oil from the remote region. Mr Doyle said he was confident that if oil was discovered in commercial quantities that the Chinese would ensure that transport would be facilitated. He estimated a 2,000km pipeline across some of the world's roughest terrain would cost 'several billions'. Texaco has been relatively successful in its Chinese ventures. With its partners Agip and Chevron of the US, it is producing 60,000 barrels a day in the South China Sea. The American company recently signed agreements to explore in the East China Sea south of Shanghai. It is also involved in exploration in the Bohai Gulf, south-east of Beijing.</p>

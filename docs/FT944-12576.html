			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Arts: Olga Borodina sings Tchaikovsky - Recital Olga Borodina's all-Tchaikovsky programme at the Wigmore Hall on Thursday launched the Maryinsky-Kirov series of recitals that will run there until the middle of next year. Like the parallel Royal Philharmonic Orchestra-Maryinsky series, also under the artistic directorship of the Kirov's chief, Valery Gergiev, it is a celebration of St Petersburg's cultural heritage, past and present. On Thursday the 'present' was personified by Borodina, who along with the soprano Galina Gorchakova (to appear later in the series) is a leading lady of the Kirov Opera. In the space of a few years she has established herself as one of the most exciting mezzo sopranos around today, not only in the Russian repertory in which she excels; as her recent Cenerentolas at Covent Garden testified, she is not an artist to be pigeon-holed. Borodina possesses an individuality of voice all too rare among her contemporaries. The sheer beauty of her tone was enough to hold the full house rapt, in spite of the relatively unvaried programme. She has the burnished Slavonic glint that distinguishes Russian singers, but nothing of the 'edge' that can detract from some of them; she also boasts admirable dynamic control, with wispy pianissimos and reserves of power. Even so, the first part of her recital was a little short on communication: perhaps she was relying too much on the lustre of her voice, but the dark and wonderfully lugubrious sequence of songs needed greater definition. 'None but the lonely heart' - the most famous Russian song, ironically a translation from Goethe - cried out for legato phrasing: even when notes were joined, Borodina did not always seem to be thinking in long lines. She redeemed herself with seamless legato in her first encore, Pauline's aria from The Queen of Spades. There was more variety to the second half of Borodina's programme - virtually a repeat of the mezzo's recent recital disc for Philips - and she found the mood of each number, helped by the flexible, fluent accompaniments of Semyon Skigin (replacing the announced Larisaa Gergieva). The 'Gipsy girl's song' was sultry, 'Gentle stars were shining for us' evocative; she caught the bursting emotion of 'The first meeting' and the eroticism of 'The sun has set'. Borodina put her all into the concluding 'Again, as before, I am alone' - Tchaikovsky's last song, whose haunting strains reveal almost as much about the composer's mental state during his final months as does the whole of the Pathetique Symphony. Performances of this stature make the case for Tchaikovsky as a major song composer, one which unfortunately still needs arguing. His output of over 100 songs is undeserving of its continuing and condescending neglect. The Maryinsky-Kirov Series, sponsored by the Regent Hotel, London and British Airways (St Petersburg), continues with recitals by Valentina Sedipova (November 16) and Irina Arkhipova (November 24).</p>

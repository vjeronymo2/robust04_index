			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg, April 16 (CTK) -- It was decided that the  German and Czech Defense Ministers would meet regularly every  six months to discuss developments in European and global  security.    Some 144 Czech officers have received or are receiving  training at military colleges in Germany, said Jaromir Novotny,  head of the Foreign Relations Section of the Ministry of  Defense. Joint training courses are under consideration and the  first joint exercise of staff officers from both armies is  planned for autumn, he said.    Czech soldiers exercised together with Dutch troops in  March,  and in July a Czech-French staff officers exercise has been  scheduled, he said. The aim is for the Czech Army to acquire  the skills necessary for joint military peacekeeping operations,  he said.    General Karel Pezl, adviser to the Defense Ministry, told  CTK  the Czech Army was undergoing a very complex transformation  process in which the method of leadership was being altered,  military service shortened from 18 months to one year, and the  240,000-strong army reduced by a quarter.</p>

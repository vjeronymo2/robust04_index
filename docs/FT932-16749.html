			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / As They Say in Europe: Fleshing out the facts of death LOOK FOR sports papers in Britain and you look in vain, unless you care only about horse racing. In France, Spain and Italy there is a plethora of such publications, and very good they are, too. Once, sitting in a cafe in the Tuscan town of Gubbio, I noted that two-thirds of the men in the square were reading La Gazzetta dello Sport. The rest were studying the Corriere dello Sport. This week, the Gazzetta published figures which confirmed this anecdotal evidence: it has 3.35m readers, and its rival 1.9m. They are the second and fourth most widely-read papers in Italy. They deal with a range of sports, but both are dominated by football (Americans, read soccer). The same is only slightly less true of L'Equipe, the leading French paper. But narrowness could be wise: any attempt to provide a universal sports paper may be founded on error. One could not imagine a boxing fan queueing for the Centre Court at Wimbledon. So, the finest sports paper in the world is Midi Olympique. The title conveys nothing, but its sub-head is Journal national du rugby. This is an understatement. It is a national rugby (union) paper in the way the Koran is an Islamic book; its writers are rugby fans in the way the late Ayatollah Khomeini was a 'keen Moslem.' In Britain, many will regard Bill McLaren, the greatest of all sports commentators, as the epitome of rugby wisdom and enthusiasm. By comparison with Midi Olympique, he is a mildly interested observer. This account of the paper might put you off but, remember, you do not have to be a Christian to admire the Sistine chapel. The issue of MO which dealt with France's triumph in the Five Nations Championship a couple of weeks ago reflects its virtues. The French victory was not an excuse for a triumphalist chorus. Instead reporters, in a minute-by-minute examination of the game, found 24 occasions where the French XV had made a mess of things against Wales. Had everyone played his part, one supposes, France would have won 156-0 instead of 26-10. MO produces 32 pages on every conceivable aspect of French rugby - even jobs for players. This issue had an unexpected picture of the victorious French team in dinner jackets. There was a feature on the team doctor's week, and details on what happened the previous weekend any time a rugby ball was kicked anywhere in France. But one item stood out, and not just because it actually included a picture with a woman in it. She was Mrs Gustavo Zerbino, who was seen with her husband and children. Now, Gustavo Zerbino is not well known in Britain, even in rugby circles. But he must be a household name in Beziers, Toulouse, Agen, and wherever else French rugby is played. To explain, one has to go back exactly 20 years before the Five Nations' final in Paris. Readers may recall the Uruguayan air crash in the Andes in 1973 when many survived by eating dead fellow-passengers. Piers Paul Read wrote a book called The Survivors, and now a film is on its way. Among the passengers was a Uruguayan rugby club, Old Christians. Gustavo Zerbino played in their back row, and he and a colleague 'were the first who cut a piece from a human thigh.' According to MO, he did so with the words: 'If I should die and you don't eat me, I'll come back to earth and give you a good kick up the arse.' Zerbino and three others were invited by Midi Olympique to watch the Paris game this year to mark the 20th anniversary of the event. The editor, Henri Nayrou, wrote: 'We can attest they are survivors rather than cannibals, heroes not curious beasts.' Nayrou travelled to Uruguay for a four-part feature about Zerbino and how a rugby player coped with disaster. Asked how the team survived at that altitude, Zerbino replied, 'Like a rugby club facing death. 'I'll tell you how I saw it: every day I felt I was playing a match, every day I played the last minutes of a game everyone thought was lost . . . we felt as if we were down 25-0.' 'Did you talk about rugby up there?' 'No . . . would you talk about girls during a match? You play one game at a time.' The editor concluded with the words, 'Next week, we tackle the delicate problem of the human flesh swallowed by the survivors as well as the supernatural aspects of the epic.' I am not quite sure what it is about this story that makes it curiously French. Maybe it is the relentless logic of the sequence of events, from cannibalism in the Andes to the Parc des Princes 20 years (to the day) later. It is the Cartesian tradition, perhaps . . . after all, Descartes was the first to concern himself with the mind-body problem.

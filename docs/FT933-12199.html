			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Unison chief issues threat on pay limit THE HEAD of Unison, the new large public-sector union, has warned that it will be seeking to demonstrate its industrial muscle if the government attempts a further year of pay restrictions. Mr Alan Jinkinson, who as well as being general secretary of Unison also chairs the TUC's public services committee, wants a meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to warn him of a co-ordinated union offensive against further pay restraint in the coming public expenditure round. The government has indicated that while there must be no 'catch-up' on public-sector pay after this year's l5 per cent limit, there will be a more flexible approach next year. The 1.5 per cent rise for this year has been accepted by workers, with the exception of firefighters, ambulance staff and rail workers. Mr Jinkinson said: 'The limit was only accepted this year by most people because of a unique convergence of low inflation and fear for jobs.' He added: 'There are plenty of people in Unison who want to show that this new union of 1.4m people has a lot of muscle.' A TUC paper on public-sector pay says that many of the sector's 5.7m workers are suffering falls in real wages as earnings across the economy continue to rise at about 4 per cent. It warns of a 'devastating effect' on morale and recruitment in the public sector. Pay settlements have bottomed out but are still well ahead of inflation, says Incomes Data Services, the research group. Latest figures, which incorporate settlements to July, show little change from the trend that has emerged over the past four to five months, with private-sector pay increases mostly between 2 per cent and 4 per cent.

The prime minister said: 'There is no doubt tests are the key to raising standards, as our main competitors around the world have shown.' Mr Peter Hardy (Lab Wentworth), a former teacher, claimed that the English tests proposed for this year were 'outrageously flawed' and called for their withdrawal along with that of Mr John Patten, the education secretary.</p>

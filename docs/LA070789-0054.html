			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> OFF VINE: HIGHS, AND LOWS OF HOLLYWOOD STYLE  </P> <P> A shark is diving through the roof of a plain clapboard house. Is it a motif? A  metaphor? Something to write about in a restaurant review?  </P> <P> It might just be a ready-made topic for a restaurant review. Of course, the  shark does happen to be the main clue that Off Vine is a restaurant. If it  weren't for its tail projecting from the roof and the impact pattern painted  around it on the shingles (plus a discreet magenta neon sign on the front of  the building), Off Vine would look just like any other house on this quiet  residential street.  </P> <P> But consider: Inside, Off Vine is a comfortable, homey sort of place, and the  menu has a certain reassuring quality. There's a New York steak with Jack  Daniels sauce, really rather good, the sauce not mawkishly sweet as you might  expect from the bourbon. Little loin lamb chops come in a pureed herb sauce of  very green color and very subdued flavor, and three-cheese ravioli (actually,  capelletti) in a very little bit of garlicky wine sauce.  </P> <P> One appetizer has a vaguely avant-garde sound, but turns out to be flamboyantly  retrograde, scallops in puff pastry with a lot of irresistible butter sauce.  There are a couple of old-fashioned butter sauces around, come to think of it,  such as the one with leeks in it on the chicken with an egg-and-herb stuffing.  The so-called "shredded potato pancakes" are an awful lot like the  old-fashioned potato basket, though browned to the limit and maybe a bit  beyond.  </P> <P> But this is Hollywood -- indeed, Off Vine is located just around the corner  from Sunset and Vine -- and these are wacked-out gastronomic days. There is  always the possibility of health and/or California influences infiltrating,  possibly even through the roof.  </P> <P> Sure enough, the menu is full of the words "sun-dried tomatoes," and the pastas  tend to have a certain California quality, as in a special of angel hair with  salmon and goat cheese, a perfectly acceptable combination that was bound to  happen.  </P> <P> A sweet red pepper is stuffed with ricotta and capers, with a couple of  unexpected treats on the same plate: asparagus in honey mustard sauce, a disk  of French goat cheese on a bed of cilantro/red pepper sauce. And look at this,  a "mushroom carpaccio" of mushrooms pleasantly marinated in vinegar, arranged  around a mound of polenta that tastes as if it's actually made with American  hominy grits (I do notice that when you order this, the waitress writes  "mush").  </P> <P> There's a hamburger on the menu at both lunch and dinner, but it turns out to  be a turkeyburger. It's exceptionally good, as turkeyburgers go, and the sauces  -- Dijon mustard, hot chile mayonnaise and a barbecue sauce-like catsup -- make  pretty good sense with turkeyburger. But the waitress points out the health  benefits of turkey-eating, and there's spinach instead of lettuce. Spinach  isn't awful on a turkeyburger, but I think I see a dent appearing in the  ceiling, as if made by some blunt snout!  </P> <P> No, there's nothing there. A lot of old houses just look like that. I should  relax with the nice old-fashioned desserts, particularly the wonderfully  crunchy blueberry crumb cake. It really is good, and makes me proud that I  never bought into that obvious shark thing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Off Vine, 6263 Leland Way, Hollywood. (213) 962-1900. Open for lunch Monday  through Friday, for dinner Monday through Saturday. Beer and wine. Street  parking. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $28 to $63.  </P> <P> </P></p>

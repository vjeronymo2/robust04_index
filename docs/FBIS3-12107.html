In a message issued at the OAS office in Washington, Paredes  said he is "proud to have supported the Colombian president's  candidacy, given the exceptional relationship between our two  countries. We are proud because our support has been a  demonstration and a reflection of the sentiments of affection  the Ecuadoran people have toward Colombia and its president,  Cesar Gaviria."    In February the government of Ecuadoran President Sixto  Duran-Ballen announced its commitment to support the Costa Rican  candidate, Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus. Ecuador maintained  its support for Costa Rica until a few days before the election.  Last Friday [25 March] it changed its position in favor of the  Colombian candidate, who was elected Sunday [27 March] with 20  votes. Niehaus received 14 votes.    In his message, Paredes also congratulated the Costa Rican  candidate "for his lofty and dignified campaign." He said it was  a pleasure for the Ecuadoran delegation to adhere to the  expressions of affection and recognition of the work carried out  by outgoing OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, who has  headed the organization for the past 10 years.    [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 2130 GMT on 28 March carries a  report saying that "the Ecuadoran Government expressed surprise  today over Colombia's economic measures against Ecuadoran  exporters and stressed that the announcement was made when  Ecuador `gave its clear and definitive support to (Colombian)  President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy for OAS secretary general.'"]</p>

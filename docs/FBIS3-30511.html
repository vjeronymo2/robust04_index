			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As we have already informed you, the 26th session of  the National Council was suspended today following the walkout  of the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] deputies and  some SNS [Slovak National Party] deputies. Subsequently, the  opposition deputies were unable to start discussing their  version of the large-scale privatization law. The parliament  session might continue on 4 February, following a consultative  meeting of the parliamentary parties' officials. It is still  possible that the deputies of the ruling coalition will change  their decision about not attending the parliament's  deliberations until a decision is reached by the Constitutional  Court on whether it was legal to deprive parliament Chairman  Ivan Gasparovic of the chairmanship of today's session.    As HZDS chairman, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar told TA SR  [Press Agency of the Slovak Republic] that the Constitution  clearly defines the powers of the chairman of the National  Council. Therefore, Meciar considers the vote on whether  Gasparovic should chair the session to be an informal vote of  no-confidence in Ivan Gasparovic and an effort to question his  honor.    According to Vladimir Meciar, the initiative of the HZDS  deputies and some SNS deputies to turn to the Constitutional  Court is correct. He stressed that the issue was not the  chairmanship of the session; it was the issue of respecting  constitutional principles.</p>

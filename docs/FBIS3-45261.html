			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, 11 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Ulanmulun  and Zhu Yucheng, deputy directors of the Hong Kong branch of  XINHUA, held talks with 16 Hong Kong affairs advisers for more  than two hours today to solicit their opinions on ways to  maintain Hong Kong's economic prosperity and bring about a  smooth transition without the cooperation of the British side.    Advisers present at today's talk held an optimistic view on  Hong Kong's economic prospects. They believe that Hong Kong's  economic prosperity is based on the sustained, steady [wen ding  4489 1353], and rapid economic development of mainland China and  also on China's policy of reform and opening up. Although the  British side refuses to cooperate with the Chinese side on the  issue of Hong Kong, as long as China persistently expands  opening up, deepens reform, and brings further growth to its  economic development, Hong Kong's economic prosperity is  guaranteed.    However, this does not mean that there are no hidden worries  for Hong Kong's economy. The advisers pointed out during the  talk that besides the possibility that the British side might  deliberately damage Hong Kong's economy, the biggest hidden  worry for Hong Kong's economy is inflation. They pointed out  that inflation is weakening Hong Kong's competitive capacity  with each passing day, and the livelihood of the common people  has been considerably affected. However, instead of taking steps  to ease inflation, the British Hong Kong Government is spending  without restraint and putting forward a number of measures which  will result in spiralling inflation. The Chinese and Hong Kong  citizens should pay great attention to this fact and the  Preliminary Working Committee should study this issue and draw  up countermeasures.    During the talk, advisers focused their discussions on the  White Paper concerning the regulations for the Airport  Corporation, which was recently released by the Hong Kong  Government. They shared the same view that the regulations are  not strong enough to supervise the operation of the Airport  Corporation. The company is placed totally beyond the  supervision of the public and only the governor and the  Executive Council have the right to oversee its operations. In  addition, the power of chairman of the board of directors and  the executive director of the Airport Corporation are  concentrated in one person and the Airport Corporation itself  has no right to dismiss its managing director; as a result, the  supervision by the board of directors is but an empty shell and  people really feel worried that the Airport Corporation may  become an "independent fiefdom."    Some Hong Kong affairs advisers even questioned whether or  not it is appropriate for the Hong Kong Government to change the  Provisional Airport Authority into the Airport Corporation  before China and Britain have reached an agreement on the  financial arrangements for the new airport. They also wonder if  the relevant suggestion has violated the spirit of the  Memorandum of Understanding on the building of Hong Kong's  airport reached between China and Britain.    Advisers expressed worries over the financial arrangements  for the new airport, which remains unsettled to this day. They  pointed out that the consensus of all sides is that Hong Kong  needs a new airport and the Chinese have always shown support  for the idea. The problem we are facing now is how to urge the  British side to produce, in line with the spirit of the  Memorandum of Understanding, a financial arrangement which  conforms to the principle of cost efficiency so that the airport  project can be developed in a comprehensive way as soon as  possible.    A total of 16 Hong Kong affairs advisers were present at  today's talks: Ann Tse-kai, Tsui Tsin-tong, Tsao Kuang-piao,  Cheng Yu-tung, Lee Peng-fei, Kuo Ping-hsiang, Hsieh Kuo-min,  Tang Hsiang-chien, Kuo Ho-nien, Chan Wen-chiu, Hu Ching-chang,  Hsu Shih-hsiung, Wu Ching- hui, Chang Yung-chen, Huang  Chih-hsiang, and Yuen Pei-yao.</p>

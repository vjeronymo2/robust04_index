			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System The Italian lira remains firmly at the bottom of the European currency system's grid after a week in which the Bank of Italy was forced several times to intervene in the open market on its behalf. Its differential against the strongest currency, the Portuguese escudo, is wide enough for central bankers to be concerned about the possibility that it will test its limits in the EMS this week. Sterling is second from bottom despite recent comments from the UK chancellor that the pound could enter the system's narrow bands when the time is right. If today's figure for the UK's current account and trade balance in May is disappointing, the pound may weaken. The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent fluctuation band. In practice, currencies in the EMS narrow band cannot rise more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the system. Sterling and the Spanish peseta operate with 6 per cent fluctuation bands.</p>

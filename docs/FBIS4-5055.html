			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- The Transport Ministry on  Thursday [7 April] announced bills to relax car inspection  regulations as part of government deregulation efforts. The  deregulation involves the elimination of rules requiring a car  inspection once every six months as well as a reduction in items  required for annual and biennial car inspections.    The ministry plans to implement the latest measures next  year, ministry officials said.    The ministry expects the scrapping of the six-month  inspection requirements to save car owners an average 15,000 yen  and the reduction in items for annual and biennial inspections  to save them 4,000 yen and 8,000 yen, respectively, they said.</p>

Israeli radio said intermittent firing took place between  the  Resistance men and the occupation forces and agents. The  militia [South Lebanese Army, SLA] radio said a Katyusha rocket  fell at the al-Bayyadah post.    The Agent militia continue to force residents of the Strip  to  enlist in their ranks. Reports indicate that the militia  personnel raided Kafr Kila, al-Tayyibah, and al-Qantarah and  arrested 80 young men aged from 18 to 35 and herded them to a  training camp in al-Majidiyah.    The agent militia commander, Antoine Lahd, has been absent  recently and his deputy Karamallah Sa'id represents him at  various meetings and activities.    Elsewhere, two officers of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon  [UNIFIL] were wounded this morning in a landmine explosion while  on a field tour north of al-Naqurah. They were taken to the  UNIFIL hospital in al-Naqurah. One of the officers was said to  be seriously injured and the other slightly.</p>

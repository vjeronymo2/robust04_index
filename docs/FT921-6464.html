			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Assumptions about debt challenged THE VIEW that personal financial difficulties are caused by high-spending and reckless borrowing is challenged by a Policy Studies Institute study. Ms Elaine Kempson, who produced the report with Mr Richard Berthoud, said the main causes of difficulties with debt were changes in circumstances such as divorce, unemployment or the failure of a small business. The survey found that age, numbers of children and income all related to a household's debt risk and any combination of two of these factors raised the risk to a high level. Young people with children and low incomes had the greatest tendency to be in difficulties. The report said: 'Low income led to indebtedness through the week-to-week budgeting problems it caused, rather than because poor people persisted in buying goods they could not afford.' The authors called for financial assistance for poorer families and for much greater advice and information for borrowers. Ms Kempson also urged creditors to take a more flexible line in times of difficulties. 'There is the assumption that people will pay up if you lean on them hard enough,' she said. The survey, conducted in 1989, does not reflect the recession. It shows that, at that time, one in eight households had difficulties with debts, with 150,000 having a 'very serious problem'. Consumer debt then totalled Pounds 50bn. The researchers estimated that the number of people owing money to three or more creditors increased from 130,000 in 1981 to 530,000 in 1989. Those in the north-west and south-east of England and Northern Ireland were more likely to be in debt than those in other parts of the UK. Credit and Debt.

The new card is in the form of a laminated  rectangle and is larger than a credit card. It is made of  squared banknote paper overlaid with "security" printing the  color of which varies from blue to green when exposed to certain  kinds of light.    A total of 5,000 cards have already been issued to residents  of Hauts-de-Seine since April 1988, when the experiment was  begun in Nanterre Prefecture. Issuance of these cards--which was  one of the priorities of the Right when it returned to power in  1986--was discontinued by the Socialists after 1988. Interior  Minister Charles Pasqua resumed the practice last March, and the  residents of Essonne, Moselle, and Mayenne have had identity  cards for several weeks. Forty additional departments will be  involved this year, and the remainder of the country--including  Paris--will follow in 1995.    The decree of March 1987 that specified the characteristics  of the new card and authorized the creation of a system of  computerized manufacture and control took into account the  criticism expressed by the National Commission on Computer  Science and the Freedoms (CNIL). In particular, the commission  ruled out any magnetic scanning that would have made it possible  to enter invisible information without the knowledge of the  cardholder.    Direct access to the system of computerized control was  limited by the CNIL to only those services responsible for  preparing the cards and for certifying their authenticity,  thereby excluding the police and gendarmerie services, who will  have access only to the file of cards reported stolen or lost  and the file of persons wanted by the law.  <H5>  A Desire to "Start All Over" </H5>   The commission did, however, authorize fingerprinting--a  precaution deemed to be useful in combating usurpations of  identity--but only on condition that the fingerprints not be  digitized and not be used to create a file.    The central computer file will accordingly contain only  those  data that appear on the card, together with the nature of the  civil document that was prepared as a basis for issuing the  card. According to Interior Minister Pasqua, the new card  represents "a safeguard for the cardholder" and "security for  commercial transactions." It is also expected to facilitate  identification of persons wanted by the law.    To justify making the new card generally available, Pasqua  cites the increased incidence of the counterfeiting and forgery  of the present paper cards. More than 9,000 such cases were  detected in 1992 (out of 3.6 million cards issued) compared to  fewer than 6,000 in 1988. He said that no falsification of the  new card has been reported in Hauts-de-Seine.    The new system is more secure, but it is also more  burdensome. "Security is worth a little patience," Pasqua notes.  The manufacture of the cards will be centralized at two sites.  The first site--at Marne-La-Vallee (Seine-et-Marne  Department)--houses the national file for the control of the  cards and will be able to produce up to 3 million cards this  year; the second site is scheduled to be established in another  region of the country. A minimum delay of from eight to 10 days  will be necessary between the receipt of a request and the  issuance of the card. To prevent fraud, all files will in effect  be reviewed by the subprefectures or prefectures, which will  give the green light to the production center. In principle, the  documents required to establish a card remain unchanged. In  order to ensure the security of the data in the computer file,  however, the renewal of an old card is treated as a new request  and presupposes the same formal procedures. This desire to  "start all over" translates into a nuisance for French citizens  who were born abroad or both of whose parents were born abroad,  of whom a certificate of nationality may be required. Lastly, in  order to prevent usurpations of identity, copies of birth  certificates (which these criminals have heretofore had sent to  them by mail) will be transmitted directly to the prefectures by  the municipal governments.    The introduction of the new card--and of the computerized  files--represents a 400 million franc market for Idmatics, a  subsidiary of Thomson-CSF [General Radio Company]. Similar  contracts have been signed in the United States, Spain, Peru,  and Colombia, and will be signed shortly in Greece. The interior  minister is delighted with the French success in this sphere and  has made no secret of his new projects: the computerization of  drivers' licenses and foreign nationals' residence certificates.  The residence certificates could in this way be replaced by  "tamper-proof labels" affixed to passports.</p>

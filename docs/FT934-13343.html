			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Warning shots off Haiti A US Coast Guard cutter fired warning shots across the bow of a merchant ship near Haiti yesterday as an international fleet enforced United Nations sanctions against the country, Reuter reports. The merchant vessel, registered in the Turks and Caicos Islands, left the area after the Coast Guard fired two machine gun bursts as a warning, the US navy said. Earlier, the fleet blockading Haiti diverted a Honduran-flagged ship, with a cargo of motor oil, to Miami. The UN has put an embargo on fuel and weapons shipments to Haiti to reinforce diplomatic efforts to persuade the Haitian military to cede power to a democratic government and restore exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. US, Canadian and British vessels have been sailing a few miles off Haiti to check vessels for banned cargo. France, the Netherlands and Argentina are sending ships to join the fleet. Five other vessels have been intercepted and boarded off Haiti since early Tuesday. Four were diverted but one was allowed to proceed with a cargo of cement, which is not banned.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- Japan still hopes North  Korea will opt to remove suspicions that the communist country  is secretly developing nuclear weapons, Chief Cabinet Secretary  Masayoshi Takemura said Thursday [24 March].    "We will continue to expect North Korea to take desirable  steps in accordance with international opinion," the top  government spokesman told a news conference.    Takemura also said Japan will keep in close touch with the  United States and South Korea to exchange views on ways of  tackling the growing threats arising from North Korea's  suspected nuclear weapons development program.    While acknowledging that Tokyo's diplomatic channels to  Pyongyang remain closed, Takemura noted that its Foreign  Ministry is striving to find ways to persuade North Korea  indirectly to remove the suspicions concerning its nuclear  development program.    Earlier this week, the International Atomic Energy Agency  adopted a resolution referring the issue of North Korea's  refusal to accept full inspections to the UN Security Council,  which may subsequently consider economic sanctions against  Pyongyang.    North Korea slammed Japan on Wednesday for considering  backing such sanctions, saying, "if seditious forces dare to put  unreasonable pressure upon us in the form of `sanctions,' we  would regard it as something equivalent to `a declaration of  war'."    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will confer with South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday  for a three-day stay, on possible ways to encourage North Korea  to allay concerns that it is developing a nuclear weapon  capability.</p>

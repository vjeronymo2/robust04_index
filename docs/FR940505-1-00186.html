			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Overview of Rule Requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There are three sections of the rule that together establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NSR requirements for the FIP areas. The first, 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 52.3000, describes which sources are required to obtain a pre- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction permit, and sets out most of the procedural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements involved in permitting. The second section, 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 52.3001, contains the substantive requirements related to New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Source Review, including control technology determinations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offset requirements. The third section, 40 CFR 52.3002,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> describes the procedure EPA will use to determine the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> creditable reductions available and authorize them for use as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offsets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In general, the rule is designed to meet each of the severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area NSR requirements mandated by the Act, meet each applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for State and local NSR rules as set forth in 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 51.165, as well as be consistent with EPA's policies for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The rule requires that any source <FOOTCITE>98</FOOTCITE>  owner proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construct an emitting piece of equipment obtain a permit prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction of that equipment. A permit applicant must provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA all information necessary to process the permit. Once all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such information is received by EPA, the application is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administratively complete and EPA will begin the process of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis and permit preparation, and will then issue or deny the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit. Except for certain small sources, EPA will present a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> draft permit for public notice and provide an opportunity for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 98 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Source is generally defined as all emitting equipment at one location. This document uses the same definition as 40 CFR 51.165. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The substantive requirements that may apply to construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or modification of certain larger emission units include: Best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Available Control Technology (BACT), offsets, statewide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance, and alternative siting analysis, and are discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER). LAER is required for any emission unit construction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification where the potential emissions of that unit exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ten pounds per day. This requirement is consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Air Act and is based on the requirements of the Districts'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules. The applicable Clean Air Act control technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement is Lowest Achievable Emissions Rate (LAER) (CAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 173(a)(2)). The District rules use the term Best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Available Control Technology, but define it to meet the LAER  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement. Therefore, as used in today's rule, the term ``BACT''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfies CAA section 173(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Offsets. Today's rule implements the offset requirement mandated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act for severe areas by adding a 1.3:1 offset ratio to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base District rule. The rule triggers the offset requirement once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential to emit of the source exceeds 7,500 pounds per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarter (approximately 15 tons per year). Once the source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeds the offset trigger, all subsequent emissions increases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are required to be offset at this ratio.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Statewide Compliance. The owner or operator of all major new sources and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications is required to demonstrate that all major sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under his or her ownership or control within the state are in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance or on a schedule for compliance with all Clean Air Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. This requirement has been in effect since the 1977  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Clean Air Act amendments, and is already part of all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Alternative Siting Analysis. The requirement for an alternative siting analysis is found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in section 173(a)(5) of the Clean Air Act. An applicant for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major new source or modification is required to perform an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental control techniques and demonstrate that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits of the source significantly outweigh the environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and social costs of construction of the source at that location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule implements the alternative siting analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement at 40 CFR 52.3001 (c)(7).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Existing NSR Rules. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The five Districts affected by today's Rule are all within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same air basin and Metropolitan Statistical Area. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each District adopts NSR rules independently, all but one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Districts' rules are similar in structure and substance. Feather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> River Air Quality Management District's rules have similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitions and substantially similar requirements as the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disticts, but differ in minor structural and other respects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule is similar to the existing rules in Sacramento  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Metropolitan Air Quality Management District, Placer Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pollution Control District, Yolo-Solano Air Pollution Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District and El Dorado Air Pollution Control District. <FOOTCITE>99</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, today's rule is numbered differently and is written to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address only ozone precursors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 99 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The rules related to New Source Review in each of the Districts are as follows: Sacramento Metroplitan AQMD Rules 201, 202, and 204; Placer APCD Rules 501, 502, and 504; El Dorado APCD Rules 501, 523, and 524 (board  adoption expected April 1994); Yolo-Solano APCD Rules 501, 502, and 504; Feather River APCD Rules 4.0, 10.1 and 10.2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None of the District NSR rules in the State Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Plan currently meet all the requirements of the 1990 CAAA. On  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 15, 1993, EPA found that Feather River AQMD, El Dorado  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APCD, Placer APCD, and Yolo-Solano APCD failed to submit NSR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules meeting certain requirements mandated by the CAAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, Feather River AQMD, Placer APCD, and Yolo-Solano APCD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have since submitted rules for inclusion into the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation Plan. EPA expects submittals from El Dorado APCD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Sacramento Metropolitan AQMD in the next year. Because all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of these rules were written to only meet the requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serious nonattainment areas, they do not meet the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for severe nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> d. Changes From Original APCD Rules.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Changes to Address Severe Area Requirements. In order to satisfy the provisions required by the Clean Air Act for severe areas, EPA has included several requirements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's rule which differ from those of the current Districts'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rules. The changes include the addition of a more stringent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major source threshold and a more stringent offset ratio. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements are in accordance with Section 182(e) of the CAA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The minimum size threshold for a major source is 25 tons per year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the lowest acceptable offset ratio is 1.3 to 1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

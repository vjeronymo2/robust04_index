			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> 1. One alternative upon which the Department requests the public's views would consist of continuing the current course of operations at the Pantex Plant and the current component storage and recycling activities at the various Department sites. This is commonly referred to as a ``no action'' alternative. This alternative would not include any new projects or general facility upgrades or modifications. Current Pantex operations would include those projects already authorized and funded through Fiscal Year 1995, transportation activities (both onsite and offsite), environmental cleanup and restoration activities, and routine maintenance. The interim storage of up to 12,000 pits at the Pantex Plant would continue. The storage of highly enriched uranium components at the Oak Ridge Reservation, and the recycling of tritium-containing components at the Savannah River Site and Radioisotopic Thermoelectric Generators at Los Alamos would also continue. No Action would result in curtailing dismantlement or the relocation of pits above 12,000 to another site for interim storage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A second alternative upon which the Department requests the public's views would discuss those activities that could be relocated or performed somewhere other than at the Pantex Plant and the current storage locations. This alternative will discuss the transfer of some or all of pit storage activities from the Pantex Plant and relocation of the other nuclear component storage from other sites. Discussion of alternate locations for some Pantex Plant operations will include the Nevada Test Site. Discussion of alternate locations for nuclear component storage will include certain Department sites and other Federal facilities, including those currently owned and operated by the Department of Defense. This alternative will analyze and consider, to the extent practical, any environmental issues or impacts that may arise from the implementation of decisions by Congress and the President to allow third-party inspection at the Pantex Plant as part of any implementation of national nonproliferation policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Department of Defense Sites as Storage Alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Department of Energy solicits comments on the inclusion of Department of Defense sites as possible alternatives for the storage of nuclear components resulting from weapons disassembly. Through the public comment process on the Environmental Assessment for Interim Storage, a number of questions were raised in regard to the possibility of using Department of Defense sites as interim storage locations. Since the fact that nuclear weapons exist at a specific Department of Defense site is classified by the Department of Defense, the Environmental Assessment analyzed three generic sites: an active nuclear weapons storage facility, an inactive nuclear weapons storage facility, and an active conventional weapons storage facility. The use of Department of Defense sites was not considered as a viable alternative to the interim storage of plutonium components at the Pantex Plant under the Environmental Assessment for Interim Storage because it was not timely (per the immediate need), would cost more, and offered no environmental benefit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Energy is again considering Department of Defense sites as alternatives for near to mid-term storage of nuclear components at Department of Energy sites. Preliminary meetings have been held with Department of Defense staff to discuss the process for identifying facilities that are now or will be in excess to the Department of Defense needs that could be made available to the Department of Energy or those facilities where a joint tenant agreement could permit the Department to occupy a part of a larger facility. Based on the result of a facility review and preliminary assessment process, the degree of additional analysis, which may include additional scoping meetings at specific locations, and consideration of the Department of Defense facility alternatives will be determined. However, due to the same concerns regarding the classification of information about specific Department of Defense sites, the Department may be required to use the generic site method described above to discuss Department of Defense alternatives. The Department solicits comments on how to conduct the analysis of alternative Department of Defense storage sites so that maximum public participation is possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Preliminary Identification of Environmental Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The issues listed below have been tentatively identified for analysis in this Environmental Impact Statement as being applicable to the operation of the Pantex Plant and the storage of nuclear components. The list is tentative and should be considered as illustrative to facilitate public comment on the scope of this Environmental Impact Statement. It is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor does it imply any predetermination of potential impacts. The Department invites suggestions for the addition or deletion of items on this list. Identified issues include: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=2 --> _Potential effects on the public and workers from releases of radiological and hazardous materials during normal operations and from reasonably postulated accidents, including aircraft crashes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Potential effects of natural disasters including floods, tornadoes, and seismic events;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Potential effect on air and water quality and other environmental consequences of normal operations and potential accidents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Potential cumulative effects of operations at the Pantex Plant and the storage activities at other sites, including relevant impacts from transportation activities, environmental restoration, present operations, and reasonably foreseeable activities at the sites;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Potential socioeconomic impacts on surrounding communities, including demographics, economic base, labor pool, housing, transportation, utilities, public services/facilities, and education;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Potential impacts on environmental justice;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Potential effects on endangered species, economically and recreationally important species, floodplains, wetlands, and historic and archaeological resources, including paleontological sites and Native American resources;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

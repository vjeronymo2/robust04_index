			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / More executives get bonuses BONUS SCHEMES for senior executives have become the norm for large companies, even though only 8 per cent had them in 1979, according to a survey. The survey by Incomes Data Services found that few schemes were in the public sector. The Royal Mail was the only public body to have a bonus scheme. Its scheme covers 1,200 senior managers and 11,000 middle managers. British Rail abandoned an attempt to introduce a bonus scheme for senior managers in 1990. The study says that bonuses in the private sector tended to be paid on top of normal salaries although some companies were paying lower salaries. It also found that some companies were allowing bonus payments to count towards pensions. Many companies placed ceilings on bonus payments - for example, British Gas limited bonuses in a range from 18 per cent of salary for most senior managers to 37.5 per cent for the chairman and chief executive. In spite of rises such as the Pounds 1.1m bonus paid to Sir Ian MacLauren, the chairman of Tesco, in 1990, the report found British bonuses lagging behind US counterparts such as Toys R Us which last year paid Mr Charles Lazarus, its chief executive Dollars 6.71m on top of his annual salary of Dollars 315,000. IDS surveyed 18 companies and drew information from other corporate surveys.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rafiq al-Ma'luf, Sulayman Nimr, Iqbal 'Abdallah, </F> and Hamad al-Jasir: "Al-'Attas Emphasizes to AL-HAYAH:  Socialist Party Unity Stronger Than Ever Before"]    [Excerpt] Washington, Sanaa, Aden, Kuwait -- [passage  omitted] In a statement to AL-HAYAH after his arrival in  Bahrain from Kuwait yesterday, [South Yemen Prime Minister]  Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas ridiculed reports of a split in the  Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. He told AL-HAYAH: "The  allegation that there are disagreements inside the YSP  leadership is a cracked record, because since the unity was  established Sanaa has worked to split the YSP. It exerted every  effort, allocated huge sums of money, and conspired against many  people, but it failed to achieved its aim of splitting the YSP,  which is now more united than ever before. The Political Bureau  replied to Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani's statement on a split  two days ago. All this confirms that Sanaa is desperately  trying to play this card, but to no avail. Sanaa's behavior  reflects the secessionist spirit it has exercised with all  national leaderships in all parties on the national scene. It  is pursuing its known policy based on the divide-and-rule  principle. It has worked to cause splits among tribes and  numerous national parties, and the Yemeni scene bears witness to  that."

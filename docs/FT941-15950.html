			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Bridge Oil US issue delayed Bridge Oil, the Australian oil and gas company, said the proposed flotation of its US unit is likely to be postponed until there is a sustained improvement in US energy markets, writes Nikki Tait. No formal decision has yet been made, but the timing looks doubtful. 'At this stage, I would have to say it probably won't go ahead as planned at the end of January, but it could well do later on in the year,' said one executive. In December, Bridge announced plans to offer 38.57 per cent of Bridge Oil (USA) to investors via a public issue of 4m shares of common stock. The company said the likely delay to the issue does not affect its plans to acquire a package of US production and exploration properties from Santa Fe Energy Resources.</p>

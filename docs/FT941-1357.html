			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Mexico after Mr Colosio The shocking murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the man most likely to be Mexico's next president, heralds a period of deep uncertainty in a country still reeling from the peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas. Taken together, these two events show that Mexico's current economic and political transition - while necessary and inevitable - is causing strains which may hitherto have been underestimated, both within the country and elsewhere. They need not, however, signal protracted or deep-seated instability. Mexico will emerge formidably strengthened if its politicians learn how to manage the transition better. The attempt by President Carlos Salinas to transform his country into an open, modern economy has had severe costs. Economic growth has ground to a halt - in part because too much Mexican industry was unable to compete in the international market; in part perhaps because the government has sacrificed growth to a single-minded fight against inflation. The difficulties have been exacerbated, however, by Mr Salinas's ambivalent approach to political reform. The president underlined the power of his office by regularly sacking state governors in a supposedly federal system. The electoral system severely handicaps opposition parties, and Mr Salinas's moves to improve it have been piecemeal. His recipe of moving faster with economic than with political reform now looks questionable, since pressures for political change are breeding economic uncertainty and slowing growth and investment. Rich potential It is not clear that the president has fully come to terms with the transition he set in train. Mr Salinas was right to break with the past, but the weakening of its highly-centralised executive - an inevitable consequence of economic reform - has enhanced the need for a strong and legitimate institutional structure. The problem is that this is precisely what the country lacks. There are exceptions. The newly-constituted central bank - autonomous except with respect to exchange rate policy - is a durable strength. The North American Free Trade Agreement also brings rich potential and some certainty about the future rules of the game. But the legal system and the judiciary remain arbitrary and inefficient, the police corrupt. Mexico's people are denied the rule of law, its businesses hindered by their inability to enforce contracts. Recent events thus emphatically do not call for a reversal of Mexico's reform programme. Rather, a new government and a new presidential candidate should look for ways to advance it. In the meantime, some fiscal relaxation  -to provide targeted help to ease social pressures - may well be justified, though the government will be aware that an excessively lax policy would prompt capital flight and an economic crisis. Crisis avoidable Even with Mexico's dependence on foreign capital to cover a current account deficit of over Dollars 20bn, a financial crisis is eminently avoidable. Some Dollars 29bn at last count, Mexico's reserves are high compared to its monetary base; the country also has financial and political support from the US. Similarly, while a period of political uncertainty is inevitable, it need not run out of control. The probable replacements for Mr Colosio as presidential candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) all represent continuity to some degree - though each has his drawbacks. Finance minister Pedro Aspe is harmed by his association with Mexico's current recession. Ernesto Zedillo, like Mr Salinas a former budget minister, is politically inexperienced. Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy to the troubled southern state of Chiapas, has ruled himself out of the race. Whoever stands for the PRI, it is unlikely that the left-wing opposition led by Cuauhtemoc Cardenas will benefit greatly from the uncertainty. In spite of yesterday's tragedy, the PRI remains the clear favourite to win the August election. Mr Salinas's contribution to the modernisation of Mexico has been considerable. His final task as president is to ensure that progress towards a more pluralistic political system, which means ending the PRI's monopoly of power, is maintained.</p>

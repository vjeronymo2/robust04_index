			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with European Parliament President Egon Klepsch </F> by Frank B. Meyer; place and date not given: "The Community  Should Be Able To Function"]    [Text] [Meyer] On 12 June new elections will be held for  the European Parliament. Important and experienced Europeans  will not run again. These include Vice President Hans Peters and  the chairman of the budget committee, Thomas von der Vring. Nor  are you on the list of candidates--why not?    [Klepsch] That is a difficult question. Let me say this:  There were special considerations in my party's land  organization in the Rhineland-Palatinate to which I did not turn  a deaf ear.    [Meyer] That means lines were drawn and you fell through the  cracks. Could one say it that way?    [Klepsch] I could have resisted, but after having been a  member of Parliament for 29 years....    [Meyer] The president of the European Parliament is newly  elected every two and a half years. He will, therefore, never be  as well-known as the president of the Commission. Does  Parliament thus forego the chance to create a personality that  would reinforce the public's awareness of Parliament?    [Klepsch] I think it is a good arrangement. It strengthens  the integration of Parliament and allows all parliamentary  positions to be reexamined every two and a half years. I also  think that the question depends on the individual. I am quite  well known in the European Community. A prophet always has the  greatest difficulties in his own country.    [Meyer] The 18 east German delegates will not become full  members until the newly elected Parliament convenes. Paris  wanted to prevent this, in case you do not want to sign the  lease agreement for the planned new Parliament building in  Strasbourg. Will you give in and sign?    [Klepsch] The German media have sometimes given the  impression that the issue revolved only around the 18 east  German delegates. The real issue is the implementation of a  system of graded proportionality for the entire Parliament. The  package also included the determination of the number of  European Community seats in a dozen cases and, especially, the  final determination of seats for the Council and for Parliament.  These decisions must now be ratified internally by the national  parliaments. I think a favorable decision will be made shortly.    [Meyer] Does that mean you will sign the lease?    [Klepsch] Under the right conditions.    [Meyer] Following the Nordic countries and Austria, Estonia,  Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak  republics, and probably Slovenia are also seeking to join the  European Union [EU]. These countries would benefit greatly from  membership. What would be the advantage for West Europe?    [Klepsch] I think the most important question remains the  following: To what extent is the community's ability to function  guaranteed? Such a guarantee exists for the Nordic states and  for Austria if some minimum conditions are observed. The  question will, of course, be carefully evaluated for each new  membership.    But there are, after all, many different intermediate  stages.  The European Economic Area, for instance, is suitable for those  who do not want to sacrifice sovereignty to integration. There  are association agreements, such as those we have with the  Visegrad countries, in which the Baltic countries are  interested. To come to a decision within a reasonable time  should not be a problem as I see it--the same holds true for  Slovenia.    [Meyer] Can we expect a uniform right of asylum in the EU  and  a joint asylum policy?    [Klepsch] There are strong indications. The Maastrich Treaty  was a beginning. It is in the common interest to establish a  joint policy.    [Meyer] The institutions of the EU are constantly asked to  become democratic. Yet, the preconditions for a European  democracy are simply not present: There is no single European  nation, no common European language, and there definitely are no  European parties...    [Klepsch] But these are problems for a nation state. Where  do we live? We are not a nation state; we will never be a nation  state. I still think the best way to define the European Union  is to call it a "sui generis" [one of a kind] object. Even all  this talk about a confederation or a federation in Europe is  really an internal German debate about constitutional law  triggered by our own constitutional structure, and so forth. It  is irrelevant to others.    [Meyer] Why, then, did the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]  decide in favor of a federal model for Europe?    [Klepsch] The CDU has correctly opted for a federal  solution.  If I look at the whole structure, I see that it moves steadily  and continuously toward what we call a federal structure. There  is an obvious reason: For our future survival and to solve our  problems, we must act jointly.    [Meyer] Why should our male and female citizens bother  voting  in the European election at all?    [Klepsch] For the same reason they vote in any election: To  pick their representatives, the delegates who, on their behalf,  can control how and by whom power is exercised and the extent to  which the exercise of power can be limited and influenced.  <H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5> <H5>  Parliament Must Consent </H5>   Article 228 (Agreements With Third States or Organizations)  of the treaty concerning the European Union discusses the role  of the European Parliament:.. the consent of the European  Parliament is required for agreements as defined by Article 238  (Association) and agreements that...create a particular  institutional framework, for agreements that have a considerable  financial impact on the Community, and for agreements that  require amendments to a...legal instrument. In urgent cases, the  Council and the European Parliament may agree on a deadline for  such consent.    Article O (Admission of New Members) stipulates: Every  European country may apply for membership in the Union. The  country addresses its application to the Council; the Council  then decides unanimously after hearing from the Commission and  after Parliament, which decides with an absolute majority of its  members, has agreed.</p>

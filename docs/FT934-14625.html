			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tudor deficit cut to Pounds 240,000 Losses at Tudor, the floor and wall tile distributor, widened from Pounds 117,000 to Pounds 240,000 pre-tax for the half year to June 30. Turnover of Pounds 8.63m compared with Pounds 7.81m. Directors said the ceramic tile market had shown a gradual improvement until the early part of April after which the market declined. They added that during the half year the company had to contend with a considerable amount of price cutting but despite that was able to improve market share and gross profit margins. United Tiles, whose sales represents 90 per cent of group turnover, was currently trading at turnover levels similar to the corresponding period and was 'trading profitably'. Losses deepened to 2.2p (1.06p).</p>

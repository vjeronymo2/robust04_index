The ministry's quarterly index of  current business sentiment at major firms improved to minus 13.1  in the survey conducted in February from minus 22.1 in the  previous survey taken in November.    The earlier figure was the worst recorded in the current  economic downturn.    The survey for the first quarter, like the Bank of Japan's  most recent "tankan" survey also taken in February, "seems to  show a halt to the declines" in business sentiment, a ministry  official said. "From these numbers alone it would seem that the  economy has hit bottom, but we must see if the trend continues"  in subsequent data, he said.    The minus readings, which show the difference between the  percentages of respondents seeing improvement and those seeing  decline, also declined in the medium and small business sectors,  according to the survey of 9,310 companies, of which 85 percent  responded.    Overall, sentiment is improving, the official said, citing  corporate restructuring and downsizing efforts. But he  acknowledged a similar improvement in the survey figures a year  ago.    At that time, signs of a turnaround were dashed by such  factors as a surge in the yen's value, unseasonably bad summer  weather and a series of construction scandals. The official  said some of the February figures were collected before and some  after a failed Japan-U.S. summit that saw trade tensions prompt  another yen surge.    Major firms predicted the sentiment index will improve to  minus 4.6 next quarter and to a plus 5.3 in the July-September  period.    Sentiment at large manufacturers improved to minus 15.5 in  the first quarter from minus 27.3, with predictions of  improvement to minus 5.5 in the quarter starting next month and  to plus 5.7 in the subsequent period.    Large nonmanufacturers reported an improvement to minus 10.8  in the current quarter from minus 17.8 and predicted  improvements to minus 3.9 and plus 4.9.    Nonmanufacturers, especially the service sector, led the way  in improving sales and profits, the ministry survey found.    All respondents, which also included medium-sized and  smaller  firms, expect pretax profits to fall 13.9 percent in the fiscal  year ending this month, with sales slipping 2.8 percent. But  they see profits rising 12.5 percent in the first half of the  coming fiscal year and sales edging up 0.3 percent.    Manufacturers predicted fiscal 1993 pretax profit falls of  25.2 percent with sales dropping 4.4 percent and a first-half  profit pickup of 10.1 percent with sales curbing their declines  to 1.2 percent.    Among all nonmanufacturers, profits are expected to decline  in this fiscal year, with sales slipping 2.2 percent, but climb  13.7 percent in the first half of fiscal 1994, with sales rising  0.9 percent.    Service companies see pretax profits rising 0.2 percent this  fiscal year, with sales up 1.6 percent, and jumping 22.2 percent  in the first half of fiscal 1994 as sales rise 2.4 percent.    Labor conditions, however, continued to worsen, according to  the survey index that gauges the difference between the  percentage of companies reporting a labor surplus and those  seeing a shortage.    At major firms, the index weakened to minus 21.3, the worst  since the ministry began conducting the survey in 1983, from  19.6 in the November survey. It was almost flat at medium-size  companies, inching up to minus 13.6 from minus 13.7, and dipped  to plus 0.5 at smaller firms from plus 1.5.    "The sense of surplus increased slightly," the official  said,  but he added that labor conditions are a lagging indicator of  the state of the economy. All groups in the survey forecast  improved labor conditions in the coming two quarters.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Abitibi-Price starts turnround ABITIBI-PRICE said it had taken the first step in a long-expected financial turnround in the first quarter, with a strengthening newsprint market and tight cost control. The loss from continuing operations was CDollars 28.8m (USDollars 22.9m), or 42 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 37.9m, or 56 cents, a year earlier. Sales were CDollars 471m against a restated CDollars 379m. 'Though we are not yet profitable, we have shown the first year-over-year improvement in quarterly results of our core newsprint business since 1988,' said Mr Ronald Oberlander, president. Rising newsprint demand was based on advertising gains in the eastern US, along with some build-up in inventories - partly due to fears of stoppages in eastern Canada mills. The unions have targeted Abitibi for a pattern-making contract. Nearly all the eastern Canada contracts run out on April 30. Abitibi's shipments to Europe came up against Scandinavian competition following last year's devaluations, but Asian and Latin American markets were firm. Groundwood papers, of which Abitibi is a large producer, lagged the newsprint market's strength.</p>

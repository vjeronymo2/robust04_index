			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares rally following Bank inflation report - Market report An extremely volatile trading session left the UK stock market showing little change on the day after early losses had been quickly recovered when the Bank of England released an unexpectedly favourable report on domestic inflation prospects. Trading was overshadowed from the opening by apprehension ahead of the latest National Purchasing Managers Index in the US and the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, both released in mid-afternoon. The market drifted easier before dropping sharply when the US Purchasing Managers Index alarmed the dollar and US and global bond markets by disclosing the highest level of business activity for seven years, with its prices component also stronger than expected. The FT-SE 100-share Index extended its loss to show a net fall of nearly 20 points within a few minutes of the US news. However, traders said there was no time for any selling pressure to develop. The Bank of England Bulletin, released shortly afterwards, inspired a dramatic turnround in UK bonds and equities. The FT-SE 100 Index climbed back into plus territory, albeit briefly, and ended only 1.1 off at 3,096.3. At the close, London brushed aside both weakness in US bonds and the fall of nearly 30 points on the Dow Industrial Average in UK trading hours. The Bank's prediction that domestic inflation would stay in the lower half of its target range for the next two years, and that wage inflation was posing no problems, appeared to remove the market's fears of any sudden upward move in base rates. Analysts commented that much of this week's debate over base rates has been one of timing; the market had long ago braced itself for higher rates at some time in the future. However, market analysts were cautious about abandoning the view that the Bank may still tighten policy at some stage as economic recovery continues, especially in view of the further evidence yesterday of pressures in the US. Traders warned that the recovery in the market towards the close should be regarded as further evidence of London's volatility rather than of a change of investment sentiment. Seaq volume remained poor, with the day's total of 471.8m shares through the electronic reporting network a shade lower than in the previous session. In the early part of the day, volume was very slow, although the Footsie moved erratically, opening 15 points down but almost regaining the overnight level at midsession. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed at 3,524.3 for a rise of 7.4 as the utility sector continued to race ahead. Trading in non-Footsie stocks, incorporating many utilities, made up around 55 per cent of total business. The market closed with an irregular pattern. British Petroleum ended the session lower as not even excellent trading figures could offset Wall Street's influence and some disappointment that the dividend payout had not been raised. Shell Transport was easier, and most of the dollar-orientated stocks, including pharmaceuticals, were unable to make progress at the close. Retail and consumer shares, the most closely linked to base rate worries, made only a cautious response to the Bank's favourable comments on inflation. Banks, which have also proved sensitive to threats of higher base rates because of the negative implications for their bad debt portfolios, turned firmer. A leading US securities house turned positive on the UK banking sector this week. Traders were unwilling to be drawn on prospects for the opening of the London market this morning. Some suggested that yesterday afternoon's rally might prove to be as much as London could manage if the US and European bond markets remain weak.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Gnomes with big ambitions: Swiss banks are looking increasingly for earnings growth overseas Switzerland's bankers were once famously described as 'the gnomes of Zurich'. The image of them as cautious, secretive characters tucking away cash in a small mountainous country has lasted ever since. But the big three Swiss banks are now taking steps to shed it. 'It is not enough to be a gnome any more. We must be international bankers,' says Mr Josef Ackermann, chief executive of Credit Suisse. Last week CS Holding (parent of Credit Suisse) opened a half-year results season which will show a further shift in the balance of their businesses towards global operations. Their determination to break out of an over-crowded and competitive home market is leading to results that appeared implausible even at the start of this decade. In another five years, their nickname could be a relic of history. The transformation carries risks, even if it succeeds. The range of businesses on which they are building an international strategy is narrower than in Switzerland, where they mix retail banking, lending to big companies and securities broking. Abroad, the big three want to rival global investment banks such as the US firm Goldman Sachs. By doing so they risk their earnings becoming more dependent on the activity of financial markets, and so more volatile. CS Holding's trading income fell by 35 per cent to SFr949m (Pounds 114m) in the first six months of 1994, compared with the same period a year before. Furthermore, it will affect their culture. The heads of the big three already talk of the solid, conservative Swiss approach being loosened by the deal-making culture of their international arms. 'Our tradition is to be long-term oriented, rather than working for bonuses. We treat the bank as if it is our family company, and we want to keep it for the next generation,' says Mr Ackermann. The banks have decided to run such risks in exchange for the prize of developing an earnings stream to supplement their Swiss profits. They face fierce competition, not only from US securities firms which currently dominate the securities broking and corporate finance businesses, but from large banks in several other European countries which are also trying to build international arms. But the Swiss have some natural advantages. Mr John Leonard, European banking analyst at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, says they gain from their capital strength. This gives them high credit ratings - topped by Union Bank of Switzerland's triple-A rating - which are increasingly important in selling financial derivatives, complex instruments whose value is based in part on that of an underlying financial market. Furthermore, Mr Leonard argues that the Swiss banks have a history of sound management controls. This means their shareholders are likely to support their efforts to build international arms without fearing unexpected losses. 'All the banks strike me as having a record of strong management. They are less likely to enter risky businesses they do not fully understand,' he says. The Swiss also have a pressing motive for expanding abroad. Their home has become one of the most competitive retail banking markets in the world, and profit margins are too low to compensate for persistent bad debt problems. The big three's domestic return on equity fell to between 5 and 6 per cent last year because of high bad debt, and is unlikely in the medium term to recover to levels in other countries. These factors led to a push abroad by the big three at the turn of the decade. Swiss Bank Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland had bought London broking firms in the 1980s - with UBS making the most substantial purchase in Phillips &amp; Drew - and Credit Suisse had merged its international investment bank with the US firm First Boston in 1988. But none of these efforts had worked wholly as planned. UBS had difficulty integrating Phillips &amp; Drew with its own operations; SBC found it had not gained true access to London markets (see below); while CS First Boston was plagued by internal divisions throughout the 1980s and early 1990s because it was run as a collection of regional operations rather than a single firm. Since the turn of the decade, SBC and UBS have restructured international operations, and tried to make them more coherent. But CS Holding has continued with a dual strategy of expanding Credit Suisse operations, and making CS First Boston more effective. It has linked the two with a joint venture, Credit Suisse Financial Products, to engineer and sell derivatives. The efforts bore fruit last year, when the Swiss banks were in a good position to take advantage of the strength of bond and equity markets as well as European currency turmoil. It led to UBS raising its pre-tax profits by 69 per cent in 1993, with a third of earnings coming from abroad, while trading income - much of it generated abroad - formed 37 per cent of CS Holding's profits. One of the main reasons for the Swiss banks' rapid progress in the 1990s has been their strength in derivatives. All three were used to trading in currency derivatives in the Swiss bond market because most multinational companies wanted to swap out of Swiss franc issues and into currencies such as the dollar. They have since used derivatives to push into markets where they are weak in the underlying cash products. Mr Robert Studer, president of the UBS executive board, says derivatives are among the bank's most global products, and strongest growth areas. 'Being a triple-A bank, if a company has a seven-year swap (for example, exchanging a variable interest rate contract for a fixed rate one), they want to do it with us,' he says. It remains 'very comfortable' with derivatives despite US upsets such as Procter &amp; Gamble's loss on contracts sold by Bankers Trust, the US bank specialising in derivatives. The Swiss banks have a potential long-term advantage over US and other investment banks in being able to back their derivatives and other securities broking and corporate finance activities with lending. This increases the range of services they can offer clients. Credit Suisse has just agreed to use its balance sheet to back leveraged deals arranged in the US by CS First Boston, while UBS has been working on integrating commercial and investment banking abroad. Mr Studer says that UBS at first had considerable difficulty in getting the two disciplines to mesh with each other, but barriers are now breaking down. 'We did not believe in pushing our views down people's throats,' he says. 'Finally bankers and corporate financiers realised that, if they talked to each other, it would make them more competitive on customer calls.' Mr Hans de Gier, a member of the SBC executive board, says that it can sometimes be difficult to persuade companies not to treat SBC as just a lending bank. But the bank only wants to lend money to international customers when it can also sell them other services. 'Some clients say they just want a lending bank. We say goodbye, and six months later they accept that life is a bit more complicated,' he says. Yet despite the strong progress the Swiss banks have made abroad, two big challenges remain. One is to compete more strongly with investment banks as corporate finance advisers. SBC does not count its mergers and acquisitions and advisory arm as one of its main global businesses. 'Advisory is an important activity for us, but it does not seriously affect the bottom line,' says Mr de Gier. A second challenge is to establish stronger businesses in the US, a key to forming a chain of global operations. Neither UBS nor SBC have strong footholds in the underwriting and distribution of US equities. CS Holding has an advantage in CS First Boston, although the investment bank has only this year started to grasp the nettle of operating as a integrated global business. Mr Studer of UBS says that its hold in US corporate finance 'is not yet where we would like it to be to support a global link'. But despite speculation that UBS will try to acquire a US investment bank, he says that legal barriers under the Glass-Steagall Act (which separated securities broking and banking) are holding it back. 'As we develop, an acquisition becomes less likely, and I think it is very unlikely today,' he says. The Swiss banks thus still have some way to go before they achieve their international ambitions. But they have come too far to turn back now, no matter how the journey has changed their traditions. 'We have the more aggressive stance of our foreign operations, and maybe the disciplined and cautious Swiss approach,' says Mr Ackermann of Credit Suisse. 'We are already different.'  ------------------------------------------------- GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS  ------------------------------------------------- 1993               Credit Suisse           UBS                     Sfrbn      %      Sfrbn      %  ------------------------------------------------- Switzerland         114.5     49      111.4     36 EC                   63.4     27       92.2     29 US                   22.5     10       62.4     20 Japan                 8.3      4       11.1      4 Other                23.3     10       34.2     11 Total               232.0    100      311.3    100  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Company accounts, Datastream, Merill Lynch  -------------------------------------------------</p>

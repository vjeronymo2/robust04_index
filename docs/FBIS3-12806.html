			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>   [Excerpt] Political sources in Jerusalem yesterday said  Israel and the PLO are holding contacts in an attempt to  organize a meeting between Foreign Minister Peres and PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo on 7 March. According to the  sources, Peres will try to convince 'Arafat to immediately  resume the peace talks.    Last Friday Peres conveyed a message to 'Arafat via Greek  Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. Foreign Minister Peres  urged the PLO chairman to immediately resume the negotiations  and offered him a "package of steps" Israel is willing to  implement. Among these steps are accelerating the withdrawal  from Gaza and Jericho in an attempt to complete it by 13 April,  granting the Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho immediate  authority and increasing the size of this police force, and  deploying international observers in Gaza and Jericho.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 6 March  broadcasts a report by political correspondent Udi Segal on the  proposed Israeli steps, adding that "Foreign Minister Peres says  that in addition to the above proposals, Israel will agree to  discuss additional demands and has some more proposals of its  own. He emphasized, however, that Israel will not agree to  illogical demands such as the dismantling of settlements and  disarming all the settlers." In recorded remarks, Peres says:  "We distinguish between useful and senseless demands. We will  examine every demand and will not oppose anything which can help  calm tempers and facilitate the peace process." Asked to  elaborate, Peres adds: "We will not oppose strengthening the  Palestinian police force. Also, when there is a curfew in an  Arab village we will object to armed settlers entering it and  other things of this nature."]    Peres told Papoulias it is possible to complete the  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho within three to four weeks.  Prime Minister Rabin told the Greek foreign minister, on the  other hand, that between three to four weeks will be required  for finalizing and signing the agreement with the PLO, whereas  the implementation of the agreement will require six more weeks.    According to Israeli political sources the U.S.  Administration has made it clear to the PLO -- via meetings  between senior State Department officials and Nabil Sha'th --  that the United States has no intention of getting actively  involved in the negotiations. According to reports which have  reached Jerusalem, the Americans told Sha'th -- who demanded  that settlements such as Netzarim and the Jewish settlement in  Hebron be dismantled -- that they will accept "whatever you  conclude with Israel."    The PLO has sent its delegates to an agricultural conference  in Cordova, Spain, attended by regional experts in the framework  of the multilateral peace talks. Aside from the Palestinians  and Israelis, representatives of Arab countries participating in  the multilateral talks also attended the meeting. Israeli  sources last week expressed the fear that the delay in the  bilateral talks would also suspend the multilateral talks.  [passage omitted]</p>

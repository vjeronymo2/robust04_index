			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Iraq wants to discuss lifting of sanctions IRAQ'S Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said last night he believed Iraq had done enough to warrant the lifting of sanctions against it. In an interview with the US Cable News Network, CNN, he said his government wanted to open 'technical, legal and objective' discussions with the UN Security Council about all outstanding issues with a view to easing sanctions soon. He went on to express Iraq's fear that even if every detail of Gulf War ceasefire resolution 687 was implemented, the 33-month-old sanctions might not be lifted. 'We don't have a solid promise that sanctions will be lifted when all the resolutions are implemented,' he said. He called for a review by the Security Council to examine exactly where Iraq stood and discussion of all the remaining issues. Mr Aziz's comments come five days after the US launched a missile attack against Baghdad intelligence headquarters which killed six civilians and wounded many others. He decried the attack as 'totally unjustified' and said Iraq wanted 'a quiet and normal relationship with the US'. Referring to the 'ceasefire' announced by President Saddam Hussein on January 19 after the previous allied air attack on Baghdad, he said Iraq had 'shown good intentions' which had been rejected by the US. In contrast to more belligerent statements by Iraqi officials this week, the minister said Iraq would not 'condone any acts of aggression' in retaliation against the US strike. Meanwhile, there seemed little development on the deadlock between the UN and Iraq over the UN demand to install cameras at two ballistic missile sites outside Baghdad.</p>

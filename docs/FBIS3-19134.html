			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bart Willems: "Germans Are Arming Themselves </F> Via Belgium on Massive Scale"]    [Text] In the heavily guarded offices of the Bundes  Kriminal Amt (BKA, Federal Investigation Department), the  service yesterday presented the results of a nationwide arms  raid that yielded more than 1,000 weapons of Belgian origin.  The haul ranged from handy, light arms for ladies to  ultramodern, fully automatic Uzi's. At the same time, the  German justice authorities expressed severe criticism of the  liberal Belgian arms legislation.    The house search action, "a raid on law-abiding citizens who  arm themselves," resulted in more than 750 apartments being  searched. A total of 2,247 agents were deployed throughout  Germany, bringing hundreds of people out of their beds from 0500  GMT Wednesday [9 March] morning. The largest number of holders  of illegal firearms live in the border area, just a 30-minute  drive away from Liege. However, major caches were found in  Berlin, too. "It is curious that someone should drive 600 km  there and back to buy a weapon," noted the BKA.    In all, 1,049 weapons were found in the searched houses.  They included revolvers, rifles, and automatic machine pistols.  However, the lion's share of the arms haul comprised rifles and  handguns. The BKA believes that it only discovered the tip of  the iceberg during this haul: "We think that the arms  discovered during this action represent 15 to 20 percent of  annual illegal exports," said Commissioner Ulrich Kamp, who led  the investigation.    Kamp thinks that his service missed another 250 weapons: "We  did not find any at addresses where there should have been  some." One day after the arms haul, it became apparent that  more than 30 weapons had been used in armed raids, shooting  incidents, and suicides. The people in possession of illegal  weapons risk prison sentences of between six months and six  years.  <H5>  Arms Tourism </H5>   "Germans are arming themselves via Belgium on a massive  scale," was the conclusion reached by Cologne prosecuting  attorney Egbert Buelles. He was concerned about how easy it is  to acquire weapons in Belgium. Buelles has been entrusted with  taking care of the criminal prosecutions arising from the case.  "The problem caused by the different regulations governing arms  ownership that apply in various European countries has become a  burning issue from today," he announced. According to Buelles,  the Belgian legislation plays right into the hands of this kind  of "arms tourism." "I hope that the Belgian authorities will  recognize one fact, namely that the bearing and using of  firearms must simply be banned." In Germany, the arms  legislation in application is highly restrictive. The BKA claims  it is the strictest in Europe. Even the purchase of weapons for  self-defense is inadmissible. Anyone wanting to come into  consideration for a permit must take a shooting test.    Investigation chief Ulrich Kamp emphasized that the Belgian  state police passed on the details of the searched addresses to  the BKA of their own accord. In Belgium, anyone purchasing  weapons must show their identity card, and it was those details  that the BKA used: "The purchasers were not aware that we could  get hold of the information."    None of those responsible for the action wanted to say so in  as many words, but there are major difficulties concerning the  exchange of information with France. As a result, the question  concerning the next raid in search of weapons of French origin  was merely met with a broad smile.  <H5>  Ostend </H5>   During the presentation, the BKA did not give any details on  where in Belgium the weapons had been purchased. The arms were  neatly displayed on a table and commented upon by an arms expert  wearing a spotless white coat. Subsequently, Commissioner Kamp  wanted to make it known that the main centers involved had been  Eupen and Liege. Because of their location, close to the German  border, many Germans go there to buy weapons. However, weapons  are purchased in Antwerp and, remarkably enough, even in Ostend.  According to Ulrich Kamp: "During the summer of 1992 and 1993  we noted peak sales in Ostend. Perhaps people combined their  holidays with the purchase of a weapon."    According to Volker Rehm, the head of the organized crime  division of the BKA, there are no indications of commercial arms  trading between Belgium and Germany: "However, that is  certainly an area which we will be keeping a close eye on."    Rehm emphasized that the action by the German police had  been  of a primarily preventive nature. "We want to warn all those  law-abiding citizens that they cannot simply go to Belgium to  purchase a weapon there," he concluded.</p>

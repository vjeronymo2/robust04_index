			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ASBESTOS DISEASE STILL RISES DUE TO LAG BETWEEN EXPOSURE AND ILLNESS;  </P> <P> HEALTH: THOUSANDS OF WORKERS FACE THE EFFECTS OF THE 'MIRACLE FIBER' DESPITE 18  YEARS OF REGULATION. THE NUMBER OF PLAINTIFFS SUING COMPANIES RISES DAILY.  </P> <P> Kevin Quinn's father began working for Consolidated Edison in the 1940s, when  asbestos was still considered a miracle fiber and no regulations governed its  use.  </P> <P> William Quinn died in 1980 of cancer linked to asbestos.  </P> <P> His son was hired by the same utility in 1979. In the years since his father  first came in contact with asbestos, numerous laws were passed to protect  workers from what had become acknowledged as a prime health risk.  </P> <P> But in 1987, Quinn said, he was working at a plant when asbestos-covered doors  were removed from boilers and dropped to the floor. The doors remained for  weeks while workers went about their duties without protective gear amid clouds  of asbestos dust, he said.  </P> <P> "I used to walk past that area every day," he said. "They told us it was safe.  And it turns out it wasn't."  </P> <P> Now, Quinn has joined 180 co-workers and the Environmental Protection Agency in  suing Con Ed, charging that he was exposed to the same material that killed his  father.  </P> <P> Eighteen years after passage of the first federal law regulating asbestos,  thousands of workers -- at utilities like Con Ed, and in other industries where  asbestos was used as an insulator -- still face its effects.  </P> <P> "We are talking to people who are extremely surprised that asbestos is still a  problem," said Heather Maurer, executive director of Asbestos Victims of  America. "But the incidence of asbestos disease is on the increase instead of  the decrease, despite restrictions that have been applied to make the use of  asbestos safer."  </P> <P> A recent union-sponsored screening of 538 Con Edison workers found that 20% had  either scarred lungs or mesothelioma, an asbestos-caused cancer of the lining  of the abdomen or the lungs.  </P> <P> Since 1987, Con Ed has been cited by the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration for more than half a dozen alleged violations -- mostly failure  to monitor the level of asbestos fibers in the air -- at the Indian Point  nuclear plant in Buchanan; at a plant in Astoria, Queens, and at Quinn's 74th  Street plant in Manhattan.  </P> <P> Some allegations are still under investigation, some have been contested and  dropped by OSHA, and Con Ed settled others by paying a fine.  </P> <P> "Prior to 1973, we didn't know what the asbestos risks were," said Con Ed  spokeswoman Rosalie Zuckerman. "We're not denying that prior to that time,  there was exposure. But now that we're aware of it, whenever we do any asbestos  work, we follow all the regulations."  </P> <P> She added that since 1973, the company has had two medical vans visiting Con Ed  plants, carrying X-ray machines to test for asbestos scarring.  </P> <P> She would not comment on Kevin Quinn's suit. But Quinn said the company was  negligent in 1987, when he was exposed. The workers, he said, were kept in the  dark.  </P> <P> "We didn't realize we were working around asbestos till a shop steward took an  air sample to the White Lung Assn.," he said.  </P> <P> Because asbestos cancers can take 20 to 35 years to develop, workers like Quinn  who believe they have been exposed recently may not become sick until the year  2020. People who were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s, '60s and '70s are just  now getting sick.  </P> <P> A study by Dr. Irving Selikoff, perhaps the world's most noted asbestos  researcher, and his colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine projects  that asbestos cancer rates won't peak until 1992 and won't drop off  significantly until after the year 2000.  </P> <P> Smoking exacerbates the risk of asbestos-related lung cancer, which is  incurable in 70% to 95% of cases, said Dr. Stephen Levin, who works with  Selikoff. Mesothelioma is always fatal. Asbestos exposure also increases the  risk of colon cancer, which has an 80% cure rate if caught early.  </P> <P> The study predicts that 9,739 deaths from asbestos exposure will be recorded in  1992 in just 11 industries, including utilities, construction, car and railroad  engine repair, shipbuilding and asbestos manufacturing.  </P> <P> Many Con Ed workers fear that they might surface among those statistics:  </P> <P> * Gene Duffy, 46, has worked for Con Edison for 25 years. His chest X-rays show  lung scarring; he often has trouble breathing. Duffy said he can't even cut his  lawn without taking a rest halfway through to catch his breath.  </P> <P> * Artie Sagevick, 58, a 31-year veteran. He gave up smoking 25 years ago but he  has "coughing fits 15 minutes at a time a couple of times a day."  </P> <P> * Steven Amato, a 21-year employee, said: "If you had to do a strenuous job, go  up and down stairs, I could not do it. In the wintertime, I throw the phlegm  all day long. . . . I'm 51 years old and I feel like an old man."  </P> <P> All three want compensation from Con Ed and asbestos manufacturers, as well as  more help from their union. They, and many of their co-workers, are suing the  manufacturers.  </P> <P> Lawyer Chris Placitella is handling similar suits by 130 Con Ed workers. His  firm represents 3,300 additional workers from other utility companies who are  involved in similar suits, and the number of plaintiffs rises daily.  </P> <P> Con Edison has other asbestos-related worries. City officials have raised  concerns about public exposure to asbestos from Con Ed accidents. In several  recent incidents, asbestos insulation wrapped around underground Con Ed steam  pipes has blown off when the pipes or nearby water mains burst.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Asbestos had been suspected of causing lung diseases since about the turn of  the century, but it wasn't until 1973 that federal laws began to regulate  exposure. Inhalation of asbestos fibers triggers the diseases, which may lay  dormant for 20 years or more. Asbestos has been widely used as insulation, and  as the material ages it becomes friable, which means that its fibers crumble  and can be released into the air. The Environmental Protection Agency requires  asbestos' removal from older buildings, especially schools.  </P></p>

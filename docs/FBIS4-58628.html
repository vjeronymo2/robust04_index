			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Adnan Husayn: "Clashes in Northern Iraq Between </F> Barzani's and Talabani's Fighters"]    [Text] London -- A dispute over land ownership in the area  of Qal'at Dizah north of the Iraqi Kurdish city of  al-Sulaymaniyah has led to clashes between gunmen of the two  main Kurdish parties, namely the Kurdistan Democratic Party  [KDP], led by Mas'ud Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan [PUK], led by Jalal Talabani. The battles extended to  cities and villages in three of the four Kurdish governorates.    Sources of the two parties agree that the fighting, which  started on 1 May, stopped yesterday, leaving an unspecified  number of casualties, both dead and wounded.    The two parties' sources, contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  yesterday, said that the leaderships of the two parties and  figures from other Kurdish parties and Iraqi Arab opposition  parties succeeded in stopping the fighting which had started in  the Qal'at Dizah area near the border with Iran in the wake of a  tribal dispute over land ownership between individuals with  split political loyalties to the two parties. Relations between  the two parties have been characterized by rivalry and  sensitivity, and at the end of last year they formed a joint  command to avoid armed clashes between them and to coordinate  their supervision of the local government which they formed and  in which they shared influence for the past two years.    Statements issued by the two parties yesterday said that  clashes occurred between their peshmerga forces in the main  cities of al-Sulaymaniyah and Dahuk and also in the city of  Raniyah in the extreme east and in Zakho in the extreme west  near the border with Turkey.    The European branch of the KDP distributed an appeal for an  end to the fighting by its leader Barzani the night before last.  It said: "Despite the very serious aggressions against our  party in Qal'at Dizah, Raniyah, and al-Sulaymaniyah in recent  days, as the future of our Kurdish people faces a most serious  threat, and to prevent any further appalling tragedies, I call  on all parties to remain calm and to stop the fighting  immediately." He also called for a meeting of the Kurdistan  Front which is an alliance of Kurdish parties, in existence  since 1988. That meeting was supposed to take place yesterday.    According to sources from both sides, the political bureaus  of the two parties held a joint meeting in Barzani's presence  but in the absence of Talabani, who is in Italy. They issued a  joint appeal to their forces and supporters calling for the  immediate cessation of fighting, the release of the detainees  from both sides, and the return of the gunmen to their bases and  camps. But a statement issued by the PUK said that the fighting  spread to Dahuk and Zakho after that appeal was made. The PUK  statement urged forces of both sides "to stop the military  operations immediately and not to allow any new eruptions."</p>

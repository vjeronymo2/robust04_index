			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kenji Takeuchi, Tokyo Economic News Department </F> reporter: "Bureaucrats Take Tough Attitude Toward U.S."]    [Text] The Japanese Government's negotiating stand in the  Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks has been notably tough.  In the talks, the U.S. side has stuck to its demand for setting  "numerical targets" designed to gain access to the Japanese  market. This approach has come under attack in the United  States. Being inspired by the attack in the United States, the  Japanese side therefore has gotten tough increasingly at the  talks. The thinking of bureaucrats in the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI], the Foreign Ministry,  and the Finance Ministry at the talks has changed greatly. Will  the transformation of Kasumigaseki [government district in  Tokyo], which has begun to speak out with a "no" [to U.S. trade  demands], result in the construction of an "equal Japanese-U.S.  partnership," which has never gotten off the ground, or result  in the further deepening of the United States' distrust in  Japan? Japanese-U.S. relations now stand at a crossroads.    An official at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo disclosed that  apprehension spread within the U.S. Government late last year  when Masahisa Naito, director general of MITI's Industrial  Policy Bureau, resigned. At the time, a U.S. Government  official asked, "Is MITI really going to sack a pro-American  official?" Mr. Naito was in fact dismissed, and he was one of  the Japanese Government officials who knew the United States  well and who had broad personal ties with U.S. Government  officials.  <H5>  Dependence on Personal Ties Becomes Less Important </H5>   Mr. Naito resigned because of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], which aimed to subordinate the bureaucracy to  politicians, and because of a factional struggle within MITI.  Some officials in MITI said in unison, "The U.S. Government's  apprehensions missed the point." The dependence on personal  ties in the conduct of diplomacy with the United States has  certainly become less important.    The chief of the Americas Division of MITI's International  Trade Policy Bureau is a working-level official in charge of  trade negotiations with the United States. Many of the  successive division chiefs have served in the New York office of  the Japan External Trade Organization (Jetro), which is called  "MITI's hidden channel to the United States."    Mr. Masakazu Toyoda, who became the chief of the Americas  Division last July, has not served in the United States. He is  the first division chief who has written an article in the  "Report on Unfair Trade" compiled by the Industry Structure  Council that was critical of the United States' protectionist  trade policy. A senior MITI official says that Toyoda was  appointed division chief under "MITI's personnel management  policy of giving important posts to officials who are able to  analyze the United States in a unbiased way."    In the Finance Ministry, which has maintained its own  negotiating channel with the U.S. Department of the Treasury,  Deputy Finance Minister Matoko Uchinai, a typical pro-American  official, resigned in 1991. The channel is now close to  breaking.  <H5>  The Emergence of Officials With a Diversified Awareness </H5>   The Finance Ministry asked the Foreign Ministry to arrange a  meeting between Prime Minister Hosokawa and U.S. Treasury  Secretary Bentsen when the latter visited Japan in late January.  This became a topic among government officials. The "practice"  under which "the Finance Ministry is exclusively in charge of  arranging all itineraries in Japan for high-ranking officials  from the U.S. Treasury Department, and that the Foreign Ministry  cannot touch these itineraries, has broken down."    While the diplomacy-through-personal-ties is receding, an  assertion of "multilateralism" is emerging in Kasumigaseki.  This multilateralism has emerged from the "multilateral trade  system," a doctrine of GATT. Some government officials are  asserting that Japan's trade policy, which has so far focused on  trade relations with the United States, should transform itself  into one that conforms to GATT rules and focuses on trade  relations with other nations.    In taking advantage of the Uruguay Round (the multilateral  trade negotiations), each ministry has staffed its bureau in  charge of GATT affairs with capable officials. GATT is set to  be transformed into the World Trade Organization (WTO), which  will have a powerful say on world trade matters. Yoshihiro  Sakamoto, director general of MITI's Trade Policy Bureau, says,  "We want to foster an awareness among our officials that they  need to hold trade talks with U.S. negotiators with a  multilateral perspective."    The officials with a multilateral perspective are already  claiming: "If the United States slaps sanctions on Japan, Japan  will take its case to GATT. If Japan compromises with the  United States on numerical targets, this would lead to a loss of  Japan's credibility in Asia and Europe." What should not be  overlooked is their experience with the Uruguay Round.  <H5>  The United States Is More Pusillanimous Than Thought </H5>   A junior MITI official who saw the United States make large  concessions in 11th-hour negotiations with the European Union  (EU) says, "I think that although the United States talks tough,  it is more pusillanimous than I had thought."    Multilateral negotiations are "open negotiations" in which  negotiators exchange their assertions according to rules and are  a power game in which the interests of nations clash. In  previous Japanese-U.S. negotiations, attention has focused on  how far Japan will go in making concessions to the United  States. Now, however, a group of bureaucrats with a sense of  the game, and who are eager to hold trade talks with U.S.  negotiators on an equal basis, is emerging.  <H5>  The Concessive Thinking Is Losing Weight </H5>   Japanese Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama, who  recently returned to Japan, told Prime Minister Hosokawa,  "Although the United States has a good impression of the  Hosokawa government, it is tough in trade negotiations." In  response, a senior Foreign Ministry official said coolly,  "Almost no Foreign Ministry officials believe that Japan must  concede as much as possible to the United States to keep its  relations with that country in place."    According to the same senior Foreign Ministry official, the  keywords of Japan's diplomacy toward the United States are  "broad and in the medium-term." The idea is that "Japan aims to  build a friendly medium-term relationship between Japan and the  United States while pointing out to the U.S. Government, which  is focusing on economic issues, the importance of maintaining  security and politically cooperative relations between the two  countries." This concept implicitly indicates that Japan does  not care about the occurrence of temporary discord in its  relations with the United States. In fact, no tensions are  evident in government offices despite rough sailing in the  Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks.    With the collapse of the cold war structure, the importance  of security issues in Japanese-U.S. relations has decreased.  Another senior Foreign Ministry official said, "The Foreign  Ministry is no longer in an obsessive mood to recheck Japan's  relations with the United States whenever Japanese-U.S. summit  talks are held."    There is another reason why Japanese bureaucrats feel  relaxed: the decrease in the competitiveness of Japan's economy.  The Japanese-U.S. semiconductor agreement, which the U.S.  Government intends to use as a model for "numerical targets,"  was concluded in 1986; plans for the expansion of Japan's  purchase of U.S.-made auto parts were announced in early 1992.  At the time of concluding the semiconductor agreement, Japanese  chip makers were in a dominant position, and some Japanese chip  makers even said, "Our cornering the U.S. chip market is just a  matter of time." At that time, the share of Japanese-built cars  in the U.S. market was on the increase.    Now the situation has been reversed. U.S. chip and  automobile makers have outstripped their Japanese counterparts  after catching up with them. Japan's current-accounts surplus  posted a record high in 1993. It is apparent that the surplus  is on the decline after peaking that year.    A senior MITI official involved in semiconductor  negotiations  with the United States said: "We felt guilty in our minds that  Japan was disrupting the economies of the United States and the  world. Now, we have no such guilty conscience." A cynical  structure has been built wherein the "weakness of one's economy"  leads to strength in negotiations.  <H5>  Danger Leading to a Change in Attitude </H5>   Perhaps the new thinking of bureaucrats is a first step  toward transforming the psychologically warped Japanese-U.S.  relations into "ordinary bilateral relations." In their being  transformed, however, there is a danger that this could lead to  a "change in the attitude of each toward the other." At a  recent seminar, junior MITI officials snarled at a U.S. official  well versed in Japan-U.S. negotiations: "The Japanese market is  open, and there is no problem with the market. The United  States is heading toward managed trade." The U.S. official  responded to their criticism, saying: "We believe that Japanese  businessmen and scholars do not disagree at all on the point  that the Japanese economy is managed to a substantial extent.  If Japanese bureaucrats are only criticizing the United States  for pursuing `managed trade' instead of themselves addressing  Japan's problems, the United States will point out their  hypocrisy."</p>

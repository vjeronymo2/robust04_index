			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Miraleste -- A headline in Friday's edition of The Times incorrectly said that  an election sought by a parents group in the Palos Verdes Peninsula School  District would deal with the proposed closure of Miraleste High School.  Instead, the election, had it been approved, would have involved a proposal to  form a separate school district on the east side of the peninsula.  </P></p>

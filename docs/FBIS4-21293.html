This announcement was made  here today by the PJF deputy commissioner, Javier Norona  Guerrero.    He explained that, during the operation, headed by the  force's commander in the zone, Armando Alarcon, and backed by a  special group from the Office of the Attorney General of the  Republic (PGR), 131 packages of the aforementioned drug were  intercepted moments before they could be shipped to the United  States.    Norona Guerrero added that the investigation conducted by  the  PGR personnel ended with the capture of Ramon Moreno Gomez, aged  27.    Seven PJF agents participated in the operation, called  "Lightning," backed by an agent from the Federal Public  Prosecutor's Office, successfully intercepting the drugs.  According to Eduardo Mancera, group chief of that police force,  this dealt a severe blow to the international drug Mafias.    He noted that the PJF agents seized the drugs from a 1978  Dodge pickup truck without license plates, as it was leaving a  warehouse located in the Colonia Industrial, at 2379 Montevideo  Street. The vehicle was confiscated by the PGR, which took it to  that office's facilities in Ciudad Juarez.    He claimed that, if the marijuana had reached the United  States, it would have supplied 200,000 addicts.    The subject under arrest and the drugs were placed at the  disposal of the authorities.</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / IG Metall and employers to meet Germany's week-long engineering sector dispute abated yesterday as trade union leaders and employersannounced a return to the negotiating table on Monday. Gesamtmetall, theengineering workers' employers association, said its leaders in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia would meet their counterparts from the IG Metall trade union in Cologne to discuss new compromises for wage agreements in 1995. The m eeting will break a week-long deadlock in wage negotiations which has been marked by protest strikes across the country. Between 60,000 and 150,000 workers have stopped work for several hours a day in protest against employers' refusal to grant them a 5.5 per cent pay increase for 1995. Gesamtmetall is instead offering a cut in real income and a reduction in holiday pay. The news of a return to the negotiating table came as figures for December industrial orders confirmed economists' views that the German economy is slowly recovering. West German industrial orders for the month rose by a seasonally-adjusted 1.1 per cent over November. Domestic orders declined by 3.5 per cent, however, while foreign orders rose by 1.5 per cent, according to the federal Economics Ministry. On a two-month basis, favoured by the ministry because itremoves the impact of seasonal factors, orders in November and December were down 2 per cent from the previous two months, with orders for capital goods recording the sharpest drop, at 4 per cent. November and December orders were up by 2 per cent on the same period in 1992, however, with domestic orders down 2.1 per cent, but foreign orders up by 10.3 per cent, confirming a pick-up in demand outside Germany, particularly in the US.</p>

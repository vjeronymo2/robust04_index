			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, May 4 (CNA)--Trade unions from both sides  of the barbed wire which divides Cyprus since the 1974 Turkish  invasion met Wednesday [4 May] at the free areas to discuss how  they can play a role in building trust and understanding between  the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.    In a joint announcement, the six trade unions (three from  each side) said they decided to stage jointly next November a  trade union forum in which all labour organisations of Greek and  Turkish Cypriots will participate.    An effort will be made so that the forum will be held under  the auspices of the European Union while experts from European  trade unions will be invited to attend. The forum will address  labour and social-economic issues of common interest.    Those attending today's meeting were PASIDI [Pancyprian  Union  of Civil Servants], PEO [Pancyprian Labor Federation], SEK  [Confederation of Cypriot Workers], and three Turkish Cypriot  unions namely KTAMS, DEV IS and TURK SEN.    The joint statement said that the six labour organisations  "reaffirmed their determination to step up their efforts in  order to promote and consolidate trust between the two  communities".    It said the common interest and destiny of the two  communities demanded their cooperation through mutual  understanding for the joint handling of problems and the  overcoming of obstacles.</p>

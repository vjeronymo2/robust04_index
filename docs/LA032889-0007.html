			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. POLICY ON IMMIGRATION  </P> <P> Despite the traditional admonition "don't pick a fight with those who buy ink  by the barrel," it seems appropriate to respond to several aspects of your  editorials on Feb. 22 ("Bad Scene in South Texas") and March 8 ("Spotlight on  the INS") regarding Immigration and Naturalization Service and U.S. immigration  policy.  </P> <P> First, with respect to my tenure as INS commissioner, please note the  following: I am still on the job; I am currently the most senior high level  political appointee in the Department of Justice, having served under Attorneys  General William French Smith, Ed Meese and Dick Thornburgh over 7 1/2 years; I  have not been informed either that I will be staying or departing; I will  continue to serve at the pleasure of the President and attorney general.  </P> <P> Second, it would seem The Times would recognize and acknowledge the tremendous  management and policy improvements in immigration over the last 7 1/2 years. In  Southern California alone, over 1 1/2 million former illegal aliens were  legalized under the very successful program conducted by INS.  </P> <P> With respect to some of the suggestions of The Times for reorganization, these  in all probability would create more problems than they will solve. For  example, the Border Patrol, with other immigration functions, has long been  central to a successful national policy.  </P> <P> The last point relates to The Times frequent support for the approach of  "extended voluntary departure" (EVD) where aliens from Central American  countries would be allowed to come to the U.S., stay here until conditions  improve, and then be required to return. It is very naive for The Times not to  realize the obvious: If we invite Central Americans (22 million) to come to the  United States, it would be a tremendous magnet, with potentially millions of  aliens coming to this country. Once they have come to the U.S., how would we  make any reasonable determination in a few years that conditions were now all  right for them to return? Beyond that, how would we effectively locate and then  uproot people who had been here several years, become part of our society, and  return them to Central America?  </P> <P> If there is one lesson learned with illegal immigration, it is that the longer  a person is here illegally, the more difficult it is to remove him. EVD is not  a solution; it is part of the problem.  </P> <P> ALAN C. NELSON  </P> <P> INS Commissioner  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

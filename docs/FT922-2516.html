			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recoups early losses in subdued trade Wall Street ALTHOUGH US share prices recovered from early losses incurred in the wake of Friday's bad news from Monsanto, stock market sentiment remained subdued all day, leaving major indices little changed at the end of trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed a slight 0.54 up at 3,354.90. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 0.53 at 410.29, while the American SE composite was down 2.54 at 388.78 and the Nasdaq composite 0.51 easier at 569.01. Turnover on the New York SE was very light at 164m shares. Overnight weakness in foreign markets, particularly in Tokyo where the Nikkei average tumbled 2.5 per cent, plus the Wall Street market's failure to hold on to Friday's early 30-point Dow gain, set the tone for a weak start to trading yesterday. By the end of the first half-hour, the Dow was down more than 16 points, but there was sufficient demand to bring the index back to its opening level by noon. The early losses were linked to the decline of Monsanto shares, which plunged Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 53 3/4 in turnover of 2.5m as investors reacted to Friday's late warning from the chemical company that its second-quarter earnings would be between 20 and 30 per cent below analysts' estimates that ranged from Dollars 1.60 to Dollars 1.80 a share. Such was the backlog of sellers that trading in Monsanto was delayed at the start until the order imbalance had been rectified. Leading tobacco issues were unsettled by news that Federal prosecutors are conducting a criminal probe into whether the big cigarette makers had misled the public about the health dangers of smoking. Philip Morris retreated Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 73, RJR Nabisco lost Dollars 1/4 early on but finished steady at Dollars 9 1/2 , and American Brands dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 47. Browning-Ferris put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 21 after Kidder Peabody, the broking house, upgraded its rating on the stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy', citing the benefits of the recent equity offering and predicting a return to earnings growth not seen since 1990. Barr Laboratories plummeted Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 6 on news that the US Food and Drug Administration is seeking court approval to prevent the company from manufacturing or selling drugs. The court hearing is scheduled for June 24. Utilicorp dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 23 7/8 on stating that it would take a second-quarter 21 cents a share charge following the discovery that some of its funds had been misappropriated. On the Nasdaq market, Century Medicorp rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 11 1/2 after the company said it would meet analysts' estimates of Dollars 1.13 a share for the year ending June 30. Also higher was Chipcom, up Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 22 1/2 on a Prudential Securities upgrade. Canada TORONTO showed some recovery from an early slide to end on a mixed note after slow trading. The TSE 300 composite index was finally 1.8 up at 3,409.8, while declines held a slight edge over rises by 263 to 259. Volume was 23.2m shares. Gulf Canada plunged CDollars 3 1/8 to CDollars 6 3/4 . The company reported that first test results from its Indonesian gas properties were 'very discouraging'.</p>

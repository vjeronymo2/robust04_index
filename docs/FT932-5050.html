			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Books that shouldn't be taken as read - Nick Garnett visits a company where fakery flourishes IT WAS THE big bookcase Jonathan Eaton had up for sale at the antiques fair in London's Olympia that sparked off the idea for a new business. 'It needed 2,500 books to fill it so we had that many dummies made up to help present it. I asked the buyer whether he also wanted to purchase all those book spines and he said . . . 'Well, of course I want them. I haven't any time to read'.' That was 1990. The Dummy Book Company, set up shortly after the antiques fair, generated sales last year of Pounds 380,000. From its workshop in a converted Gloucestershire cow shed, the tiny business supplies not only false tomes for bookcases but also a range of items based on this curious use of fakery. Boxes for videos which look like ageing copies of Fly Fishing by JR Hartley, CD holders simulating Gardiner's History Of England, an icebucket camouflaged as the Waverley Novels. Rules Of Football is made up as a paperweight crowned with a rugby ball. Other paperweights come with miniature models of baseball bats and mitts and golf clubs. 'I know it sounds a crazy business, but it really took off.' Eaton, who abandoned his life as an antiques dealer to concentrate on running the Dummy Book Company, vividly remembers those first 2,500 dummy book ends. 'We thought about buying them completed but the ones you could buy then just looked like Readers Digest volumes with no age. We went to a local company, History Craft in Cirencester, and it supplied the basic resin dummies. My wife and I painted them all on our kitchen table. We nearly had a divorce doing it.' The Dummy Book Company, which employs 11, now does things a bit more professionally. It still buys the chalk-based resin blanks from History Craft. These book spines are made from moulds taken directly from real books. A small team at the Dummy Book Company converts the white resin into simulated leather by staining, then uses waxing and polishing techniques to produce antiqueing followed by gilding the letters. Eaton, aged 38, and his wife Anne-Marie started the dummy book business with Pounds 500 of their own money and maximum loan arrangements of Pounds 65,000 from the Royal Bank of Scotland which took out a charge over their house. Early sales grew quickly, Eaton says, mainly through word of mouth along the antique dealers network, customers paying up to Pounds 20 a foot for imitation book spines. Sales were a surprisingly high Pounds 150,000 in the first 12 months. Last year, the company moved from a small shop in Tetbury to a cow shed on the edge of the town. The Eatons spent Pounds 15,000 clearing the mess and erecting internal walls and are paying just Pounds 5,000 a year rent for 2,000 square feet. The company has grown by expanding its odd range of mimicry, adding holders for letters and telephone directories, waste paper bins, jewellery boxes and ledger containers impersonating Walton's The Compleat Angler. Just 10 per cent of sales come from straightforward dummy book runs. Almost all the rest of the business is based on selling to the gift trade and to some large stores such as London's Harrods and the General Trading Company. Three quarters of the company's output is exported, most to the US. The Department of Trade and Industry helped Eaton take a foothold there by partly funding the company's display at a New York trade show. Every market, from Portugal to Japan, wants only English language books as dummies, Eaton says. The Dummy Book Company is not the easiest type of venture to run. Its costs seem very high. Purchasing, covering materials such as resin blanks and packaging, are the equivalent of a half of turnover and labour 30 per cent. The company's pre-tax profit last year was Pounds 28,000. Selling in the US caused some headaches. 'We originally took on two distributors there but there was some overlapping and it was a mistake.' The company now has one US distributor selling through 65 agents. As with so much of manufacturing it is the retailer that takes the biggest slice. A so-called compact disc 'hide' retails for about Pounds 14.50 and a book paperweight decorated with resin dog at Pounds 45. But this includes a retailer's mark up of usually 100 per cent and VAT. Eaton has made product mistakes. 'We've done about 8,000 of the paperweights with the dog lying on the book but the one with the cat didn't work. The icebucket retailing at Pounds 120 was not successful.' He considered making bedside condom holders using Dickens' Hard Times as the dummy, but thought it too risque. 'Our biggest problem though is cashflow,' Eaton says. Dispatching Pounds 40,000 of merchandise a month and carrying stocks creates a serious financial and management burden. Eaton says the Dummy Book Company is trying this year to put its house in order. 'Cashflow went up the chute. We have been doing too many gift shows. We are trying now to control stocks better.' The bank recently requested regular cashflow statements and profits will fall this year. Seamus Hawthorne, who joined the company at its start, has been made a director at the age of 21 with a 10 per cent share of the venture. Eaton though has toyed with the idea of attracting investors. Does Eaton use his company's dummy Aesop's Fables or The Ruins of Elsinore at his own home? 'Funnily enough, I've got real books there.'

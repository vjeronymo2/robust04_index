			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEN AND NOW  </P> <P> Wynyate, the rambling Queen Anne Victorian at 851 Lyndon St. in South Pasadena,  has been carefully restored by its present owners, Ian and Barbara  White-Thomson, to preserve its historical integrity as a link to the city's  past.  </P> <P> The house, a historical city landmark also listed with the National Register of  Historic Places, was built in 1887 by Donald M. Graham and his wife, author  Margaret Collier Graham.  </P> <P> It was the year before the city was incorporated and Graham, chosen as its  mayor, signed an anti-saloon ordinance as his first official action. His wife  later described the historic meeting at Wynyate.  </P> <P> "Mr. Graham was opposed to saloons but was not  </P> <P> a Prohibitionist. After the board adjourned he came to me in great amusement  and said: 'It would have been well to remove the wine glasses and the whiskey  bottle from the sideboard before meeting to organize a Prohibition town,' " she  wrote in her memoirs.  </P> <P> Graham, a lawyer who spoke Greek, Latin and Hebrew, had also served his  community as the local mail carrier and driver of a second-hand buggy stage  between Pasadena and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Wynyate currently sits on about two acres of land that originally overlooked  grape vineyards, hence its Welsh name for vineyard. In 1889, naturalist John  Muir planted a lemon eucalyptus that still flourishes on the west side of the  house. The only major change to the structure is the absence of the original  porte-cochere and glass enclosure of its third-floor open porch.  </P></p>

The Contours of Russia's Strength"]    [Text] The many centuries of Russian history teem with  military upheavals -- attacks, aggression, and intervention.  There have often been people around who wanted to test the  strength of our statehood to "breaking point." The country's  fate has often hung by a thread -- and only the Army's military  might and the mass heroism of the people saved our dying  country. In this respect the special, close attention and  impassioned and burning interest which Russian society has  always shown for issues of military policy and the country's  defense doctrine are understandable. The recent collapse of the  seemingly immovable foundations of life and philosophy,  accompanied by the major shifts in the international  military-strategic sphere, has exacerbated these problems still  further. That is why the impatience with which the emergence of  the new Russia's military doctrine -- promised by the president  more than a year ago -- is entirely understandable.    The "Main Provisions of Russian Federation Military  Doctrine"  examined at the Security Council's 3 March and 6 October 1993  sessions and introduced by Presidential Edict No. 1833 of 2  November have finally appeared in the press.    Quite frankly, when you read certain parts of the document  you may doubt that it is talking about the armed forces of an  independent and sovereign state -- the service of some abstract  "world community efforts" and "different collective security  organs" is imposed so blatantly. The following provisions are  quite simply discouraging: "in order to safeguard military  security the state resolves the following tasks: ...providing  backup for operations by the UN Security Council and other  international organizations." Will our state henceforth really  be just an organ to serve Security Council operations; will UN  interests really take precedence over our own national interests?    On reading the document it is alarming to learn that the  Armed Forces are given the role of guaranteeing so-called  "democratic transformations" -- in other words, the Army is  called upon to use its bayonets to maintain a regime pursuing an  antinational, antistate policy and, consequently, to wage war  against its own country's citizens. The Army does not have such  functions in any state other than a dictatorship.    This cannot be acceptable for Russia -- not only because of  its historical traditions, but also because of the people-based  [narodnyy] nature of the Army. Despite all the political  upheavals in the USSR and Russia, despite all the gibes and  mockery, the Army has accomplished the impossible -- it has  remained intact following the collapse of the Union, when it  found itself in the situation of being an "army without a state."    This is all the more impressive given that this mortal blow  was followed by a campaign to divide up the living Army between  the newly "sovereign" republics, to extort new oaths, and to  bribe and blackmail the officer corps. The Army's position  among the people has remained firm, despite the fact that  certain crack teams of elite forces riddled the country's top  state organ with bullets before the very eyes of a stunned  world. The scorn and hatred of their fellow soldiers are the  everlasting companions of these splittists. The Russian Army  saved itself thanks to the powerful patriotic instinct of our  officers and men, and to the fact that the backbone of the  command staff is made up of Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians,  and Tatars -- the peoples who laid the foundations of our great  state.    This also applies in full to the millions-strong army of  scientists, managers, engineers, and workers in the  military-industrial complex who never cease to astonish the  world by producing the most modern equipment and armaments in a  country where everything has seemingly collapsed for good.    Conceptually a military doctrine, by definition, represents  the socially accepted totality of the state's views on the goals  and nature of a possible war, of the preparations for it by the  country and the Armed Forces, and of ways of waging that war.  It should define the enemy or enemies with which military  confrontation is possible, what might be the aims and nature of  such a war or wars, what armed forces the state requires to  conduct hostilities successfully, and what are the main areas  for their organizational development and the procedure for  preparing the country for different military conflicts.    In general terms a state's military doctrine is based on  interrelated military-political, military-strategic, and  military-technical foundations. A detailed elaboration of  military doctrine as a guide to action for the various state  structures, ministries, and departments responsible for the  country's protection "by force" presupposes an extensive  description of the practical organizational, legal, financial,  and other mechanisms which guarantee the effective  transformation of the state's military potential into specific  factors of its Armed Forces' combat might. At the same time,  its fundamental political section -- compact and clear-cut --  can be briefly set out in the form of a number of theses.    I do not plan to assess the published document from a purely  military or military-technical standpoint. To certain  specialists it seems quite constructive and in line with the  realities of our difficult transitional period. But when it  comes to its political tenets it looks -- sadly! -- more than  dubious in respect of a whole series of positions that are of  fundamental importance for Russian security.    The tumultuous events of recent years have fundamentally  altered the geopolitical situation in every aspect -- from the  ideological to the economic and the religious. These changes  could not fail to affect the military-political sphere, the  situation in which can now be described in terms of the  following highly important factors:    1. The collapse of the USSR. The disappearance from the  geopolitical arena of such a powerful military-political entity  has led to a major deformation of the "force field" of all world  politics. The global balance of power established in the world  as a result of World War II and for which mankind paid with tens  of millions of lives has been irreversibly destroyed. The  bipolar world system based on the strategic priority of two  equally great "power centers" -- the USSR and the United States  -- has become a thing of the past.    2. The abolition of the Warsaw Pact. This military bloc --  the counterweight to NATO in Europe -- served to maintain the  military balance of power on which world stability has been  based for the past 40 years. Its collapse is the second factor,  following the collapse of the USSR, that marks a fundamental  change in the military-strategic situation in the world.    3. The qualitative increase in U.S. geopolitical positions.  As a result of the disappearance of the Soviet "power center,"  the United States has to all intents and purposes managed to  carry out a fundamental revision of the results of World War II  in its favor, to use its influence to fill the  military-political "vacuums" that have emerged in the world, and  to adopt in the international community the role of undoubted  global leader in terms of all the most important power  parameters.    In abstract terms our national interests in the immediate  future would be best served by well-intentioned partnership  relations with America in all spheres -- including the  military sphere -- provided that the relationship is one of  equal rights and mutual advantage. That is beyond dispute.  What is at issue is the question of how realistic it is to try  to ensure the long-term stability of these relations without  sacrificing Russia's state priorities. Thus, while making the  utmost effort to develop Russo-U.S. cooperation in the political  and economic spheres, we simply do not have the right to  forget that our military might, which ensures the proper respect  and attention of our partner, will in this case be a very  constructive factor in such bilateral relations.    It would also be irresponsible to forget that, since World  War II, every U.S. military doctrine -- whether the strategy of  "massive retaliation," "realistic deterrence," or "flexible  response" -- has been subordinate to the idea of global  hegemony. Even back in 1945 President Truman stressed in a  message to Congress that the victory in the war had left the  American people "confronting an urgent and permanent need to  assume world leadership."    In January 1993 the U.S. defense secretary submitted to  Congress a document entitled "U.S. Defense Strategy for the  Nineties: The Regional Dimension." This document recognizes  "maintaining a high level of armed forces' combat readiness" and  a deterrence potential across the range of possible conflicts as  being "extremely important to maintaining the U.S. leading role,  with which it can shape the future." Given the overall trend  for a shift in emphasis in armed forces' organizational  development away from confrontation with the USSR (now Russia)  toward "countering regional threats," the "Defense Strategy"  recognizes that "deterring nuclear attack should remain the top  priority."    Under these conditions it is necessary for the Russian  military doctrine to envisage symmetrical combat capabilities  for our Army.    4. The strengthening of the NATO bloc and its new quality.  The evident desire of a number of Central and East European  countries to join NATO, the lack of any realistic counterweight  to its military might in Europe following the Soviet troop  withdrawal from Germany and Poland, and the attempts to expand  the bloc's sphere of responsibility and win a UN mandate for  "peacekeeping operations" in "hot spots" in Europe and even the  CIS all demonstrate that NATO aspires to the role of  military-political referee in the vast geopolitical area  stretching from Greenland to the Persian Gulf.    5. The emergence of a European geopolitical center.  Following the end of the Cold War, the importance of the United  States as guarantor of European security is to a considerable  extent being lost, which makes it possible to predict the  galvanization of an independent "Eurocentric" policy within the  EC.    In its many centuries of confrontation with Russia, Europe  --  particularly West Europe -- has always seen itself as an  integrated whole. The trend toward integration among the  European states, should it result in the creation of a viable  and lasting union with a unified military-political structure,  could in the future substantially influence the geopolitical  force picture by forming a new, European "power center" that  would be fully competitive with America and Russia.    For Russia this means that it is necessary to safeguard the  security of its European borders in light of the fact that these  will be borders with a united Europe. "The border between  Europe and Russia is an obligatory measure in order to avert the  possible emergence in Russia of a temptation to move against the  West," [prodvinutsya na zapad], Guy Sorman, the well-known  French political scientist and economist, believes, expressing a  view that is widespread among the European political elite. The  active attempts by certain NATO and EC forces to integrate  Central European countries -- Poland, the Czech Republic,  Hungary, and so forth -- into their structures should also be  seen as part of this concept.    "A strong and independent Europe should be created not  against Russia but without Russia" -- that assertion of Sorman's  could reasonably claim to be the fundamental slogan of  European policy in the foreseeable future. It is no  accident that the talk of a "united European home" and a "Europe  from the Atlantic to the Urals" -- which Western leaders used to  love using with Gorbachev -- came to nothing so quickly.    Even the remaining supporters of a "big Europe" involving  Russia see such a geopolitical combination merely as a means of  restraining the Russian giant's development. "Russia will  become a fully healthy and viable great power 40 years late,"  Doctor Herbert Kraus, the Austrian political scientist and  analyst, warns. "It is inevitable that it will rival and be  predisposed to conflict with the EC.... If we want to save the  next generation from this, we must start acting today. Right  now we can peacefully defeat Russia, which is the key to the  entire surrounding area.... We who are facing recession will  obtain highly valuable technical material and a ready sales  market!"    This group of factors, linked to the Soviet Union's loss of  the Cold War and to the considerable shift in the geopolitical  balance in the West's favor, could be termed a group of  "purposeful changes," since it is the result of a deliberate  policy pursued by the "developed countries" throughout the  postwar era. This policy, in turn, undoubtedly has its  historical roots in the West's centuries-old military, economic,  and ideological practice of "containing the Russian threat."  This traditionally meant that the Russian state should follow  their national interests.    It would be logical and entirely justifiable today if the  new Russian military doctrine stipulated that its Armed Forces  had the capability to counter new military threats on the  continent....    The "purposeful change" factors by no means exhaust the  results of the global changes of recent years. The most  powerful "side effect" of the weakening of the historical  Russian "power center" has been the controlled growth in  regional threats, which are now casting doubt on the ability of  the Cold War "winners" to respond appropriately, and are  threatening to nullify all the strategic advantages won by the  West during the Soviet "perestroyka" era.    Quite recently U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin admitted at  a  press conference that the end of the Cold War, contrary to  expectations, had made the world even more vulnerable than  before. "The old Soviet threat, although very dangerous, made  for a certain degree of comfort," he stated. "The old  principles worked very well...." But these principles do not  work under the new conditions of universal regional instability,  and the Pentagon has been forced to urgently revise the concept  for the use of its strategic nuclear forces, since under the new  conditions this concept has become virtually meaningless." [no  opening quotation marks as published]    "We are all facing one common problem today -- growing  global  discord," Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former U.S. national security  adviser, warns. The latest book by this analyst who is  influential in world circles is entitled "Out of Control.  Global Turmoil on the Eve of the 21st Century." It is imbued  with a sense of acute alarm about the avalanche of  uncontrollable changes that are occurring.    And the geopolitical bloc which we are accustomed to calling  the "West," which seemed monolithic during the period of tough  anti-Soviet confrontation, is starting to display internal  cracks. The many centuries of infighting among the European  powers, which ended in the 20th century in two terrible world  wars, did not disappear in the face of the "Soviet threat" but  merely took a back seat. Today, on the eve of a major new  rearrangement of spheres of influence, this infighting is again  making itself felt -- and so actively that it is calling into  question the effectiveness of the mechanisms to create a "united  Europe."    Moreover, many analysts specializing in elaborating  predictions about the changes in the geopolitical sphere are  pointing to the fact that by the end of the century there will  be an exacerbation of the United States' relations not only with  China and India but with its current allies -- Germany and  Japan. Their claims are based on the fact that the U.S. economy  will continue to be uncompetitive against the German and  Japanese economies not only in the European and Asian markets  but in the traditional American market too. The United States  will have no way to resolve this conflict other than by  political and military means. And the possibility of Russia's  being involved -- on the American side, of course -- in  "pacifying the recalcitrants" cannot be ruled out.    In a recent interview Margaret Thatcher expressed the  conviction that the Maastricht Treaty would "inevitably lead to  the establishment of German domination of Europe." According to  the "Iron Lady," this frightens her a lot, because she believes  that Germany has never abandoned the idea of achieving world  domination and that "the Germans are very stubborn people who  ultimately always get what they want." The united German  colossus alarms French politicians just as much, although they  try not to advertise the fact.    A major factor in any possible global destabilization  remains  Islamic fundamentalism, which is rooted, apart from the  religious sphere, in the Muslim peoples' natural indignation at  interference by the "developed countries" -- above all, the  United States -- in their internal affairs. There is a growing  environmental crisis, and world conflict is increasing after  "simmering" for many years between the rich, prosperous North  and the hungry, poor, debt-laden South.    Thus, along with the controllable factors of "purposeful  change," the geopolitical and military-strategic sphere is being  influenced increasingly strongly by the virtually uncontrolled  group of "risk factors," which are a consequence of the overall  destabilization of the international situation and constitute a  major obstacle to a predictable, evolutionary development of  events. The struggle between these two trends will, clearly,  continue to determine the direction of world politics in the  next few years.    There is only one force in the modern world capable of  decisively influencing this struggle. In the military-political  sphere it is implemented through a range of measures aimed at  universally establishing a "new world order." And its basic  structures are international, supranational, and suprastate  organizations -- first and foremost, the United Nations with all  its subsidiary and ancillary institutions.    The ultimate aim of the cosmopolitan elite comprising the  organizational nucleus of the "new world order" is to create a  unified global network of planetary control -- a kind of world  superstate run from a united center and enjoying legal priority  over "local" legislation.    The world's press is actively discussing the question of the  "legitimate basis for intervention." All this makes it possible  to assume that the trend toward the forcible limitation of the  state sovereignty of "disobedient" countries will be developed  and honed in the very near future.    Moreover, it is necessary to clearly understand that the  "developed countries" today see the "new world order" primarily  as a way to reinforce their leading position in the  international community. Nonetheless, it is obvious that at  some point the processes of global political integration will  conflict with the interests of the national state elites in  these very countries -- the United States, Germany, or Japan.  If the world's behind the scenes powers directing the  integration processes succeed in overcoming this conflict, their  entire might will be thrown into controlling further "purposeful  changes" in the geopolitical and military-strategic spheres in  the context of the "new world order." But if they fail, it is  quite possible that the world's elites will use all their  influence to expedite the strengthening of "risk factors" with a  view to "detonating" the situation, exploiting the results of  the general turmoil, and achieving at a time of global crisis  what had proved impossible under an evolutionary development of  events.    On the basis of all this it seems logical and justifiable  that the political foundations of Russia's defense doctrine  should be laid down, taking account above all of the following  provisions:    The qualitatively different geopolitical and  military-strategic situation requires a radical and  comprehensive reevaluation of the military doctrine of the  "Soviet period," which was based on the bipolar system of a  world balance of power. The abandonment of the excessive  geopolitical ambitions which exhausted the country's economy and  were often dictated not by its national, state, or historical  interests but by ideological claims to the rapid "victory of  world socialism," presupposes the active reorientation of the  Armed Forces to the priority of confronting regional threats to  our security. Provided, of course, that we unconditionally  maintain our strategic military potential at a level where it  can guarantee to inflict "unacceptable damage" on any potential  aggressor.    At the same time, the historical continuity of our  "patriotic  defense mentality" in all its spheres -- from military-political  theory to military-strategic practice -- should also be ensured.  In reality this means recognizing that Russia's security could  continue to be safeguarded only in the event of its Armed  Forces' being ready to independently and effectively counter the  full range of potential force threats -- from the global to the  regional, local, and even internal.    2. [no number 1 as published] The prospects for military  organizational development should take proper account of the  alarming trends in international politics. Analysis shows that  in the foreseeable future the military-political situation in  the world will be defined by collaboration and confrontation  between the three such trends which we previously dubbed  "factors of purposeful change," "risk factors," and "new world  order factors." Not one of these trends is favorable for Russia,  coincides with its long-term economic, political, or military  interests, or promises us anything new in the future other than  more unrest, worry, and diverse threats. And a readiness to use  force to counter such threats, along with a vigorous  peacekeeping policy to avert them, seems to be the most  effective combination of the various means of safeguarding  Russian security.    3. The Russian military strategy that has been adopted in  the light of present-day conditions can be characterized on the  whole as a strategy of "defense sufficiency" founded on the  political basis of "healthy national pragmatism." This means  that:    a) The immediate period of Russian development should be  seen primarily as a period of stabilization during which it will  be necessary above all to minimize the damage done to the  country by the ill-conceived and undistinguished actions of  politicians over the past few years; mechanisms for mobilizing  all of society's potential with a view to getting the country  out of its profound systemic crisis as quickly as possible will  have to be elaborated; priority attention to the internal  problems of social revival and national regeneration will have  to be guaranteed; any kind of external state activeness will  have to be reduced to a necessary minimum to rule out the  possibility of Russia's getting dragged into the activities of  any supranational international organizations whatsoever which  claim a right to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign  states; and the military activeness of the country's Armed  Forces will have to be very strictly limited to the framework of  Russia's national interests, for the purposes of whose  protection they should have the necessary technical,  organizational, and legal base.    b) The material and personnel resources channeled into  defense should be determined on the basis that the most  important task in this sphere is to prevent any further  deterioration in Russia's military-political and  military-strategic positions in the world arena. The events of  recent years have revealed that we lack reliable military  allies, therefore the priority avenue of military organizational  development should be to safeguard the country's security  against both direct military aggression against it and regional  threats associated with local areas of military-political  instability escalating into the threat of a comprehensive  geopolitical crisis ("global turmoil").    4. Along with the concepts of "healthy national pragmatism"  and "defense sufficiency" the key terms in the Russian military  doctrine, defining its practical features, could now be the  concepts of "vital interests" and "potential enemy." It would  be expedient to introduce the latter term in place of the term  "probable enemy," which was discredited during the Cold War. If  the term "probable enemy" is taken to mean states or alliances  of states that were viewed as hostile in the unjustifiably  ideologized system of references that prevailed earlier, then  the concept of a "potential enemy" could be stripped of its  "state affiliations" and acquire a concrete meaning independent  of ideological predilections -- exclusively in conjunction with  detailed and justifiable military-political forecasts.    The existence of potential military threats in the modern  world is obvious and generally accepted. Consequently, the  introduction of the proposed term should not unjustifiably  concern anyone since it does not affect the overall defensive  nature of our military doctrine. At the same time, it makes the  processes of shaping specific aspects of the state's military  policy and the day-to-day combat training of Russia's Armed  Forces substantially easier.    In turn, the concept of "vital interests" makes it possible  to render the military organizational development process clear  and purposeful wherever its requirements cannot be adequately  reflected with the help of the simple "potential enemy"  definition. These interests -- understood to be Russia's  legitimate right to stake a claim to a geopolitical or regional  balance of power which would safeguard its security and  territorial integrity -- can exist in areas where a "potential  enemy" is simply absent. They may also be made the basis of our  military policy in areas where friendly relations with local  states, mutual loyalty, or other factors rule out the  possibility of any other view being taken of the situation and  require a flexible approach to the safeguarding of Russian  security....    It would be naive to believe that this brief review could  cover all of today's military-political problems. Moreover,  Russia's current position is so vague and complex, so unstable  and changeable, that any claims that the highly important  provisions determining the country's military security which we  have tried to formulate here are final would look very dubious.  Nonetheless, it is necessary to define right now the future  basis for our defense doctrine, to outline its specific forms,  and to map out the general direction of its evolution.    It is the specialists' job to elaborate the  military-strategic and military-technical aspects of military  doctrine, it is the politicians' duty to elaborate the  military-political provisions.    But we must not refrain from emphasizing that the Russian  Army's future lies solely in its link with the people [v yeye  narodnosti]. No mercenary force -- and this is demonstrated by  the experience of manpower acquisition for the Special-Purpose  Militia Detachment -- is capable of defending the people or of  winning their support.    We are obliged to preserve universal military service for  Russia's citizens. We are compelled by life itself to foster in  Russian citizens a sense of patriotism, pride in their  motherland, and a readiness to defend it. We must preserve and  augment the state's defense capability and the Army's combat  readiness. It is necessary to clear away many obstacles and  "democratic" prejudices in this area.</p>

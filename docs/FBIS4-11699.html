			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ron Ben-Yishay: "Let Fatah Establish an </F> Inquiry Commission"]    [Text] It would be appropriate for the Fatah leadership to  establish an inquiry commission into the killing of six senior  Fatah activists in the Gaza Strip two days ago.    The mandate of such a commission -- were it established --  would be to determine why the six acted in direct contravention  to the explicit understandings and agreements between Fatah and  the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], in such a way as to endanger  their own lives and those of passersby. Such a commission would  also ascertain who in the Fatah leadership knew about their  activity or approved it, and punish those responsible.    Instead of doing this, however, the PLO leadership prefers  --  as always -- to blame the IDF. And in the spirit of those who  see a conspiracy behind every corner, there are people who  disseminate in Israeli and foreign media that the undercover  unit's attack on the six was initiated by a group of Israeli  officers who want to foil the Oslo agreement.    However, the facts -- which even Fatah people in the Gaza  Strip do not deny -- all indicate that the tragic mistake should  be entirely attributed to the Fatah members. On Monday  afternoon the six activists -- after proper coordination with  the IDF -- participated in a memorial service for a Fatah  activist in the al- Shaykh Radwan neighborhood, which is located  only several kilometers from the site of the incident. The six  were armed and wore checkered uniforms (apparently with tacit  IDF agreement).    However, they did not settle for this. Following the  ceremony -- and without any prior coordination -- they set up a  roadblock on a main road of the Jabalyah refugee camp, stopped  cars with drawn weapons (Kalashnikovs and pistols), and  distributed leaflets.    It was dark, the Fatah men were masked, and wore no signs to  indicate their affiliation -- in clear contravention to the  agreements between the Fatah leadership and the IDF in the Gaza  Strip.    The undercover soldiers who spotted them assumed -- and  rightly so, from their point of view -- that the six were  terrorists, and went on to attack them. It should be noted that  a short time prior to that incident an attempt was made to  attack the IDF outpost in Jabalyah, and that the IDF is still  responsible for maintaining security in the Gaza Strip. Fatah  is also aware of the fact that undercover units are operating in  the Gaza Strip and should have foreseen what would happen.    It is also inconceivable that 'Arafat's PLO would delay the  negotiations on transferring responsibility for security to the  PLO while at the same time its people on the ground are acting  as though the negotiations have been completed and they no  longer need to coordinate their moves with the IDF before  departing on an armed mission.    The IDF, however, should also draw the appropriate  conclusions. The Jabalyah incident ought to serve as a warning  sign as to what could happen after a Palestinian police force  deploys in Hebron, the Gaza Strip, and Jericho. It should be  feared that the security cooperation agreements of the kind the  delegations are currently striving to attain would "invite" such  incidents.    The more complicated and intricate the security and  coordination arrangements are, the greater the potential for  fatal mistakes on both sides. And as is well known, mistakes  cause escalation in violence and friction even between  well-meaning Palestinians and Israelis.    The only way to avoid this situation is to clearly demarcate  the borders of the sectors in which the Palestinian police force  on the one hand, and the IDF on the other, will operate.    The joint patrols in the sectors slated to be jointly held  will be an inexhaustible source for mistakes and  misunderstandings -- and consequently must be avoided. It is  inadvisable to rely on coordination, especially with an  inexperienced force -- which is exactly what the Palestinian  police force will be at first.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Deal close on Madrid aid for Seat Volkswagen and the Madrid government yesterday came close to an agreement in negotiations over state aid for Seat, the German vehicle group's crippled Spanish subsidiary. Further talks are scheduled next week and VW said a deal could be expected not long after that. According to a joint statement from Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, and Mr Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, the Spanish industry minister, the two agreed that there should be no direct subsidies from the Spanish government for redundancies. Help would come instead in the form of support for technological projects. VW initially sought an injection of DM820m (Pounds 328m) from Spanish central and regional authorities to cover 4,600 further job cuts at Seat, reducing the company's workforce to 9,500. Other multinational motor companies manufacturing in Spain reacted sharply against the prospect of special conditions for Seat. The statement made clear that state aid would be tied to 'certain commitments' from VW and from Seat itself. It also underlined that an agreement would be aimed at 'keeping the basic elements of Seat as a company with its own capability for competing in the global market'. The still-uncertain scale of Madrid's financial commitment is crucial to VW's bid to plug the hole in VW group finances threatening for the second year in succession to sink hopes of breaking even. Seat lost DM1.8bn in 1993, was DM350m in the red in the first quarter of this year, and is heading for a further full-year deficit of DM1bn, according to company officials. VW has taken control of Seat's Pamplona factory and financial services division. The Zona Franca plant in Barcelona - subject of the current negotiations - is to be closed, leaving Seat with just one works, a new plant at Martorell.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Bundestag scraps pricing curb Germany's Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, yesterday sought to introduce more competition by scrapping a 1933 law preventing retailers from reducing prices by more than 3 per cent outside the summer and winter sales. But its efforts are likely to be defeated when the draft law goes to the Bundesrat, or upper house. Attempts to retain the law, passionately defended by small retailers on the grounds that they would be forced out of business, and even by some large chains because it would mean increased competition, were defeated by 314 to 262, with 26 abstentions. In theory retailers can now set their own reductions, which might mean that the German consumer will be given a choice on prices outside sale periods. But in practice, yesterday's vote was a pyrrhic victory for Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, who spearheaded the campaign for a reform of the law, as the Social Democrat-dominated Bundesrat is likely to reject it.</p>

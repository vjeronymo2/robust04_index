			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Observer: Pooled venture The Beijing restaurateurs who have pooled together to compete with invading fast-food chains have surely missed a trick. They should have called their new joint venture Donald's. After all, it is duck they're relying on to win back market share from the hamburgers and such of chief interloper McDonald's, along with Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pizza Hut and numerous others. The city now has about 300 junk-food sellers whose mostly foreign-style wares go down increasingly well with the 1.5m floating population. In their counterattack, the plucky Beijingers are planning three quick-roast outlets in the capital and eventually 50 elsewhere. In addition to the backing of municipal authorities, they have keen support from nearby farmers looking to feather their nests on extra demand for the ducks which take around two months to fatten to a standard weight of 3.4kg. Moreover, while the new venture's promoters may have missed the ideal name, there's still a touch of western marketing hype in the one they have chosen. Even though they have apparently not yet cracked the problem of making the duck not just fast but flavoursome, they have called the company Quanjude which means 'all virtuous'.</p>

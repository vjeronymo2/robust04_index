			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: QVC declines to Dollars 11.7m QVC, the US cable television home-shopping group which earlier this month accepted a Dollars 1.4bn takeover offer from its two largest shareholders, yesterday reported second-quarter profits of Dollars 11.7m, down from Dollars 13.3m for the same period last year. For the first six months of the year, QVC earned Dollars 23.8m, compared with Dollars 34.9m in the same period of 1993. QVC is due to be bought out by the two shareholders - cable groups Comcast Communications and Liberty Media - later this year. The takeover foiled a previous attempt by QVC to merge with CBS, the broadcast television network. The decline in profits during the quarter and half-year was blamed on the cost of setting up electronic retailing joint ventures in the UK and Mexico. Although the ventures reach 17m households in the two countries, QVC does not yet make a profit from its overseas operations, which incurred losses of Dollars 9.6m in the quarter. Net revenues were up 16 per cent during the quarter at Dollars 303.3m, and operating income by 31.5 per cent at Dollars 31.4m. There was little reaction to the earnings from investors, and QVC's shares closed down Dollars  1/16 at Dollars 44 13/16 in trading on the Nasdaq stock market. CBS, which failed to win control of QVC earlier this year, yesterday said its offer to buy 3.5m of its own shares at Dollars 325 a share had expired with the tender oversubscribed. CBS plans to declare a five-for-one stock split, the date of which will be announced on September 14. The company's share price closed up Dollars 2 at Dollars 314 in trade on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.</p>

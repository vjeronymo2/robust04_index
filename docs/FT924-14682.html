			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Holiday sector on bid alert VOLATILITY in the share price of Owners Abroad continued as rumours grew that a bid would be forthcoming from its rival holiday group Airtours. The belief in the market is that it is now a matter not of if, but of when an offer is made, as sources close to both companies indicated that Airtours was the unnamed company which approached Owners three weeks ago and referred to in a statement from Owners on Tuesday. The company said that it had received an approach but that no follow-up had been forthcoming. The two groups are ranked numbers two and three in the package holiday market with a combined share of over 30 per cent; a bid would almost certainly attract the attention of the Office of Fair Trading. However, Owners is also said to have had talks with the German group LTU, which bought the Thomas Cook travel chain in June. It is thought that Owners was discussing a co-operation agreement, rather than a formal alliance. Some in the market suggested that the German group may become involved as a white knight in the event of a hostile bid. In the meantime, Owners shares, which have been propelled on the back of the takeover speculation, fell back as profit-takers moved in. They ended 6 1/2 off at 70 1/2 in large turnover of 2.9m. Airtours fell 7 to 239p. Anglian bought deal The worst individual performance of any Footsie stock came from Anglian Water, whose shares retreated 13, or just over 3 per cent, to 417p, after Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French utilities group, disposed of its near 9 per cent stake in the group. The stake, some 26.52m shares, was sold by Lyonnaise, in a bought deal operation, to Cazenove, Anglian Water's broker, and Warburg Securities. Lyonnaise sold the stock to the two broking firms at 410p a share. The stock was then placed with institutions at 415p a share, giving the two participating brokers a 5p a share turn on the deal, or a total profit in excess of Pounds 1.32m. The first half of the placing was said to have gone smoothly, although there were hints that the remainder proved much more difficult than had been expected. Some institutions, that were said to have taken up their original allocations were rumoured to have had to sell blocks of other water shares to enable them to take on more Anglian. Lyonnaise acquired its holding in Anglian in the immediate aftermath of the flotation of the 10 water companies in December 1989. It also built up a 6 per cent stake in Wessex Water and a 7 per cent holding in Severn Trent. Lyonnais sold both these stakes, at a substantial profit, in December 1990, via bought deals executed by Smith New Court. The other water stocks in the Footsie suffered accordingly, with Thames aggressively sold and finally 9 off at 432p, on 2.8m traded, North West 8 lower at 434p and Severn Trent 4 1/2 easier at 392p. Of the smaller companies, Welsh Water lost 10 to 454p and South West 7 to 425p. Shell retreat Shell Transport delivered another disappointing performance, underperforming the Footsie and the oil sector, after one senior executive from Shell's chemicals division delivered what was described as a cautious address to London analysts. Shell said it saw no upturn in its chemicals business until late 1993. The presentation was accompanied by a bearish note on Shell issued by County NatWest. Mr Fergus MacLeod at County said: 'The market's search for security in the face of turmoil of the past months has pushed Shell's rating up to a high from which there is little conceivable upside, despite its well known operational and balance sheet strength. While the uncertainty continues it will be very difficult for fund managers to decide to lighten holdings, but the simple fact is that Shell has been over-hyped and is over-priced.' Shell retreated 9 more to 522p with turnover a hefty 7.3m. The cautious note struck on the outlook for chemicals held ICI back, the shares dropping 14 1/2 to 1060 1/2 p. Enterprise Oil continued to gain ground, racing up 7 more to 422p, with the Kleinwort buy note and the round of US presentations still finding a ready response in the market. Lasmo, too, attracted considerable support, moving up 5 to 161p. Profit-taking was seen in Unilever as some in the market felt it had had a good run. Some fund managers switched out of the UK 'plc' shares and into the Dutch 'nvs', arguing that the latter are at a 5.5 per cent discount to the plc equivalent. The shares retreated 21 to 1041p. Scottish supermarket group Shoprite jumped 48 to 587p following recent presentations by BZW. Asda climbed 2 1/2 to 36 1/2 p as hints were heard that trading was steady and that one leading broking house would be upgrading today. The 4 per cent drop in new car sales during September triggered a series of profits downgrades in the motor components area of the market. 'It's nothing but bad news in the car manufacturing business,' said Mr Alistair Stewart at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, the stockbroker. Mr Stewart said he had downgraded his profits estimates 'across the board' in the sector to allow for the drop in UK car sales, the problems caused to the German industry by a rampant D-Mark and the production cuts in the US car industry. The Carr downgrades had an impact on GKN, 10 lower at 359p, Laird group, 12 off at 259p and Lucas, 4 off at 88p. Dealers said Lucas had bounced off the bottom as a recent large selling order, apparently executed by Williams de Broe, had been completed. The market's response to news that General Accident (GenAx)is paying CDollars 165m for Prudential's Canadian direct general insurance business, funded by the issue of 13.5m new shares at 588p a share, was to lift GenAx shares 5 to 510p. Prudential shares moved up 10 to 269p on the news. BZW's profits' upgrade coincided with a tightening of the market in Standard Chartered shares, which raced up 31 to 476p on turnover of just 2m shares. Barclays were again very busy, with 11m shares traded. Dealers said there had been heavy trading in the options market as well as big activity generated by the argument over whether a cut in the dividend is on the cards. The shares rose a penny to 337p. There was considerable selling by nervous holders of the electricity stocks ahead of a document expected to be published today by the electricity industry watchdog (Offer). East Midland, after confirming its interest in the forthcoming sale of British Coal, dropped 7 to 370p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (18).

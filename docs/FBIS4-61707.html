			<p>BFN     [Text] On Thursday 5 May, President Kravchuk signed an  edict that liberalizes Ukraine's export procedures with the view  of expanding exports of Ukrainian commodities and thus (promote)  foreign currency income. The edict specifies in particular that  a list of commodities are approved for which quota and licence  issue regulations are nullified in 1994, as well as that  licence-issue procedures are no more applicable to commodities  not covered by the quota regulations. The cabinet is further  instructed to draft, within a month's term, and submit to the  Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, a law on necessary amendments to the  cabinet edict that regulate exports of commodities and services  and to adjust within a two-week term its own resolutions to this  edict.</p>

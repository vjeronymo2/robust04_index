			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received  in his office at the Prime Ministry this morning Viktor  Posuvalyuk, chief of the Near East and North African Department  at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the special  representative of Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    During the meeting, they discussed bilateral relations and  regional issues, including the peace process. The Russian  official briefed the journalists on this meeting. He said:    [Begin Posuvalyuk recording, in progress] ...and I would  like to thank his excellency the prime minister for giving  sufficient time for our discussions, which I consider important  ones. Discussions were divided into two parts, so to say: One  dealt with relations between our two countries; and the other  dealt with international and regional issues, led by the peace  process.    First of all, I conveyed a salute, through his excellency  the  prime minister, from President Boris Yeltsin to His Majesty King  Husayn. I also conveyed a warm salute from Russian Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin to his excellency the prime minister.  With regard to bilateral relations, we were agreed that they  are generally good. We discussed some details with the  participation of our ambassador.    We also agreed on the steps that we will take in the near  future in order to consolidate these relations; I mean in  economic and other technical fields. This is because we believe  that political dialogue is under way, and that it is useful for  both sides.    With regard to the peace process, we emphasized our interest  in the Jordanian side, in Jordan's importance in the peace  process, and in Jordan's participation in the progress of the  Arab-Israeli negotiations on the bilateral and multilateral  levels. We also discussed matters that are now developing in a  dynamic manner. Thus, consultations should also be dynamic.  With much satisfaction, I indicate that we agreed on many  issues, and that our views were very close. [end recording]</p>

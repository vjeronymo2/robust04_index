			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Imigran boost for Glaxo NEWS THAT Glaxo had received formal approval from the US authorities for the marketing there of Imigran, its anti-migraine drug, reversed an initial decline in the share price, sending it swiftly forward. The shares closed 20 up at 768p having earlier been 12 adrift on US switching into cyclical stocks. Earlier this month, the US authorities had hinted that approval for Imigran would probably be forthcoming and many market observers had pencilled in a probable announcement for some time during the first quarter of 1993. Glaxo said yesterday that it expects to launch the drug in the US in March, still in line with most analysts' expectations. However, Glaxo's confirmation came only just before the London market closed last night, too late to restrain buying in London in anticipation of an earlier US launch date. Mr Andrew Porter, pharmaceuticals analyst at Nikko Europe, predicts that Imigran will generate sales of Dollars 1bn a year by 1995 from the US. Food manufacturing stocks were among the worst performers in the market on the back of a pessimistic survey on the outlook for the sector. A quarter of the food, drink and consumer manufacturers and suppliers interviewed said they did not expect any improvement in business until 1994. Fewer than half had detected any improvement in current demand. Among those to suffer falls, Booker lost 6 to 377p, Cadbury-Schweppes 5 to 483p, Northern Foods 4 to 273p, Unigate 5 to 299p and United Biscuits 5 to 363p. A line of stock overhung Argyll most of the day, the block of 1m finally going through at 419p. The shares closed 3 lighter at 420p. A rumour that Christmas trading at Kwik Save had been disapointing left the shares 9 adrift at 806p. Recovery talk and the much-publicised sales boom lifted stores stocks. Among those benefiting, Boots rose 9 to 550p, Dixons 9 to 268p, Kingfisher 11 to 583p and Storehouse 6 to 207p. A flurry of slightly more optimistic reports on the housing market failed to inspire any of the related sectors. One analyst said that such forecasts had been repeatedly bullish and wrong in the past and that the market was taking its cue from the continuingly weak industry statistics, such as last week's dull new construction orders for October. Among construction stocks yesterday, Wimpey managed to shine, the shares gaining 3 to 119p. Old takeover target Tarmac was the subject of renewed speculation, but this time seen as a possible predator with Ibstock Johnsen believed to be its likely prey. Tarmac shares retreated 5 to 101p, with Ibstock a penny better at 40p. US investor moves out of defensive and into cyclical stocks hit SmithKline Beecham, off 17 1/2 at 487 1/2 p and Wellcome, down 4 to 975p. Fisons edged forward helped by press reports that it may sell its horticultural business to management. The shares gained 2 to 235p. Among chemicals stocks, Courtaulds, BOC Group and ICI all benefitted from the switch to recovery plays. Courtaulds added 8 to 595p, BOC 5 to 768p and ICI 29 to 1051p. Shares in BT rose on the back of its recent round of cost-cutting and its poll position as one of the key recovery hopes. The fully-paid gained 7 to 404p, the part-paid 7 to 300p. Firmness on Wall Street and in the US dollar helped leading oil shares, the best performance coming from Shell which added 8 to 559p. BP added 4 at 245p. BP shares were again restrained by background worries in the stock market over the possibility of a rights issues in the new year. Traders commented that worries over impending fund-raising moves, both in equities and in government bonds, represented one of the chief causes for doubts over the market's dramatic advance in the approach to Christmas. Reports of strong bookings for 1993 holidays helped the listed tour operators. Airtours, Britain's third biggest group, added 7 to 285p, while the second-placed Owners Abroad rose 2 to 87p. Euro Disney surged 22 to 785p. Consumer recovery hopes spilled over into the automotive sector, with Kwik Fit the prime beneficiary, the shares up 9 at 126p. BBA Group, ahead 2 at 157p and T&amp;N (Turner and Newall), 5 1/2 better at 173 1/2 p, also gained from the exposure. In derivatives, further progress by the March contract on the FT-SE Index provided the chief feature in thinly-traded futures instruments. The renewed gain in the stock index future, bringing the March contract to within 10 points of 2,900, provided a strong spur for the underlying stock market, but futures traders warned that dealing in their sector had been extremely light. Throughout the session, March held on to the strong premiums against the cash market which has been a feature of the latest advance in the Footsie Index. However, with many of the Footsie constituents, in particular the pharmaceutical leaders, out of favour at first, the influence of the stock index future was not displayed in early trading. But the traditional power of the stock index future strengthened significantly in the latter half of the session when Wall Street's strong opening supported sharp gains in Glaxo and ICI. At the official close, March at 2,890, showed a premium of 41 against the underlying cash market, of which only 20 points was ascribed to fair value. In traded options, where only 9,928 contracts traded compared with 6,375 in the Christmas Eve half-session, Glaxo headed the actives list with 885 contracts, followed by Marks and Spencer at 607.

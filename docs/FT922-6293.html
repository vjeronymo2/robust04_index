			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Michael Prowse on America: Lord, deliver us from deficits It promises to be one of the strangest chapters in fiscal history. Next month, a Democrat-dominated Congress is expected to back an amendment to the constitution requiring a balanced federal budget. The White House has already signalled its support. Ratification by the required three quarters of state legislatures is not seen as problematic; most will probably be eager to impose on Washington a restraint they have long endured. Believe it or not, most experts predict that a balanced federal budget will be part of the nation's highest law within five years. This prospect is prompting a torrent of critical comment. The bipartisan Congressional Budget Office has denounced the plans as a 'cruel hoax'. The Washington Post says they are 'sloppy, dangerous . . . the ultimate expression of the weakness and dithering . . . they purport to correct'. The alarm has even spread to influential conservative organs. The Economist opposes the amendment, arguing that it is merely a ruse to distract attention from the failure to cut today's record deficit. I find myself sympathising with members of Congress. It may be easier to vote for a balanced budget in 1997 than to cut spending or raise taxes today. Yet the sheer breadth of support for an amendment surely indicates a remarkable shift in opinion. A reform once supported only by a fringe of diehard conservatives is being championed by Senator Paul Simon, a prominent left-leaning liberal Democrat, and many others on the left of centre. What is going on? The answer is that years of criticism of deficits has had an effect. The intellectual battle is won. Most members of Congress are now convinced that persistent deficits do harm: the long-term impact on national savings and hence on investment, productivity and growth is better understood than in the 1980s. At the same time, big deficits are widely denounced as an immoral charge on future generations and, increasingly, as a source of inequality today: the federal government pays more in interest to wealthy bondholders than it spends on programmes for the disadvantaged. But politicians also know - better than their critics - that the peculiar character of American politics makes responsible action desperately hard to achieve, especially when the parties share control of Congress and the White House. Many of the arguments against a constitutional amendment are spurious. People say that the states regularly flout their balanced budget requirements. They may cheat a little, but their fiscal performance is impressive by federal standards. Most do take tough action when necessary. This has not been true for decades in Washington. The federal government has achieved a surplus in only one year since Dwight Eisenhower's presidency. In the past 12 years, the national debt has mushroomed from Dollars 1,000bn to Dollars 4,000bn. A more serious objection is that the federal government needs fiscal flexibility because its job is to balance the national economy, rather than its own books. Economists offer two ripostes. The new-classical school says fiscal fine-tuning is impossible because movements in private saving offset the effect of government actions. The experience of the 1980s, when both public and private saving fell sharply, has largely refuted this piece of wishful thinking. But a second objection to fiscal demand management stands: by the time politicians have agreed how to respond to a recession, and passed the necessary legislation, the economy is usually on the mend. The practical significance of reduced fiscal flexibility may thus be limited. It would depend, in any case, on the exact phrasing of a balanced budget amendment. There is no reason in principle to seek balance over a single year: a requirement for balance over a three or five year period would be perfectly feasible. This would allow the 'automatic stabilisers' - falling taxes and rising benefit payments - to cushion demand during recessions. Under current proposals, a three-fifths majority of both houses could override the balanced budget rule; such majorities would be forthcoming if the US faced a 1930s-style depression. The much-vaunted freedom under existing rules has anyway proved illusory: the federal government borrowed so much during the 1980s that it was unable to take action to mitigate the recession. The long-run drain on savings from persistent deficits is a far more serious threat than any temporary loss of fiscal flexibility. Yet the fragmentation of political accountability under the US system focuses attention on the short run. This provides a prima facie case for a constitutional amendment - for rules that force Washington to adopt longer fiscal time horizons. After the disappointments of the Gramm-Rudman legislation in the 1980s, the tough question is whether it would work. Don't be too cynical. The passing of a constitutional amendment is not the same as ordinary legislation. At the very least, it would demonstrate broad national support for fiscal restraint and increase the pressure on Congress and White House to make painful decisions in coming years. At best, it might radically alter the conduct of fiscal policy. An appeal to constitutional authority is the modern equivalent of primitive tribe's prayer for deliverance. Prayers are sometimes answered.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN SALES BRISK AS FEAR STALKS JERUSALEM;  </P> <P> ISRAEL CRISIS: PROTECTION AND REVENGE ARE MUCH ON THE MINDS OF BOTH  PALESTINIANS AND JEWS.  </P> <P> The clientele at the Krav gun shop and shooting range in Jerusalem has grown  more numerous and more demanding, a measure of the fear and tension that have  gripped the city over the last three weeks.  </P> <P> Israeli men came in Wednesday to trade their small-caliber weapons for  something heavier. Women came to take up pistols for the first time in their  lives. Young workers considered renewing a daily familiarity with guns they  thought they had left behind with their army service.  </P> <P> For Palestinians, too, protection is much on their minds, although they are  prohibited by law from buying guns. So residents in Arab neighborhoods and the  occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip are shuttering windows and staying indoors  for fear of reprisal attacks.  </P> <P> Revenge is also much on the minds of Israeli and Palestinian alike: stabbings,  beatings, roving bands of vigilante groups, threatening declarations from  underground groups, police patrols -- all are on the rise. Ever since police  killed 21 Palestinian rioters on the Temple Mount earlier this month, Jerusalem  has been splitting at the seams.  </P> <P> "No one knows how long this will go on," Shalom Uziel, manager of the Krav  shop, said. "But people feel they must protect themselves."  </P> <P> Israel's leaders are forecasting that the fever will pass -- some say sooner,  some later. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir estimates that Jerusalem will return  to a normal but still tense state of affairs in a few days' time, while Defense  Minister Moshe Arens expects it to take a few months.  </P> <P> There is no budging from an unwillingness to open peace talks with  Palestinians, since in the government view, Palestinian violence is innate and  hysterical.  </P> <P> "What prevails among them," Arens said, "are the fanatic and brutal drives, the  lack of respect for human lives, which is typical not only for some of the  Palestinian population in the territories but also for some of the Arab  countries."  </P> <P> Palestinian analysts also believe the violence will subside. There is no  tactical advantage, they say, to the risks of escalation of the Arab uprising,  especially because the spotlight could shift suddenly to the Kuwait crisis.  </P> <P> Yet of the many explosions of civil violence between Israelis and Palestinians  in the past three years, this has been the longest and bitterest.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, a 39-year-old Palestinian died of a beating at the hands of  Israelis who caught him Tuesday in the act of stabbing two women soldiers near  Haifa. The women were both hospitalized, one with a punctured lung.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, someone representing a shadowy group called Eye for an Eye  telephoned television and radio stations to claim responsibility for the ambush  shooting death of a Palestinian laborer. No arrests have been made; police and  witnesses say Israeli civilians shot the Palestinian and three companions from  a moving vehicle.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Arens called for an end to the revenge and vigilante attacks.  </P> <P> "I call on the entire Israeli population, Jew and Arab, to avoid these acts,"  he said. "They break the law; they are against the interests of the state of  Israel. There are security forces to deal with the people endangering our  lives."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, all was quiet. Palestinians were barred from entering Israel from  the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. In Tel Aviv, Palestinians who  customarily sleep in the city to avoid returning home from work each day were  routed from their hiding places and sent to the territories.  </P> <P> Strains in Jerusalem were evident mainly in the extra patrols of paired police  officers at many intersections and the number of police vans moving through the  city.  </P> <P> Jerusalem has become a curious focus of two kinds of war fever -- worry about  attack from abroad and worry about civil conflict at home.  </P> <P> Residents are being issued gas masks in preparation for a possible attack from  Iraq. What do the people consider the more worrisome, poison gas or revenge  killings?  </P> <P> "I think gas attack is less likely," said George Jamid, a plumber who was  picking up masks for his wife and children at a school in East Jerusalem.  "People here are afraid the Jews will come in and attack us. I used to work in  Jewish neighborhoods. But not anymore. It is too dangerous."  </P> <P> Across town in Jewish West Jerusalem, two secretaries entered the Krav gun shop  to buy a pistol. Manager Uziel recommended a .22-caliber Beretta, which is  lighter than the 9-millimeter pistol he recommends for men. But on learning  that the women are from Jerusalem, he told them they need special permission  from the Interior Ministry to buy a gun and that they probably could not get  it.  </P> <P> Uziel estimates that more than 100 customers a day have come to his store to  inquire about buying a gun since Sunday, when three Israelis were stabbed to  death by a Palestinian laborer. Before Sunday, the average number was fewer  than 20.  </P> <P> In general, Israeli private citizens are not permitted to own guns unless they  live or work in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip. Soldiers on active duty  are often seen carrying rifles through the city; pistols are usually seen on  police officers and settlers.  </P></p>

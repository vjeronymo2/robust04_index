			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Mortgage claims hold back recovery at Eagle Star INSURANCE claims stemming from the slump in the property market have slowed the pace of recovery at Eagle Star. The composite insurer, which is a subsidiary of BAT Industries, yesterday reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 71.4m for 1992, compared with a Pounds 394m deficit previously. It declared losses of Pounds 146m on commercial mortgage indemnity policies, a line of business which it no longer underwrites. On all classes of mortgage indemnity business the company has paid more than Pounds 900m in claims since 1990. The Pounds 146m figure included a Pounds 77m loss on 'agency pool' business, which relates to the insurance of loans made by centralised mortgage lenders, following the adoption of a more cautious accounting policy for this class of business. Losses from domestic mortgage indemnity business, which Eagle Star continues to underwrite (although on a different basis), declined from Pounds 213m to Pounds 97m. Mr Clive Coates, finance director, warned that new claims could emerge in 1993 as a result of an increase in mortgage arrears. Existing provisions amount to Pounds 307m on commercial mortgage business, Pounds 150m on agency pool business and Pounds 220m on domestic mortgage indemnity business, making a total of nearly Pounds 680m. Gross claims on all mortgage indemnity business paid in 1992 amounted to Pounds 260m (Pounds 230m after reinsurance recoveries). These losses offset an improved performance on most other lines of business. UK underwriting losses from personal insurance (home and motor) fell to Pounds 75.2m and on commercial insurance to Pounds 64.5m, as a result of more selective underwriting and premium rate increases of between 5 and 20 per cent. Non-life premium income increased to Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds 1.7bn), but life business premiums fell to Pounds 866m (Pounds 940m), partially because Eagle Star Life has reduced its involvement in the single premium bond market Overall underwriting losses on 'continued business' were Pounds 280.3m (Pounds 563.7m). Investment income rose to Pounds 237m (Pounds 219m). Life profits were Pounds 50.2m (Pounds 55.3m). Operating profits of Pounds 14.5m on continued business compared with losses of Pounds 145m (Pounds 123m loss) on discontinued business and gains on disposal of discontinued operations of Pounds 58.8m (Pounds 31.1m). BAT Industries' other financial services operations both performed well. Farmers, the California-based company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 408m, up 14 per cent. Allied Dunbar, the Swindon-based life insurance subsidiary, announced a post-tax surplus of Pounds 114m, 8 per cent up on 1991 and a pre-tax surplus of Pounds 123m, marginally ahead of last year. New business was 9 per cent down, however, reflecting the continued impact of recession among the self-employed and small company sectors.</p>

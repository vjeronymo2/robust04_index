			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 21 KYODO -- A group of 500 Chinese  intellectuals sent an open letter to the ongoing National  People's Congress (NPC) on Monday [21 March] demanding the  release of war compensation activists detained by Chinese  security authorities.    The letter says more than 100 victims of Japanese aggression  during World War II were detained Friday in front of the  Japanese Embassy in Beijing, a day before Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa arrived in China for a three-day official  visit.    "According to eye witnesses, there were no marches,  demonstrations, petitions, sit-ins, shouting or similar  disturbances. On the contrary, they expressed themselves  peacefully and had an orderly attitude," said the letter,  describing the activists.    "All were crippled after receiving injuries and being forced  to labor for the Japanese Army during the time of the Japanese  invasion," it said. "The oldest is 85 and the youngest is 56."    The letter also called for the release of Tong Zeng, a  leader  of the compensation movement, who since 1992 has received  support from NPC delegates on the matter of demanding  compensation from the Japanese Government, it said.    Sources close to the movement said the 100 elderly activists  were released and sent home Sunday evening, but that Tong's  whereabouts were still unknown.    Tong's wife also made inquiries into her husband's  whereabouts, but was told by police that nothing was known of  his case, the sources said.    Police took Tong from his home Friday morning after he  refused to follow orders of his work unit to leave Beijing  during the Hosokawa visit, they said.    A group of 32 NPC delegates at the ongoing session of the  NPC, China's legislature, earlier filed a motion demanding  compensation for civilian victims of the war from Japan and a  formal apology by Hosokawa, but the motion has reportedly been  shelved by central authorities.    Informed sources said the Movement for War Compensation is  potentially huge as elderly Chinese still harbor rage at the  Chinese Government's agreement to give up demands for war  reparations from Japan as stated in the 1972 Sino-Japanese joint  communique which restored diplomatic ties between the two  countries.    Police have singled out Tong because of a letter, forged  with  Tong's signature and sent to thousands of victims calling them  to come to Beijing during Hosokawa's visit, one source said.    The one-page letter, which also urges the NPC to make  security departments apologize, is accompanied by seven pages of  names of mostly elderly Chinese intellectuals.    "The play in front of the Japanese Embassy and acted out by  public security organs was utterly outrageous, ridiculous and  lamentable," the letter said. "This is very incomprehensible  and has left us outraged."</p>

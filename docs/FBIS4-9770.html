			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Elizardo Sanchez Santa-Cruz, Cuban </F> dissident and president of the Commission on Human Rights and  Reconciliation, by Dominique Dhombres in Havana; date not given:  "Cuban Society Has Become an Explosive Cocktail"]    [Text] A car filled with sinister-looking, plain-clothes  policemen drives slowly around the block of houses. On the front  door, you can still see the marks left by other representatives  of "law and order" who recently broke it down. In the past few  years, this peaceful house in the Playa residential area in west  Havana has been "visited" a total of nine times by the police  with varying degrees of heavy-handedness. This is the home of  Elizardo Sanchez Santa-Cruz, a leading Cuban dissident and  president of the Commission on Human Rights and Reconciliation  -- an unofficial body, of course, and one which has been a  constant cause of concern for the political police since it was  founded in 1987.    The head of the household, who has spent more than eight of  the last 12 years behind bars and who declares himself to be "in  the opposition for 26 years," shows us a few of his personal  photographs. In one, he stands smiling with the head of the  Spanish Government, Felipe Gonzalez, while in another he is seen  with Ted Kennedy, brother of the assassinated president and  Democrat senator for Massachusetts.  <H5>  `Country Is Immense Concentration Camp' </H5>   Twice "Elizardo" has been allowed to travel abroad. He  explains: "Both times, the authorities wanted to make a good  impression on the rest of the world. Then they stepped up the  repression when I returned."    "Elizardo" is a resolute opponent and the current  authorities  have made him pay dearly for it. What makes him different,  however, is that he represents the social-democracy movement. He  refuses to join the Miami expatriates who are pushing for a  return to raw capitalism and the "good old days" of Batista, the  dictator overthrown by Castro in 1959. He explains: "We want  change for Cuba to come with a minimum loss of human life. What  we are suggesting is gradual democratic reform, in the same way,  for example, that Spain got rid of `Francoism' and Chile did  away with `Pinochetism.'"    He takes a dim view of the current situation in Cuba: "The  country is an immense concentration camp. There are prisons  everywhere." He even comes up with the figure, impossible to  verify, of 100,000 prisoners, both "common law" and political  detainees, out of a total of just over 10 million inhabitants.  This would give Cuba the highest proportional rate of  imprisonment in the world, with approximately one in 10 citizens  in jail....    "Cuban society has become an Molotov cocktail. All the  ingredients are there, after 35 years of totalitarianism. There  is the accumulated hate of all those people who have been the  victims of denunciation, and those people whose homes have been  attacked, sometimes by their neighbors, during `disavowal  actions' (demonstrations of hostility against opponents of the  regime, supposedly spontaneous but in fact organized by the  authorities). Nor should we forget that there are hundreds of  thousands of veterans from the African wars who know full well  how to fight. If the authorities hesitate and if weapons are  available, it could turn into a blood bath. This is why we are  proposing national reconciliation with a general amnesty, like  in Chile or Central America. No one can be prosecuted by the  authorities for their previous political activities. There are  about 1 million members of the Communist Party in Cuba, and most  of them are good people..."    "Elizardo" is aware that this desire for "reconciliation"  scarcely pleases -- to be euphemistic -- the anti-Castro groups  in Miami. The last straw for someone who has spent so long in  prison is to be accused of being an agent of the regime by  expatriate organizations demanding a severe purging when Castro  has been overthrown. In the peace and quiet of Florida or New  Jersey, it is easy for the most extreme expatriates to forecast  the imminent fall of the Communist system and to delight in  imagining scenarios where, for example, the former owners of  tobacco and cane sugar plantations will have their property  returned to them and the hotels and tourist beaches will be put  up for auction.  <H5>  `Romanian or Czech Model' </H5>   For "Elizardo," it is clear that things will not happen that  way. His prime concern is that a blood bath be avoided. Then  again, who knows how long this system can continue, since it did  not crumble, as people had often said it would, with the  disappearance of the USSR and the "socialist camp." Fidel  Castro may be 66 years old, but he enjoys excellent, even  blooming health; he does not drink and he has given up smoking  his legendary cigars. "Elizardo" concludes: "Sooner or later,  change will come. The question is knowing whether it will  follow the Romanian model or the Czech model." He would, of  course, prefer a Cuban version of the "Velvet Revolution."    The same analysis prevails with Western diplomats stationed  in Havana. Even if most of them prefer not to openly frequent  dissidents, they are fully aware of the position tirelessly  defended by Elizardo Sanchez Santa-Cruz and his friends. One of  them said: "Castro has made considerable concessions by  decriminalizing the possession of dollars by private  individuals, but on the political front he has not budged an  inch. We have to think about what will happen in the next few  years if he remains this inflexible. He will either be gently  retired by the more lucid members of the regime's `young guard,'  or he will be brutally overthrown in a bloody uprising."    This "young guard," which the dissidents admit exists, is  made up of people in their forties who were practically born  with the Revolution and whom Castro has promoted to key posts in  recent years -- people like Carlos Lage, who controls the whole  economic sector, or Roberto Robaina, formerly charged with youth  policy and now foreign minister. They are the "fresh, young  faces" whom the bearded patriarch has taken some pleasure in  promoting over the heads of some of his former comrades in arms  with long-standing experience.    Obviously, they cannot, according to the very strict code  governing the system, speak publicly about Castro's succession.  They are thinking about it, however, and apparently have  permission, in recent months, to voice a few of their thoughts  to foreigners. This "young guard," therefore, is trying to relay  the following message: The Americans must first lift the  embargo. Castro himself would be ready to step down with dignity  if he could be sure that everything he had accomplished would  not collapse in a few hours. Institutional solutions can be  found, but for the time being there is no question of talking to  opponents like "Elizardo," especially since, in the eyes of the  Socialist International, he would be the ideal choice to succeed  the "Lider Maximo." The "young guard" is certainly ready to take  over the reins, but its most brilliant members are well aware  that, for years, the unenviable fate of the real or supposed  successors to Castro has been disgrace, exile, or death.</p>

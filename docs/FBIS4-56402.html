			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 2 May (PL) -- Today, Cuban President Fidel  Castro announced that the measures to strengthen the country's  domestic finances began this week with a fight against  individuals who become rich illegally. The president said he is  already drafting a decree to confiscate illegally acquired  property [words indistinct] in an expedited and noncomplicated  manner.    Castro said the government will not rest for a single moment  in applying the measures, which the Cuban parliament decided to  implement today following a two-day debate and an extensive  consultation of the people during the first three months of the  year. He said all the decisions cannot be implemented together  because they need to be put in order.    The fight against those who become rich illegally here,  called "profiteers," was one of the primary demands in more than  80,000 consultations convened by labor unions, in which  approximately 3 million workers participated.    The purpose of this process, dubbed here "workers  parliaments," was to learn about the people's opinions on needed  measures to face the country's current crisis caused by the U.S.  blockade and the loss of traditional trade relations following  the disappearance of the European Socialist Bloc.</p>

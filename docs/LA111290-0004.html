			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 1 WORKER KILLED, 2 HURT IN BLAST  </P> <P> One worker was killed and two were injured Sunday when a turbine engine  exploded at a Kearny Mesa industrial plant, authorities said.  </P> <P> The accident occurred about 6:40 p.m. in a work yard at Solar Turbines Inc. on  Ruffin Road when a compressor undergoing an air pressure test exploded, company  spokesman Larry Sera said.  </P> <P> The two injured men, who were not identified late Sunday, were taken to Sharp  Memorial Hospital. One man suffered burns to his shoulder; the other suffered a  broken wrist and second- and third-degree burns.  </P> <P> "A cap came off the compressor," Sera said. "I don't know if the cap hit the  men or the blast of air got them."  </P> <P> Remaining employees were sent home after the accident, he said.  </P> <P> The compressor is normally used to compress natural gas but was undergoing a  routine test at the time of the explosion, officials said.  </P> <P> Solar Turbines manufactures gas turbine engines and places them in machines  that compress gas, generate electricity or pump liquids, Sera said.  </P> <P> The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration will look into the  accident today, authorities said.  </P></p>

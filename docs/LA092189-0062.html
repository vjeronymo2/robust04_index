			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'THEY'RE ON FRONT LINE';  </P> <P> SEARCH, RESCUE SCOUTS THRIVE IN NORTHWEST  </P> <P> The rugged, forested mountains of the Pacific Northwest beckon droves of hikers  and hunters. When they get lost, the county sheriff doesn't call out the dogs  -- he mobilizes an Explorer search-and-rescue post.  </P> <P> Washington and Oregon have 24 of the nation's 117 such Scout posts -- with  nearly 30% of the 1,800 members.  </P> <P> The Northwest terrain makes the region a hotbed of good programs, said Forrest  McVicar, associate director of the Boy Scouts of America Exploring Division.  </P> <P> Search-and-rescue Scouts -- ages 14 to 20 -- get a chance to learn outdoor  skills and serve their communities in a very practical way, said Sgt. Gary  Lewis of the sheriff's office in Lane County, Ore., who has advised Post 178  since 1977.  </P> <P> "They're on the front line," Lewis said. They may be on a mission overnight and  may get called from school.  </P> <P> Student members have to maintain good grades, and they sometimes elect to give  up other activities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Skipped Concert  </P> <P> "We've had kids forgo a rock concert to go on a rescue," said John Pitetti, 38,  an associate adviser who joined the post when he was 14. "And one skipped  football practice and endured the wrath of the coach."  </P> <P> The point of the Explorer program is to learn about possible careers. Training  in a search-and-rescue post is more hands-on than in most Explorer programs.  Scouts get extensive practice using camping and communication skills, map and  compass knowledge, and thorough search techniques. More important, they  practice teamwork and leadership in situations in which their performance can  have life-or-death consequences.  </P> <P> "We train outdoors October through March, when the weather is the worst," said  Doug Caley, operations director of King County Explorer Search and Rescue in  Seattle.  </P> <P> "And we do it in the Cascades, where the rainfall is more than double what it  is in Seattle."  </P> <P> Search-and-rescue graduates often go into some phase of forestry or related  fields, such as insurance safety, radio communications or paramedical service.  Many continue as program advisers or community volunteers, such as Pitetti, who  is also a volunteer scuba diver for the sheriff, or Caley, who joined the Boy  Scouts at 11 and the Explorers at 14.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Give Them Responsibility'  </P> <P> "Society mistrusts teen-agers," Caley said. "But when you give them  responsibility like this, they live up to it."  </P> <P> Scouts on a mission -- about 40% are female -- are serious, whether they are  searching for lost people or for evidence, or providing support for special  professional search or rescue teams, such as the ski patrol or dog tracking  units.  </P> <P> Lois Spencer is a good example. In 3 years, she has been on 36 missions.  </P> <P> One started at dawn on a Monday in September, 1987.  </P> <P> The call had come Sunday about 7 p.m.: Hiker last seen about half a mile up  French Pete Creek, female, 28, retarded, lightly clothed. Had a fight with her  boyfriend Saturday and tried to patch it up Sunday by going for a hike. The  boyfriend went back to the car to get a camera and, when he returned, Charlotte  was gone.  </P> <P> Or so he said. How big a fight was it? Why did he wait 9 hours to report her  missing? And what about the 12 arrests and five convictions on his record?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Moved Slowly  </P> <P> Lois, 18, led a team of four up the trail slowly, so as not to miss any subtle  sign. They only covered 1 1/2 miles in 2 hours.  </P> <P> Then, 50 feet from a footbridge, she saw a faint scratch in the dirt that  looked like an arrow. Across the creek, a woman bent to get a drink. Lois  crossed the bridge.  </P> <P> "Hello," she said. "What's your name?"  </P> <P> "Charlotte," the woman said, and she laughed and cried at the same time.  </P> <P> "I could just see the tension drain from her," Lois said. "Did I feel good!  Each of our teams had a radio, and the posse was standing by."  </P> <P> Although new search-and-rescue Explorer posts invariably have to prove their  abilities, once they have, they receive high praise.  </P> <P> Lt. Howard Kershner, the Lane County sheriff's officer who worked with Post 178  from the time it was formed in 1962 until he retired last year, would rather  use Scouts than adult volunteers.  </P> <P> "You tell them to do something and they do it," he said. "We've had kids go  through blackberry thickets 10 feet high. I can guarantee you that if they  don't find something, it isn't there."  </P></p>

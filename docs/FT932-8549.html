			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Portuguese road blockade Farmers yesterday blocked the main road from Lisbon to Portugal's second city Oporto with tractors to protest against cheap fruit imports from Spain, Reuter reports. Reporters at the scene said about 100 farmers had blocked the road near Batalha, about 100km north of Lisbon. Police were diverting traffic to avoid the barricade, which had caused tailbacks of up to 1km. The farmers' protest followed demonstrations by fishermen over two weeks to protest against cheaper Spanish fish flooding auctions in Portugal.</p>

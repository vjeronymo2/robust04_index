			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 8/6/1994 -- The land reform is  not a panacea for the crisis faced by the Moldovan agriculture,  stated to the newspaper NEZAVISIMAYA MOLDOVA (Independent  Moldova), Moldovan Vice Premier Valeriu Bulgari. Bulgari called  the destruction of the current forms of Agricultural enterprises  technological regression. Without the necessary agricultural  equipment and infrastructure, small farms will go bankrupt. He  also mentioned that advanced technologies need huge investments.  Businessmen from abroad expect that Moldova will achieve a  political and economic stability and set taxes at the level of  the European ones or even lower. Moldova has no choice but to  cooperate with the ex-Soviet republics and Eastern European  countries. "By founding the Economic Union (EU), I think that  all problems will be solved on the basis of the equal rights;  the EU statute is favorable for Moldova." Bulgari added that  Moldova has chances to reconquer some of its lost positions on  the Russian market as the excises on goods from the West, which  made Moldovan wine uncompetitive, will soon go up because  Russia, as an EU leader, will intensify the measures of  protecting its market and producers. The protection of the  internal markets of the EU member states must constitute a  large-scale strategy, promoted by all members of this community,  said Bulgari.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Communique by the Party of Democratic Kampuchea spokesman </F> rejecting the base accusations made by Prince Ranariddh, first  prime minister of the two-headed government, who fabricates  stories and accuses the Thai military of providing assistance to  Democratic Kampuchea" issued on 6 April; place not given -- read  by announcer]    [Text] I. There have been reports that on 5 April, Prince  Ranariddh, first prime minister of the two-headed government,  said there is a photo of Democratic Kampuchean leaders leaving  the Pailin battlefield in a car and entering Thai territory with  an escort of Thai troops.    II. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] spokesman  vehemently and most categorically rejects Prince Ranariddh's  accusation, which has dirty and dark political goals. This  concocted and dirty story certainly will not deceive anyone.    III. The Cambodian nation and people, like the international  public in general, know and are well aware of the tricky way of  the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their puppets and  lackeys. The communist Vietnamese aggressors and their puppets  and lackeys have been using this dirty method incessantly since  1978-79 to cover up the war by the communist Vietnamese  aggressors and their great criminal and brutal activities in  killing the Cambodian nation, people, and race. These are  intended to transform Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom  [former Cambodian territory now part of Vietnam] according to  the communist Vietnamese Indochinese Federation strategy.    Prince Ranariddh concocted all the above stories on the  orders of his masters; namely, the alliance between communist  Vietnam and the communist Vietnamese puppets. Their goals are  the following:    1. The two-headed government, the communist Vietnamese, and  their allies have taken turns making accusations concerning the  situation on the Pailin battlefield. This is to cover up the  fact that communist Vietnam has brought nearly 4 million  Vietnamese settlers into Cambodia and annexed tens of thousands  of square kilometers of Cambodian territory in eastern Cambodia.    2. To cover up their defeat on the Pailin battlefield; the  two- headed government, the communist Vietnamese puppets, and  their allies are beginning to smell utter defeat on the Pailin  battlefield. The invading forces of the two-headed government  are being attacked by the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  and the Cambodian people. Their transport lines around Pailin  -- which are their lifelines -- are being cut and their troops  are being attacked and trapped within Pailin's perimeter. Their  soldiers are constantly being killed and wounded. They are  running around like rats caught in traps.    IV. The Cambodian nation and people and the international  public have clearly seen who is good and who is bad; who wants  peace and national reconciliation and which warmongers are  fueling the war. The communist Vietnamese oppose national  reconciliation and the king's five-point national reconciliation  plan.    It is clear that Democratic Kampuchea wants genuine peace  and  national reconciliation in line with the king's five-point plan.  As for the two-headed government and the communist Vietnamese  puppets, they constantly shout about war and about fighting  against Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian people.    National and international opinion inside and outside of the  country predicts that the two-headed government will certainly  be defeated on the Pailin battlefield, just like at Anlung Veng.    [Signed] The PDK spokesman    [Dated] 6 April 1994</p>

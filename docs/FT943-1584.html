			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Arts: Poor Superman - a Play with Captions Successful artist David (Ian Gelder) is suffering from painter's block. His friends, Shannon (Jude Akuwudike), desperate for a sex change operation before he dies of Aids, and Kryla (Elaine Collins, excellent), a sardonic hackette equally desperately seeking The Man, know exactly what he needs: a new boyfriend. They are less than enchanted when he picks up Matt (Christopher Simon), the naive young restaurateur who just happens to be happily married to the devoted Violet (Kathryn Howden). Super hot Canadian playwright Brad Fraser takes the well worn theme of tainted love in Poor Superman - a Play with Captions, but embroiders it into a compelling insight into the power of sex over the lives of gay men. In director Ian Brown's sharp and discrete production, which started life at the Traverse, Edinburgh (where it was well received on this page by Martin Hoyle), Fraser surely has another award to add to his mantelpiece. The only question marks hang over the title. The Superman leitmotif never justifies itself, and the captions, which light up in neon at the back of the stage to beam the real thoughts of the characters behind their polite, and not so polite, conversation, are hardly needed in such punchy dialogue. The lives of gays and young entrepreneurs in Calgary, Canada, are not the traditional stuff of drama but from the first you care desperately about Matt, with his faltering cry of 'I'm not queer' as he falls into the arms of David; and Violet, whose horizons are happily confined to stove and nappies; indeed all the credulous victims hanging round David, who may be an ageing charmer but proves an ill equipped Superman. Fraser's great achievement is that he does not take sides: David is quite prepared to exploit people in the cause of art: it is up to the audience to decide who are the winners and who the losers. Fraser has also dusted down some sharp Wildean aphorisms to set alongside the easy lies of normal talk. Almost incidentally Poor Superman contains some of the most explicit sexual acts seen on the London stage. The fact that they perfectly underpin the action and develop the characters is a triumph for cast and director. Hampstead Theatre (071 722 9301)</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The diversity of views is, in part, related to the functional responsibilities of the individuals interviewed. For example, a number of persons with credit management responsibilities in banks and other financial firms tended to favor expanded Fedwire hours based on the potential benefits associated with access to final, that is, irrevocable and unconditional, settlement using central bank money_notably, potential reductions in counterparty and systemic risk. In contrast, individuals with responsibilities for transaction processing services and information technology within banking organizations tended not to favor an expansion of Fedwire operating hours because, for example, (1) they could not identify customer demand for longer Fedwire hours, (2) there would be costs and operational challenges associated with ``off hour'' services, and (3) competitive responses by rival banking organizations would compel them to undertake product and operational changes. In addition, many of those interviewed also pointed to the charging of fees for Federal Reserve intraday credit as creating a disincentive to the use of Fedwire funds and securities transfer services during both regular and expanded hours of operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A main concern raised during the meetings held by the Fedwire Study Group, particularly by executives and senior credit managers, was that of settlement risk in foreign exchange dealings, or Herstatt risk. Those expressing concern noted, however, that while expanded Fedwire funds transfer operating hours might be useful as a component part of some new approaches to controlling Herstatt risk, without changes in overall settlement practices, longer hours would not be able to make a major contribution to risk reduction. Further, changes in risk management techniques and settlement practices would need to take account of a variety of operational and financial factors for different currencies. Some of these issues are discussed further in appendix C of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given that there is a reduced tolerance for temporal risk in settlements, especially_but not solely_settlement of multi-currency transactions, the Board anticipates that efforts to control settlement risk will continue, with or without the support of central banks. The Board believes, however, that final, real-time gross settlement through Fedwire should play an important part in market efforts to control risk more effectively. As discussed earlier, final settlements in central bank money are free of default risk and, as a result, settlement in central bank money provides the highest possible degree of certainty and liquidity in interbank settlements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The routine availability of Fedwire on an expanded schedule will add final interbank payment capabilities that the markets, the Federal Reserve, and other federal regulatory agencies recognize as being particularly important during periods of financial stress. Only by becoming familiar with the use of expanded Fedwire will banks be prepared operationally and procedurally to use expanded final payment capabilities effectively. Over time, as the availability and use of expanded Fedwire capabilities becomes more routine, operating procedures for using Fedwire earlier in the day will become well tested and integrated into banks' operations and contingency planning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, expanding Fedwire operating hours will eliminate an operational barrier that stifles potentially important innovation in privately-provided payment and settlement services. Expansion of Fedwire operating hours will provide opportunities for market participants to experiment with the use of real-time gross settlement to meet a variety of market needs. New bank services and settlement arrangements based on real-time gross settlement will have the potential to reduce significantly banks' own and their customers' settlement risks in the foreign exchange and other markets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A particular application could be the development of delivery-versus-payment settlement techniques either for individual foreign exchange transactions or for obligations arising from netting arrangements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Examples of private sector initiatives currently underway include the development of multilateral netting systems for foreign exchange transactions, such as Exchange Clearing House Organization (ECHO) and Multinet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Federal Reserve initiative to expand Fedwire funds transfer operating hours also demonstrates a long-term commitment to increasing the availability of real-time gross settlement services in the international financial system. The Federal Reserve is taking a leadership role in the international financial community in seeking to stimulate new or enhanced central bank services to facilitate cross-border, multi-currency payments and settlements. By expanding the operating hours of Fedwire, the Federal Reserve will make it possible for banks to settle the U.S. dollar, with finality using central bank money, during the banking and trading days of major international financial centers in Europe and the Far East. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Such a Federal Reserve initiative looks to private sector banking organizations to develop improved multi-currency services and settlement arrangements, in some cases relying on Fedwire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Staff notes that the Bank of Japan recently expanded the operating hours for its large-value funds transfer system to later in the Tokyo banking day. Also, as noted earlier, the European Union central banks have recently endorsed the establishment of real-time gross settlement systems in all EU countries as well as closer coordination of operating hours for settlement services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, a clearly stated Federal Reserve policy regarding Fedwire operating hours provides the certainty and stability banks have indicated that they need to develop their own business and technology plans. This approach to communicating Federal Reserve policy was requested both in public comments on the Board's October 1992 proposal and in meetings with representatives of the industry held by the Fedwire Study Group. As noted here, expanded Fedwire funds transfer operating hours are announced three years in advance of implementation. Banks will have a clear understanding of the Federal Reserve's intentions with respect to its operating hours and could use the lead time to incorporate the expanded hours into their strategic plans for payment services and supporting technical systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

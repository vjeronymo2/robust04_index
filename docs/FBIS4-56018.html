			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Talloires, May 25 (TANJUG) -- Foreign minister of  the Bosnian Serb Republic Aleksa Buha said on Wednesday that the  Bosnian Serb delegation told the contact group that a ceasefire  must be established first in the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that the territorial delimitation would  be resolved later. The contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina  began separate talks in the French tourist resort of Talloires,  close to the Swiss border, on Wednesday with two delegations --  of Moslems and Croats and of the Bosnian Serbs.    The official platform for the talks is the Geneva  declaration  signed on May 13 by ministers of the United States, Russia and  the European Union (E.U.), it was announced. Under this  declaration, the warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina are urged  to sign a four-month ceasefire, during which time they would  agree on the division of the territory of former  Bosnia-Herzegovina according to the E.U. formula of 49 percent  for the Serbs and 51 percent for the Moslem-Croat federation.    In a statement to Bosnian Serb television, Buha said that  the  talks today had primarily focused on territorial delimitation.  He said that the Bosnian Serb delegation had insisted that  other criteria, in addition to the one of percentage of  population, be also taken into consideration in the  delimitation. These criteria include property, resources, and  certainly, the one of functionality of the two future states in  the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Moslem-Croat  federation and the Serb Republic, he said. According to land  registers, 64 percent of the land in Bosnia- Herzegovina is  owned by Serbs.    "It is my impression that the members of the contact group  are very interested in these arguments and I believe that, if  they have not accepted them, then that they have seriously taken  them into consideration. It remains to be seen what will come  out in the end," Buha said. The contact group includes  diplomats from the United States, Russia, Great Britain, France  and Germany.    Buha said that the Bosnian Serb delegation had made it clear  at the very beginning that it considered the international  conference on former Yugoslavia as the valid body, and that the  contact group could only be a place where views will be  exchanged and possible new suggestions be made. The members of  the contact group "have accepted such a role and they did not  have any greater ambitions than to be part of the diplomatic  process within the conference on former Yugoslavia," Buha said.    Representatives of Bosnian Moslems and Croats said upon  arrival in Talloires that they would demand 58 percent of the  territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina for their federation, but  foreign agencies reported that they had agreed later during the  day to discuss the division of territory on the basis of 51  percent for the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 percent for the  Serb state. Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic announced  ahead of the talks in Talloires that the Moslem side would  negotiate and wage war until it wins 58 percent of the territory  of former Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

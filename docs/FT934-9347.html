			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Regulation call on mortgage policies THE SALE of mortgage protection policies should be regulated by statute to make up for the failure of arrangements to protect homebuyers in difficulty, the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux says today. It warns, for example, that borrowers often do not realise that they can have continuing liability for their debts even after their home has been repossessed. The association wants the Financial Services Act to be extended to include the sale of mortgage protection policies and that in some circumstances borrowers should be able to sell their properties on the open market at a shortfall.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Major hangs campaign on integration fears Mr John Major yesterday launched a last-ditch attempt to stave off disaster for the Conservatives in Thursday's European elections by stepping up his attack on the dangers of greater European integration. The prime minister used a wide-ranging television interview to emphasise that his 'instincts' were not in favour of a single European currency and to predict that the European Union would 'break' if it did not develop more flexibly. Pressed on his own future Mr Major said that the government had a five-year programme and he expected to carry it through. It would be 'perfectly proper' for someone to use the party's leadership procedure to mount a challenge in the autumn. If that happened 'I will take on whomsoever the contestant may be and I would hope and expect to beat that contestant'. He said he would 'pick my own time' for the cabinet reshuffle, expected during the summer. This would not be affected in any way by the date of the coming Labour leadership election. But, as the main parties reduced the intensity of their Euro-election campaigning to accommodate yesterday's commemoration of the D-day landings, Mr Major declined to predict the election's result. A recent opinion poll put the Conservatives in third place more than 30 percentage points behind Labour, suggesting the party could be reduced to a handful of seats. Such a result, coming within a month of the Tories' local election humiliation, would revive doubts about Mr Major's leadership and bring renewed speculation that a challenge to the prime minister could be mounted this autumn. The Conservatives hold 32 seats in the European parliament compared with 45 for Labour. A haul of fewer than a dozen seats this time would be regarded as a serious setback for Mr Major. Interviewed on BBC-TV's Frost on Sunday, the prime minister said that to argue for the flexibility of a 'multi-speed' Europe, as he did at a rally at Ellesmere Port last week, was not to argue against the EU. Europe had 'slowly, unobtrusively' been moving in that direction for some time. The EU had to develop 'in a more flexible way', he said. 'I believe if it doesn't then it will break.' Sir David Steel, foreign affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, attacked the government for being 'shackled' by the Euro-sceptics on its own back benches. Labour concentrated its assault on tax, where it hopes the primary focus of the campaign will rest in the approach to polling day.</p>

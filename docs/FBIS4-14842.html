			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Country's Concern for the </F> Citizen and the Citizen's Concern for the Country. The First  Congress of the Union of Georgia's Citizens"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] On 18 March, the first  congress of the Union of Georgia's Citizens [UGC] was opened  ceremoniously by the eminent Georgian scientist Aleksandr  Javakhishvili in the large concert hall in the Tbilisi  Philharmonic building. [passage omitted]    The congress outlined concrete tasks aimed at bringing the  country out of the political and economic crisis and an action  program. In particular, great attention was devoted to  questions regarding privatization, the development of  entrepreneurship, the improvement of the taxation system, and  the boosting of industry and agriculture.    The union adopted a program document and rules.    The attention of the deputies was focused on the problem of  Abkhazia. Zurab Erkvania, Zaur Chanchibadze, Vakhtang Kobalia,  and others delivered speeches during examination of this  question. It was said that the UGC, unlike other political  organizations, had assumed responsibility for the country's  fate. "In this Union, we see a strong organizational force for  the return of Abkhazia. No further state development in Georgia  is possible while the Abkhazian question remains unresolved."  The speakers gave a positive assessment of the decisions  adopted by the Georgian authorities regarding Abkhazia and their  attempt to regulate Russian-Georgian relations. [passage  omitted]    Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze delivered a long speech at  the congress. Then, elections were held.    By secret ballot, the congress's delegates elected Eduard  Shevardnadze as chairman of the Union.    Zurab Zhvania was elected its general secretary, Gia  Zhorzholiani speaker of the consultative body, and Revaz  Chkheidze chairman of the auditing commission.    The congress elected members of the auditing commission, the  Union's main council, and its consultative body.    The UGC once more confirmed that its ideology was evident  from its name. The country's concern for the citizen and the  citizen's concern for the country is the guarantee for the  political, social, and economic strength of Georgia.</p>

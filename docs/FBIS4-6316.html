			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  met visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and Assistant  Secretary of State Robert Gallucci at Chongwadae [presidential  office] Wednesday afternoon to exchange opinions on the North  Korean nuclear question and the latest military movement in  North Korea.    During the meeting, President Kim said the nuclear issue  ought to be resolved through dialogue. "But, if dialogue efforts  fail to bring about any tangible result, there would be no way  but to use the last card,' namely, a U.N. sanction," Chongwadae  spokesman Chu Ton-sik quoted Kim as saying. Chu said the  presidential position was readily agreed to by Secretary Perry.    President Kim and Secretary Perry shared the view that the  resolution of the North Korean nuclear question requires solid  and close cooperative system between South Korea and the United  States and that presently bilateral cooperation is in a  satisfactory state.    Secretary Perry said in particular that if the U.N. Security  Council takes a sanction, it would apparently offend North  Korea, adding his country is prepared to take full defensive  steps in such a circumstance.    A number of Korean and American officials were present at  the  Chongwadae meeting. They included Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae,  Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Yi Yang-ho and Chief Presidential  Secretary Pak Kwan-yong from Korea. Among the U.S. officials  present were Ambassador James Laney and U.S. Forces in Korea  Commander Gen. Gary Luck.</p>

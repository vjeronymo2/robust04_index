			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Elkem rescue package planned by Norway NORWAY'S Industry Ministry hopes this week to unveil final details of a proposed NKr1bn (Dollars 159m) rescue package for Elkem, the troubled light metals group. Elkem recently reported a 60 per cent increase in nine-month pre-tax losses, after extraordinary items, to NKr307m and said its equity to debt ratio had sunk to below 20 per cent from 22 per cent since January. Elkem is in discussions with its two biggest shareholders, Saga Petroleum and the Orkla foods group, and Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank to create a package comprised of fresh equity capital, new loans and the postponement of old debt. Elkem is also expected to announce a rights issue to raise up to NKr500m of which an estimated NKr135m would be guaranteed by the state and the balance guaranteed by Saga and Orkla. If the state is forced to supply NKr135m in fresh capital to Elkem, it would then own an estimated 30 per cent stake in group. Elkem is also expected to be allowed to postpone repayment of a NKr270m state loan, due next year, which the group used to acquire a 45 per cent stake in former state-owned Norsk Jern Holding. Discussions centre on the possibility of writing down the value of Elkem's shares by 50 per cent. In addition, Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank have been asked to provide the group with a long-term loan of up to NKr500m, which would cover Elkem's debt due next year.</p>

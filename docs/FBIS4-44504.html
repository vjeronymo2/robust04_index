			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jin Junhui (6855 0689 2547): "Initial Analysis </F> of the Clinton Administration's Foreign Policy Ideas"]    [Text] The Clinton Administration's foreign policy is  characterized by five basic ideas: 1) ensuring the U.S. economic  security; 2) starting to shift priorities to the Asia-Pacific  region; 3) popularizing worldwide the Western values, such as  democracy and human rights, as one of the three pillars of the  foreign policy; 4) stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction as a foremost task of the foreign policy; and 5)  promoting so-called multilateralism.    In practice, the Clinton Administration's foreign  policy has undergone several adjustments. At the start, it was a  Tarnoff doctrine. Later, it was an enlargement strategy, and  then six strategic priorities.    The United States is still exploring how to define its  position in the post-Cold War world. In such exploration, an  inevitable question is how to adapt America's foreign policy  ideas to the reality of the contemporary multipolar and diverse  world.    In early 1993 when Clinton assumed the presidency, he was  confronted with a grim situation both at home and abroad. The  post-Cold War world was filled with complex, volatile, and  uncertain factors. The Western economy remained in the doldrums  on the whole. In the United States, there were innumerable  economic and social problems. Quite common among the public was  the introversive feeling that "we have only to sweep the snow at  our doors and not bother about the frost on others' roofs." As  regards the role to be played by the United States in the  post-Cold War era, divergent views existed among various  circles, and no consensus could be reached.    Over the past year, Clinton has firmly taken the  reinvigoration of the American economy as the central task. His  foreign policy has shown the heritage of the past as well as  something new created by himself. The heritage finds expression  mainly in his upholding America's leading role in the world,  stressing the need to maintain a strong national defense despite  the reduction of the armed forces and military spending, giving  generous assistance to Russia, and promoting the peace process  in the Middle East.    The new part of Clinton's foreign policy reflects both the  salient features of the post-Cold War era and the characteristic  tradition of the Democratic Party. The past year has seen a  painstaking course traversed by the Clinton Administration's  foreign policy, with achievements as well as faults and  setbacks. Accordingly, the policy has been continuously adjusted  in the course of practice.  <H5>  I. Five Basic Ideas Characterizing the Clinton </H5> Administration's Foreign Policy    1. Ensuring U.S. economic security as a primary pillar  of U.S. foreign policy. Clinton and his foreign-policy team  have all along taken the reinvigoration of the U.S. economy and  the promotion of world economic development as the central goal  of the foreign policy. For instance, Clinton's efforts at the  July 1993 summit meeting of the G-7 nations in Tokyo brought  about an industrial products market access agreement among the  U.S. and European countries and Japan. Later, he made all-out  efforts to win Congress approval for the North American Free  Trade Agreement. In November, he officiated the APEC ministerial  conference and held informal meetings with leaders of the APEC  members in Seattle. And, finally, he managed to conclude  successfully the seven-year-old Uruguay Round of GATT talks  before the 15 December 1993 deadline. As U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher said, Clinton's above-mentioned activities  plus his plan to cut the U.S. deficit by $500 billion within  five years constitute the "integral elements of the most  ambitious international economic agenda that any President has  undertaken in almost half a century."[.sup]1[/]    In foreign trade, the Clinton Administration stresses a  "fair  trade" principle in opening overseas markets to boost U.S.  exports and increase employment at home. It has taken a firm  stand in trade talks and, on many occasions, even resorted to  unilateral sanctions, which have led to serious confrontation  with its allies, including European countries and Japan. In  addition, the Clinton Administration has adopted an  export-oriented national strategy of "less aid to foreign  countries and more trade development," "linking aid to foreign  countries with trade promotion," and "relaxing restrictions on  exports of certain high-tech products." As a result, more world  markets were opened to American products in 1993 than at any  time in the last two generations.[.sup]2[/]    2. An apparent shift of foreign policy priorities to  the Asia-Pacific region. In recent years, the trade volume  between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region has  accounted for 40 percent of America's total foreign trade and  exceeded its trade with Western Europe by 50 percent. East Asia  contains the most dynamic economies in the world. Historically,  the United States fought in three wars in Asia during the last  50 years, while more and more Asian immigrants have served to  "enrich America's cultural and economic mosaic."[.sup]3[/]  For this reason, Christopher said: "No area of the world will be  more important for American interests than the Asia-Pacific  region." "It is thus crucial to the President's domestic  agenda."[.sup]4[/] Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State  for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, also made the remark that  "the Clinton Administration has elevated Asia's importance and,  in short, Asia is now more important than ever."[.sup]5[/]  This is why Clinton's first overseas trip was to Asia and he  proposed the establishment of a "New Pacific Community."  Christopher made three visits to Asia within one year, and on  his visit to ASEAN countries, he clearly expressed the intention  to get positively involved in the multilateral Asian security  dialogue following the ASEAN ministerial meeting. Taking the  opportunity of the APEC conference in Seattle, the United States  sponsored informal meetings with the leaders of the countries  concerned. The meetings deepened the U.S. cooperative relations  with the Asian-Pacific countries and promoted the APEC's  development. In addition, the Clinton Administration has  maintained the U.S. troops in the Asia-Pacific region at the  same 100,000-strong level as in Europe. It is with such a  background that the Clinton Administration has "recognized  China's obvious importance in bilateral, regional, and global  partnership."[.sup]6[/] In September 1993, Clinton himself  made a decision to proceed with "all-round contacts," raise the  level of dialogues, and develop extensive exchanges with China.  In November, a U.S.-China summit took place in Seattle, the  first such official meeting since 1989. This meeting helped  improve the relations between the two countries.    3. Promotion of Western democracy and human rights  worldwide raised to the height of one of the three pillars of  U.S. foreign policy. There are several reasons for this:  First, stressing the promotion of democracy and human rights is  a historical tradition of the Democratic Party. Second, the  United States regards its victory in the Cold War as a triumph  of its ideology and values. As Clinton once said, "our greatest  strength is the power of our ideas."[.sup]7[/] Third, after  the Cold War, the United States has no arch enemy and needs to  uphold an ideological banner as a major instrument to maintain  its rallying force at home and abroad. For these reasons, the  Clinton Administration has put forth an "enlargement strategy"  to enlarge worldwide "the community of market democracies" as a  U.S. global strategy to replace the "containment strategy" of  the Cold War era. To carry out its democracy and human rights  policy, the Clinton Administration has applied pressure through  bilateral and multilateral channels, by means of ideological  infiltration through cultural exchanges, and by using assistance  and most-favored-nation treatment to foreign countries and the  State Department's annual human rights reports. It has even set  up so-called "free" radio stations of one kind or another to  conduct subversive agitation and propaganda in an effort to  unscrupulously intervene in others' internal affairs.    4. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and  their vehicle missiles viewed as a practical and primary threat  to U.S. national security; prevention of arms proliferation put  to the fore in the U.S. foreign policy and regarded as "one of  the most urgent priorities of the U.S. national  commitments."[.sup]8[/] This involves two principal  tasks: One is to make every effort to remove the threats from  the massive nuclear weapons kept by Russia, Ukraine, Belarus,  and Kazakhstan. The other is to prevent nuclear, biological, and  chemical weapons and missiles from proliferating to those Third  World countries that the United States believes are the most  dangerous. To this end, the United States has used both the  carrot and the stick. It has either used the tactics of  improving bilateral relations and providing aid or resorted to  sanctions as a threat and punishment. The Clinton Administration  is trying to consolidate the system of nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons, conclude a treaty of comprehensive ban to all  nuclear testing, and establish a sound "missile technology  control mechanism" by 1996. In the eyes of the Clinton  Administration, "the most urgent arms-control issue in the  1990's is to fight the long-term threat caused by arms  proliferation."[.sup]9[/]    5. The United Nations and other international  organizations are utilized to promote so-called  multilateralism. The purpose of multilateralism advanced by  the United States is to achieve its foreign policy goals while  dividing the burden among nations to remedy its own financial  and material deficiencies. Also, if action must be taken, the  United States will be "in a legal position" to do so, and it  will be easy to win support from the American public. In June  1993, Madelenine Albright, chief of the U.S. Mission to the  United Nations, further stressed that multilateral engagement  must be led by the United States and become an "assertive  multilateralism"; otherwise, it cannot serve America's goals  well and may even damage major U.S. interests.[.sup]10[/] In  this regard, the Clinton Administration particularly underscores  the important role of the United Nations and, in actual fact,  regards it as "a major means of the U.S. foreign  policy."[.sup]11[/] Because of this, Christopher visited the  UN Headquarters in New York and called on Secretary General  Boutros Ghali shortly after he took office. It was also for this  reason that the U.S. Mission to the United Nations has been  extremely active. In particular, the Clinton Administration  attaches importance to the UN peace-keeping function in dealing  with regional conflicts. If necessary, Christopher said, the  United States will act alone, but if at all possible, it will  deal with problems in a multilateral way and prefer to act  together with others.[.sup]12[/] This is precisely the policy  the United States pursues in dealing with the issues of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Haiti. Under the U.S. powerful  impetus, the UN peace-keeping operation has expanded from five  missions, less than 10,000 troops and military observers, and a  $233 million expenditure in 1987 to 13 missions, 75,000 troops,  and an expenditure as high as $3 billion in 1993, resulting in a  hard-to-bear burden on the United Nations.  <H5>  Three Adjustments in the Clinton Administration's Diplomatic </H5> Practice    (1) Appearance of the "Tarnoff Doctrine"    The first major test faced by the Clinton Administration  with  respect to foreign policy was how to deal with the armed clashes  among the three factions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the  beginning, Clinton took a firm stand and directed the spearhead  of pressure at the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Serbia  Republic. In addition to stepping up economic sanctions,  establishing an international court to prosecute "ethnic  cleansing" criminals, setting up no-fly zones, and air dropping  relief supplies, he made two proposals: lifting the arms embargo  on the Muslim force and launching air strikes on Serb positions.  But, due to the opposition within the U.S. Government,  especially from the military, plus the strong objection by its  NATO allies such as Britain and France, the Clinton  Administration later took a retreat policy and shelved these two  proposals. The U.S. hesitation and vacillation on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue induced doubt and perplexity at home  and abroad. On May 1993, U.S. Under Secretary of State for  Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff made a candid statement to the  press. He stated unequivocally that the Clinton Administration's  stand and action on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue were by no  means an expedient move, but manifested a new basic policy:  Limited by its financial and material resources, the United  States must now concentrate its efforts primarily on developing  the economy. It can no longer assume a leading role everywhere  as in the Cold War era. Instead, the U.S. involvement in  regional conflicts must be commensurate with the threat to its  interests. With regard to the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, which is  primarily a European question, the United States has no  intention of acting unilaterally; it is necessary to take  concerted action with the European allies playing a main role.  This is the "Tarnoff Doctrine" foreign policy later so-called by  the U.S. press. Originally, the "Tarnoff Doctrine" represented a  selective-engagement and proper-retreat policy that the Clinton  Administration tried to implement to cope with the new post-Cold  War situation. Yet, because of its improper presentation and the  inopportune time (when Clinton had some failings in domestic  affairs), this kind of statement just helped intensify the image  of weakness of Clinton's leadership, added to the growth of  isolationism at home, and produced a harmful effect on America's  "leading position" in the world. Under such circumstances, it  was immediately denied by the authorities.    (2) Presentation of the "enlargement strategy"    Since then, the Clinton Administration has not only stressed  in words that "the United States must play a leading role in the  world; this is the core of Clintonism,"[.sup]13[/] but taken  deliberate actions to show America's strong image and active  engagement in international affairs. Chief among them are: At  the Tokyo summit of the G-7 nations, the United States displayed  a leading role in reducing deficits, promoting the Uruguay Round  negotiations, and developing the world economy. It promoted and  organized the Western action to aid Russia. It launched a sudden  raid on the Intelligence Building in Iraq's capital to show its  determination and ability to act unilaterally. It decided to  send 300 troops to Macedonia to prevent the spread of the  conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina and promised to send as large a  peace-keeping force as 25,000 men to the area after the factions  involved have reached a peace agreement that they are willing to  abide by. In Somalia, it expanded the role of the UN  peace-keeping force and the U.S. troops, saying that their  mission is not only to provide humanitarian relief but also to  build a local police force and restore the country's order. With  regard to banning arms proliferation, it took a strong stance  and imposed blockades and sanctions against other countries. In  the Middle East, its active mediation eased the problems  aggravated by the incident of Lebanese violence and sustained  the peace talks. And Christopher personally led a U.S.  delegation to the UN human rights conference and launched an  offensive against some Third World countries on the issue of  human rights.    These U.S. actions have scored some achievements. The most  remarkable one was the signing on 13 September 1993 in  Washington of a Declaration of Peace Principles between  Palestine and Israel for self-government of the Gaza Strip and  the Jericho area. On the other hand, setbacks were encountered  and prices paid. The most prominent was that bloody clashes  continued in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, for this, the United  States and its European allies criticized each other scathingly.  In Somalia, armed clashes intensified between the UN  peace-keeping force and the United Somali Congress, leading to  casualties of the peace-keeping troops, American servicemen  included. This immediately triggered a strong voice at home,  demanding the withdrawal of American troops from that country.    With this background, Secretary of State Warren Christopher,  Assistant to the President for National Security Anthony Lake,  Chief of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations Madelene  Albright, and President Clinton, one after another, made four  attention-drawing speeches in late September 1993. Two notable  ideas were set forth. One was the "enlargement strategy"  expounded by Lake. It consists of four points: 1) consolidating  cooperation and unity among those democracies that have  instituted the market system as a core force in carrying out  this strategy; 2) actively supporting nascent forces that are  building market-based democracies--i.e., Russia, central and  East European countries, and other CIS states; 3) isolating  diplomatically, economically, militarily, and technologically  those states hostile to the market and democratic systems and  prompting those non-democratic countries that have adopted the  market mechanism to advance toward democracy; and 4) providing  humanitarian aid to developing countries suffering bitterly from  natural disasters or man-made calamities and prompting them to  develop markets and democracy.[.sup]14[/]    The other idea was prominently reflected in the following  passage in Clinton's address to the United Nations General  Assembly: "The United Nations simply cannot become engaged in  every one of the world's conflicts. If the American people are  to say `yes' to UN peacekeeping, the United Nations must know  when to say `no.'"[.sup]15[/] From now on, he said, the  United States will ask some rigorous questions before deciding  on whether to take part in a peace-keeping operation. Examples  of the questions are how much threat is posed to peace, whether  the peace-keeping mission has a clear objective, whether an end  point can be identified for the mission, and how much the  mission will cost. In people's eyes, this is a retreat from the  original U.S. miltilateralist stand of vigorously advocating the  reliance on UN peace-keeping operations to deal with issues of  regional conflicts.    The above-mentioned "enlargement strategy" and the selective  peace-keeping operations reflect the confusion and  self-contradiction of the U.S. foreign policy ideas. On the one  hand, it has a great ambitious goal. On the other hand, it feels  that it has limited methods and is incapable in practice. As a  commentary published in a U.S. newspaper puts it well, "the  Clinton Administration's difficulty lies in how to preserve  America's traditional leadership while minimizing its  international commitments so as to concentrate its efforts on  domestic affairs."[.sup]16[/]    Shortly after Clinton's above address, the U.S. and UN  peace-keeping operation suffered a serious setback in Somalia.  In a combat on 3 October, 18 U.S. soldiers were killed, and  another several dozens were wounded. The U.S. military personnel  sent to Haiti to restore the democratic order were rebuffed and  forced to come back before landing. At that time, U.S. public  opinion vied to criticize the government. Representative Frank  McCloskey of the House Foreign Affairs Committee wrote an  article openly asking Christopher to resign. Meanwhile, the  acute difference between the United States and its European  allies in the Uruguay Round negotiations threw their relations  to an all-time low. And the U.S. relations with some Third World  countries also kept deteriorating.    (3) "Six strategic priorities" put forth by  Christopher    Under these circumstances, the U.S. Government once again  reviewed and reexamined its foreign policy. On 4 November when  testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  Christopher delivered another important speech, setting forth  "six strategic priorities" for the U.S. foreign policy and the  "realistic principles" for dealing with regional conflicts. The  contents and order of the six strategic priorities are as  follows: 1) ensuring U.S. economic security; 2) supporting the  political and economic reforms in Russia and other CIS members;  3) revitalizing NATO to meet the challenges faced by Europe  under the new circumstances; 4) enhancing ties and cooperation  with the Asia-Pacific region--this includes the "U.S. efforts to  work out a comprehensive relationship with China that permits  resolution of differences in a broad, strategic context"; 5)  advancing on the basis of the breakthroughs made in the  Arab-Israel peace process and trying to bring about an overall  and lasting peace in the Middle East; and 6) promoting the  nuclear nonproliferation principle worldwide and solving other  global questions.    In dealing with regional conflicts such as those in Haiti,  Somalia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.S. general guideline is:  The U.S. role and the extent of its involvement will need to be  informed by a strict assessment of its own interests and the  interests of others. It must examine every case--asking rigorous  questions and giving measured answers--to find the course  commensurate with U.S. interests. "The United States will not  attempt to force a settlement on Bosnia militarily. No imposed  settlement would endure," Christopher pointed out  unequivocally.[.sup]17[/] It seems that his testimony  reflects a relatively pragmatic attitude now taken by the  Clinton Administration. In action, this attitude is essentially  reflected in two ways: One, the Clinton Administration is more  able to face up its mistakes and has made a more appropriate  policy adjustment. Two, it pays attention to using dialogues and  consultations to reduce naked suppressive action.  <H5>  The Clinton Administration Still Exploring How To Define </H5> U.S. Position in the World    In a February 1993 article entitled "Clinton and the World,"  Dr. Henry Kissinger said that Clinton's task is to find a role  for the United States to play in a world that it can neither  dominate nor simply withdraw from.[.sup]18[/] Generally  speaking, the Clinton Administration's diplomatic practice over  the past year seemed to "zigzag" on the road to explore how to  do this. The "Tarnoff Doctrine" at the inception was a  not-so-successful attempt to "retreat" and "shrink." The  subsequent "enlargement strategy" was aimed at reestablishing  the U.S. dominance in the world as a general guiding principle  for the American foreign policy. Yet the ruthless reality gave a  lesson to this principle. As Charles Maynes, chief editor of the  U.S. quarterly FOREIGN POLICY, commented in an article, "the  United States must recognize the ruthless reality that even a  superpower will become exhausted in trying to act as a world  police." Under the current U.S. situation marked by a strained  financial budget and a shrinking military force, the adoption of  the "enlargement strategy" "seems to be marching toward  shouldering unlimited new responsibilities rather than limiting  the U.S. commitments."[.sup]19[/] So the "six strategic  priorities" and the realistic principle for dealing with  regional conflicts were put forward in an attempt to resume  America's relatively pragmatic status in the world. Of course,  regardless of the adjustments, the above-mentioned five major  foreign policy ideas remain in the Clinton Administration's  foreign policy. At this time, it appears that the United States  is still in the process of exploring how to define its position  in the post-Cold War world.    Nonetheless, it should be noted that an inevitable question  in this exploration is how to adapt the U.S. foreign policy  ideas to the multipolarization trend and diversification reality  in the contemporary world. An obstacle to such adaption is the  traditional U.S. concept that its foreign policy should serve  the American values. As I see it, while United States is fully  entitled to believe in and publicize its values, it has no right  at all to impose its values on others. Nor does it have any  right to press other countries and interfere in their internal  affairs in various ways in an attempt to create a global order  and peace under the rule of the United States. This is the key  reason for the sharpening contradictions between the United  States and many Third World countries. It is also a main cause  leading to unrest in the world. There is no exaggeration if we  attribute such contradictions and unrest to the hegemonism and  power politics contained in the U.S. foreign policy.  Footnotes    1.

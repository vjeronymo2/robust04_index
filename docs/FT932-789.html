			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Spotlight on the Yen THE YEN shot back into the spotlight again yesterday after it staged a sharp early rally against the dollar, and reached a new post war high against the D-Mark, writes Gillian Tett. In the Far East markets, the dollar fell below the Y107 level, down from a New York close of Y108.7 in spite of repeated intervention by the Bank of Japan. Although the dollar later rallied in European trading, closing at Y109.2, the yen continued to strengthen against most European currencies. Most traders yesterday said that the yen's recovery against the dollar had been widely expected, in light of its rapid weakening this week. However opinions remained divided about how much further the dollar would fall. Most dealers yesterday said that the main reason behind the yen's rally was the growing confidence in the market that the elections in Japan were unlikely to lead to major political change in the country. 'The weakness we saw earlier was really due to temporary political factors,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank. But with most traders continuing to insist that they were bullish about the underlying strength of the dollar, the consensus was that the dollar was unlikely to fall as low as the Y105 mark that it reached earlier this month. In Europe the D-Mark reached a new low of Y62.25, down from Y63.79 the previous day. In spite of edging up against the dollar and French Franc, the D-Mark continued to look weak against most European currencies. Nevertheless, some dealers yesterday insisted that in light of the recent political developments between the French and German finance ministries, the main spotlight in the European currencies over the coming days was likely to be the French franc. Speculation that the Bank of France might be planning to push ahead with interest rate cuts, in spite of the refusal of Mr Theo Waigel, the German Finance Minister, to agree to concerted interest rate cuts, weakened the franc. It finally closed at FFr3.378 down from FFr3.363 on the previous day. 'The markets are very nervous about the franc now,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, economist with Swiss Bank, who predicts that the Franc could soften to FFr3.395 in the near future. Meanwhile, a statement from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor of the exchequer, indicating that the government would not implement any further rate cuts, helped to strengthen sterling against the D-Mark. It closed at DM2.515, up from a previous day's close of DM2.5125.</p>

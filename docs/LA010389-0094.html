			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> AMBASSADOR HOTEL CLOSES DOORS  </P> <P> The Ambassador Hotel, where Charlie Chaplin lived, Robert F. Kennedy died,  Marion Davies rode a horse through the lobby and generations of stars  entertained at the Cocoanut Grove lounge, closed its doors today.  </P> <P> The last guests bade farewell to the 68-year-old Wilshire Boulevard landmark,  an imposing building on 23 lush acres now in disrepair. It was one of the  city's first luxury hotels, its palm-lined property exemplifying the California  life style. The site's future is uncertain, with two companies negotiating to  buy it, hotel spokeswoman Margaret Burk said. The estimated sale price has  risen above $100 million, with preservation of some or all of the building  possibly at issue.  </P></p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Danish insurer Hafnia acts to keep operations running HAFNIA HOLDINGS, Denmark's second-biggest insurer, yesterday announced it was suspending its shares and transferring all of its assets to a new holding company in a drastic move to keep its insurance and banking operations running. Hafnia's insurance and bank subsidiaries - which include Prolific, the London-based life assurance and pensions company acquired in 1989, and the Economic, a small general insurance business - expect to continue as before under the umbrella of a new company, Hafnia Holding 1992. The old company will suspend debt payments and is understood to be seeking protection from its creditors. The news hit share prices across Scandinavia with falls of more than 1 per cent in the share price indices of the Copenhagen, Stockholm and Oslo bourses. Hafnia's difficulties mark the end of an ambitious attempt to create a giant pan-Scandinavian financial services company. They will have serious repercussions for some of Scandinavia's biggest banks and insurers, including Skandia of Sweden, Baltica of Denmark and Uni Storebrand of Norway. Norwegian authorities last night were reported by the Oslo newspaper Aftenposten to be considering a rescue plan for Uni Storebrand. Hafnia said the creation of a company, which will be wholly owned by the old holding company, was the 'best way to secure the interests of shareholders and creditors'. The old company's liabilities amount to DKr6bn (Pounds 553m). Hafnia first disclosed it was in serious financial difficulties earlier this summer when it raised DKr1.9bn from shareholders. This capital, however, has been lost within the space of two months, and the group yesterday said that it had negative net assets of DKr100m. The deterioration has been caused in part by provisions against losses on the group's credit insurance business of DKr250m, and unrealised capital losses of DKr700m from its big shareholdings in Baltica and Skandia. There were also unrealised losses of DKr500m on shares and bonds because of falling prices on Danish markets. The board said attempts to sell its Skandia and Baltica stakes had not yet been successful. Skandia's share price fell by SKr6 to SKr71 because of uncertainty about the future of a combined shareholding of 39 per cent in Skandia held by Hafnia and Uni Storebrand. Uni Storebrand's shares fell 2.6 per cent to an all-time low. Shares in banks which are big Hafnia creditors were particularly hard hit. Denmark's biggest banks, Den Danske Bank and Unidanmark, said they had claims on Hafnia of about DKr1.2bn and DKr450m. The leading Danish banks and pension funds, the main owners of Hafnia, said they supported the reconstruction plan as the only way to save the group, although they risked losing hundreds of millions of kroner. Analysts said the restructuring of Hafnia applied a temporary protective layer between Hafnia Holdings and its solvent operations, while the group seeks a solution to its problems. The Copenhagen bourse's KFX index of 20 leading companies closed 1.8 points down at 80.36. The Oslo all-share index fell 2.6 per cent to 336.63 and the Swedish all-share index lost 1.38 per cent to a 1992 low of 786.92. Hafnia, which announced earlier this month a plan to reduce costs by cutting its staff working in Denmark by 22 per cent, incurred a 1991 net loss after minorities of DKr1.31bn. First-half results are due at the end of the month. Lex Page 16 Share suspension Page 20 Nordic bourses Page 31</p>

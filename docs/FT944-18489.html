			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Consumer confidence grows Business and consumer confidence is climbing strongly in the European Union as the first effects of the economic recovery filter through, the European Commission said yesterday. Not only were consumers less worried about their own financial situation in August, there was also a marked decline in fears about job security. The review noted that industrial capacity utilisation had recovered to 80.4 per cent, the same as in October 1992 although still well below the peak of 85.8 per cent in 1988. But it stressed there was no immediate risk of capacity shortages which could trigger a sudden rise in inflation. The Commission noted that domestic demand was rising steadily, broadening the base of the economic recovery which was still mainly export-led.</p>

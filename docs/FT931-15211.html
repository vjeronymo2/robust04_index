			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / George Walker's Pall Mall home up for sale Mr George Walker's former Pall Mall penthouse home, is up for sale with a price tag of Pounds 1.45m, Maggie Urry writes. Mr Walker, once chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, was last week arrested on charges of theft and false account-ing. He and his wife Jean had already vacated the flat, on the fifth and sixth floor of the Palladian-style building, which overlooks St James's. The flat has four reception rooms, including a 'rather grand drawing room' according to Mellersh &amp; Harding, the agents, also four bedrooms and three bathrooms. Reports that Mr and Mrs Walker removed the kitchen they had installed, before departing, are borne out by the agent's particulars which say the kitchen 'requires complete renovation'.</p>

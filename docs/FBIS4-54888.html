			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Branko Geroski: "Formula for Useful </F> Implications"]    [Text] The solutions for the selection and  responsibilities of the heads of the new security structures, as  the government is proposing them--through a sort of distribution  of power--could prevent frequent changes and coups under  conditions of political confusion in the cabinet and in the  state leadership.    Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]  is the third of the former Yugoslav republics to embark upon a  fundamental restructuring of the security system. So far it has  only been done by Slovenia and Croatia. The announced separation  of intelligence and counterintelligence functions into separate  and relatively independent structures (the Intelligence Agency  and the Directorate for Protection of the Constitutional Order)  will create the institutional prerequisites for beginning a  process of dispersion of the enormous real power that  accumulates at the very top of the ministry. During the period  of monism that power was not transparent, since the ministerial  (at that time secretarial) armchair was reserved for quiet and  obedient "soldiers," loyal to the state and party leadership.  Later things changed, and today it is not by chance that it is  thought that the head of the ministry is probably the most  influential figure in the country after the three in the state  leadership (the state president, the president of parliament,  and the prime minister).    How will that power be distributed? The government, in the  draft laws on internal affairs and the Intelligence Agency, is  offering an interesting formula for the method of selection and  dismissal of the directors of the Agency and the Directorate,  and especially for the subordination of responsibility of these  people and structures. As we know, the minister of internal  affairs is selected by the Assembly, and he is answerable to the  cabinet and in a specific way (the institution of  interpellation) directly to the parliament. The director of the  counterintelligence service (the Directorate) will be appointed  and dismissed by the government, but at the proposal of the  minister. Logically, he will thereby also be responsible to the  latter. The author of the law is proposing that the head of the  intelligence service (the Agency) be appointed and dismissed by  the republic president, but subordination to the cabinet is also  envisioned. The Agency will thus be responsible to the  government, which will be able to demand accountability from its  director. Furthermore, the head of the intelligence service will  adopt regulations on the organization and systematization of  jobs only with prior consent from the government.    There is no doubt that this formula is consistent with the  spirit of the constitutionally (and realistically) established  semipresidential system in Macedonia. A similar solution exists  in Croatia, for example, where the counterintelligence service  is part of the Interior Ministry, but the intelligence under the  control of these services in all countries depends on the basic  characteristics of the system. In "pure" parliamentary regimes,  for instance, the members of the intelligence-security families  are under the control of the governments and the corresponding  ministries, and it is often the practice that their activities  are coordinated by interministerial committees.    So far the solution offered by the government has not  aroused  any interest whatsoever on the part of parliament and the  broader political public. It is symptomatic that only the idea  arises somewhere in parliament and that the appointment and  dismissal of the Directorate's director are to be under the  jurisdiction of the head of state. To say the least, this is a  surprising proposal. It would be natural for the deputies to  fight to have that authority come either from their chamber or  at least from the government that they elect. It might thus be  logical that they would challenge a solution according to which  the state president appoints and dismisses the director of the  Intelligence Agency.    If the efforts of some deputies to establish direct  subordination of the heads of these structures to parliament as  well (parliamentary oversight is another matter) are perhaps an  understandable, if not justified "reflex" on the part of the  deputies, then the proposal that the head of state be given  greater powers, of course, demonstrates a lack of understanding  of the essence of the formula offered. It is not coincidental  that the republic president's jurisdiction to appoint such an  important figure in the security community is limited by the  Agency's clearly defined subordination to the government.    Actually, the mutual limitations are the point of this  solution. The formula is constructed in such a way that it  complicates any possible attempts at rapid, ill-considered, and  frequent changes of the people in leading positions at these  services, all in a situation of disagreement or open conflicts  within the government (between coalition partners, between the  premier and individual ministers, and so forth), in cases of  conflict between the government and the republic president, or  possibly between the government and the minister of internal  affairs.    Thus, for example, the government could hold the director of  the Intelligence Agency responsible for a specific situation or  occurrence, but that does not mean that the state president is  obligated to accept it and dismiss that person. Conversely, if  the president decides on such a step without or even against the  will of the government, the latter, even if it does not block  the selection, can at least hamper the functioning of the  president's new protege. Or there is this situation: The  minister can hold the director of the Directorate responsible,  but the government does not have to decide to dismiss him.  Conversely, if the government replaces the head of the  counterintelligence service without the minister's consent, the  latter can block the selection of a new director by dodging the  obligation to propose a new candidate, or by proposing someone  who will not suit his fellow cabinet members.    These complications are unnecessary at first glance, and  even  dangerous, but they are actually extremely useful, since if it  were not for these "handles," it could easily happen, in the  event of political infighting within the government or in the  state leadership and, in general, in confused general political  conditions, that confusing changes and coups in the leading  positions of these services might also result. In that way the  services could be utilized in political quarrels among coalition  partners, and even induced to engage in unhealthy mutual  competition. In the developed democratic world, such cases of  quiet "wars" between a state's security services have been  recorded, and they usually end with serious scandals with  serious consequences for the state's security as well. It is  precisely for that reason that these services need to be  protected from major political upheavals. The formula that has  been offered will create a situation in which changes in the  leaderships of these services will be feasible only in  conditions of relative political stability.    Admittedly, certain shortcomings of these solutions can also  be noted. In the first place, it can easily be assumed that  formal jurisdiction over the intelligence service will probably  be ceded by the head of state to one of his special advisers for  security issues. That is customary in presidential regimes. With  the increase in the head of state's real power, the power of his  adviser (or team of advisers) will also be increased, something  that is not exactly in the spirit of the regime, which, however,  is basically a parliamentary one. In the second place, in a  situation of assumed chronic political instability in the state  leadership, there is a risk that the heads of these services may  become detached from real control by the government and the  republic president, and that new centers of political power may  thus be promoted. There are no ideal solutions, however, and one  must also rely on the corrective factor of parliamentary and  also public oversight.    It remains to be seen how, after the anticipated adoption of  the laws, this part of the Interior Ministry's transformation  will be carried out in practice. The experiences to date from  the division of leading positions in state institutions among  the coalition partners suggest the assumption that things will  not go smoothly this time either. Whatever happens, that is also  part of the entertainment called politics.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro disputes NKr690m tax claim Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly-quoted company, has become embroiled in a dispute with the Oslo Tax Board which is claiming NKr690.1m (Dollars 93.8m) in extra taxes covering a four-year period. The disagreement concerns a deduction for losses on shares in Norsk Hydro Canada, a unit which produces magnesium, and the waiving of interest on equity loans for Hydro Fertilizers in the UK. Norsk Hydro intends to appeal against the tax board's claim and said deferred tax provisions were included in consolidated accounts for the relevant years. The company maintains that 'the new assessment, therefore, has no effect on total taxes compared with the preliminary result for 1993 published on February 21'. It explains that the tax board had disallowed a deduction for loss on shares in Norsk Hydro Canada, and in the board's view the waived interest on the loans to Hydro Fertilisers should have been included in taxable income in Norway. ABB Finland has won a Dollars 50m contract from Central Hidroelectrica de Carnas (CHEC), the Colombian utility, to supply transformers and other equipment for 21 new substations throughout the Caldas region of the Colombian Andes, writes Andrew Baxter. The deal is a further sign of revival in the South American power equipment markets. Union Bank of Finland is providing 85 per cent of the finance through a Dollars 42.5m 12 1/2 -year export credit loan.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: IN ARRESTING MOVE, SCHOOL'S BOARD DROPS KHASHOGGI  </P> <P> Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi has been dropped from the American University  Board of Trustees -- not because of his indictment on charges of racketeering,  fraud and obstruction of justice -- but because he is a no-show. Khashoggi,  once reputed to have been among the world's richest men, was named to the  Washington school's board in 1983 but, according to AU President Richard  Berendzen, has attended only one board meeting, staying about 30 minutes. "We  have no address for him," Berendzen told the Eagle, the AU student newspaper.  It is true that for a time after the indictment was issued Khashoggi was a  fugitive, traveling frequently through Europe and the Middle East. However, his  current address is Bern, Switzerland, where he was jailed last month for  extradition to the United States to face charges that he helped Ferdinand E.  Marcos funnel millions of dollars out of the Philippines when he was president  to buy paintings and real estate in New York. Meanwhile, a column in the AU  student paper called for the university to drop Khashoggi's name from its new  sports complex, calling it an "embarrassment." Khashoggi pledged $5 million to  the facility in 1984.  </P> <P>  -- No more free rides at Chicago City Hall. Mayor Richard M. Daley, who took  office just over a week ago, ordered all cars parked illegally outside City  Hall towed away, including those of five city officials. Daley's press  secretary, Avis LaVelle, said that to set an example, Daley ordered his  limousine parked in the city's underground lot. Normally, the vehicle idles  outside City Hall. Will Daley make the tow order a daily occurrence? "Oh, I  think people will get the message," LaVelle said. She should know. Hers was one  of the cars towed.  </P> <P>  -- FBI headquarters was paid a visit by an unlikely group of tourists -- 12  retired Soviet admirals and generals. The former top Soviet military officers,  in the United States for a conference sponsored by a private defense group, saw  FBI exhibits on fingerprinting, its famous crime laboratory and a firearms  demonstration. But perhaps of greatest interest to the group was a display  showing various Soviet spies captured in recent years and one in particular  entitled "The Walker Family," the spy ring broken up by the FBI and  masterminded by former Navy communications specialist John A. Walker Jr. He  pleaded guilty to selling some of the nation's most vital secrets to Moscow for  nearly two decades. DEBORAH CHRISTENSEN  </P></p>

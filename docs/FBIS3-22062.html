Concerned agencies recently  detected two out of a group of eight foreign cargo ships  carrying smuggled goods.    Drug trafficking has also been on the increase in recent  days. In the first two months of this year, the authorities  uncovered 17 cases of trafficking and confiscated 450 kg of  opium and 0.72 kg of heroin. The most serious was the smuggling  of 129 kg of opium by cadres of the Dien Bien goldsmith shop in  Lai Chau Province.    It is noteworthy that the manufacturing and trading of fake  goods done in meticulous ways are also widespread. Police  nationwide have so far detected and dealt with 2,700 cases.  This is a new challenge for responsible agencies in the  struggle against smuggling.</p>

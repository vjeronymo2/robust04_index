			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / SIB may drop unit trust plan THE Securities and In-vestments Board is preparing to drop its controversial proposal to allow unit trusts to be sold through far more outlets than competing life assurance products, according to industry sources. SIB made the proposal, known as 'depolarisation', because it viewed unit trust charges as more transparent to the prospective purchaser than those of life assurance investments. The proposal provoked an outcry from the life assurance industry, which saw it as aiding its competitors. Under polarisation, imposed with the Financial Services Act in 1987, sales agents may be 'tied', selling the products of a single producer, or 'independent', selling the products of several producers. The rule was intended to help consumers to gauge the objectivity of the advice they were given. Since 1987 the life assurance industry has adapted to polarisation, building large sales networks around both types of distributors. The number of outlets for unit trust companies has shrunk. SIB is not expected to make a formal decision until its meeting next month, but industry sources said recent informal soundings suggested the proposal had already been dropped. Among the reasons for the move is the opposition of consumer groups. Ms Jean Eaglesham, money policy adviser for the Consumers' Association, said her group opposed the move, partly because research showed that sales agents frequently misled buyers about the company for which they were working. Depolarisation would only make it easier for that confusion to occur, unless sales agents were forced to disclose their employer much more clearly. The Unit Trust Association, which supported the proposal, has found itself deserted by five of its most powerful members - life assurance companies which also sell unit trusts. The association sent a paper to SIB supporting the proposal. It attacked the sales methods of the life industry in support of its arguments. The association has been forced to back down and is submitting a new paper to SIB.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Ship ahoy - afloat on a sea of oil money / Keith Wheatley investigates the market for luxury yachts THOSE WHO sell luxury goods believe that money never vanishes: it simply moves on. Customers may change but the overall demand remains. Take super-yachts, for instance. 'The market has shifted from British and American owners,' says Jonathan Beckett, a partner in yacht-broker Nigel Burgess which sells more of these largest and costliest toys than anyone else. 'It touched down briefly in Japan, but I don't think life at sea fits the recreational pattern of most Japanese. Some of the brokers thought of opening offices in Tokyo, but I'm glad we didn't. 'Then, the market was briefly with French and Italian owners, but we're now back with the Middle East plus a resurgence of interest from France and Holland. Indeed, we're selling boats to younger men in the Middle East. Quite often, their fathers bought yachts 20 years ago in the first rush of oil money and they've grown up with it as part of their lives.' In spite of the recession, Burgess had its best year ever in 1992 and sold seven 'large yachts,' a term owing as much to cheque-books as waterline length or tonnage. Such vessels cost Dollars 5m-Dollars 10m; Dollars 20m would be unusual but not spectacular. Yachts such as the liner-sized Trump Princess - owned in the past by both the New York property speculator Donald Trump and Arab wheeler-dealer Adnan Khashoggi - pass (on paper) through brokers' offices. So do glorious restoration jobs such as the 1929 Rosenkavalier, 217ft of Weimar glory built by Friedrich Krupp. Its original owner, yeast magnate Max Fleishmann, followed the fashion of the times by copying the lines of an 1890s' steam yacht. Although it looked an antique, it was propelled by 750hp diesels of the kind that went on to power Hitler's navy. The new owner is Andreas Liveras, a British-based Greek Cypriot businessman. The yacht's satellite communications and accommodation are as modern as those at any international hotel but Liveras has gone to just as much expense to restore and preserve the original engines as if they were Old Masters - which, in a way, they are. Is the market recession-proof? Are these the extravagant toys of men - the owners are always men, although the boats are often named after wives or daughters - so rich that the ebb and flow of the profits cycle is nothing to them? Probably not. After a peak in prices during 1989, the whole market seized-up for a year during which almost no mega-yachts was sold. They sat in the harbour at Antibes, France, like white tombstones. Vessels once used for non-stop socialising were tended by just a solitary shipkeeper, pumping the bilges and polishing the brass work. Designer Jon Bannenberg, the most successful man in his field, was an exception; new-build projects for yachts costing more than Dollars 30m continued to keep his office at Chelsea, west London, working flat out. 'Cars and trains can't be made individually any more,' he says. 'Yachts are the last way of creating a totally unique environment that you can travel in.' But Bannenberg - an aesthetically fierce man who admits to giving shipyards, and even clients, a hard time - admits the business is heady, even dangerous, from a commercial point of view. 'No one actually needs these vessels. You need only four or five people to decide not to build and you haven't got a business.' After the Gulf War, there was a distinct pause in orders. 'We hung on and ran the company very tightly. We never make the mistake of thinking we have the right to live like the clients.' What owners appear to want, more and more, is boats that can be lived-on comfortably for weeks at a time. If the ultimate modern luxury is privacy and seclusion, the super-yacht offers it in abundance. Faxes, modem-linked computers and satellite phones mean that keeping contact with an office presents no problems. William Simon, a former US Treasury secretary who now operates a huge investment business, runs his operations for several months each summer from his 110ft sloop Freedom. One year, it cruised the entire South Pacific while the boss continued to buy and sell on the New York markets. Although aerials and satellite domes can look ugly on a sailing yacht or a restored Edwardian classic, there are ways round the problem. Recently, Bannenberg created a false second funnel for an older yacht undergoing stem-to-stern restoration. Inside were all the external electronics for the communications. Will yachts continue to get bigger? 'Ten years ago,' says Beckett, '40 metres was a big, big yacht. Now, the benchmark is 50m-55m. But there will be a tailing-off. For one thing, costs increase proportionally to displacement, which rises exponentially with length. Second, if you build something 80m long, you are virtually stuck on a floating island. Only three or four desirable ports in the entire Mediterranean are open to you. Not many of my clients want to be anchored three miles off St Tropez.'</p>

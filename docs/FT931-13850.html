			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Lucas forms electronics unit LUCAS Industries, the UK car and aerospace components group which has recently been seen as a possible candidate for takeover, has integrated its separate electronics activities into one business. Lucas Electronics, which has an annual turnover of Pounds 100m, employs 1,900 people and has sites and resources in Europe, North America and Asia. The new business is designed to benefit from Lucas's capital investment in electronics and to exploit the increasing convergence in components used by the group's aerospace and automotive markets. The move is part of a three-year restructuring programme, announced in October, which would shed 4,000 jobs, half of them in the UK, to bring the workforce below 50,000. Mr Paul Brown, managing director of Lucas Electronics, said the new business would contribute to the group's cost-savings drive, but believed that growth would protect the jobs of his 600 electronics, software and manufacturing engineers. Lucas Electronics sells 70 per cent of its products within the the group, but aims to increase the proportion going outside to 50 per cent within 18 months. Mr Brown was confident that increasing applications for electronics in safety and fuel control systems would ensure annual organic growth of more than 20 per cent. Lucas recently took a fuel control mechanism from a British motor car and applied it to Rolls-Royce's Tay aero-engine, at about half the cost of existing aerospace fuel management systems. A diesel fuel-injection system for Volvo trucks has also been modified for use on locomotives made by General Electric of the US. Mr Brown said a priority would be to create a library of re-usable solutions to recurring problems - such as noise, vibration and security. Preferred components would also be identified, so the new business could benefit from economies of scale in manufacturing and purchasing. Lucas shares yesterday closed 1 1/2 p lower at 140 1/2 p, valuing the group at Pounds 990m. The shares touched a five-year low of 78p in September, just before the group announced a collapse in profits. The increase since then has been fuelled by speculation that Lucas was vulnerable to predators.</p>

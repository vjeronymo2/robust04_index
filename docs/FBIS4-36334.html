			<p>BFN     [Text] The main opposition Union of Democratic Forces [UFD]  lost several of its members yesterday. Some of them slammed the  door and decided to form another political organization, called  the Movement of Independent Democrats [MDI]. (Abel-aid Ould  Kebde), the new party's leader, explains here to Salem Meshbouh  Salem the reasons for his decision to pull out of the UFD:    [Begin recording] [(Kebde)] We are of the view that the UFD  no longer provides us leadership, because it now serves merely  as a shock absorber that enabled the government to carry out  painfulessly, under the most ideal political and social  conditions, reforms which in the final analysis were not reforms  at all -- and I think the present frustrations of the  independent press clearly show to what extent authoritarianism  has surged back. All in all, when one takes stock of the  democratization process, not much is left.    [Salem] Does this mean that the other movements which have  supported you so far -- the Party for Liberty, Equality, and  Justice and the [word indistinct] movement -- have also pulled  out?    [(Kebde)] I think you are aware that we are right at the  beginning of this process, and I understand that consultations  between these two movements are under way. It appears that  within the next 24 to 48 hours they will announce their  decisions -- which could be to remain with the UFD. As I said,  we are at the beginning of a process which could in due course  involve other forces which were originally outside the present  UFD, or informal forces formerly within that organization. I do  not think it is possible to predict what is likely to happen  next. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBT-REDUCTION BILL COULD COST COMMUNITY COLLEGES;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: PROVISION IN FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO CURB LOAN DEFAULTS COULD BLOCK  ENROLLMENT OF 100,000 STUDENTS AND REDUCE AID, CHANCELLOR WARNS.  </P> <P> Federal legislation aimed at reducing the national debt also threatens to block  the enrollment of 100,000 new students in California community colleges and  could cost the institutions $200 million in lost federal aid, a top state  educator said Thursday.  </P> <P> Although the state's 107 community colleges have traditionally maintained open  enrollment policies, new students without high school diplomas could be barred  from entering the colleges under provisions of new federal legislation to curb  defaults on student loans.  </P> <P> Unless new legislation or some other remedial action is taken swiftly, state  Community Colleges Chancellor David Mertes warned, "I view it as a major  disaster for California community colleges."  </P> <P> In Washington, a U.S. Department of Education official agreed that the federal  action could deal a major blow to the state's community college system but  pledged to "work with California to ensure that this will not happen."  </P> <P> "We are committed to helping the post-secondary education community implement  this new law as smoothly and less disruptively as possible," said Bill Moran,  director of the department's student assistance programs.  </P> <P> The dispute between the community college chief and the U.S. Department of  Education broke out Thursday, a day after publication of what Moran termed an  explanation of the new legislation to curb mounting defaults on guaranteed  student loan programs.  </P> <P> As part of the budget deficit reduction package enacted Nov. 5, President Bush  and Congress devised steps to try to prevent defaults on loans by former  students, a major problem in some parts of the country.  </P> <P> One controversial provision of the legislation requires prospective college  students without a high school diploma or its equivalent to take and pass an  admissions examination called an "ability-to-benefit" test. Mertes said the  federal action violates a California law that prohibits use of a standardized  examination as a condition of enrollment at community colleges.  </P> <P> The federal law takes effect Jan. 1 and Mertes said community colleges that  admitted students who did not pass the tests would be liable, under the federal  law, to lose $35 million in federal support for vocational education programs.  Students stand to lose an additional $164 million in federal assistance.  Traditionally, under the state's policy of "open" admissions at community  colleges, anyone 18 or older is admitted, regardless of whether the student is  a high school graduate. Tuition for each student is $50 per semester.  </P> <P> At a news conference, Mertes said projections show that about 100,000 new  students a year could be affected. The state's total community college  population is 1.5 million. Students already enrolled would not be affected.  </P> <P> Mertes said he is exploring possible legal action to prevent the loss of funds,  but he is counting on sympathetic Californians in Congress to introduce  legislation next month to protect the community colleges.  </P> <P> Mertes said he officially learned of the admissions test requirement on  Wednesday and said that even if there were no conflict with California law it  would be impossible to comply by Jan. 1 because a federally approved test could  not be developed, administered and scored by then.  </P> <P> The new term starts Jan. 1 for two-year colleges on the quarter system and Feb.  1 for those on the semester system. Mertes estimated that most of the students  affected by the federal action are in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego  counties. He said campuses probably would risk admitting the students for now.  </P> <P> Mertes said the education department's publication of a notice in the Federal  Register of the testing requirement constituted a binding regulation affecting  only community colleges in California because this is the one state with a  "pure" open admissions policy.  </P> <P> But Moran said federal action "is not a regulation drafted by the Department of  Education. This is a law enacted by Congress. This is not something we just  ginned up out of whole cloth."  </P> <P> Moran said final regulations will be adopted after hearings are held and that  the published "notice" was intended to alert states that the federally required  tests were about to be implemented.  </P> <P> In the case of California, Moran said, a "placement" test now given to students  to determine their abilities in reading, writing and mathematics might be  adjusted to include "some kind of a pass or fail test score for purposes of the  law."  </P> <P> But Mertes said California officials repeatedly tried to discuss the situation  with the Department of Education but were shunted aside. "It was done in tight  secrecy," he said.  </P> <P> Moran, however, said that in drafting the explanation of the new law, officials  "got as much input from the post-secondary education community as we could,  given the amount of time we had to put it out."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Oswald Johnston contributed to this story.  </P></p>

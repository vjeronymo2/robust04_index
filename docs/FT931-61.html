			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Last ditch attempt to break the log-jam - Coffee talks TALKS ON renewing the international coffee agreement appear set to end in failure in London today, although last minute attempts to find a way out of a morass of technical issues were continuing late into yesterday evening. Mr Arnoldo Lopez, chairman of a special committee looking for ways to unblock the talks, said at the International Coffee Organisation headquarters that delegates had recognised that they could not reach an agreement by today's deadline. But he insisted that there was a prevailing mood of optimism, hinting that the talks might be extended. The London robusta market closed down yesterday, the May contract touching Dollars 853 a tonne before recovering to Dollars 862 a tonne, off Dollars 11 on the day. The move followed Monday's retreat in New York, where arabica prices were showing some signs of recovery in early trading yesterday. Analysts in both London and New York were dismissive of any hopes that an agreement with economic clauses would emerge from the latest talks. 'I never thought that we would have an agreement, and I'm glad that they might finally shoot this dead horse,' said Ms Judy Ganes, analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York. Mr Peter Kettle, analyst with ED &amp; F. Man in London, said both producers and consumers held strong views, and neither side appeared prepared to give way. The London May contract is now Dollars 30 below the level when the ICO talks started at the beginning of last week, while the New York May contract was more than 4 cents a lb down on Monday. Mr Kettle pointed out that ICO negotiations, which have been spread across the past four years, have always had a negative effect on prices. Even though the market always expected nothing to emerge from the talks, it was still disappointed when nothing did.</p>

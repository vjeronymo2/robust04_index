			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AROUND THE FOOTHILLS: THE DISCOURSE IS MEANT TO PROBE DEEPLY INTO THE PUBLIC  PSYCHE.  </P> <P> For the past five Wednesdays, more than 60 of Glendale's most influential  citizens have met in small groups in private residences to talk about sensitive  public concerns.  </P> <P> Their topics are gangs and drugs, home ownership, diversity in the workplace,  cultural diversity and the all-inclusive, "Change -- Should We or Shouldn't  We?"  </P> <P> Among them are all five members of the City Council, several trustees and  employees of the school and college districts, businessmen and financiers,  developers, a judge and the publishers of a newspaper and a magazine. Balancing  out the group is a diverse selection of Glendale's population, including  students, housewives and blue-collar workers.  </P> <P> The discourse is meant to probe deeply into the public psyche. Each evening's  focus is guided by a list of written questions, such as:  </P> <P> "What changes have you noticed in Glendale as a result of the dwindling white  population?  </P> <P> "What steps do you think the city of Glendale ought to take to address this  issue?" and  </P> <P> "What are the images you believe U.S. residents have of Hispanics, blacks,  Mideasterners, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos, Jews and Anglos?"  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the responses of the city's leadership will be known only to the  68 people invited to the exercise.  </P> <P> Specifically excluded from the sessions were working reporters who might convey  to their readers any small insight into the private thinking of the city's  leadership.  </P> <P> This is the second year of what is to be an annual forum called "Understanding  Glendale for the Future."  </P> <P> It is put together jointly by the city, Glendale Community College and a  business group called Glendale Partners.  </P> <P> Following last year's pattern, for the benefit of the press, as they say, there  was a three-hour opening session with suitable fanfare and speeches before the  participants went behind closed doors.  </P> <P> The rationale for this secrecy -- or, more graciously, privacy -- was to avoid  any impediment to the expression of ideas that might be delicate, embarrassing  or antagonistic, said Martha Thayer, whose public relations firm organized the  forum.  </P> <P> A similar explanation was offered this summer when the Board of Education sent  some community leaders on a retreat to devise a report on the mission of the  schools. In that case, the professional facilitator hired to lead the meetings  barred reporters from Glendale's hometown paper, the News Press.  </P> <P> The paper screamed in print that the future of the schools was being molded  secretly in violation of the Ralph M. Brown Act, the state's public meeting  law. The school district relented and the meetings, in all their resplendent  tedium, were opened. The jackals of the press were happy and the News Press  declared its conquest an "editorial triumph."  </P> <P> Those who represent the municipal/commercial complex are a degree more polished  in their method.  </P> <P> In subtle ways, the current forum deflects any application of the Brown Act --  no two council members being assigned to the same group and the product being  only free discussion, rather than a report.  </P> <P> Finally, the hosts invited the publisher of the News Press, Judee Kendall, into  their circle. The publication raised no eyebrow this time.  </P> <P> It's a shame, because the conversations that are going on would undoubtedly be  interesting and instructive for the rest of the city. I'd like to hear what a  councilman thinks should be done about the dwindling white population.  </P> <P> Some of those in the discussion groups, by the way, have chosen to talk about  their experiences. They uniformly found them constructive.  </P> <P> One, 15-year-old Jessica Billingslea, a student at Glendale High School, said  she made the heavy commitment of time for one reason: to help improve the image  of her city.  </P> <P> Being half-black and half-white, she said, she has grown weary of outsiders  telling her, "Oh, I feel so sorry for you," when they learn she's a resident of  Glendale.  </P> <P> "I wanted to join this group because really it's not like that anymore," she  said, before equivocating slightly. "Actually it is, but maybe we can do  something about that, show that we are trying to do something. I would just  like people to know. You want to be proud of your city."  </P> <P> She and others said there were some tense conversations and considerable  disagreement over questions of public transit and taxation. There have also  been notable triumphs over ignorance. The city fathers are now informed, for  example, that the term Mideasterners does not apply to the town's largest  ethnic group, Armenians.  </P> <P> It shouldn't take a Brown Act to spread such things. The Glendale stereotype  that may well be last to die casts its power elite as a club that reaches all  important decisions in private. That subject should be added to next year's  agenda and reporters should be invited by right, whatever the consequences.  </P> <P> Jackals that we are, we would probably skip most of the meetings and report  much out of context with an unpredictable margin of error.  </P> <P> We would intimidate some and stir others to excess.  </P> <P> But we would also spot a few more of the Jessica Billingsleas in Glendale's  future.  </P></p>

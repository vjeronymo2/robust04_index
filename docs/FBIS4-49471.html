			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Xia Yuhua (1115 0060 5478)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 6 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The Foreign  Affairs Select Committee of the British Parliament recommended  in a report released last month, that a human rights commission  be set up in Hong Kong. Lu Ping, vice chairman and secretary  general of the Preliminary Work Committee and director of the  State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, pointed out  here today that setting up a human rights commission clashes  with the Basic Law.    In a discussion meeting with National People's Congress Hong  Kong deputies and Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference Hong Kong members, Lu Ping said: This commission, as  they see it, will not be a normal consultative body but a body  of power. Yet it is neither an executive, or legislative, or a  judiciary organ as laid down in the Basic Law. Setting up such  a human rights commission obviously clashes with the Basic Law  and will undermine the power structure established by the Basic  Law.    Lu Ping believed that the people recommending such a human  rights commission "had some other things in mind." As a power  body, the human rights commission is bound to weaken and affect  the powers of other bodies and destabilize Hong Kong society.    As regards the proposition that after 1997 the Chinese  Government should report periodically to the UN Human Rights  Commission on the human rights situation in Hong Kong, Lu Ping  said: As China did not join either of the two international  human rights conventions, it does not have any responsibility or  obligation to report to the UN Human Rights Commission on human  rights in Hong Kong.    Lu Ping said: Hong Kong is not a polity and does not have  the authority to make reports to the UN Human Rights Commission.  The Basic Law states very clearly: The parts in the two human  rights conventions that have been applicable to Hong Kong in the  past must, after 1997, be implemented through the local laws of  Hong Kong. In other words, the two human rights conventions  cannot be directly applied to Hong Kong. There was consensus on  this point when the Basic Law was drafted.    Lu Ping said that Hong Kong people will enjoy extensive  rights after 1997 and the Basic Law provides full legal  safeguards in this respect.    During the discussion, Lu Ping characterized the Foreign  Affairs Select Committee's report as "very good teaching  material" because it bluntly admitted a fundamental change in  Britain's 1989 policy on the problem of Hong Kong from  cooperating with to confronting the Chinese Government.</p>

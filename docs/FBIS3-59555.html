Elettra's light cannot be held back. A  ray squirts outside the experimental area and gets lost on the  dome of the elegant building. Even we can see the  violet-colored reflections of the radiation produced  specifically to study the microscopic details of matter, both  organic and inorganic. We are on the Carso, in the area where  the Elettra light machine (synchrotron light in technical terms)  began operating a few days ago.    From the outside it looks like a doughnut squatting on  lime-impregnated soil, whose round shape fits in with the beauty  of the surroundings.    Inside complexity triumphs: 10 million pieces, both  mechanical and electronic, to generate and pilot a swarm of 100  billion electrons from which the magic radiation originates.    "When we turned on the machine the first time, we were not  at  all sure that it would work," admitted Albin Wrulich, an  Austrian scientist who took over the direction of the project  following the premature death of Prof. Mario Puglisi. "Then  with great joy we saw that everything was working as it should  and that we had even beaten all records." Elettra, in fact, is  one of the three new synchrotron light machines in the world  (the other two are in Berkeley and Grenoble) and all three have  reached the finishing post almost simultaneously. The goal is  to launch a scientific competition that should revolutionize the  world of applied research.    The Synchrotron Trieste company has an exceptional  president,  Nobel Laureate Carlo Rubbia: "Now we have a strategic tool that  is extremely important for scientific, industrial, and economic  development. A machine developed using particular technical  innovations that will enable us to observe organic and inorganic  matter in detail."    The Elettra structure consists of a particle accelerator. An  80-meter long electron cannon (LINAC [linear accelerator] fires  its shots inside a ring with a 260-meter circumference. Here  the electrons are accelerated by radio frequency cavities and  forced to run along a circular trajectory by powerful magnets.  When passing through the curved magnets and inverters the  electrons radiate synchrotron light which is radiation with a  very wide spectrum: from infrared to X ray.    "The radiation," explained Elettra Scientific Division  Director Prof. Renzo Rosei, "is channeled into a series of lines  that are tangential to the ring and brought to experimental  areas where it is focused on the samples to be analyzed. The  most appropriate wavelength for each type of research is  selected. There are eight light lines available but there are  plans to bring this number to 22."    By observing the wavelengths that correspond to the  dimensions of the atoms and molecules, the most inaccessible  structures of matter are revealed.    "The machine cost 300 billion lire, the same as two football  fields," said Synchrotron Managing Director Giuseppe Viani.  "Now the company is stipulating contracts with public and  private organizations."  <H5>  It Can Be Precious In Many Sectors </H5> <H5>  Live Chemistry </H5>   This is how the functions of the first light line activated  alongside the Elettra synchrotron can be summarized. The  scientific name of the line is "super bait." It is based on the  principal of photoemission discovered by Nobel Laureate Siegban.  The X ray produced by Elettra, which focuses on a sample to be  analyzed, has the capacity to extract electrons from the various  chemical elements that make up the sample. An analysis of the  electrons leads to a determination of the single elements at  play as well are their reciprocal interactions. It promises to  have applications in the field of catalytic processes,  corrosion, and other chemical reactions.  <H5>  Semiconductors </H5>   This is what is expected of the other two Elettra light  lines  called Vuv Photoemission and Esca. They are also based on the  principle of extracting electrons from samples by means of  incident X rays. The first piece of equipment, managed in  collaboration with the CNR [National Research Council] will be  used to design semiconductor joints and high temperature  superconductors. The second, in collaboration with ENI  [National Hydrocarbons Corporation], will be used to understand  how a diamond is made. Another photoemission light line  dedicated to gases will be used to perform a detailed study on  the process leading to the destruction of ozone.  <H5>  Chemotherapies </H5>   These are one of the many applications that could emerge  from  the Elettra "diffractometry" light line. There are three:  diffractometry, scattering, and aloisa. In this case the  incident radiation is used to perform a kind of radiography of  biological and pharmacological materials. But acquiring an  in-depth understanding of how specific proteins and crystals  function, it is hoped to develop pharmaceuticals that act  selectively by depositing themselves only on sick tissues and  avoiding other healthy organs, and bombarding using highly toxic  chemical substances.  <H5>  Mammography </H5>   It is an eloquent name for a light line that has still not  been activated but whose opening is slated for 1994. It has  been seen that synchrotron light is one of the most effective  methods for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. The  wavelength of the light will be varied according to the  dimensions of the organ under examination, thereby permitting  50-micron tumor granules to be seen. The radiation will be 10  times less than that absorbed using traditional equipment. The  light line will probably be assigned to a health authority in  the area and will be positioned on the outskirts of the Elettra  area.</p>

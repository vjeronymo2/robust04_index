			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Pressure increases on Major for early reshuffle MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced pressure to bring forward his expected ministerial reshuffle as further cracks appeared in cabinet unity over the Treasury's fundamental review of welfare spending. Ministers raised the possibility that the prime minister might be preparing to replace Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor as early as next week. The suggestion came as some of Mr Lamont's senior colleagues voiced concern about the risk of a public backlash against the curbs on the welfare state that are being studied in the Treasury. Mr Major has made it clear he will not be 'bounced' into ministerial changes, and late July remains the most probable date for a cabinet shake-up. The prime minister's office refuses to comment on the speculation. But as a further spate of leaks confirmed that the Treasury is exploring cuts in core areas of the welfare state, close associates of Mr Major acknowledged the growing pressure within the Tory party for speedy changes. The associates indicated there was now a 'possibility' he would use next week's Whitsun parliamentary recess to conduct a reshuffle that would see Mr Lamont moved from the Treasury. One suggestion last night was that Mr Major might combine a limited shake-up of cabinet posts with much wider changes in the middle and junior ranks of the government. But friends of Mr Lamont insisted there has been no indication that Mr Major has made up his mind to move him. The chancellor, who returned to London yesterday from a meeting of European Community finance ministers, has put in place a series of meetings in coming months to prepare for the Budget in November. The political row over the spending review - which ministers warned threatened a government defeat in the forthcoming Christchurch by-election - has intensified the pressure on Mr Major to reassert his authority. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, sought to defuse the latest speculation by declaring that the government would stick to its manifesto commitments to preserve the child benefit payment and to uprate it in line with inflation. Accusing the Labour party of 'scare tactics', he insisted no decisions had been taken in other areas such as widening the base for prescription charges, introducing 'hotel' fees for hospital stays and cutting invalidity and unemployment benefit. But cabinet colleagues echoed warnings from backbench Tory MPs that Mr Portillo's understandable reluctance not to close options before the completion of the review had created serious concern among the electorate. Ministers in charge of large Whitehall spending departments are said to be concerned about the political risks. Some ministers were arguing yesterday that since some of the proposals would never win a majority in the House of Commons, Mr Major should indicate the review will not erode central elements of the welfare state. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, indicated that the opposition would aim to keep up the pressure on the government by demanding specific assurances on a range of benefits and NHS services.</p>

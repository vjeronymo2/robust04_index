			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L. Ageyeva: "R50,000--Is This a Lot or Not? What </F> the Ordinary Taxpayer Needs To Know About the Nebulous Concepts  of the Budget"]    [Text] As reported, several items on the agenda of the  Supreme Soviet session involve the social sphere, that is, your  pocketbook and mine: on changes to the program of targeted  social support for the population, and the draft laws on the  minimum wage.    Debates on this topic began even before the session. We have  reported that the Supreme Soviet's Planning, Budget, and Finance  Commission did not support the draft on the minimum wage on the  grounds that it "requires additional consideration and the  introduction of companion acts not only from the standpoint of  the budget, but also from the angle of affecting the situation  and interests of industrial enterprises, first and foremost in  the defense industry."    A few figures from the commission's conclusions: In the  event  of shifting to a R50,000 minimum wage, expenditures on sectors  financed from the Tatarstan budget will amount to R100 billion  over seven months; additional payments to institutions of higher  learning and vocational secondary schools--R35 billion; and the  republic social protection fund's expenditures will increase by  more than 10 billion.    There is an opinion that the government, which proposes to  raise the minimum wage, is an interested party, because in this  case there will be an increase in budget revenue from various  duties which today are pegged to the minimum wage. However, the  deputy commission came to the opposite conclusion: The tax base  will shrink, resulting in a loss of approximately R200 billion.    Thus, additional expenditures and losses will amount to R350  billion, or R50 billion a month. The actual state of the budget  shows that real revenue will amount to R80 billion a month on  average.    Undoubtedly, some people will gain. This includes those who  will be receiving this minimum wage. One of draft laws submitted  for the deputies' consideration assumes employers' liability in  the event they do not pay even R50,000: The administrative fine  will equal 10 times the value of the minimum wage on the first  occurrence, and on repeated occurrence within one year--double  that amount.    However, if all other grades are left unchanged in the  Unified Pay Scale, which is the basis for setting salaries in  most budget-financed organizations, the imbalance in the ratio  of labor remuneration for low-skilled and highly skilled labor  will reach threatening proportions.    Several versions of increasing pay for all others were  submitted to the deputies: add R20,000 to all grades above the  minimum; make the base pay for the first grade R30,000 or even  R50,000 and then set salaries in accordance with established  coefficients; and so on. That is, on the surface, everybody wins.    The deputy commission says, however, that increasing the  minimum wage to R30,000 in February-May did not result in a  substantial increase in average earnings. Their decline over the  past months has become catastrophic: Average earnings for March  and April differ by only R1,000. And this is considering that  prices went up for everything!    And the last consideration on this account. At a recent  press  conference M. Sabirov mentioned that the republic budget may  simply not be able to cover this innovation. That is, R50,000  will be set by law, and then, as has already happened before,  people will not see their pay for months. The harsh reality is  this: The budget treasury in the republic and in Kazan is quite  depleted.    Meanwhile an increasingly greater number of urban and rural  residents are falling into the low-income category every day.  The materials distributed to the deputies provide numerous  interesting details in this respect.    As long as store prices and residential rents in Tatarstan  were lower by an order of magnitude than in other regions of  Russia, we had good grounds to say that we lived better. Today  the picture has changed.    The average monthly income of one worker in our republic  amounted to R151,800 in April and fell by 1.3 percent as  compared to March. Social and labor benefits here account for  only 6 percent. The average wage earned in April amounted to  R142,800 and increased as compared to last April by 5.2-fold,  and as compared to March--by 1.3 percent, while prices for  consumer goods and services increased 5.8-fold and by 12.8  percent respectively.    Let us arm ourselves with patience and give some thought to  several more figures: Of the cities in our republic, with  respect to average wages Kazan was in fifth place  (R153,069--raise your hands: Who gets how much?). First is  Bugulma (R174,267), followed by Naberezhnyye Chelny, Zainsk, and  Nizhnekamsk.    If we compare the indicators of changes in the standard of  living in 1993-1994 in Tatarstan and the Russian Federation,  everything is less here than in Russia. I do not even want to  quote the figures so as not to traumatize people unnecessarily.    I do not want to add my voice to those who are yelling that  this is all the result of the treaty with Russia: We are being  robbed as before, they say. Neither does it make any sense to  contend that Tatarstan reformers are worse than Russian ones.  Apparently we have not prepared well for the stage of transition  from "soft" forms of the market to hard ones, although all this  time we have been talking of the need for such preparation. That  is, individuals have prepared, and some have learned to live for  months without pay, but the republic budget, burdened by  production decline and insolvency, has been literally brought to  its knees. As the banker T. Abdullin pointed out at the session,  we are not rich enough to continue to provide for a "soft merge"  into the market. We did so as long as we could. But President M.  Shaymiyev warned prophetically: We will end up where Russia is.  So why all of a sudden so much talk about a crisis?    And the last observation on the subject of the session  documents.    As one can see from the table we publish below, in both  republics people of the same category have more or less the same  standard of living in both republics. Financiers, those handling  the pension and insurance pie, and bureaucrats are paid well  everywhere (the latter are paid more in Russia, by the way),  while doctors, teachers, and people of science and culture are  paupers everywhere. How else can one put it, considering that  the minimum consumer budget today stands at R164,000, and their  salaries do not exceed the R130,000 mark?    Prime Minister M. Sabirov said a few days ago that this was  the first time he had heard that journalists are also not paid  much. Yes, we live like the majority of the population. A  typical salary in an editorial office is R97,600. So we have to  study the session materials most attentively--otherwise, how  will we learn whether the deputies care for our interests or  their own?

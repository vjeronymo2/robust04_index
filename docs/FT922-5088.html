			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Investigators unravel Maxwell web: Liechtenstein companies are beyond the reach of creditors and pensioners INVESTIGATORS have uncovered a number of Liechtenstein-controlled companies with links to the Maxwell family which are beyond the reach of creditors and pensioners of the collapsed Maxwell empire. One of them, Sphere Inc, a Californian computer games company, expects to have turnover of Dollars 20m (Pounds 11m) this year. Another, Pergamon Holdings (US) Inc, was used to pay Mr Kevin Maxwell, former chief executive of Maxwell Communication Corporation. Until two months ago Mr Kevin Maxwell was a director of Sphere Inc, and his sister, Ms Christine Maxwell, is still on the board. The news of the family links with at least one significant company comes less than a week before representatives of 30,000 present and former Maxwell staff, whose pension funds have lost more than Pounds 400m, march on the House of Commons to demand compensation. The companies are separate subsidiaries of the secretive Maxwell Foundation in Vaduz which was also the ultimate owner of Robert Maxwell's complex web of businesses. In addition to the Liechtenstein-controlled companies, investigators also have been examining at least one private company owned directly by members of the Maxwell family. The company, Fivetell, has been used to hold family stakes in top football clubs. According to the latest company records, Mr Ian Maxwell, former chief executive of Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), owns 51 per cent of the company. Investigators believe that last year 'substantial funds' were transferred into Pergamon Holdings (US) Inc from Maxwell companies throughout the world, including Macmillan, the US publisher and the most valuable asset of MCC. Investigators understand that one of the company's functions was to pay Mr Kevin Maxwell, a legitimate activity, and a common structure in many companies. On April 3 1992, Pergamon Holdings (US) Inc registered an interest in Mr Kevin Maxwell's house, which is believed to be worth more than Pounds 1m. Investigators are unclear whether the company had other functions, or whether it still contains assets. Their examination has been inhibited because they cannot penetrate the Liechtenstein rules of confidentiality. Robert Maxwell took an 80 per cent stake in Sphere, based in Alameda, California, in 1987. It operated as a sister company to Mirrorsoft, a UK computer games company owned by MGN, but Sphere was always owned separately. Mr Gilman Louie, the founder of the company, yesterday confirmed that he believed the ultimate ownership was in Liechtenstein. Mr Louie said this had fortunately insulated the company from the chaos surrounding the Maxwell businesses. 'We are trading as normal,' he said. Yesterday administrators said they understood that Sphere was a direct subsidiary of the Maxwell Charitable Foundation in Liechtenstein. Mr Werner Keicher, trustee of the Maxwell Foundation in Liechtenstein, confirmed there was a link between Sphere and the foundation. Because of uncertainty about future ownership Mr Louie has been talking to potential backers. Ms Christine Maxwell yesterday declined to comment on Sphere's present ownership and assets when contacted at Research on Demand, the San Francisco company of which she is director.

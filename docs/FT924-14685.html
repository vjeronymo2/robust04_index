			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls after wave of program selling Wall Street AFTER a quiet opening, US share prices tumbled in late trading yesterday on a wave of program selling and a big drop in bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25.94 at 3,152.25, near its lows for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 2.91 at 404.27, while the Amex composite eased 0.83 to 366.88 and the Nasdaq composite gave up all of its early gains to finish 1.36 lower at 569.19. Turnover on the NYSE was 184m shares. Although investors were disappointed that the Fed did not ease monetary policy after its monthly open market committee meeting on Tuesday, prices were supported yesterday by continued, if sporadic, bargain-hunting as investors went in in search of bargains after the recent sell-off. The overall mood of the market, however, remained downbeat. The Dow has lost almost 120 points in the last five trading days, and investors are reluctant to invest heavily in stocks for fear of being caught out by an unexpectedly poor third quarter reporting season, which starts next week. It was no surprise, therefore, when a combination of a big fall in bond prices and program selling pushed prices sharply lower in the last hour of trading. Among individual stocks, Ford fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 36 1/4 in busy trading after analysts at the broking houses, Bear Stearns and Salomon Brothers, cut their 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates for the car manufacturer, citing rising costs and a poor outlook for European sales. Perkin-Elmer dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 29 1/2 even though it said the acquisition of Applied Biosystems in a Dollars 330m stock-swap would not significantly dilute operating earnings in the first year. News of the takeover lifted Applied Biosystems Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 19 3/8 . The drugs sector was boosted in early trading by reports that fund managers were picking up drug stocks after their recent declines, but prices fell back with the wider market in the final hour. Among those to benefit most were Johnson &amp; Johnson, up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 45 1/2 , Pfizer, up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 72 1/2 , Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dollars  7/8 higher at Dollars 63 1/4 , and Eli Lilly, up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 60 1/8 . Federated Department Stores climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 15 after securities house Lehman Brothers raised its earnings estimate for the retailer in anticipation of better than expected September comparable-stores sales. Medtronic, in strong demand lately and approaching its 52-week high, ran into profit-taking and fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 94 5/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Premier Bancorp firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 13 3/4 after the regional banking group announced third quarter net income of 49 cents a share, up sharply from the 21 cents a share earned a year ago. Pyramid Technology fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 6 3/4 on news of cost-cutting measures which will leave the company with a fourth-quarter charge of between Dollars 22m and Dollars 24m and an overall net loss for the final period of the year. Canada TORONTO SHARES fell out of a narrow trading range late in the session to end lower. The composite index slipped 14.13 points or 0.44% to 3,215.36, with 278 declining issues against 243 advances. Volume was 33.38m shares against 28.554m and trading value was CDollars 376.7m. The mining sector showed the largest swing among the sub-groups, down 1.71% on index, while industrial products fell 1.24%.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 13 SAPA -- Jabu Moleketi, the PWV's  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] MEC [Member Executive  Committee] for economic affairs and finance, wants to develop  small business and manufacturing in the region. This would be  part of a "dynamic strategy" involving government, the private  sector and labour, he told journalists after he and nine other  people were sworn on to the PWV Executive Committee at Sandton,  north of Johannesburg, on Friday.    Mr Moloketi has already formed a strategic management  committee of people with technical know-how. His chief concerns  are a better quality of life for everyone, promoting small  business and manufacturing and increasing jobs.    Contributing 40 per cent of the country's gross domestic  product, the PWV must co-operate with the other eight provinces  and ensure its strategy complements national efforts, but not to  the detriment of the PWV, he believes.    Mr Moleketi, who matriculated in Soweto, was recruited into  Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], the African National  Congress' armed wing, in 1976. He spent about 14 years in exile  in countries including the former Soviet Union, Cuba, Angola,  Botswana, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.    Mr Moleketi returned to South Africa in November, 1990 and  was soon elected as secretary of the South African Communist  Party's PWV region, a post he still holds.</p>

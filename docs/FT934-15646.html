			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Warning on 'misleading' pay details: Fringe benefits can distort the remuneration picture painted in company reports FIGURES on directors' pay included in company annual reports substantially understate remuneration, a survey of executive pay and benefits suggests today. On average the director of a British company earns a basic salary of Pounds 92,306, but receives additional benefits in bonuses, pension contributions, company cars, insurance and other fringe benefits worth Pounds 62,428, according to the survey by Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the actuaries, and Remuneration Economics, a salary and benefits specialist. Bonuses are normally disclosed in companies' annual reports but details of fringe benefits, which can be very valuable, are rarely published. Mr Keith McNeish, a senior consultant at Bacon &amp; Woodrow, said: 'Institutional and private shareholders should be concerned about the findings because they reveal just how inaccurate and misleading it can be to rely on annual reports or salary figures alone as an indicator of directors' pay levels.' The survey covers the pay of 1,434 directors in 222 companies, and includes more than 20 FT-SE 100 companies and top building societies and insurance groups. Some directors are paid more than double their basic salary when additional benefits are taken into account, the survey says. In addition, company directors own share options worth on average an extra Pounds 298,320, or double their average annual total remuneration. 'There is a delusion that pay is all about basic salary,' said Mr McNeish, who said he was surprised by the size of overall packages. The 190 chief executives surveyed received average basic pay of Pounds 157,706 and a total package - including bonuses and benefits - worth Pounds 261,327. Their share options were worth on average an additional Pounds 619,107. The average value of benefits received by chief executives included life assurance of Pounds 4,195, company car allowance worth Pounds 14,164, private fuel allowances of Pounds 1,431, medical insurance worth Pounds 1,033, permanent health insurance of Pounds 2,312, extra holiday worth Pounds 4,587, subsidised loans of Pounds 2,581, other insurance benefits of Pounds 2,693, and pension contributions of Pounds 36,395. Pensions are the element of remuneration which varies most widely. Company contributions can vary from as little as 5 per cent of basic salary to as much as 90 per cent. Bonuses, received by two-thirds of respondents, are worth, on average, a further 16 per cent of basic salary. Overall total pay packages vary widely across regions and industries. The average package for a director in inner London amounts to Pounds 237,000 compared with Pounds 155,000 in the west Midlands and Pounds 96,000 in the east Midlands. Directors appear to be best paid in the food and drink industry, where chief executives were paid an average of Pounds 366,865 compared with 339,190 in retail and distribution, Pounds 272,851 in finance, Pounds 231,870 in chemicals, Pounds 217,585 in energy and engineering, and Pounds 210,105 in high-tech sectors. By contrast the chief executives of the seven public-sector groups in the survey were paid Pounds 99,112. More than a third of chief executives have a notice period of three years or more, and more than half the directors have a notice period of at least a year. The average basic salary received by directors increased by 6.2 per cent in the 12 months to July 1993. Only 270 received no in-crease. Directors' TRP Survey 1993. Bacon &amp; Woodrow.

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Pay deal for east German workers IG CHEMIE, Germany's chemical, paper and ceramics union, agreed to a 9 per cent wage increase for its 100,000 members in eastern Germany following arbitration talks which ended yesterday. But IG Metall, the giant engineering union, yesterday said it would start holding demonstrations throughout east Germany unless its members were promised a 26 per cent pay increase in line with its timetable for parity with western workers by 1994. IG Chemie's pay rise falls short of the union's demand for a wage increase which would match east German inflation, running at an annual rate of about 11.5 per cent, but is more than the 7.5 per cent originally offered by the employers' association. Mr Bernd Leibfried, the spokesman for IG Chemie, said the 13-month agreement, which will be backdated to February 1, would bring wages in eastern Germany's chemical sector up from 62 per cent to 70 per cent of west German levels. Last week IG Bergbau and Energie, the energy and utilities union, accepted a 9.3 per cent rise. Neither has sought income parity between east and west German workers by 1994, unlike IG Metall. In March 1991 it agreed with Gesamtmetall, the employers' association, to income parity by April of next year. But Gesamtmetall pulled out of the contract, saying economic conditions had changed. IG Metall said demonstrations would start tomorrow in the car manufacturing region of Ludwigsfelde, south-west of Berlin. The pay talks come amid rising job losses in east German industry, where employment fell by 40 per cent last year. Manufacturing and mining were the hardest hit, according to federal statistics. Employment in the sector in the whole of Germany was 9.5 per cent down in December 1992 over 1991, or from 7.46m workers to 7.12m a year before. Registered unemployment is expected to exceed 18 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`fk' report: "Bundesbank Issues Statement on Interest </F> Rates"]    [Text] With its interest rates policy, the Bundesbank sees  itself caught in a trap between the improving stability on the  economic front on the one hand and the unsteady developments in  the financial sector on the other hand. With the latest  reductions in the discount and Lombard rates, "the interest  rates horizon should be clear for the time being," according to  the Bank.    "Unlike in the United States, the climb in the value of  German securities does not reflect any definite inflation  trends," says the Bundesbank's June report. "Foreign confidence  in the stability of the mark remains unbroken. This is also  visible on foreign currency markets, in which the mark even  managed to gain in value against the dollar for a short time."    The Bundesbank attributes the rise in German long-term  interest rates over the past few months to the financial vortex  coming from the United States. In the meantime, short-term  interest rates are sinking. On account of the closer link  between interest rates in recent years, worldwide uncertainties  have materialized in the form of a "high-risk premium" for  long-term investments.    Bundesbank President Tietmayer is confident that a credible  financial policy, supported by a financial and wages policy,  "will eventually serve to overcome any unjustified rise in  long-term interest rates," although the Bundesbank report also  says that the interest on capital sums, which sank to as little  as 5.5 percent at the beginning of the year, was underestimated.    The unexpectedly strong drop in interest rates on 13 May,  involving a fall in the discount rate from 5 to 4.5 percent and  a fall in the Lombard rate from 6.5 to 6 percent, was "quite  compatible with the concept of money quantity control,"  according to the Bundesbank.    According to the June report, the strong increase in the  amount of money in circulation over the past few months (a  15.4-percent increase on an annual scale) has resulted in a  great reluctance to save money over a longer term. But the  latest drop in interest rates should encourage people to keep  less cash on hand and create more savings, says the Bundesbank.    Between January and April, total capital sums amounted to a  mere 40.8 billion marks [DM], so that the increase in  medium-term investments amounted to 6.5 percent between these  months, representing a 4 percent increase on an annual scale.  The total value of savings certificates in the nonbanking  sector fell by DM15.8 billion, while fixed-term savings plans  valid for more than four years received strong subsidies (DM22.9  billion).    The increase in credits between January and April was far  greater than last year, DM65.9 billion compared to DM45.7  billion. The Bundesbank attributed this increased demand for  credits to forthcoming reductions in tax concessions for  property. Nevertheless borrowers, fearful of higher long-term  interest rates, still tried to secure more favorable terms.</p>

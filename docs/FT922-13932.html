			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / UK Company News: Interest gain helps Proudfoot edge ahead to 'pleasing' Pounds 48m ALEXANDER PROUDFOOT, the management consultancy and staff training group, yesterday announced a slight increase in profits in spite of difficult conditions in its important North American market. The company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 48m (Pounds 46m) in the year to December 31, in line with expectations and aided by higher interest gains. Mr Neil Hamilton, finance director, said the results were 'very pleasing'. Proudfoot's order book is about 10 per cent higher than a year ago. 'We are very well positioned as the economies of the world develop,' he said. Turnover slipped slightly to Pounds 176.4m (Pounds 178.5m), mainly due to a decline in North America, where turnover fell to Pounds 58.8m (Pounds 66.8m). North America's share of total turnover slipped to 33 per cent (37 per cent). Operating profits fell to Pounds 44.2m (Pounds 45.2m). But net interest receivable rose to Pounds 3.78m (Pounds 858,000) mainly due to lower servicing costs for the company's near-Pounds 30m debt, which is largely dollar denominated. The company held net cash of Pounds 24.4m at the year-end. Last April's sale of BAS, the debt collection subsidiary, raised an extraordinary profit of Pounds 2.09m. Fully diluted earnings increased 4.8 per cent to 45.5p (43.4p). The directors recommended a final dividend of 13.5p to make a total of 19.5p (19p). Indevo, the Scandinavian consultancy acquired last September for Pounds 12m cash, made a small undisclosed contribution. Mr Hamilton said Indevo would start to perform in the second half of this year and its margins, of about 8 per cent, could be improved. COMMENT Maintaining margins around 27 per cent through a recession, as Proudfoot has managed to do, is no mean feat, even if it does prompt some clients to start asking questions. Nevertheless, Proudfoot's cautious statement about the outlook was sensible, even if such circumspection worried the market slightly. The US is not convincingly out of recession, nor are the company's main European markets of the UK, France and Germany easy to call. First-half profits are likely to be depressed by investment in new products and translation costs for existing course material, even though turnover will be lifted by a full contribution from Indevo. Full-year forecasts of Pounds 50m-Pounds 51m put the shares on a multiple of less than 8 with an attractive 7 per cent yield. They are worth holding, but potential buyers may prefer to wait until the interim stage to assess how quickly any upturn is coming through.</p>

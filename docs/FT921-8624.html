			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Construction Contracts: Residential conference facility AF BUDGE (BUILDING) has been awarded a contract in Leeds for the refurbishment and conversion (pictured) of the Grade II listed Weetwood Hall, Otley Road, Leeds into a residential conference centre. Set in nine acres of mature parkland, this development is due for completion in spring 1993, and will be finished to high standards both internally and externally. The centre will provide residential accommodation, conference and lecture rooms, banqueting suites and catering facilities for up to 150 guests. Having originally acquired the Hall in 1919 for student accommodation, the University of Leeds is now taking advantage of the growing demand for conference facilities. In a contract, worth about Pounds 5.3m, Budge will construct a three-storey stone faced extension with pitched roof and hardwood windows. The Hall, parts of which date back to 1625, will also be extensively refurbished. This includes restoration of the external stonework, listed decorative ceilings and wood panelling.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: EUROPEANS BY JANE KRAMER (PENGUIN: $10.95)  </P> <P> The polished, insightful writing in this collection of "Letter From Europe"  columns in the New Yorker provides a welcome antidote to the shallow  sensationalism that characterizes much of contemporary journalism.  </P> <P> Jane Kramer offers vivid portraits of individuals ranging from a doughty Breton  innkeeper who led the local Resistance during World War II to a self-styled  Italian psychotherapist and intellectual, currently serving a prison term in  Milan for fraud. Her analyses of current political issues, including the French  attitude toward expatriate North African workers and the controversy over the  West German government's anti-terrorist measures are well-researched and  carefully balanced. Valuable background reading for anyone planning a trip to  Europe.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEY LEADERS IN SOVIET GEORGIA OUSTED FOR FAILING TO CONTROL CLASHES THAT KILLED  19  </P> <P> The Communist Party of Georgia, in a decisive move intended to put a lid on  tensions still simmering in the republic's capital after five days of martial  law, ousted its key leaders Friday for failing to control clashes between  demonstrators and army troops that led to 19 deaths.  </P> <P> In an emergency session attended by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,  the party named the republic's KGB head as Georgia's new party chief, a post  once held by Shevardnadze himself.  </P> <P> "There is no way anyone or anything can justify the death of innocent people,"  Shevardnadze told the party meeting in a speech partially broadcast on Soviet  television. "We have now one supreme duty: to figure out the truth and exclude  forever the possibility of such a tragedy happening again."  </P> <P> The mood in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi remained tense. Troops patrolled  the streets, stopped cars at roadblocks for searches and cordoned off squares  with tanks and armored personnel carriers to prevent mass gatherings, residents  said. Foreign journalists were not permitted to visit.  </P> <P> Demonstrations in the republic's capital of 1.2 million people began last week  with protesters demanding independence from the Soviet Union. Soviet troops  invaded the republic in 1921 and it was then annexed. Georgian nationalists  contend their needs are not adequately met by the Russian-dominated government  in Moscow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deaths at Demonstration  </P> <P> The Tbilisi protests became bloody on Sunday when troops attempted to break up  a gathering in front of the republic's Government House. Sixteen people were  killed during the demonstration and three died later, according to official  figures, which listed 13 of the dead as women.  </P> <P> Most of those killed were bystanders, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman  Gennady I. Gerasimov. A government commission, which is to include members of  the public, has been appointed to investigate the tragedy.  </P> <P> Placards posted at Tbilisi State University after the clash said that Dzhumber  I. Patiashvili, the republic's Communist Party chief, was a "murderer."  </P> <P> Patiashvili, speaking on Soviet television Monday night, admitted that he  mishandled the protest, apparently by ordering troops to suppress the  demonstrators. Two days later, Patiashvili offered to resign.  </P> <P> The 49-year-old party leader was appointed in 1985 to succeed Shevardnadze. He  will be replaced by Givi G. Gumbaridze, Georgia's 45-year-old KGB chief,  Gerasimov told reporters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two Others Ousted  </P> <P> Also ousted from their party posts on the republic's ruling Politburo were  Zurab Chkheidze, chairman of the Georgian Council of Ministers, and Otar Y.  Cherkezia, president of the republic's Supreme Soviet, Gerasimov said.  </P> <P> Gerasimov said that the decisions were made after a "heated discussion" but did  not elaborate except to say that the session was attended by Shevardnadze, who  postponed a visit to East Germany to try to defuse the crisis in his native  Georgia.  </P> <P> The spokesman said that nationalist rallies in Georgia and earlier this year in  the republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan were damaging President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's efforts to reform Soviet society by permitting greater openness.  </P> <P> "These events are like sticking a dagger in the back of perestroika," he said,  referring to Gorbachev's policies of reform.  </P> <P> Gerasimov also defended the government's ban on travel to Georgia by foreign  journalists, saying: "My view is that we are providing you with enough  information so that your readers can judge the situation by themselves."  </P> <P> Radio Moscow reported Friday that 328 people had been detained in Georgia over  the last 24 hours and handed over to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Factories and public transportation were operating normally, but attendance was  down by about 50% at the city's secondary schools, the radio said.  </P> <P> A dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in effect and the army continued to hold about  66,000 hunting rifles and privately owned guns collected earlier this week.  </P> <P> About 2,000 people, many carrying black flags, marched through a central  Tbilisi street Thursday for the first funeral of one of the victims, residents  said. Additional funerals were planned for the weekend.  </P> <P> The square outside the republic's Government House apparently has spontaneously  become a memorial to the victims.  </P> <P> "There are mountains of flowers. Every day, people place fresh flowers," Leda  Archvadze, sister-in-law of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, a jailed Georgian human rights  activist, said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> The army newspaper Red Star said Friday that reports were circulating in  Tbilisi that troops who broke up the demonstration were drunk and "butchered  women and girls with military shovels." But the newspaper said doctors who had  examined some of the bodies of the victims found no signs of cuts. Gerasimov  has said that initial autopsies showed most of the victims were crushed by the  crowd.  </P> <P> Gorbachev, in a statement broadcast in Tbilisi two days ago, sharply rejected  demands that the republic be granted independence and called on the Georgians  to restore order to their republic.  </P> <P> Georgia declared independence in May, 1918, in the chaos following the 1917  Bolshevik Revolution. Moscow recognized that declaration in a treaty signed in  1920, but Soviet troops invaded in February, 1921, and took over the region.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article; part 27 in the series: "The </F> Coalition -- A Revolving Stage": "The Coalition's Tax Reform"]    [Text] On the morning of 21 December, the Social  Democratic Party of Japan's [SDPJ] Tax System Research Council  held its first meeting in the conference room of the Diet  members' office.    Chairman Ichiro Hino opened the meeting by saying: "The tax  system has become more important than ever. The party should  work out a thorough assessment."    Discussions were quietly carried on for about 90 minutes,  and  the SDPJ adopted its tax reform policy for fiscal 1994.    The SDPJ policy includes many points of interest to  industrial circles, such as a review of consumption tax  exemption for smaller businesses, maintenance of the land price  tax, and heavier taxation on nonprofit foundations. However, no  businessmen gathered around awaiting the results of the SDPJ  policy meeting, unlike that of the former ruling party -- the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Even though the SDPJ is the  largest party in the coalition, it is no more than one of the  coalition parties.    The coalition's tax reform policy is firmed up by the "tax  reform working group." As the subgroup of the conference of  secretaries of five floor groups, the working group is organized  by five Dietmen specializing in tax issues.  <H5>  Everything Is Secret </H5>   In principle, the membership and agenda of the five-man  working group have been kept "secret." In fact, however,  business circles sniffed out the existence of the group, and the  members were chased around by a large number of petitioners. A  member of the working group complained: "Even government  officials from some ministries came to us to make petitions with  business people. Nothing has changed after the LDP meltdown."    The working group is charged with examining individual  special tax laws, which stipulate favorable tax policies for  specific industrial fields. The group examines every single  special tax to determine whether it should be continued or  scrapped. The final decisions, though, are sometimes left to a  meeting of party secretaries when members cannot reach  agreement, or when the tax under debate involves a huge amount  of revenue.  <H5>  Business Leaders Wonder Who Makes the Decisions </H5>   Business circles are perplexed by the coalition's new  decisionmaking process because they have long been used to  dealing with only the LDP tax board. Business leaders wonder  "who is really in charge of compiling the coalition's tax reform  guidelines, and where should we go to make petitions."    Hajime Tsuboi, director of the National Association of Real  Estate Agents and concurrently chairman of Mitsui Real Estate  Sales Co., called on Secretary Kansei Nakano of the Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP] on the morning of 20 December. Tsuboi  asked Nakano to "scrap the heavy taxes on real estate  transactions and on owners of real estate." This was the second  time Tsuboi has petitioned Nakano, following their first meeting  in September.    Tsuboi also met Shinseito's Mamoru Nakajima and the SDPJ's  Nobuyuki Sekiyama on 7 and 10 December, respectively. It  appears Tsuboi has a strategy of meeting policymakers from all  five floor groups as frequently as possible to present his  opinions on the coalition's tax policy. However, he complained:  "Everyone understands land transactions should be further  liberalized to boost the economy, but all of them said, `the  Finance Ministry is too stubborn to give up the tax revenues'."    The association's secretariat has recently drawn up a list  of  the five party secretaries, the five members of the working  group, and seven other political figures who accept petitions,  with accompanying photographs and profiles of each. According  to an association official, nobody was familiar with the names  on the list, except for the party secretaries, until the people  had been introduced in trade journals. In fact, most never came  to public notice until the coalition took power.    On the night of 17 December, the coalition gave up plans to  submit the government's fiscal 1994 budget plan before the  year-end.    Nissan Motor Company Managing Director Heiichi Hamaoka, who  is concurrently serving as the chairman of the Japan Automobile  Manufacturers' Association [JAMA] Tax System Committee,  responded in disgust: "I am really disappointed with the  cease-fire announcement because JAMA is now ready to negotiate  with the Finance Ministry."    When the commodity tax was replaced by the consumption  tax, which imposes a 3-percent tax on every purchase, the  government left a higher tax rate of 4.5 percent only for  automobiles as a tentative measure. The 4.5-percent tax on  automobiles will expire the end of March 1994; however, the  Finance Ministry has begun to hint at seeking an extension of  the extra taxation on the pretext of revenue shortages. In  reaction, JAMA leaders have been making positive contacts with  senior leaders of the coalition parties since November,  insisting that "the tax should be lowered to 3 percent because  this is the way for the government to keep faith with industrial  circles."    Hamaoka has already met with all politicians concerned,  including the five party secretaries in charge of tax issues.  Yet, he said "I could not figure out who is the real  decisionmaker."    Shinseito has many industrial lobbyists, and the DSP is  backed by the Federation of Japan Automobile Workers' Unions.  The two parties stress "we would never submit a bill for  extending the extra taxation even if we had a big fight with the  Finance Ministry" (as noted by the DSP's Nakano).    On the contrary, the SDPJ virtually supports the extension  of  the high consumption tax for automobiles. SDPJ Secretary  Harumichi Hosoya said: "Scrapping the special tax when it  expires is favorable from a political viewpoint. But we  probably cannot afford to do that under the present financial  situation." Also, Komeito shows understanding of the Finance  Ministry position, noting that, "If the tax rate for automobiles  is lowered to 3 percent, tax revenues would decline 100 billion  yen."  <H5>  Taxation Is Politics </H5>   Under the LDP ruling, the Finance Ministry has been leaving  the decision on scrapping and continuing individual special  taxes to the LDP tax board -- at least in its official posture.  At that time, ministry opinions were conveyed to the LDP  through the government's advisory Tax System Research Council.    Unlike the preceding years, the fiscal 1994 budget is being  compiled under the Finance Ministry Tax Bureau's direct control.  The new "budget compilation system" estimates budget allotments  at the Tax Bureau's initiative, while expectations of business  circles are probed through the appropriate ministries. When  coalition parties cannot agree with each other on specific  issues, the Finance Ministry's judgment becomes heavier.    Nevertheless, the Finance Ministry has its concerns. A  middle-ranking Tax Bureau official noted: "Nobody complained  about the LDP tax board's final decision. But we no longer have  such a barrier. Since tax-related decisions involve much  political judgment, I am not confident that bureaucrats are able  to assume all the responsibilities for next year's taxation."    The 1994 tax reform agenda was postponed when the coalition  government gave up the completion of the fiscal 1994 budget plan  before year-end. Both the coalition and the bureaucrats will  have to keep groping in the dark.</p>

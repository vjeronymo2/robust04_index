			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Pavel Bogdanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- During Vietnamese Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet's planned visit to Moscow in June, most  probably a package of important intergovernmental agreements  will be signed. The documents will regulate economic cooperation  and political relations between the two countries, a  high-ranking source in the Russian Foreign Ministry told  ITAR-TASS.    The head of the Vietnamese Government will pay his first  visit to Moscow after the disintegration of the Soviet Union.  It is considered an important landmark in bilateral relations  in the Russian Foreign Ministry.    According to the Foreign Ministry source, during talks with  the Vietnamese prime minister discussions will be held on the  prospects of broadening Russia's interaction with Vietnam, a  traditional ally of Moscow in the Asia-Pacific region.    The diplomat emphasised that the two countries are  "successfully coordinating their political steps in the  Asia-Pacific region. Useful exchange of views had taken place  during meetings between heads of foreign affairs department of  the two countries in lobbies of two ASEAN (Association of South  East Asian Nations) summits. On a majority of issues positions  of the two states coincide or are close, the diplomat added.</p>

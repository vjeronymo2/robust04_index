			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Business and the Law: Role of the outsider - Changes in US corporate governance and case law In the world of US corporate governance, outside directors appear to be taking control of large public companies away from the erstwhile imperial chief executive officer. Two of the more striking examples are General Motors and IBM. There appear to be several reasons for this change. First, courts are becoming much tougher on company directors. Good examples are the Delaware Supreme Court opinions in Cede &amp; Co v Technicolor Inc1, Paramount Communications Inc v QVC Network Inc2, and Kahn v Lynch Communication Systems Inc3. In each case, the defendants were board members of a company which had agreed to an acquisition by a favoured buyer. The Delaware Supreme Court had some fairly hard words for directors whose decisions are not entirely independent. Opinions of this kind spur directors to assert their independence from the chief executive officer, and from a controlling shareholder, when there is one. Pressure on boards from institutional investors is also an important factor. Courts and institutional shareholders have also been highly influenced by the commentary of academic lawyers, economists and a better informed financial press on the role directors should play in corporate governance. On many corporate governance reforms, the US appears to be ahead of the European Union. Compensation and audit committees consisting of outside directors are the rule in public companies. Nominating (or corporate governance) committees of outside directors, which control the selection of directors, are becoming widespread. On the other hand, in the US, the positions of CEO and chairman of the board are usually still combined. However, the idea of a lead director, around whom the outside directors can mobilise when the CEO is also chairman of the board, is catching on. For example, although at present GM has an outside chairman of the board, the concept of a lead director is the second item on its new, widely publicised board guidelines on significant corporate governance issues. It remains unclear what effect these changes have had on corporate performance. Unfriendly takeovers, the primary testing ground for corporate governance, in the 1980s have declined, primarily for economic reasons. However, it is possible that one reason for the decline could be improved corporate governance, as directors reorganise companies before an overt takeover threat. But since many of these reorganisations have come late in the day, after the companies have suffered a great deal of damage, it is hard to view them as clear evidence of the new effectiveness of outside directors. Bad laws The US legal system remains a big problem. For a long time, it has been suffocating under an accumulation of bad laws, and this state of affairs is becoming worse. It is relatively easy to pass a new law in the US, but almost impossible to eliminate an existing bad one. Bad laws of any importance quickly develop a devoted following of powerful pressure groups who benefit greatly from them. The general public usually is relatively indifferent, not organised and ineffective. This is a crucial problem, since a large proportion of laws in any society inevitably turns out to be bad. Courts provide some help in limiting the damage from bad laws, but not enough. One aggravating factor in the US is the constitutional right to trial by jury, combined with the reluctance of courts to dismiss legally weak cases at an early stage, before a jury trial. The result is that defendants must often settle for large sums or face the risk of even larger damages in a jury trial, possibly trebled under some statutes or with punitive damages added. An extreme example of such a dangerous statute, where the courts have not helped as much as they should, is RICO, the federal treble-damage racketeering law. Congress has not eliminated or modified RICO, because it is a favourite of plaintiffs' lawyers, who are a powerful political pressure group. However, in Reves v Ernst &amp; Young4, the US Supreme Court took an important but cautious step to rein in this absurd statute. The court held that Ernst &amp; Young did not conduct or participate in the management of an auditing client through a pattern of racketeering activity when it reported a key asset of the client at a highly inflated value. However, the court is probably barred by its own precedents from what might to an outsider appear an obvious commonsense idea, that auditors are not racketeers. But in Central Bank of Denver v First Interstate Bank of Denver5, the US Supreme Court was a little more daring. Overturning many years of lower court precedent, the court held there is no aiding and abetting liability under section 10(b) and rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, on the ground that the language of the statute does not cover giving aid to a person who commits a fraudulent act. Since section 10(b) and rule 10b-5 are the heart of federal securities anti-fraud law, the case may be helpful to accountants, lawyers and other service organisations such as banks and investment banks, who are the natural targets of aiding and abetting allegations in litigation. And in Honda Motor Co v Oberg6, the US Supreme Court released a favourable signal on punitive damages. The court held unconstitutional, as a deprivation of the federal constitutional right to procedural due process, an unusual Oregon constitutional provision, which prohibits judicial review of a jury's award of punitive damages unless the reviewing court can affirmatively say there is no evidence to support the award. Although, because of the unusual nature of the Oregon constitutional provision, the Supreme Court's decision is narrow, some of the language in the court's opinion offers encouraging signs that the court may be getting ready to cope with some of the many problems of jury awards of punitive damages. Contingent fees Contingent fee litigation continues to be an important and deeply embedded element of the US legal system. In the ordinary small litigation of individuals, the contingent fee system appears to work reasonably well. But in shareholder class actions, for example, lawyers usually have the only real economic interest on the plaintiffs' side. In fact, lawyers usually own 100 per cent of these cases, since shareholders' interests in the claims are generally dispersed and small. Lawyers in the US have some intimidating governmental powers. The most important of these powers is an almost unlimited right to discover facts, including the interrogation of witnesses at depositions. In theory, courts regulate and control these powers but, in fact, they do very little. Thus a combination of right to trial by jury, lawyers' governmental powers, the intense self-interest of plaintiffs' lawyers in the outcome of high stake litigation and the possibility of treble or punitive damages has created a potent anti-social mixture. Lawyers themselves are now becoming victims of the system. They are defendants in contingent fee litigation almost as often as accountants. But the plaintiffs' lawyers who are beneficiaries of the system are a much more focused and better organised group than the victims. There is therefore little sign of change. 1 634 A2d 345 (1993). 2 637 A2d 34 (1993). 3 638 A2d 1110 (1994). 4 113 S Ct. 1163 (1993). 5 114 S Ct. 1439 (1994). 6 62 USLW 4627 (Jun 24 1994).

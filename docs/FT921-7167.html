			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Observer: Musing? Observer is offering a bottle of the finest malt whisky to the first reader who knows why the following chorus is now echoing round the streets of Aachen - and can elucidate all pertinent references: Gremium, gremium, Epithalamium, Soon you'll be married, And tra-la-la: Vorstand with Vorstand Will grow e'er more rotund, Your stock is not votund, But tant pis, ca va.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Alliance Resources lifts Valentine stake Alliance Resources, the US-based oil and gas company, is paying Dollars 780,000 (Pounds 503,000) in shares to increase its presence in the Louisiana Valentine field. The group announced it would issue 7.5m new shares and waive Dollars 161,000 in debt in return for a further 5.75 per cent interest in the oil and gas field. The deal will bring Alliance's working interest in all production from the Valentine field to 65.5 per cent and result in a 99.75 per cent interest in the undeveloped portion. The vendor is Progas, a US gas marketing company with which Alliance is negotiating to pre-sell part of the gas production from the Valentine field.</p>

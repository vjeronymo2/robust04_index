			<p>BFN     [Text] Two bus-loads of Kosovo Albanian asylum-seekers  deported from Sweden have been stopped by authorities at the  Serbian border. It's the third time deported Kosovo Albanians  from Sweden have been refused entry into Serbia in the last few  weeks. Swedish authorities say Belgrade is violating human  rights by refusing its own citizens entry into the country.</p>

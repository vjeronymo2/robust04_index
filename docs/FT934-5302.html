			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Polaroid scare sends silver price tumbling Silver lost 6 1/2 per cent of its value in a bout of hectic trading that sent the price plunging 30 cents a troy ounce in New York yesterday after a brief announcement that the Polaroid Corporation had developed a silver-free photographic process. The precious metals markets were very nervous after a four-day Thanksgiving holiday in the US and gold and platinum took their cues from silver, each dropping Dollars 9 an ounce at one stage. All three metals recovered slightly and steadied by the close in London. Silver ended 15 cents down at Dollars 4.51 1/2 an ounce; gold was down Dollars 5.75 at Dollars 371.25 an ounce; and platinum closed Dollars 6 down at Dollars 368.75. Silver's reaction to the Polaroid announcement was considerably overdone, suggested Mr George Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers. The full story showed Polaroid was moving further into the medical X-ray business and would begin testing larger prints for its Helios dry-process laser imaging system for medical applications. He said X-rays accounted for less than 8 per cent of silver consumption 'and this will affect only a small part of the X-ray market'. Consequently, this was less important than the Xerox Corporation announcement about a silver-free film for the graphic arts market on November 1 - which also sent silver prices spiralling downwards - and would have a discernable impact on 10 per cent of the market. Mr Milling-Stanley suggested silver might dip a little more before the year end, moving to Dollars 4.50 or even Dollars 4.25 an ounce. Gold was unlikely to break out of its present trading range between Dollars 360 and Dollars 385 an ounce.</p>

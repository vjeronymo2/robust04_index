			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bayer plans generic drugs businesses Bayer, the German drugs and chemicals company, is planning to set up a chain of businesses around the world to sell unbranded, generic drugs. Generics is one of the fastest growing segments of the pharmaceuticals business. Bayer is creating a joint venture with US generics specialist Schein. This is the first large deal with Schein since Bayer paid Dollars 310m for a 28.3 per cent stake in March. Mr David Ebsworth, head of Bayer's worldwide business operations, said the joint venture would 'be the basis of a global generics busi-ness'. He said that the six months since the stake was taken had showed there was a need for 'dedicated manpower' to take Schein from its US base to other countries. Initially, 10 to 15 people would be employed by the joint venture including specialists in the launch and marketing of drugs and in finding new products. Schein already has a portfolio of more than 400 products, and is especially strong in central nervous system and heart drugs. Mr Ebsworth said the company would make a priority of finding new antibiotics to manufacture and sell.</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Flow slows to a trickle After a hectic start to the year, the flow of new issues by investment and unit trusts has slowed to a trickle, although this could be viewed as a return to normal following a period of unprecedented activity, writes Bethan Hutton. The amount of money raised by investment trust new issues in the first few months of 1994 has already outpaced the amount raised in the whole of 1993 - Pounds 2.2bn, compared to Pounds 1.5bn. But most of the 1994 total was pulled in during January and February before a rise in US interest rates triggered falls in world stock markets. Since then investors have been noticeably more reluctant to put more money into equities, while fund managers are finding it harder to raise new money. Another reason for the slowdown is the passing of the Pep deadline for the 1993-94 tax year. Investors often wait until close to that before using up their allowances, so many fund managers time their offerings for the last few months of the tax year. It is logical, therefore, that the majority of recent new trusts are non-Pepable, focusing mostly on the Far East and emerging markets elsewhere. Japan is now the area drawing the most attention.</p>

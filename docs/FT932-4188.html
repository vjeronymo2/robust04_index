			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Sizeable premium expected for Quayle Munro debut TRADING IN Quayle Munro Holdings, a small Edinburgh-based merchant bank with a portfolio of holdings in unquoted companies, begins on the main market today. Analysts believe that the shares will rise to a substantial premium. The bank is coming to the market via an introduction by Williams de Broe. It follows a reverse takeover of Quayle Munro by East of Scotland Industrial Investments, the unquoted investment company which Quayle Munro manages. The shares will be quoted initially at 118p per share, which implies a market capitalisation of Pounds 4.74m. The company will have net worth of about Pounds 6m, of which Pounds 4m is in unquoted investments and the rest in cash and listed securities. Analysts believe that the discount to net asset value will narrow and that investors will also be attracted by the high dividend yield. The company will pay an interim dividend of 3p next month and another 3p in October; and in future will pay interim and final dividends in a ratio of one third to two thirds. Assuming the interim dividend is maintained that implies that next year's final will be 6p, making 9p in all. Analysts believe the shares could go to a premium of more than 20 per cent. Quayle Munro was founded in 1983 by Mr Ian Jones and Mr Michael Munro. It advises quoted companies such as Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste disposal group, and Pittencrieff, the oil company. It worked for the Scottish Office on privatising the Scottish Bus Group and recently advised it on the possible privatisation of Scotland's water and sewerage services. Mr Jones, chief executive, explained that one aim of the transaction with East of Scotland Industrial Investments was to give shareholders an exit route at a smaller discount to net asset value than was available under the old structure. The deal involves repaying about Pounds 10m of capital. 'Quayle Munro will be unusual in being both a merchant bank and an investment banking house,' said Mr Jones. 'There will be two kinds of play - fee income and capital performance.'</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Former Kentucky Gov. John Y. Brown Jr. underwent quadruple-bypass heart surgery  and was in critical condition in an intensive-care unit, said a spokeswoman at  Humana Hospital Audubon in Louisville. Brown, 55, had been in good spirits  Wednesday, the day before the surgery, and spent part of the day with his wife,  former "CBS Morning News" host Phyllis George Brown, according to a statement  released by hospital spokeswoman Denise Damron. Brown had undergone  triple-bypass heart surgery in 1983 at the end of his four-year term as  governor and developed serious lung complications. He withdrew from the  senatorial race in 1984 because of health considerations.  </P></p>

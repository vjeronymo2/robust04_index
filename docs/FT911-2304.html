			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Maghreb rivals look to future: UN-backed referendum signals peace for Western Sahara BOTH parties to the conflict over the status of the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara, Morocco and the Polisario Liberation Front, have made concessions - especially, it seems, Polisario and its main ally Algeria. This made it possible for the UN Security Council on Monday to agree proposals for a referendum, drawn up by Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary-general. Under the plan, Morocco will cut its troops by two-thirds, to 65,000, within 11 weeks of a ceasefire. All remaining Moroccan troops will be confined to defensive positions along the protective wall Morocco has built to defend itself from Polisario guerrilla attacks. Polisario's estimated 7,000 fighters will also be confined to camps around the main refugee centre south of Tindouf, in south-western Algeria. However, the existing Moroccan administration will remain, contrary to Polisario's initial wishes. Considerations of cost strongly militated against a UN take-over of the administration of the territory before a referendum. An election commission is to decide who is eligible to vote in the referendum which a force of 2,000 UN peacekeepers will supervise. Morocco's King Hassan has accepted the idea of a referendum but said the result could only 'ratify' what most Moroccans strongly felt was theirs. President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria has gone to great lengths to rebuild links with Morocco, notably by re-establishing diplomatic ties, broken off in 1976, three years ago. But the outcome of the first-ever free elections in North Africa, due next July in Algeria, could bring to power people far less willing to compromise. Furthermore, Morocco and Algeria know that the pipeline project to carry natural gas to Spain, across northern Morocco and the Straits of Gibraltar, will be given a big impetus if the north African countries settle the dispute.</p>

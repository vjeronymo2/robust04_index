In a news conference at the Arab League headquarters this  evening, al-Sahhaf called on the UN Security Council to lift the  embargo against Iraq now that the country has met its  obligations on the destruction of weapons of mass destruction.    He said Security Council procrastinations in this regard are  a kind of political pressure applied by the member states,  especially the United States, against Iraq to overthrow  President Saddam Husayn.    He noted differences among the Security Council's permanent  members on the removal of the boycott. He explained that  France, China, and Russia support lifting the embargo.    The Iraqi foreign minister said the Iraqi people are  suffering diseases, epidemics, and food and medicine shortages.  He said his country cannot import food and medicine because of  a lack of finances. This causes large numbers of children and  elderly to die daily, he said.    On Kuwaiti captives and detainees in Iraq, al-Sahhaf  stressed  that not one Kuwaiti is imprisoned in Iraq. He said that all  prisoners from all nationalities were released through the  International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] at the end of  the war.    He said Iraq is cooperating with the Arab League to solve  this problem. We invited popular committees from the Kuwaiti  parliament to see the facts for themselves but the Kuwaitis  rejected the offer, he said.    He said Iraq is prepared to provide all facilities to the  ICRC, the Arab League, the Gulf states, and any other Arab  country to solve this problem.    He said Iraq's relations with the Gulf states, especially  Oman, Qatar, and Bahrain, are good. He said Iraq's relations  with the United Arab Emirates have not been broken off either.</p>

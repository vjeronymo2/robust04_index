			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / M and S decides to open on Sundays Marks and Spencer, and the John Lewis Partnership, two of the stalwarts in the campaign against seven-day-a-week trading, yesterday announced their plans to open on Sunday. The new Sunday trading law, which comes into effect at the end of next month, means that shops will be allowed to open legally for at least six hours on a Sunday. Current restrictions are widely flouted, with about 145,000 shops ignoring the 1950 Shops Act. Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of M and S, told the company's annual general meeting yesterday: 'There are clearly a number of places where all the neighbouring retailers will now open on Sunday, and in order to satisfy customer needs, and protect our share of the market, we will open in those locations.' M and S would open 'most, if not all' of its stores on Sundays throughout the December Christmas trading period and, beyond that, would 'continue to evaluate the situation', he said. Separately, the John Lewis Partnership said it would open 19 of its 108 Waitrose supermarket branches on Sundays from September 4. The current illegal Sunday opening by competitors was costing the company Pounds 1m a week, it said. John Lewis was originally part of the Keep Sunday Special Campaign, which was also backed by the main churches, while M and S was active in the Retailers for Shops Act Reform. The two groups joined forces in November last year in a failed attempt to limit deregulation in England and Wales - Scotland is already fully deregulated. A campaigner against Sunday trading yesterday won the right to bring private prosecutions against superstores that open on Sundays. Two High Court judges ruled that Mr Roy Edey was entitled to launch such actions after Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, declined to intervene. However, Lord Justice Butler Sloss and Mr Justice Macpherson added that, in view of changes in the law, magistrates 'may not regard the offences disclosed as being particularly serious'.

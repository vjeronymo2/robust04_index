			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Arts: Don Giovanni - Theatre Royal, Glasgow The last time Scottish Opera tried its hand at Don Giovanni it came up with a bizarre show featuring a Giovanni who flounced around the stage like some self-regarding Oscar Wilde so in love with himself that he hardly had time to think about women at all. It did not last long. Now the company has returned to the opera and on Wednesday at the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, it unveiled its new production, produced and designed by Tom Cairns. This is a staging which at least looks good. A series of abstract designs, mostly curtains slashed by swords or backdrops with suggestively-shaped openings, makes a stylish visual impact, not least in the graveyard scene with its window out on to an unearthly world. There are also a few symbols brought into play. A crimson pool of light represents spilt blood; a sword thrust into the ground marks the call to vengeance. In the finale a giant hand beckons Giovanni to hell and a pair of wings sticks up out of his dining-room floor. Or were they bananas or phallic symbols? By this point the symbolism was getting obscure. And why, incidentally, was the final sextet truncated with no explanation? Unfortunately it will be clear by now that this is one of those productions which poses more questions than it answers. Little interest is shown in the characters or in getting the drama to come alive. For example, when Giovanni starts to seduce Zerlina, no feeling of sensuality envelops the stage, and for that the blame must be shared between Cairns and the conductor, Robert Dean, a noted Don Giovanni himself at Glyndebourne, but not regrettably a vivid interpreter with the baton. In the end the sets have the colour, the depth of perspective, the subtlety of atmosphere. Everything that goes on within them is one-dimensional, grey, uninvolving. We know from several other productions that Steven Page can be an effective Don Giovanni, but here he makes little impression. Gidon Saks's Leporello is not sharp enough of wit; David Gwynne needs better intonation as the Commendatore. Glenn Winslade repeats his trusted Don Ottavio. As Masetto, Meurig Davies is sunk in his aria by flabby playing from the pit. That is an endemic feature of the evening and the sense that the singers as a team needed a stronger guiding hand may explain why the women, too, make a limited effect. Virginia Kerr is the creditable Donna Elvira and Linda McLeod as Donna Anna wields her sword like a true Valkyrie, though she exited after her first aria sounding exhausted by the trial of singing Mozart. Rosemary Joshua alone comes away unscathed, a lyric and appealing Zerlina. The production is further holed below the water-line by an uncomfortably banal rhyming translation, which has Leporello listing 'strumpets and crumpets' in his catalogue, and some strange choreography by Aletta Collins. The last dance at Giovanni's party seemed to involve each guest sticking a forefinger up his partner's nostril, which may or may not have been symbolic. What to do with this Don Giovanni? The best course would seem to be yet another new production as soon as possible and then these stylish designs could be used for some other opera. Almost any other would do, in fact. And that, I fear, is ultimately half the problem. Theatre Royal, Glasgow 041-332 9000 until 3 June, then on tour. Production sponsored by The Foundation for Sport and the Arts.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PLAYS CATCH UP ON GOLF COURSES  </P> <P> Orange County mattress magnate Wayne Simmons plans to drive from his Anaheim  Hills residence to Dana Point every other week this summer to play golf at the  Links at Monarch Beach, shunning a country club located much closer to his  home.  </P> <P> Simmons, owner of W. Simmons Mattress Co. in Cerritos, says it doesn't bother  him a bit to fight freeway traffic for 45 minutes and pay the highest green  fees in Orange County -- $50 on weekdays, $75 on weekends -- to play a  first-class course with two holes right on the ocean.  </P> <P> There are plenty of people who share Simmons' enthusiasm, and their apparent  willingness to play golf at nearly any cost is prompting developers to  transform hundreds of acres of valuable land in Orange County into upscale golf  courses.  </P> <P> At least 12 new golf courses are being planned or built in Orange County, most  in conjunction with expensive south county housing developments. Their  completion will increase the number of public and private courses in the county  to 44.  </P> <P> The new facilities are billed as premier courses, designed by golfing  luminaries and architects such as Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Robert Trent  Jones Jr., Tom Fazio, Tom Weiskopf, Jay Morrish and Ted Robinson. And all will  cost much more to play than most golfers are accustomed to paying.  </P> <P> An increasing number of golfers and a limited supply of courses has sparked a  golf course construction spree across the country. Developer interest has been  stoked by higher fees, which make operating courses more lucrative than in the  past.  </P> <P> Contributing to the boom in Southern California is the ability to use golf  courses to satisfy open space mandates and the recognition that the presence of  golf courses will increase adjoining property values.  </P> <P> From 1970 through 1988, the number of golfers in the United States more than  doubled to 23.4 million from 11.2 million, according to the National Golf  Foundation. The national golfing population is expected to expand to 30 million  by the year 2000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lagged Behind in Construction  </P> <P> The foundation believes that demand is sufficient to support construction of  400 or more golf courses annually between now and the year 2000. Only 211 new  courses were opened in 1988. Golf, which seemed to take a back seat to tennis  as the "in" sport of the early 1970s, is enjoying a resurgence in the 1980s.  The national tennis population has fallen to 20 million from a peak of 40  million in the late 1970s, according to the American Tennis Foundation.  </P> <P> The change is generally attributed to the aging of America's baby boomers, many  of whom are now looking for less strenuous forms of recreation that also offer  social and professional payoffs.  </P> <P> Orange County, with an estimated 214,000 golfers, long has lagged behind other  areas in construction of new golf courses. National Golf Foundation statistics  show that in 1987, the county had 4,653 golfers for each 18-hole course. That  compared to 3,620 golfers per 18 holes statewide and 2,056 golfers per 18 holes  nationally. California had the fewest courses per capita of any state in the  nation.  </P> <P> The demand in Orange County is dramatized by the long lines that form every day  before dawn outside of pro shops at lower-cost public courses. Early rising is  a required regimen for golfers who stand in line not to play that day, but to  make reservations for a week later.  </P> <P> The new courses are expected to attract golfers who want to escape the jammed  municipal courses and are willing to pay more for some elbow room at the  upscale facilities. The new courses also claim that they will be a cut above  most municipal courses in quality.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High Fees  </P> <P> Gene Krekorian, senior vice president of Economic Research Associates in Los  Angeles, said no one in Orange County is building the kind of golf course that  is needed most: those with fees of $10 to $15. Even so, he said, there are  plenty of golfers who will support the more expensive courses.  </P> <P> By traditional standards, the new courses are certainly pricey.  </P> <P> At the Tustin Ranch Golf Course, an undulating expanse of manicured turf,  pools, waterfalls and 2,000 trees that is making its debut Monday, golfers will  be asked to pay $45 on weekdays and $60 on weekends.  </P> <P> Charges at Tijeras Creek Golf Course, scheduled to open next summer in the  developing foothill community of Rancho Santa Margarita, are expected to run  about $25 on weekdays and $50 on weekends.  </P> <P> And two public golf courses that the Irvine Co. plans to develop along the  coast just south of Corona Del Mar as part of a resort project are expected to  top the $50 and $75 fees at the Links at Monarch Beach, currently the county's  most expensive course.  </P> <P> With fees like these, developers can not only recover all of their development  costs but also pay for part of the land underlying the course, said Krekorian.  </P> <P> Some developers, however, have no interest in operating golf courses and plan  to recapture their costs by turning the courses into private clubs and selling  memberships at prices that would have seemed astonishing only a few years ago.  </P> <P> Initiation fees for memberships in the new private courses range from $8,500 at  Pacific Golf Club in San Clemente to $75,000 at Marbella Golf &amp; Country  Club in San Juan Capistrano. In addition, members must pay monthly dues in the  hundreds of dollars.  </P> <P> Despite the high cost, memberships are selling briskly. Although the golf  course and clubhouse at Marbella have yet to open, all but 52 of 300 club  memberships have been sold, said Ken Olson, corporate broker for the  developers. And at Pacific Golf Club, memberships are being snapped up at a  rate of 50 a month, according to Bob Hayward, general manager of the 27-hole  course.  </P> <P> In some cases, cities are encouraging the development of public golf courses.  Jay Pierce, director of land development for an Irvine Co. subsidiary that is  developing Tustin Ranch, said the Tustin City Council insisted on construction  of a showcase public golf course as part of the 9,000-home community.  </P> <P> "We wouldn't have been able to build houses out there if it weren't for the  golf course," Pierce said.  </P> <P> Christine Singleton, Tustin's community development director, conceded that  fees at the new course will be too rich for the blood of some Tustin residents.  Even so, she said, the city is getting a free golf course that is "far better  than what the city could afford to construct."  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Open Space  </P> <P> Although Orange County planning officials will not let developers substitute  golf courses for required parkland in planned community developments, they will  count courses toward general open space requirements. To that extent, the  courses wind up generating revenue from land that would not be developed  otherwise.  </P> <P> Eric Jessen, chief of planning and acquisition for Orange County Harbors,  Beaches and Parks, said the county planning commission has shown "a strong  interest in golf courses."  </P> <P> Jessen said that in return for giving developers open space credit for golf  courses, the county in recent years has begun filing deed restrictions to be  sure that the courses will be retained forever as open space and not later  converted to housing.  </P> <P> In areas where land proposed for a golf course is flat and easily buildable,  Jessen said, the county generally gets more open space than it otherwise could  have demanded from a developer.  </P> <P> But as a rule, golf courses are not built because of the green fees they will  generate or the open space requirements they will satisfy. Krekorian said the  most compelling economic incentive is the opportunity to increase the prices of  lots and homes in surrounding communities, especially those directly  overlooking the fairway.  </P> <P> "The reason they do it is for the real estate premiums that in many cases more  than make up the cost of the land being used for the golf course," Krekorian  said. "You can't afford to buy a piece of property and build a golf course and  (expect to) make money. You need to do it as part of an overall community  development."  </P> <P> Garth Chambers, developer of the Dove Canyon community in southeastern Orange  County, figures that his costs for golf course development include $6 million  for the land, $6 million for construction of the course, $12 million for the  clubhouse and $3 million to subsidize the private club until it is  self-supporting. He said that if the state Department of Corporations approves  his plan to sell 479 golf club memberships for $60,000 each, he will reap a  very modest profit on his $27 million investment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Water Features  </P> <P> But Chambers said he expects that the private country club atmosphere created  by the golf course will add 30% to average property values within the  1,300-home community.  </P> <P> According to real estate sales people, home buyers cherish a view of a golf  course second only to an ocean view. A home by a fairway often will sell for  $50,000 to $300,000 more than the same model home just out of sight of the golf  course, they said.  </P> <P> "If a unit is directly on the golf course, the typical premium is about 20% of  the base price. So if it were a $400,000 single-family home, it would get a  $80,000 premium for the course," said Ken Agid, a national real estate  marketing analyst.  </P> <P> The size of the golf course premium, marketing experts said, also depends on  whether the golf course is private and has water features.  </P> <P> "If you add water, they will pay an additional premium," said Ted Robinson, a  Laguna Beach golf course architect who designed the new courses in Santa  Margarita and Tustin.  </P> <P> "For every dollar spent on waterscapes, we will get $3 to $4 in increased real  estate values," said Robinson, who specializes in "babbling brooks and  waterfalls."  </P> <P> At Marbella, sales of lots over the past year have been at least as hot as  sales of golf club memberships. "We had 215 lots for sale, and they are all  gone but for five. People love to live on golf courses," said J. Richard (Rick)  McMichael, president of Fairway Land Co., a Laguna Niguel firm that is creating  the exclusive golf community with two Bay Area developers.  </P> <P> McMichael noted that home buyers don't seem discouraged by the company's  warnings that living near a golf course can pose dangers from errant golf  balls.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Essential to Resorts  </P> <P> Even before Coto de Caza has enough golf club members to support one golf  course, the developer of the fashionable community is planning a second course  to open in mid-1991. The reason, said John Yelverton, president of the  California division of Arvida, which is developing the project with Chevron  Land Development Co., is to provide more golf course settings for more lots. He  said a golf course view adds $60,000 to $90,000 to the price tag of each  buildable lot.  </P> <P> Nor does living on golf courses appeal only to golfers. "Typically, 75% of the  buyers in a golf course-oriented community do not belong to the club or play  golf," said Agid. "Twenty-five percent of the buyers are attracted by the open  space and manicured setting, and another 50% by the associated benefits, such  as the prestige and future real estate values."  </P> <P> Golf courses are deemed essential to south Orange County's bid to become a  major destination resort area.  </P> <P> The Monarch Beach course is important to the nearby Ritz-Carlton Hotel and will  be a big draw for two other hotels that are planned on its perimeter. In tandem  with the new hotel projects, Townsend said, the golf course will be expanded  and redesigned.  </P> <P> Henry Scheilein, general manager of the Ritz Carlton, said he dearly values an  agreement that reserves for the hotel half of the Monarch Beach tee-off times.  "A resort couldn't label itself a resort without a golf course," he said.  </P> <P> Moreover, Scheilein said, many of his hotel guests are Japanese businessmen who  are "wild about golf."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DIVISION I GIRLS;  </P> <P> MIRA MESA SHOOTS 10% IN LOSS TO POINT LOMA  </P> <P> The story line for Saturday's sloppy San Diego Section Division I girls'  basketball championship -- or, more appropriately, the Betty Crocker Game of  the Day (41 turnovers were produced) -- was set by halftime.  </P> <P> And by game's end, the theme was clear.  </P> <P> Mira Mesa made just three field goals. Three.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, Point Loma won the title, 44-25, at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> What was surprising was that Mira Mesa, after making just one first-half field  goal, trailed by just four at halftime, 16-12. And for all intents and  purposes, the Marauders were in the game until the end of the third quarter.  </P> <P> But the final numbers were haunting: Mira Mesa was three of 30 from the field  (10%). The Marauders made more three-point attempts (two) than two-point  attempts (one). And pestered by a tight Point Loma man-to-man defense  throughout, they turned the ball over 25 times.  </P> <P> "It was an ugly, ugly game, but it was a great defensive game for us," Point  Loma Coach Lee Trepanier said. "They had no man-to-man offense, which was  really too bad because they're a better team than that."  </P> <P> Indeed, when unguarded, Mira Mesa shot very well: 17 of 22 from the free throw  line (77%). That's why the Marauders were able to hang with Point Loma as long  as they did. Tweet Castillo made a three-point shot and a two-pointer, and  Carrie Carambas added another three-pointer. Other than that, it was all free  throws.  </P> <P> Mira Mesa Coach Gary Blevins was at a loss to explain.  </P> <P> "We took a lot of shots, they just wouldn't fall for us," he said. "Point Loma  was very aggressive, so we shot a lot of free throws. But the other shots just  rolled off the rim for us."  </P> <P> Point Loma wasn't all that much better. The Pointers were 17 of 54 (32%) from  the field and seven of 15 (47%) from the free throw line.  </P> <P> But Point Loma had Monica Filer, a slick 5-foot-6 point guard, to direct the  offense and Tyeast Brown, an aggressive 6-0 center, to control the inside.  Filer was the game's leading scorer with 20 points, and Brown grabbed 21  rebounds to go with 10 points.  </P> <P> "I was real nervous," Filer said. "I didn't settle down until halfway through  the first quarter."  </P> <P> Chris Drumm added 10 points for Point Loma.  </P></p>

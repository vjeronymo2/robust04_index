			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / People: Pizza Hut Pizza Hut UK has found a replacement marketing director for Paula Vennells, who first was and then later wasn't going to join from Dixons in the same capacity, before she decided that a job with Sears offered better prospects. The new marketing director will be Peter Maslen, a 42-year-old Australian, who has been with the group for two years. Before this latest post he was vice-president and general manager of Pepsico restaurants, east Europe. Maslen spent 16 years from 1976 with Mars before joining Pizza Hut. He held a wide range of marketing, sales and manufacturing posts with Mars; his ultimate job with the company was regional director and general manager in Asia.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Strange alliances in the water wars: Players from France, Italy and Switzerland are drawn to the drama over Perrier's ownership Even by French standards, where the intricate webs of corporate holdings and cross-holdings recall the incestuous sub-plots and shifting alliances of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, the machinations over the ownership of Source Perrier, the world's biggest mineral water group, are unusually tortuous. Yesterday the saga took a turn when Nestle of Switzerland, the world's largest food manufacturer, joined forces with Banque Indosuez, a powerful Parisian bank, to mount a FFr13.24bn (Pounds 1.36bn) bid for Perrier. The bid comes only a few weeks after Ifint, an investment vehicle of the Italian Agnelli family, made a FFr5.6bn offer for Exor, the wine and property group which controls 35 per cent of Perrier. On the face of it, the latest turn of events has pitted two of Europe's most powerful business empires into head-to-head confrontation and split the French financial establishment down the middle. However, the relationships linking the different parties are so complex  - and the ultimate motives of most of them so murky - that stock market analysts were yesterday unsure whether the skirmishing would develop into all-out war or be settled amicably by behind-the-scenes negotiation. Among the French protagonists, the Suez group, owner of Banque Indosuez, holds 10 per cent of Exor. Meanwhile, Saint Louis, a French sugar, paper and packaging company in which the Agnellis own a stake, recently paid FFr1.5bn for 13.8 per cent of Perrier. Saint Louis also owns 3 per cent of BSN, the French food group. The Agnellis indirectly own 5.8 per cent of BSN and have made no secret that their aim is to raise the stake further. However, BSN is also linked with Nestle. The two groups recently teamed up to bid for Cokoladovny, a Czech confectionery company, and yesterday BSN agreed to buy Perrier's Volvic mineral water business for an undisclosed sum if Nestle's bid succeeds. The agreement appears designed to smooth the path of the European Commission approving an eventual takeover of Perrier by the Swiss group. A deal would almost certainly fall within the scope of the EC's 15-month-old merger regulation, which has not yet been applied to a large acquisition in the food and drink industry. The Perrier saga started early last year when Ifint began buying shares in Exor. In November Ifint launched a partial bid for Exor which, after protests from the minority shareholders, not least from the Suez group, was turned into a full bid. Last summer, Ifil, another Agnelli vehicle, acquired 6.4 per cent of Saint Louis, which it has since controlled with Worms et Cie, the French family-owned holding company. Earlier this month Saint Louis bought its stake in Perrier. However the whole issue of Ifint's bid for Exor and Saint Louis' purchase of Perrier stock has gone on ice while the French regulatory authorities scrutinise the deals and decide whether to sanction the Saint Louis investment. Enter Nestle and Indosuez with their offer for Perrier, amid frenzied speculation in the French and Italian press about the Agnellis' long-term intentions towards BSN. Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's 73-year-old chairman, has long been friendly with Mr Giovanni Agnelli, head of the Italian group, and has named no heir apparent. BSN's shares rose sharply on the Paris bourse yesterday. Whether the significance of the recent convolutions lies chiefly in what they say about capitalism French-style, or whether they are a portent of the kinds of problems which may lie ahead for other, future, moves to restructure the European food industry, is quite another matter. Some French analysts suspect the Nestle offer is too low to be more than a sighting shot. 'It may be that Nestle wants to flush out a counter-bidder,' said Mr John Cousins, head of BZW-Puget Mahe, the Paris broker. 'If so who would the counter bidder be? The Agnellis? I certainly can't imagine anyone else wanting to get involved in this mess.' Although the Agnellis's business empire already includes foods, their involvement is as investors rather than as hands-on managers with a deep knowledge of the industry. Many analysts view their recent expansion in France mainly as a form of portfolio diversification. In contrast, both the industrial logic of Nestle's bid, and the seriousness of its interest in Perrier, seem clear: a spokesman for the Swiss company said it viewed mineral water as 'a strategic axis' of its future development, offering good long-term growth prospects. Nestle, which seeks to cultivate a public image of wholesomeness, does not normally indulge in hostile bids - particularly if, like that for Perrier, they involve it in high-profile political manoeuvring. Its successful bid for Rowntree three years ago was an exception and appears to have been partly an attempt to pre-empt a takeover of the UK chocolate maker by Suchard, Nestle's Swiss arch-rival in confectionery. Similar considerations seem to have influenced yesterday's bid. Nestle said only last week that it had been considering bidding for Perrier, before it was thwarted by the Agnellis. Nestle, which is a world leader in instant coffee, confectionery and dairy products, is already the world's third largest mineral water supplier. Its interests include Vittel in France - the still water market leader of which it recently acquired full control - Ashbourne in Britain and several smaller companies in Germany and the US. However, it still trails a distant third in the business behind Perrier and BSN, which had 1990 mineral water sales of FFr8.7bn and FFr5.2bn respectively. Vittel, Nestle's biggest mineral water subsidiary by far, had sales of only FFr1.9bn. Acquisition of Perrier, even without Volvic, would leapfrog Nestle into a commanding lead in the business, with best-selling brands including Contrexeville and Vichy in France and Arrowhead, Great Bear and Poland Spring in the US. Though sales of Perrier's best-known brand were hurt by a benzene scare in 1990, the mineral water market has continued to expand strongly, because of consumers' increasing concern with health and fitness. It is also a highly profitable business: in the first half of this year, BSN earned an operating margin of 21 per cent on its mineral water activities. It is less clear, however, whether Nestle would want to keep Perrier's other main business, Caves de Roquefort, which distributes the famous blue cheese. Nestle, which shed most of its cheese interests some years ago, should have no difficulty finding bidders for the business, which controls 80 per cent of the French roquefort market. Obviously, the saga still has a way to run and any number of further surprises is possible. Some analysts were suggesting yesterday that, if the Agnellis are serious about building up their European food interests, they may wish to avoid a showdown at this stage with a player as powerful as Nestle and may seek a face-saving way out of their involvement with Perrier. As things stand, a successful Nestle bid may not leave the other parties involved too unhappy. Saint Louis, regulators willing, would stand to make a FFr600m paper profit on its brief investment in Perrier, notwithstanding Nestle's threat yesterday to take legal action to freeze Saint Louis's voting rights. BSN would walk away with Volvic, while the longer-term prospect of taking control of BSN would remain open to the Agnellis. However, whatever direction developments take, it seems increasingly unlikely that Perrier will retain either its independence or its full range of existing business. As one London stockbroker put it bluntly yesterday: 'Perrier is a goner. It is part of history.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MINERAL WATER (Market Shares)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FRANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Perrier (Perrier, Contrex, Volvic, Vichy)             41% BSN (Evian, Badoit)                                   21% Nestle (Vittel)                                       14% Others                                                24%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ITALY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BSN/Sangemini (Sangemini, Ferrarelle, Boario,         18% Fabia, Nepi) Italfin (Fiuggi, Recoaro, Pejo, Gajum, Fontenova,     12% Riviana, etc) San Pellegrino (San Pellegrino, Panna, Pracastello,   10% Claudia, Sandalia, Limpia) San Benedetto (San Benedetto, Gluzza)                  7% Others                                                53%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Perrier (Perrier, Buxton, Volvic, Vichy)              28% BSN (Evian, Badoit)                                   14% Spadel                                                 8% Highland Spring (Highland Spring)                      6% Coca-Cola/Schweppes (Malvern)                          2% Others (including own-label)                          42%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Perrier (Perrier, Poland Spring, Arrowhead, Great Bear/Ozarca)                                    20% McKesson (Sparkletts)                                  7% Others                                                73%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Euromonitor  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Additional research by Ian Rodger in Zurich Lex, Page 18; World Stock Markets, Page 35</p>

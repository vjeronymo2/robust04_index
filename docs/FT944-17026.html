			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Strong US support for Clinton over Gulf stand President Bill Clinton may have found it hard to win support for his policy in Haiti, but he has no shortage of backers for his actions in response to the build-up of Iraqi troops near the Kuwaiti border. Republicans who were closely involved in the US's first confrontation with Iraq in 1990-91 were quick to back both Mr Clinton's decision to reinforce the US military presence in the Gulf and his firm statements of the US's determination to thwart any repeat of Iraq's 1990 invasion. 'I thought President Clinton did it right today: let's not get excited, but let's, on the other hand, remember that Saddam Hussein is totally unpredictable,' said Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state during the Gulf war and later secretary of state. Mr Dick Cheney, the Bush administration's defence secretary, added his support for the reinforcements sent to the Gulf and for Mr Clinton's strong statements. But he went further in suggesting that the US should be ready to attack pre-emptively. 'I think we ought to take the initiative at the appropriate point, when we're ready. He ought to be told either to stand down his force or we'll hit him, and it ought to be at our timetable, not his,' Mr Cheney said in a television interview yesterday. Mr William Perry, his successor at the Pentagon, refused yesterday to rule out the possibility of a pre-emptive strike. Republicans have been quick to warn Mr Clinton not to allow himself to get trapped into negotiations with Baghdad. 'There's no mission here for Jimmy Carter,' quipped Mr Cheney. Mr Carter's recent missions to North Korea and Haiti have both been successful in winning some kind of agreement that averted the threat of war, but the former president has been strongly criticised for backing the administration into making too many concessions. The only strong criticism of Mr Clinton's actions came from Mr Ross Perot, the Texan billionaire who lost to Mr Clinton in the 1992 presidential election. In a tirade more rambling than his norm, Mr Perot accused the president of orchestrating the tension with Iraq, as well as the US-led occupation of Haiti, to try to improve his party's chances in next month's congressional election. 'What's about to happen? We're about to have an election, right? This is the old game. The first war didn't get him a bump in the polls, now let's try a second one,' Mr Perot said.</p>

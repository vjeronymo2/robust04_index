			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 22, BNS -- Russia announced today it  will begin preparatory work to mark down the current borderline,  what it declares the official border with Estonia.    Estonia, sticking to the border as established by the 1920  Tartu peace treaty, has turned down any suggestions so far to  give the current borderline a formal status.    The Russian Foreign Ministry and other departments involved  in the work have started to draw up the respective documents,  Sergei Prikhodko, head of the Bureau for the Baltics at the 2nd  European department at the Foreign Ministry told reporters at a  briefing in Moscow.    He said a situation when no clearly marked border exists in  reality couldn't last forever.    The diplomat said Russia was forced to start marking the  border unilaterally, as Estonia was not prepared to do it  together.    He said a situation had emerged on the Estonian-Russian  border that could lead to "severe consequences," adding that  this was due to Estonia's attempts to "resurrect the 1920 Tartu  Peace Treaty."    Expressing Russia's concern about frequent occasions of  illegal border crossing and what he called "agitation carried  out by Estonian emissaries" on the territories that were once  part of Estonia, he said appeals to residents in those areas to  take Estonian citizenship and get Estonian passports were "in  violation of the Russian legislation."    At the same time Russia allows its citizens to have dual  citizenship, a status that Estonian laws forbid.    Estonia in its official policy insists that the 1920 Tartu  Peace Treaty remains in force and, thus, Estonia has the legal  right for territories now formally part of Russia's Leningrad  and Pskov regions, which went to Russia in the 1940's and 1950's.    Also the Estonian Constitution defines the country's borders  as valid before the Soviet invasion of 1940.    Russia regards the peace treaty as having lost its validity.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 13 (CTK) -- Complete parliamentary  control over the every move of the Czech intelligence services  is not possible, Chairman of Parliament Milan Uhde said on  Television Nova today. If members of parliament were informed  of every plan and process of Czech intelligence and  counter-intelligence there would immediately be leaks to the  media, he warned.    Parliament could only control the Czech services' activites  by appointing reliable individuals to top posts, he said.  Members of the parliamentary inspection commission would be  able, he said, to look at the files of closed cases but not  cases currently in operation.    He said recent German press reports that many secret agents  of former communist countries, including the Czech Republic, are  still operating in Germany were "slightly coloured" by the fact  that German agents who used to operate in communist states are  now afraid of losing their jobs.    Information CTK obtained from deputies close to the  Parliamentary Defence and Security Committee suggests, however,  that parliament can only inspect the activities of one of the  four Czech intelligence services, the Security Information  Service (BIS) which conducts counter-intelligence within the  Czech Republic. The other services engage in espionage abroad,  military intelligence and military counter-intelligence.    Speaking on the same television programme he said that the  state should contribute substantially to the funding of  political parties. If it did not do so, there was a risk the  financing might become criminal.    He explained the delays in passing the law on party funding  as being due to certain concrete questions remaining unsolved,  for example: who should control the funding and whether parties  should be obliged to declare the sources of other funds, like  donations.</p>

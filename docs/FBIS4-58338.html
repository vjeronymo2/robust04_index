			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Hasan Fathi commentary: "Northern Iraq, the Center of </F> Conspiracy"]    [Text] Only a few days after the downing of the two UN  helicopters in northern Iraq, the head of the Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan [PUK], Jalal Talabani, openly announced his intentions  to occupy the oil-rich areas of the region and that he is not  interested in joining the General Assembly of the federal Iraqi  Government.    With regard to the helicopters that were attacked by U.S.  airplanes, it is said that they were carrying Israeli and  American experts. At the same time, Turkish military forces  were entering northern Iraq on the pretext of crushing Turkish  dissidents who oppose the Ankara regime.    Together these developments created conditions conducive to  depriving Baghdad of its rich northern areas. Even though the  solidarity and unity of the country is stressed publicly in  conferences, the current trend seems to contradict such claims.    During his visit to France, PUK leader Jalal Talabani met  with President Mitterrand and other French officials to elicit  their consent for more extensive activity. All these actions  are aimed at provoking the Kurds. It is interesting to note  that most of these actions can be traced to Jalal Talabani.    Last year, in collaboration with the Turkish forces,  Talabani  attacked Kurdish dissidents' bases, where he killed and captured  some of them. After this, an Islamic group in northern Iraq was  attacked by the PUK and broken up. Talabani's extensive links  with France, the United States, and Turkey are not hidden from  anyone.    It is an irrefutable fact that Israeli experts and Turkish  military officials are playing an active role in the ranks of  the PUK peshmergas. They have used pretexts such as mutual  differences with Baghdad to promote greater closeness between  Turkey and Israel. However, this has caused even the Kurdish  people to mistrust their own leaders and the Kurds no longer  believe their promises and statements.    This is because their leaders are only concerned with their  own personal interests. While the Kurds were being subjected to  immense pressure and Iraqi Armed Forces were massacring the  defenseless people with chemical weapons, their leaders had gone  to Baghdad to meet Saddam Husayn and posed with him for the  television cameras, mocking their own people. It is because of  this very subservience of the Kurdish leaders that the years of  the Kurdish people's struggle have resulted only in destruction  and suppression.    Today when the Iraqi Kurds need assistance and support more  than ever to surmount their economic problems, internal  conflicts and ambitions prevent them from attaining their lawful  rights. The situation in northern Iraq is now more serious than  ever, because it has become the stomping ground of Zionists, who  plan to manipulate the regional nations for their own political  benefit.</p>

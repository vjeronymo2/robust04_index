			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Travel: Chile feels the wind of change David Pilling takes a bus ride through a Latin nation with more than a touch of California and the Hebrides Weather broadcasts on Chilean television pose a problem. This sliver of a country, stretching 3,000 miles down the Pacific coast of South America, is too long to fit on the screen. Instead, chunks looking like chopped-up eel are paraded in a procession that takes viewers from the gritty desert of the north to the near-Arctic freeze of Tierra del Fuego. An equivalent broadcast in Europe would detail weather conditions along a 100-mile wide corridor between London and Baku. As the weatherman rattles on about a heat wave 1,000 miles to the north, viewers in Santiago, which lies in the centre, have ample time to make a cup of tea. It is likely to be some minutes before the report has trudged its way to the capital - which could well be having a cold snap. Chile's shape is not all that distinguishes it from its neighbours. The country, known as the Great Britain of South America, appears at first sight to have little in common with the rest of the continent. Take the buses. Those who think of Chile as a romantic backwater may dream of clapped-out vehicles crammed with livestock, peasants and guitar-strumming revolutionaries, or tin wrecks driven by men with too little knowledge of the highway code but too much of tequila. The reality is that the buses have aircraft-style reclining seats and attentive hosts who store your bags in overhead lockers and bring you breakfast after an overnight trip. Chile's buses are comfortable. They are smart. They leave on the dot and purr with efficiency. They are not romantic at all. Then there is the capital, Santiago. There are no signs of carnival or fiesta, as elsewhere in South America, and no shanty towns cowering in the shadows of skyscrapers. There is little bustle or bother from street vendors or the incessant blaring of samba or salsa. In Santiago, the most obvious sound is the non-stop clinking and hammering of building workers beating out the rhythm of the city's construction boom. In middle-class districts, such as Las Condes, Santiago feels more like southern California than South America. Mobile telephones, palatial shopping centres, sharp suits and slick coffee bars are signs of the conspicuous consumption enjoyed by the upwardly mobile in a country emerging from the austere shadow of its long-time strongman, General Pinochet. Preparing to leave the capital to head south, I found something more in keeping with my preconceptions. At an Italian restaurant in Santiago's 'left bank,' the waiter flourished distinct menus - with prices for the men, without for the women. This was the understated machismo I had expected. It was particularly ironic because my wife was picking up the bill. The incident was obviously a good omen. Only 10 hours south of Santiago, a mere trifle in such an elongated land mass, everything began to feel more South American. This was the IX region - Chileans don't go in for fancy names - where Mapuche indians once put up Latin America's most stalwart resistance to the conquistadors. The Mapuches' attachment to their land was not hard to understand; the countryside is magnificent. This was April - autumn in the southern hemisphere - and the poplar trees, planted in rows to mark off sections of land, flashed fiery yellow against their evergreen counterparts. Cows and horses grazed, fat and healthy. To British eyes, there was a certain familiarity - but everything was on a vaster, grander scale. Trees towered and great birds swooped. This was England in a wilder age, with an African sky. As we drove along, cowboys cantered by the side of the road, great trunks of men mounted in the saddle. The sky began to glower and rain beat down, drowning out the sound of the bus's engine. After travelling more than 24 hours, during which the rain continued intermittently, the air had taken on a chill absent in Santiago. We were leaving the mainland by ferry for one of South America's biggest islands, Chiloe - although you would not have known by looking. Storm clouds had descended to ground level and we took to a sea enveloped in mist. A thump, some 20 minutes later, told us we had landed on Chiloe, and the bus continued its ghost-like journey, weaving along a landscape as yet unseen. I turned to my guidebook to find out what I was missing. Chiloe, it said, had a brooding atmosphere and a landscape reminiscent of the Scottish Hebrides, but with clapboard houses instead of stone crofts. For much of the winter, the island was enveloped in mists and rain. The reality was all too evident so I focused on more immediate surroundings. The character of our fellow passengers was beginning to change as newcomers joined the city types who had boarded the bus in Santiago. Every now and then, it screeched to a halt and a bedraggled specimen of muscle and brawn, shrouded in rain-drenched clothes and reeking of fish, would emerge from the mist. The vehicle, once so orderly and clean, became almost surreal as wet hulks slid around the gangway while businessmen in suits shifted uncomfortably in their seats. When the mist cleared, a gaunt, churned landscape came into view. Rough and tumble hills merged into the haze and trees battled the wind. The rain continued to lash the windows. Eventually, as fishiness within the bus neared danger level, the journey ended. The bus pulled into Castro, the island's capital, which has a tiny population and a huge wooden cathedral. What might once have been an elegant structure, however, is now encased in corrugated iron and painted in lurid shades of orange and blue. From a distance, it looked a bit like the sort of papier mache project popular in infant schools. Indeed, most of Castro's ramshackle houses, which range in near-anarchy over the muddy terrain, are painted in similar hues but the traffic-light colours were deadened by the drab-grey sky and misty air. We slipped and skidded down one of the steepest and muddiest streets towards the harbour, where boats - also plastered with colour - languished in the bay. We were looking for a hotel called the Unicornio Azul, which the guidebook described as an ideal sanctuary from the rain. Eventually, we found it, although the Blue Unicorn was not instantly recognisable, being neither blue nor showing any trace of a unicorn. But its Dali-esque structure and selection of excellent Chilean red wines made up for the inaccuracies of its name. As night set in, kestrels slid through the air above the trees outside our window. The television set babbled as we surveyed the bay, listening to the patter of rain against the water. Smoke billowed from nearby chimneys. The wind picked up, bringing with it the sound of a woman's mournful song. The TV presenter continued in the background. He might have been talking about the desert in the north, or the Beagle Channel far to the south, or the weather in Santiago. It all seemed a long, long way away. I reached for the mute button. David Pilling arranged his trip with Cox &amp; Kings (London tel. 071-834 7472), which has a brochure devoted to Latin America. Its 15-day Atacama, Andes &amp; Beyond tour includes Chile's northern desert, Santiago, the lake district and Chiloe island. Price: Pounds 2,495 a person. The weather on Chiloe is mild between October and March. Cox &amp; Kings also organises tours combining Chile with Argentina, Brazil and Peru. Pilling flew with Aerolineas Argentinas via Madrid, Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires. There are no direct flights between the UK and Chile.</p>

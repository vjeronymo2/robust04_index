			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: CD sales lead music market growth The global music market is enjoying brisk growth with an increase in sales of 8 per cent during the first half of this year against the same period of 1993, according to the latest figures from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Compact discs continued to be the chief catalyst of the market's expansion. Sales of CDs rose by 18 per cent in the first six months of this year after a 19.4 per cent increase to a total of 1.4bn units during 1993. The US was one of the most buoyant areas of growth for CDs, with a 25 per cent rise in unit sales during the first half of 1994. This reflects the continued trend for consumers to replace their collections of vinyl records and cassettes with CDs, and the wider availability of budget CDs. However, the pace of CD sales growth is starting to slow in more mature markets, notably in Italy. The IFPI also detected a reduction in the rate of CD sales growth in some Asian countries where piracy is a problem. One of the fastest growing areas of the music market is CD singles, where sales have continued to increase in spite of a slight decline in overall single sales. The number of CD singles sold worldwide rose by 55 per cent in 1993 and grew again in the first half of this year. The increase in CD sales has predictably depressed demand for cassettes. The IFPI noted a decline in sales of cassettes for the first time last year to 1.35bn worldwide from 1.47bn in 1992. The drop continued - albeit at the slower pace of 4.6 per cent - in the first six months of this year. The traditional vinyl market appears to be in terminal decline. Sales of vinyl LPs fell sharply to 80.4m in 1993 from 114.9m in 1992. The IFPI reported another fall in the first half of 1994. The Hollywood movie industry yesterday handed an olive branch to its European rivals following the conflict at the recent Gatt negotiations. The Motion Picture Association of the US unveiled a 'peace' package including an initiative to help the Europeans dub their films and to improve distribution in the US.</p>

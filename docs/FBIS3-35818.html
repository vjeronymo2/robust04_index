			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS observer Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 31 TASS -- The last date for the  payment by the state to Russian defence complex enterprises for  deliveries of arms and military hardware, manufactured according  to scientific and designing orders over the past one year, has  expired today. But the dues exceeding one trillion roubles has  not been credited to the account of the Russian Defence Ministry  which means the money will not be returned to defence industry  workers.    Without these funds scientific research institutes and  design  bureaus will not be in a position to meet the defence supply  orders for the year 1994 which were approved by the government.  According to specialists, it will have a negative effect on the  implementation of the long-term armament programme, the main  directions and priorities of which were stated by Deputy Defence  Minister Andrey Kokoshin at a session of the Russian Security  Council held on December 19 and were approved by President Boris  Yeltsin.    The hopes of the defence industry workers that the current  year will turn out to be the year of its revival have also not  come true. For the time being many samples of Russian arms,  which are considerably superior to similar arms manufactured  elsewhere in the world, cannot be produced on a large scale due  to deficit of funds. This not only concerns firearms brought to  perfection, but also principally new kinds of military hardware,  in particular, aviation and anti-aircraft rocket complexes and  means of communications.    According to Director General of the Aviation Production  Amalgamation (Komsomolsk-on-Amur) Anatoliy Petrov, Russia makes  the best multipurpose interceptor-fighter aircraft "SU-27", but  not a single aircraft was delivered to the airforce. Fighter  aircraft in different finishing stages are standing unclaimed on  the premises of the plant.    The same fate awaits other kinds of military hardware,  including invisible to radar low-flying interceptor "MIG-31",  fire-support (tank destroyer) "KA-50" helicopter, well-known as  "Black Shark" and possessing tremendous flying capabilities for  its class bomber "TU- 22M", according to specialists.    In order not to become an outsider tomorrow, Russian  armourers have to find non-traditional ways to perfect their  production. But they need support, first of all financial.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Steelmakers welcome EC strategy to stabilise market GERMAN steelmakers yesterday welcomed the agreement in Brussels on a broad strategy to cut EC steel-producing capacity to help stabilise the steel market. As steel workers demonstrated against the threat of further plant closures in the Ruhr, the heart of the country's steel industry, the manufacturers expressed the hope that the deal would allow prices to be raised, and therefore cover the costs of the most efficient producers. However, they warned that the EC industry ministers had left undecided the question of how to protect the market against cheap steel imports from eastern Europe. And they called for a longer period of at least two years to enable the industry to restructure. Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German steel federation, said the decision would make it easier for efficient steel producers to cover their costs in a stabilised market. He said the one year set for the industry to put most of the proposed - but still unallocated - capacity cuts into effect was too short. German manufacturers estimated it would take at least two years to set aside funds to provide compensation for unprofitable producers to leave the market. With a decision expected this weekend from Krupp-Hoesch, the second largest German steelmaker, on whether to close an integrated steelworks in Dortmund or Rheinhausen, 1,500 workers demonstrated yesterday outside another threatened plant - the Klockner-Werke works at Georgsmarienhutte.</p>

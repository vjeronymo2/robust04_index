			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / It can only get better: Change in Cuba is irreversible Three hundred pesos, or three dollars, will buy a cooking stove made from a vegetable oil can, once donated as aid, in Havana's Parque El Curita street market. With a week's guarantee included, they are selling fast. Piped cooking gas has been in short supply in the Cuban capital for weeks, thanks to breakdowns at the gas factory. This additional misery for Cubans, already coping with shortages of everything from washing powder to meat, is encouraging a return to Cuba's streets of the vendors who were cleared away in a 'revolutionary offensive' in the late 1960s. Most operate legally - licensed under economic reforms designed to loosen the state's grip on Cuba's recession-hit economy, which has shrunk by half in five years. The economy was devastated by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the loss of the communist bloc countries with which it carried on 85 per cent of its trade, on highly favourable terms. It is being further squeezed by a recent tightening of the US economic embargo. In talks with the Clinton administration last week about stemming the flow of illegal immigrants to the US from Cuba's shores, the Cubans sought a commitment from Washington to discuss the 32-year-old embargo. But most independent observers believe that domestic economic reform is what is needed to solve Cuba's economic problems. The Cuban government has moved slowly on reform, despite calls for more haste from outsiders such as Mr Carlos Solchaga, the former Spanish finance minister. Cuba has begun to welcome foreign investors in some sectors, and last year it made the US dollar legal tender. But there have been few indications of what the next step might be. Some are satisfied with the modest changes made so far. 'The good thing is that you can use your imagination to make things,' says 30-year-old Pedro Raurell, who sells mugs, pots, ladles and plates made from old soft-drink cans and aluminium sheeting. On a good day, Mr Raurell says, he can make 300 pesos. Not bad for a country where the average wage for a state worker is between 100 and 200 pesos a month. But, while legalising some self-employment has helped a number of Cubans, it has by no means solved the severe economic squeeze faced by the majority. Resolver - a popular word in the Cuban vocabulary, which means obtaining things or just 'getting by' in general - remains the order of the day. Most Cubans say the subsidised food and consumer goods provided by the state rationing system each month do not even come close to feeding an average family. The black market, a mainstay of daily existence since Soviet trade and aid dried up, is booming despite a recent government crackdown, while the lifting of the ban on dollars seems to have encouraged it. Only the dollar has real buying power. The black market rate for the dollar hovers between 80 and 100 pesos. Holders of dollars, obtained legally or illegally, can buy almost anything - either on the black market or in the dozens of new dollar stores for Cubans opened by the government over the past year. These sell food, clothes and prized consumer items, such as televisions and domestic appliances. Those with dollars can also eat and drink at state-owned restaurants and snack-bars, now open to Cubans as well as foreigners - and at illegal eating houses that have sprung up all over Havana. Getting by without dollars and on a small monthly salary of Cuban pesos is much harder, and for some impossible. And a striking novelty in today's Cuba is that people are no longer afraid - as they were even a few months ago - to speak their minds about the country's state of decay. After a restless, sweltering August which saw serious street disturbances in Havana and an exodus by sea of several thousand refugees, public discontent has become a tangible force in homes and on the streets. Old-style revolutionary fervour, still trumpeted by bright propaganda billboards, has been eroded by the economic crisis, the influence of a tourist industry serving mostly western visitors and by the government's own signals that it is moving slowly towards a limited market economy. Instead of extolling the virtues of the revolution and Cuba's one-party political system, Cubans are more likely to complain about food shortages, electricity blackouts, the collapse of public transport and other daily economic hardships. Behind the Cubans' natural cheerfulness and sardonic sense of humour, there is a sense of brooding frustration. The more than 30,000 balseros, or rafters, who have left Cuba since early August in flimsy, home-made boats bound for the US, symbolise this disenchantment. Until the Cuban authorities reimposed a ban on illegal departures under a new immigration accord agreed with the US on September 9, the young, mostly male rafters were outspoken critics of Cuba's current plight. In response to any inquiry, they directed a stream of rage and frustration against the economy, the political system and the figure of Cuba's 68-year-old president, Mr Fidel Castro. 'People are leaving because of a lack of freedom. Lack of freedom to do things, grow things, create things, invent things,' said 32-year-old Hector from the Havana suburb of San Miguel de Padron, as he helped friends prepare a raft at Brisas del Mar, some 18 miles east of Havana. Mr Castro publicly admits a segment of the population is disenchanted with socialism, but insists the vast majority of Cubans still remains loyal. It is even possible that he allowed the rafters to leave in an effort to defuse the discontent whose reality he acknowledges. It is also possible that the exodus was aimed at putting pressure on the US to lift its embargo, rather than at cooling domestic tensions. Either way, things have quietened down following the departure of so many. And for the more than 10m Cubans who did not leave after August 5, there is an air of expectancy: the future will somehow - must somehow - be better than the present. Even Cuba's tightly controlled state media, whose output normally ranges from euphoric praise for the Revolution to staid ideological conformity, acknowledges the moment is one of change. 'Things which didn't work in the past, even when we had resources, can't be expected to work now. The country is changing rapidly,' the trade union weekly, Trabajadores, said this month. The question for the Castro government is whether it will be able to influence this change, or merely be carried along - or perhaps swept away - by the tide of events.</p>

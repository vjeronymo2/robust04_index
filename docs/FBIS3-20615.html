Cheng Kejie, chairman of the region, told reporters that the  hydropower station is believed to be second only to the  projected Three Gorges hydropower station in scale, and when it  is completed it will be the second biggest in Asia.    During the first-phase construction, a water control dam  with  a height of 375 metres will be built, and seven generating units  with a total generating capacity of 4.2 million kilowatts will  be installed.    When the first phase is completed the hydropower station  will  be able to generate 15.67 billion killowatt-hours of electricity  a year, Cheng said.    During the second-phase construction, two more generating  units, to boost the station's aggregate generating capacity to a  total of 5.4 million kilowatts, will be installed.    The entire project will require a total investment of 30  billion yuan ($3.4 billion), of which $970 million will be  provided in the form of World Bank loans, the chairman said.

Zhirinovskiy told journalists in the Montenegrin capital  that  "my officers (soldiers of the Russian army close to  Zhirinovskiy's party) will carry out a test of the weapon  tomorrow in a confined space in Brcko."    Speaking after a meeting here with Svetozar Marovic,  secretary general of the governing ex-communist Socialist  Democratic Party, Zhirinovskiy said: "Russia has several types  of secret weapon. Their two-pronged effect is impossible to  survive."    The weapon to be tested Wednesday "acts directly on the  brain, has the power of a laser and is not radioactive but  ecological," he added.    The announcement echoed claims made by the leader of the  Liberal Democratic Party in December that Russia possessed a  secret weapon called the "Elipton" that was more powerful than a  nuclear bomb and could wipe out the whole of humanity.    The claim was dismissed at the end of December by Russian  Defence Minister Pavel Grachev.    News of the test raised eyebrows in Belgrade as even if the  weapon existed, the Russian volunteers known to be fighting in  the former Yugoslavia are generally young men rather than  officers or technicians.    Zhirinovskiy later told a crowd of several thousand people  gathered in the centre of Podgorica that "Russians and Serbs  have two enemies, the Catholic religion in the west and Islam in  the east."    Russia had therefore to "play the major role in liberating  the Slav peoples who are under threat of being converted to  Catholicism."    Zhirinovskiy, who is on a whirlwind tour of republics of the  former Yugoslavia, was also due to meet with Montenegrin  opposition representatives here.    He visited Serb-held regions of Croatia and Bosnia Monday  and  was expected to return to Trebinje, in the self-declared Bosnian  Serb republic, later Tuesday.    Montenegro and Serbia, which form the present rump  Yugoslavia, are subject to UN-imposed international sanctions  for backing Serb forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

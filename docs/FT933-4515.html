			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold plunges another Dollars 10 in fresh sell-off GOLD'S PRICE plummeted again yesterday, dropping by more than Dollars 10 a troy ounce as the computer programmes used by some New York investment funds sent out fresh 'sell' signals. The sell-off triggered similar plunges in other precious metals and gold share prices. Gold lost nearly 3 per cent of its value and fell to Dollars 351.50 an ounce at one point in London before closing Dollars 10.10 down at Dollars 354.25. The yellow metal has come down with a bump from Dollars 406.70 an ounce on August 2, the peak of the recent rally and yesterday was at its lowest level since early May. On the first trading day of 1993 gold touched Dollars 327, a seven-year low. Dealers said that there was some demand for physical gold as the price approached Dollars 350 yesterday but some were doubtful whether this would be enough to stem the landslide. 'It doesn't matter if the physical buyers come back or not, the funds are in charge,' said one. Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at the SG Warburg financial services group, suggested the gold price had more or less reached bottom although the next technical support point was Dollars 340. 'It certainly won't go back to Dollars 325 and could improve slowly from now on and be making its way towards Dollars 400 in six months time,' he said. He pointed out that gold was emerging from a time of seasonally weak demand but 'physical demand is firm and could get firmer now the price has come back'. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, told clients during a presentation in Antwerp yesterday that he suspected there would be many more attempts in the coming months to push up the gold price - 'and each time the bulls will find some wonderful reason for doing so'. He predicted that each time the price would fall back because 'the true equilibrium price for gold at present probably lies somewhere between Dollars 340 and Dollars 300 an ounce. The higher the averages remain above this level, the more likely we are to see sharp drops in physical demand and increased disinvestment sales and a higher level of scrap recovery'.</p>

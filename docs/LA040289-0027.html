More substantial favorites for all ages are plenty. There  are hardwood slat-backed bench swings for two, three or four, suspended from  trees, porch beams and A-frames. There are four-seat, face-to-face wooden  platform lawn swings on cross-braced stands. Gliders for two to five passengers  are made of slatted wood and of enameled aluminum or decorative wrought iron  with plump cushions and big, fringed canopies. Some canopies are bowed and  hinged like the tops of covered wagons.  </P> <P> Oval rattan chair swings, popular since the 1950s, now come with cane seats.  Natural and colored string hammock chairs suspended from crossbars come with or  without pillows.  </P> <P> Northwestern artisans hew rustic two-seat cedar log swings with fan backs,  slatted contour seats and lodgepole A-frames.

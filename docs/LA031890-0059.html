			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> OAKLAND -- NAME SUITS THE RAIDERS;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: CITY AND TEAM REGAIN THAT FAMILIAR RING WHEN AL DAVIS RETURNS  CLUB TO ITS ROOTS AND A LEGION OF LOYAL FANS.  </P> <P> The day before the Los Angeles (nee Oakland) Raiders were to play a crucial  game against Denver two years ago, a group of about 100 black-and-silver clad  fans were at Oakland Airport for the hour flight south.  </P> <P> "We are," said one of them, "the real Raider fans."  </P> <P> For the eight years the Raiders have played at the Los Angeles Coliseum, much  of the country has shared that sentiment. It still slips off the tongue: "the  Oakland . . . er, Los Angeles . . . Raiders.  </P> <P> When Al Davis announced Monday that he was moving his team back north, he  insisted he had nothing against the Los Angeles fans, only against the folks  who run the Los Angeles Coliseum, who he claims reneged on promises to improve  the facility.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles has always been blase unless you're the Dodgers or the Lakers,  perennial winners who have made it a habit to accumulate superstars.  </P> <P> Stars are big in Tinseltown:  </P> <P> Hey, let's go see Jerry-Elgin-Wilt-Kareem-Magic or  Sandy-Don-Maury-Fernando-Orel-Kirk. And watch Pat coach and Tommy manage. We  can even get to see Jack Nicholson at courtside.  </P> <P> Hockey? What's that? The Kings just got Wayne Gretzky? Let's go to a hockey  game.  </P> <P> "You know what I like about this place," says a transplanted New Yorker with a  Los Angeles attitude. "When you go to a game, you get to see celebrities. In  New York, the celebrities are inconspicuous."  </P> <P> That was the Los Angeles Raiders -- inconspicuous, a team on the decline  playing in a declining area near what passes for downtown in an area where 12  million people are spread out 60 miles north and south and 50 miles east. The  Oakland Raiders, that bunch of misfits and outcasts who appeal to the lunchpail  guys like those who took the plane south eight times a year.  </P> <P> Yeah, they'd fit in Pittsburgh or Cleveland or Boston, but not LA -- not enough  stars, except for Bo and he only shows up for half a season.  </P> <P> "As a sports town, Los Angeles has always been a hard sell," NFL Commissioner  Paul Tagliabue said Monday after the Raiders announced their move. "That's what  a lot of owners tried to tell Al when he decided to move."  </P> <P> Davis acknowledges some of that.  </P> <P> But his oft-stated theory is that the Raiders' attendance problem -- they  barely sold out half the 90,000-seat Coliseum for most of their games last  season -- is due to the team's decline on the field. They were 8-1 in the  strike-shortened first season in Los Angeles; won the Super Bowl their second  year and were 11-5 and 12-4 their third and fourth.  </P> <P> Since then they've been 28-33.  </P> <P> "We just didn't get the caliber of players we had been getting," says Tom  Flores, who played for the Raiders in Oakland, coached them to Super Bowl  titles in Oakland and Los Angeles and is now the president of the Seattle  Seahawks.  </P> <P> There's more.  </P> <P> The USFL, for example, put a team in Los Angeles and did so poorly that a  couple of times reporters actually counted the house in the Coliseum. The  Express played their final game at a junior college.  </P> <P> League officials finally came up with a theory -- the weather is too good,  there are race tracks, beaches, other things to do.  </P> <P> "It just wasn't the same," says Matt Millen, who played for the Raiders in both  cities and is now with San Francisco. "In the Coliseum, you could be tied 17-17  in the third quarter with one team driving for the go-ahead score. Then someone  would yell 'Surf's up!' and everyone would head for the beach."  </P> <P> Millen's not the only one who thinks the Raider mystique literally went south  with the Raiders.  </P> <P> Art Shell, the current coach, is the quintessential Raider -- an offensive  tackle who played for the team in Oakland for 15 years, then became an  assistant coach before taking over when Mike Shanahan was fired four games into  last season. Shanahan was a Los Angeles aberration, the only Raider coach who  hadn't been a Raider, a guy who grew up in the organization.  </P> <P> Shell's reaction to the move was a Raider reaction.  </P> <P> "I'm going home," he said, "I'm going home."  </P></p>

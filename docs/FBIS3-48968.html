			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Defense Ministry of the Croat Republic of  Herceg-Bosna pointed out in a special statement today that  Muslim fundamentalists from the ranks of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army have committed the greatest crime yet in their brutal  aggression against the Croat population of Bosnia-Herzegovina  and its ancestral homes. The fate of the mass execution grounds  in Uzdol, Maljin, Doljani, Trusina, Grabovica, and Mostar has  befallen the village of Krizancevo near Vitez.    According to well-informed sources close to UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces], 50 of the 53 Croats abducted by Muslim  fundamentalists in Krizancevo last week were brutally murdered  while three are prisoners in a Zenica jail. A mass grave  containing the remains of 35 massacred Croats has been found in  Preocica while another one located in no-man's-land between the  Muslim forces and Croatian Defense Council units contains the  bodies of another 15, the statement says.    The Muslim Army is still refusing to allow international  organizations and UNPROFOR access to the area between Krizancevo  and positions held by the 3d Corps of the Muslim Army, where the  Muslims had carried out the massacre. The liaison officer of  UNPROFOR's British battalion today informed the command of the  Vitez operational zone that the spokesman for the Muslim Army's  3d Corps had declared that some 15 bodies of Krizancevo  villagers could be found near the separation line and that  another 35 were buried in a mass grave near the Muslim village  of Preocica between Vitez and Zenica. The liaison officer  failed to disclose any details about the crime but added that  the head of the European observers and representatives of the  International Red Cross were still trying to obtain the 3d  Corps' permission to carry out an on-the-spot investigation.</p>

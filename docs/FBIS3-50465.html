The communique emphasized that the authorities have  requested  the EZLN members, who issued a "Declaration of War" against the  Army and the Mexican Government on Saturday, to "put aside their  violent and belligerent position against the civilian population  and the municipal authorities."    A day after the sudden attack by several hundred guerrillas  on the Chiapas municipalities of San Cristobal de las Casas,  Ocosingo, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and Chanal, the government  said, it is "concerned about the prevailing atmosphere in the  municipal county seats," which remained occupied by the EZLN.    At first, authorities indicated that the wave of violence  had  been unleashed by 200 Indian peasants, but their most recent  communique claims that the peasant groups "are infiltrated by  people with obvious paramilitary training." The communique  added that the infiltrators have "high-powered weapons, wear  green pants, khaki shirts, and red and black badges, and present  themselves as an organization of presumed liberation forces."    The communique pointed out that residents of the occupied  municipalities "have said that some Catholic priests and deacons  who uphold liberation theology have become involved with these  groups and are supporting them with the radio communications  system of the San Cristobal Diocese."    It noted: "The so-called Emiliano Zapata organization is  linked to the Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union  Party and to the Poor People's Party (guerrillas), and it has  forced the Ocisingo radio station to broadcast harangues calling  for violence."    The government's communique pointed out that Felipe Arriaga,  the bishop of Tuxtla Gutierrez, "has urged these groups to put  aside their violent position and regretted that priests and  deacons are accused of involvement in these incidents."    In Mexico City, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential  candidate of the center-leftist Party of the Democratic  Revolution, said in a news release that "violence, whatever its  origin, only leads to bloodshed, destruction, and greater social  backwardness," adding that the government's duty is to inform  people about the true situation in Chiapas.    According to NOTIMEX -- the official news agency --  Government Under Secretary Ricardo Garcia said the Mexican  Government is urging peasants in Chiapas to be reasonable and to  try to resolve their problems within a legal framework.</p>

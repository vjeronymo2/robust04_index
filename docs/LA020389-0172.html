Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> AMERICAN CONTINENTAL TO CUT BACK  </P> <P> Phoenix-based American Continental Corp. will change its focus from land  development to income-producing properties and will cut its work force in half  after selling Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., chairman Charles H. Keating Jr.  said Thursday.  </P> <P> Keating told reporters during an informal gathering in his office that the sale  of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings to an investment group is critical to survival  of American Continental.  </P> <P> He denied rumors that his company is on the verge of bankruptcy, although he  said it has been caught in the recession in Arizona's construction and real  estate industries. American Continental reported a $38-million loss for the  third quarter ended Sept. 30.  </P> <P> Its fourth-quarter financial statement has not been released.  </P> <P> American Continental announced in December an agreement to sell Lincoln Savings  to an investment group headed by Spencer Scott of Glendale.  </P> <P> Keating said that he expects California and federal regulators to approve the  sale next month.  </P></p>

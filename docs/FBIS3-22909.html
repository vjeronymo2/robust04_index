			<p>Language: <F P=105> Amharic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 hijacked yesterday  by two Ethiopians while on domestic flight from Bahir Dar to  Addis Ababa and forced to land in Djibouti, returned to Addis  Ababa yesterday evening, Ethiopian Airlines reported today. The  airline noted that the hijacked aircraft with 115 passengers and  eight crew members on board was forced to fly to Djibouti  because the hijackers ordered the pilot to refuel the plane in  Djibouti before proceeding to San'a. However, the Djibouti  authorities refused to refuel the aircraft. After lengthy  negotiations, the aircraft and its passengers returned yesterday  at 2230 and the hijackers remained in Djibouti. The airline  gave no details of how the aircraft was hijacked or the fate of  the hijackers. [see item AB1002180694 in previous Terrorism  Report]</p>

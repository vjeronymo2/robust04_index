			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jiangsu Provincial Foreign Affairs Department] </F>   [Text] The Jiangsu provincial goodwill delegation  successfully concluded its U.S. visit and returned to Nanjing on  the afternoon of 9 May. During the U.S. visit, Governor Chen  Huanyou met with New York State Governor Mario Cuomo and Georgia  Governor Zell Miller. Following friendly and frank discussions,  both sides exchanged views on exchange and cooperation, reached  a consensus, and signed four agreements in economic and science  trade. The four agreements were: The Jiangsu-New York  High-Technology Cooperation Agreement; the Jiangsu-Georgia  Economic and Trade Development and Exchange Memorandum; the New  York State Financial Investment Seminar in Jiangsu Memorandum;  and the Jiangsu-New York Comprehensive Visual Testing Agreement.  The U.S. visit marked the first meeting between Jiangsu and  U.S. governors and the signing of the four agreements signified  the actual progress that Jiangsu has achieved in developing  exchange and cooperation with the United States.    To enhance understanding, deepen friendship, and expand  cooperation, the Jiangsu delegation made extensive contacts with  U.S. industry, commerce, science and technology, education,  legal, and media circles and Chinese in the United States. It  attended the opening ceremony of the Jiangsu investment and  trade fair in New York City, visited Ford Motor Company, the  Atlanta Science Park, and New York State University's High  Technology Center. Governor Chen was invited to speak at the  receptions sponsored by the U.S.-Chinese Relations National  Committee; the New York State International Cooperation  Committee; and the business, scientific, and educational circles  of Georgia. He introduced China's opening-up policy, Jiangsu's  economic development and investment environment, and the  prospects of developing Sino-U.S. friendly exchange and  cooperation to those at the receptions. He also fielded  questions posed by business, political, and legal circles and  reporters. Many heads of major corporations discussed with the  delegation the possibility of expanding cooperation. The vice  chairman of the Detroit-based (Carden) Company and his party  took a special nighttime charter flight from Michigan to discuss  investment with the delegation. New York and Georgia officials  said they would organize heads of major corporations to visit  Jiangsu to explore investment projects. Good results exceeding  original expectations were achieved at the investment and trade  fair in New York City, where agreements on 48 projects totalling  $510 million were signed.    The delegation was warmly received everywhere by various  circles and by Chinese in the United States. On its first day  in New York, Chinese organizations in the eastern United States  and Suxing International Trading Company jointly sponsored a  grand reception. Some 250 people turned up at that warm  reception. This showed that Overseas Chinese love their country  and miss their hometowns. During a stopover in San Francisco  following visits to New York and Georgia, the California  governor forwarded a personal letter via his special  representative to the delegation in which he congratulated the  delegation's successful visit and expressed the wish to develop  friendly cooperation. Chinese circles in San Francisco and Los  Angeles hosted a grand reception to welcome Governor Chen and  his party. The delegation also met with Hawaii Governor John  Waihee to discuss exchange and cooperation. During the visit,  Governor Chen met with UN Deputy Secretary General Ji Chaozhu  and many responsible persons at the Chinese embassy and  consulate in the United States. He also met with comrades  working at Chinese enterprises in the United States and urged  them to further emancipate their minds, seize the opportunity,  run well overseas enterprises, and accelerate the pace of  developing overseas markets.    Cao Keming, deputy secretary of the provincial CPC  committee;  Wang Rongbing, vice governor; Liang Baohua, secretary general of  the provincial CPC committee; and Shi Shaoxiang, deputy  secretary general of the provincial government, met the  delegation at the airport. Other delegation members, including  Chen Biting, Ye Jian, Chen Deming, Li Zhonghe, and Gu Mingdao,  returned to Nanjing on the same plane.</p>

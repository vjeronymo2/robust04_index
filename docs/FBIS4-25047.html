			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Hai-tao (3076 3189 3447): "CPC Authorities </F> Secretly Draft Journalism Regulations for Hong Kong"]    [Text] After the Xi Yang incident, mass media people in  Hong Kong feel that the CPC authorities have adopted a tough  approach to the Hong Kong media without any willingness to  compromise. Retaliation was immediate against those Hong Kong  reporters who signed a statement boycotting official propaganda  events in China, and they were not to be allowed to cover news  related to the Qiandao Hu incident. The rapid retaliation by  the CPC authorities shocked many people.    An informed source in the CPC propaganda department said  that  the tough approach taken by the CPC authorities to the Hong Kong  media was related to the "leftist" shift of their general policy  toward Hong Kong. Lu Ping's recent remarks negating Hong Kong's  role as a political city show that the CPC authorities have in  fact revised the "one country, two systems" policy laid down by  Deng Xiaoping to deal with the Hong Kong issue. At present, the  CPC's interpretation of the "one country, two systems" policy  is: the "one country, two systems" formula refers only to the  economic system; that is, Hong Kong may continue horse racing,  night club dancing, and stock speculation. However, Hong Kong  people must not be allowed to oppose the Communist Party in the  political realm and must abide by the four cardinal principles.  That is, in the political realm, there will be no "one country,  two systems." Such an interpretation is substantially different  from their previous position of allowing people to swear at the  Communist Party.    According to the source, the CPC authorities recently  decided  to bring mass media operations in Hong Kong under strict control  after 1997 in order to guarantee social stability and guarantee  China's exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. They will not  allow some people to "create disturbances" in Hong Kong by using  press freedom.    An informed source revealed that a relevant department of  the  CPC authorities had set up a special body to secretly formulate  rules of behavior and management regulations for the press in  Hong Kong after 1997. This will substantially narrow the scope  of press freedom in Hong Kong from what it is now.    He said: Another measure the CPC authorities will take is to  run a party organ fully representative of Beijing's position.  The newspaper will be directly run by the government of the  special administrative region [SAR] and could be named XIANGGANG  TEQU BAO [HONG KONG SPECIAL REGION JOURNAL]. He said the plan  had been put into practice, and a number of officials would be  transferred from various journalist units to Hong Kong batch by  batch to prepare to publish the newspaper. Reportedly, a deputy  editor-in-chief of BEIJING RIBAO has recently been appointed as  deputy editor-in-chief of TA KUNG PAO, and he will also be on  the preparatory group of XIANGGANG TEQU BAO.    The informed source also said that in his view and that of  his friends, if major change does not take place in the Chinese  Government, after 1997, the press freedom enjoyed by Hong Kong  people today will be substantially restricted by the Beijing  authorities. As things are different than the mainland, the CPC  authorities will not control the nonpolitical parts of the  press. However, political news reportage will be brought under  strict control according to news rules and regulations. He said  that it was still unclear how the new rules and regulations  would be formulated, because the Beijing authorities kept things  highly secret in this regard. It is expected that the CPC  authorities will lay down restrictions on subjects and opinions  to be handled by the press in the name of safeguarding state  security and interests, maintaining social stability, and  preventing subversive activities against the government. The  SAR government will be authorized to close down mass media which  violate the regulations, or legal action may be taken against  them.    However, he thought that the CPC authorities would not  release regulations for controlling the press too soon. They  would not do this until the date of government transfer in 1997  is very close, because such an act is obviously a violation of  the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. Press  freedom is the last line of defense for Hong Kong people to  safeguard their current lifestyle. The British have never  published any official organs in Hong Kong. The overall plan  Beijing will use to control the press and public opinion in Hong  Kong will certainly destroy Hong Kong people's confidence and  could even throw the local community into complete chaos.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For those growers who purchased already-established orchards in an arm's-length transaction, we agree with respondent that their ``set-up'' cost is the portion of the price paid for the orchard that is attributable to ``capital improvements''. That is, the ``set-up'' costs for these orchards is the difference in value between the raw land and the land with an established orchard on it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When conducting the test for sales below the COP, we are concerned with the COP for the merchandise sold during the POR. The fact that the prevailing prices for kiwifruit orchards in New Zealand are depressed is irrelevant. What is relevant in our COP analysis are the costs incurred by growers to produce the fruit sold during the POR. Therefore, we agree with respondent that the price a grower paid for an orchard's ``capital improvements'' is effectively the equivalent of ``set-up'' costs for growers who purchased already-established orchards. Accordingly, we have revised the ``set-up'' costs for Growers' 1, 3, 5, and 19 in these final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent argues that the Department's use of a 20-year amortization period for orchard set-up costs is entirely unsupported and that the Department should instead use a 35-year amortization period. Respondent cites excerpts from various studies conducted in New Zealand to support its claim that the useful life of kiwifruit orchards in New Zealand is at least 35 years. Furthermore, respondent asserts that the Department's staff refused to discuss this issue at verification and would not accept any offers to back up or otherwise verify the accuracy of the 35-year productive life. Respondent also asserts that the document relied on by the Department in the original investigation to support the 20-year productive life does not make the 20-year estimate with conviction nor does it claim to be based on scientific study. Respondent maintains that the document was only a guess since it was based on commercial experience in California which at the time of writing in 1989 had just recently been established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners argue that respondent has not offered new support for a period longer than 20 years. According to petitioners, the possibility that the respondent was prepared to show the Department's verifiers a New Zealand vineyard older than 20 years is not dispositive of the issue because one, two, or even 20 farms with old vines cannot refute the fact that nearly every commercially producing kiwifruit vineyard in New Zealand and in other countries is less than 20 years old.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with petitioners. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) call for the amortization and recovery of costs over the expected productive life of an asset. The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which the asset may reasonably be expected to be useful to the individual's business or to the production of income. Some of the factors to be considered in determining this period are (1) wear and tear and decay or decline from natural causes, (2) economic changes and current developments within the industry or business, and (3) the climatic and other local conditions peculiar to the individual's business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information submitted by respondent in support of useful vine life does not refute the Department's 20-year estimate in the preliminary results. The excerpts from studies cited by respondent do not provide any conclusive evidence in support of respondent's claim for a 35-year or longer productive life. In fact, a letter from the Horticultural and Food Research Institute of New Zealand, Ltd. (HORT), submitted by respondent, states that ``the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) surveys indicate that before about 1970, there were insignificant plantings of kiwifruit_this means that in New Zealand there are very few plants more than 20&hyph;25 years old. *&blank;*&blank;*'' During verification in New Zealand, the Department discovered that, because of low profitability, some of the growers in the Department's sample had either pulled out or were contemplating pulling out their kiwifruit vines to use the land for other purposes. Furthermore, respondent's argument that it was prepared to show the Department's verifiers a New Zealand vineyard older than 20 years is not conclusive because the Department's objective is to measure an average useful life and not the useful life of one or two farms. Therefore, we maintain our position that the expected productive life of a kiwifruit orchard is 20 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent argues that the Department's methodology of allocating orchard costs to headlands and sidelands is flawed because the Department allocated headlands and sidelands only to kiwifruit crops, even though other fruit orchards also have associated headlands and sidelands. Respondent contends that the shelter-belt and sidelands are an integral part of all the orchard crops, not just of kiwifruit. Furthermore, respondent argues that the Department should not include headlands and sidelands in the allocation formula because the net area of the orchard is the area that is the focus of horticultural expenses. Although shelterbelts are occasionally trimmed and headlands and sidelands are mowed and sprayed for bugs, according to respondent, these costs are trivial. Respondent further contends that the Department's methodology of allocating costs to headlands and sidelands by using Grower 4 as an example is flawed because Grower 4's headlands and sidelands are only allocated to kiwifruit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners argue that headlands, sidelands, and windbreaks are not required for all fruit orchards. Petitioners note, however, that they are crucial for kiwifruit orchards because kiwifruit vines are much more sensitive to severe weather than are other crops. Furthermore, petitioners note that the support systems on which kiwifruit vines grow are also more sensitive to weather conditions than are other more deeply rooted orchard crops. According to petitioners, respondent is wrong to question the Department's use of Grower 4 as an example for allocation of costs to headlands and sidelands because respondent's submission did not provide any information about headlands or sidelands for Grower 4's passionfruit canopy and no support was forwarded that showed that headlands and sidelands were an integral part of the grower's passionfruit crop. Petitioners further contend that contrary to respondent's contention, aerial photographs submitted by respondents for Growers 10 and 17 do not show that crops other than kiwifruit crops require shelter belts. Petitioners additionally contend that respondent's attempt to demonstrate that the Department misallocated headlands and sidelands is inconclusive. For Grower 8, for example, petitioners argue that respondent admits in its own submission that the headlands and sidelands are devoted only to kiwifruit by attributing the extra area to the kiwifruit orchards. Finally, petitioners maintain that while the headlands and sidelands are not themselves productive, these areas are nonetheless integral to the successful growth and production of kiwifruit and are therefore appropriately accounted for in the cost of producing kiwifruit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree, in part, with both petitioners and respondent. Costs, such as fertilizer expenses, that are solely applicable to kiwifruit or to another crop's canopy area should be allocated on the basis of productive area only. However, by respondent's own admission, there are certain costs, such as trimming, mowing, spraying,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> etc. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , involved in the maintenance of shelterbelts, headlands, and sidelands. These costs should be allocated over the gross kiwifruit area. Accordingly, we have adjusted our COP calculations in the final results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to respondent's comment that headlands and sidelands were allocated to kiwifruit only, the Department imputed the area for headlands and sidelands only for those growers for whom respondent did not provide the actual breakdown between the canopy and the gross area for various crops and where it was not clear from the record whether crops other than kiwifruit had shelterbelts, headlands, and sidelands around them. Therefore, no adjustment for orchard area has been made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

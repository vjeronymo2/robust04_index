			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ulf Martensson and Johan Selander: "New </F> Democracy Splinter Group Forms New Party"]    [Text] It was not a perfect match. On Saturday [15 January]  the New Democracy [NYD] breakaway faction formed a new party in  Vaxjo, the Riksdemokraterna [National Democrats]. The party will  nominate candidates in the Riksdag election and compete with NYD.    The splinter group's main criticism involves the control  from  the top that characterizes NYD, in its view. For example, the  party leaders in Stockholm autocratically decide on the slate of  Riksdag candidates, the National Democrats charge.  <H5>  Protecting Children, the Aged </H5>   "It is no longer possible to influence New Democracy,"  according to newly elected party leader Birger Andersson, a  47-year-old business consultant from Farjestaden, Oland, who  said his main goals are to protect the interests of children and  old people--and knock NYD out of the Riksdag.    Bert Karlsson does not view the new party as a threat.    "It is good that they formed this party. If they have  different views, then of course they should make a party out of  them. But I doubt they have much more in common than their  negative attitude toward New Democracy," he commented on the  decision in Vaxjo.    There is great dissatisfaction with Ian Wachtmeister and  Bert  Karlsson among NYD members, according to representatives of the  new party who think they can get as many as 10 percent of the  votes in a Riksdag election.    Last year the splinter group formed a NYD municipal  federation consisting of around 40 local NYD associations. This  happened after NYD decided at an extra meeting to be solely a  Riksdag party. Local NYD associations were given a chance to  enter into cooperative agreements with the Riksdag party.  <H5>  Will Not Go After Refugees </H5>   Helena Karlgren, a 32-year-old law student and mother of two  from Eslov, Skane, is a new female face in Swedish politics. At  the founding meeting of the National Democrats in Vaxjo  yesterday she was elected as the party's first vice chairman.    Her goal is to win a seat in the Riksdag and knock out NYD,  which she describes as a "wolf in sheep's clothing."    "It is an undemocratic party with racist elements," she  said.    In spite of this, the breakaway party is using the NYD  program as a basis. But the National Democrats will have a  democratic control apparatus. A municipal federation made up of  member associations in the municipalities will have insight into  the activities of the party's executive committee.  <H5>  Refugee Policy Tough Enough </H5>   That is exactly how Karlgren and newly elected chairman  Birger Andersson wanted to reorganize NYD. They tried to get  Wachtmeister to listen to them.    "But he was completely unreasonable when we met him in  November."    It was after that disappointment that the idea of breaking  away from the party took concrete shape.    The new party's program will be worked out during the next  few weeks.    How will the National Democrats differ from the New  Democrats?    "We will apply democratic organizational principles. Unlike  NYD, we will not concentrate on going after individual refugees.  Refugee policy should be revised, but we do not want a stricter  policy. It is tough enough, in view of the fact that we deport  90 percent of those who come here."    Karlgren also mentioned youth unemployment as an important  issue. But the party will announce what it will do to combat  this problem later.    "The pension system should be revised in order to provide  pensions that everyone can get by on. They should be the same  for everyone. And it should then be possible to supplement them  with private insurance."  <H5>  Does Not Believe in Bloc Politics </H5>   The defense force should be a career army, without getting  rid of universal military conscription.    "I think we can have both. The Swedish boys who are serving  in Bosnia today should be given an opportunity to serve in  Sweden instead," she said.    Before she became involved in NYD, Karlgren always voted for  nonsocialist parties.    Are the National Democrats a nonsocialist party?    "No. I think we stand exactly in the middle. I do not  believe  in bloc politics," she said.    And the European Union?    "That is a good question. I must first confer with my party  chairman on this point," said Karlgren, who feels she has  something to contribute to Swedish politics, partly because she  is a member of the "lost" generation of the 1960's and partly  because she is a woman.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 49% Volex surge VOLEX GROUP, the electrical interconnection products company, lifted pre-tax profits 49 per cent, from Pounds 3.21m to Pounds 4.8m, in the 26 weeks to September 30. However, Mr Ken Hooper, finance director, said that the corresponding period did not include Mayor, the Singapore-based maker of data and power cord assemblies acquired in October 1992 for Pounds 6.5m, or CMS, the US moulded cable assemblies maker bought in January 1993 for Pounds 3.1m. Group turnover grew 47 per cent to Pounds 72.5m (Pounds 49.4m) and operating profits advanced 61 per cent to Pounds 4.83m (Pounds 3.01m). Investment income rose to Pounds 448,000 (Pounds 222,000) though interest payable also rose to Pounds 478,000 (Pounds 18,000). Mr Oliver Chapple, who became chief executive in October after Mr Howard Poulson had been head-hunted by Farnell Electronics in May, said that Volex now had three poles of operations - the Far East, Europe and the US. After the rapid expansion of the last two years - especially overseas; 60 per cent of sales are now outside the UK - Volex now had an international capability in marketing and supply. Volex had to become 'a unified force' within the global market, Mr Chapple said, with its sourcing rationalised and with co-ordinated marketing initiatives. Then organic growth would follow. Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, added that Volex would still be looking to make another important strategic move - along the lines of the Mayor acquisition. In cable assemblies, Pencon continued to benefit from legislation over the pre-fitting of plugs to electrical appliances. In Europe sales grew to the personal computer industry but fell to the mainframe market. The US 'stood still', said Mr Chapple, though the group was now also focusing on the medical sector which he expected would have a high growth rate. Specialist cables and wiring harnesses performed less well though Volex Wiring Systems had now been restructured. Earnings fell to 10.5p (11.2p). The interim dividend is unchanged at 6.5p.</p>

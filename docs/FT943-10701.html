			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Bristol-Myers in sales link-up with Cephalon The traditional roles of drug industry and biotechnology company were reversed yesterday by US companies Bristol-Myers Squibb and Cephalon. Bristol-Myers, the second largest US drug company, is to share marketing rights on one of its drugs with Pennsylvania brain specialist Cephalon. Normally, the research strength of biotechnology creates drugs but not marketing expertise and it is the biotech side that seeks marketing partners in the pharmaceuticals sector. Under a renewable three-year agreement, the two companies will enter into an income-sharing agreement based on increased sales of a painkiller, Stadol NS, in the neurology market. Cephalon will recruit a salesforce dedicated to selling Stadol NS in a nasal spray for the treatment of migraine headaches and other kinds of pain. That salesforce would then be in place to sell Cephalon's products after their approval by regulatory authorities in 1996 at the earliest.</p>

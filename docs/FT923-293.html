			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Cost of work bullies counted HARASSMENT at work makes poor economic sense for employers, according to the Institute of Personnel Management, Lisa Wood writes. Workers taunted over their sex, race, disability, union membership or even age become inefficient and often leave their jobs, the institute said yesterday. The institute is the main professional body for personnel managers. It has sent a booklet to its 50,000 members defining harassment and its effects and outlining procedures to deal with bullying of all kinds. The booklet says: 'Harassment exacts a high price for both the victim and the employer because the stress, anxiety and fear it can impose on an employee can cause absenteeism, illness and poor performance. 'Nor are the effects limited to the victim of harassment. Other employees are affected to a greater or lesser degree. It all adds up to waste and inefficiency as well as misery and it has to be stopped.' Mr Roger Farrance, president of the institute, said: 'An environment in which harassment occurs reflects as badly on the organisation as on any of the employees within it.' Harassment at Work.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The required levels of manual sugarcane weeding were  not met by every province during the January-March quarter. This  process does not require any type of imported resources, but  relies fundamentally on manpower and the organization and  mobilization of the necessary work force.    Holguin and Granma where the only provinces that surpassed  their weeding goals; Havana and Camaguey Provinces followed  close behind. However, Pinar del Rio, Villa Clara, and Ciego de  Avila Provinces did not reach even 50 percent of the areas  completed in their best quarters.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / E German border guard jailed after Wall killing AN East German border guard was found guilty yesterday of killing an attempted escapee at the Berlin Wall, in the first trial of human rights violations committed under the former Communist regime, writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin. Mr Ingo Heinrich, a 27-year-old electrician in civilian life, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for firing the first fatal shot at 20-year old Chris Gueffroy, who was attempting to flee to West Germany on February 6 1989. The sentence was 18 months more than the public prosecutor had demanded. A co-defendant was given a suspended two-year prison term for severely wounding another escapee. Defence lawyers said they would appeal. Two other border guards were found not guilty of shooting at the escapee. Justice officials said the verdicts were likely to influence future trials of east German border guards accused of murder along the frontier.</p>

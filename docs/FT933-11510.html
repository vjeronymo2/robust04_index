			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Accountancy Column: US profession faces up to self-policing role - A reform package which addresses the gap between users' expectations and reality THE US accounting profession has leapt from inaction into a frenzy of reform activity as it faces one of the most challenging periods in its history. With great fanfare the 310,000-member American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) last month unveiled a reform package designed to beef up its self-policing mechanism and take on additional reporting responsibilities. Several weeks earlier, it recommended that the US Congress enact legislation to strengthen the reporting requirements for pension funds. Describing these reforms, Mr John Hunnicutt, vice president of legislative affairs for the AICPA, told a group in Alabama that the profession's leadership was aware of the beating accountants took as the result of the savings and loans scandals. Damage control was too little and too late. This time, he said, the profession wanted to 'get ahead of the curve'. These and other recent moves by US accountants are designed to improve the profession's sagging image as Congress holds hearings on possible reform of federal securities laws. Citing estimates that accounting firms face 4,000 lawsuits seeking Dollars 20bn, (Pounds 13bn) the profession claims it cannot survive without legal relief from 'abusive' securities suits. High profile financial failures and record settlements between accounting firms and litigators not only cut into partners' pockets. They have also chipped away at the profession's once pristine image among the public, politicians and potential recruits. 'Given the unprecedented level of financial fraud witnessed over the past decade, the investing public and this sub-committee have a legitimate right to ask why so many financial institutions failed shortly after receiving an unqualified opinion,' Mr William McLucas, director of the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), told Congress recently. As the most recent reforms indicate, the profession realises that before there can be any relief from lawsuits, it must address the gap between users' expectations of auditors and the actual service delivered. While some can only be enacted through legislation, others could be implemented through the profession's system of self-governance and private-sector standard setting. Broadly speaking the AICPA aims are three-fold: Revamp the self-policing system. The AICPA would replace its current disciplinary system, which moves at glacial speed because it must await the outcome of litigation, with a mechanism to investigate swiftly and punish accountants guilty of misconduct or substandard work. Another proposed initiative would bar public companies from hiring the partner in charge of their audit for one year. Both require legislation. Revitalise financial reporting practices. The current process is outdated and no longer meets the needs of users. 'In many ways we're selling a 1930s product to a 1990s audience,' says Mr Jake Netterville, AICPA chairman. As part of its effort, the institute calls for greater disclosure of risks and uncertainties and a complete review of financial reporting practices. Achieve near-perfect fraud detection. Current auditing standards require procedures designed to detect material fraud. But in introducing the reform initiatives, Mr Netterville startled many by declaring: 'Fraud detection is our job. The public expects auditors to uncover financial manipulation. Our goal is 100 per cent detection.' The reform package advocates tougher new guidelines to assess the possibility of management fraud. In addition to these intiatives, the profession has dropped its long-standing opposition to fraud reporting legislation which demands that auditors report suspected wrongdoing to the authorities. It calls for new laws forcing all participants in the reporting system to notify auditors of financial shenanigans. It also advocates management reporting - verified by auditors - on the effectiveness of internal controls. The reform package suggests that the institute leadership accepts change is necessary. But a closer look reveals that many of the proposals are existing projects that have been dusted off in preparation for the Congressional hearings on litigation reform. For example, a special AICPA committee has been studying user needs and the financial reporting process for more than two years, and should release its report next spring. The institute's Accounting Standards Executive Committee has already issued an exposure draft of a rule that would require auditors to report on risks and uncertainties. The freshest components of the recent package aim to polish the tarnished image of the auditor. But critics point out that these proposals, such as investigations of alleged audit failure and bans on hiring audit partners, lack detail and a concrete timetable for implementation. 'We are heartened by their statements but we would expect that there would be more action on the public interest agenda before we move to their private interest agenda,' said an aide to Representative Ron Wyden, a Congressman from Oregon and longtime critic of the profession. Mr Walter Schuetze, the Security and Exchange Commission's chief accountant, says: 'The single most significant and encouraging thing about these initiatives is that the profession is finally admitting its responsibility to report fraud.' Because of its potential to increase liability exposure, this promise is also the most dangerous aspect of the new proposals. The profession's guidelines remain vague. Equally, auditors alone cannot compel other participants in the reporting process - like bank examiners and lawyers - to blow the whistle on suspected fraud. Most experts agree that detecting all fraud is unrealistic and would be too costly to implement. No audit can identify sophisticated collusion among top management or all non-material fraud. The high risk of failure in this area has the potential to sabotage the profession's efforts in others. Additionally, internal control reporting has been advocated and rejected several times over the past decade. Although the concept was recently incorporated into new banking rules governing the largest financial institutions, some experts question whether the reviews will be effective against fraud. Critics such as many companies argue that the substantial costs far outweigh the benefits. In the case of banks, the process has been estimated to add 5 to 20 per cent to the price of an audit. The reforms may do little to sway Congress as it considers legal reform. But improving the usefulness of financial reporting and shoring up the public's perception of auditor objectivity and independence may prove just as important to the survival of the profession. They also represent a public commitment by the AICPA. Many of the reform efforts require action by Congress, the SEC or other regulatory bodies, raising the danger that accountants will be perceived as dragging their feet through no fault of their own. The next few months will be a critical time for accountants in the US. With or without tort reform, it is essential that accountants take charge of their destiny by aggressively implementing those reforms on which they have the power to act. The credibility of the profession is on the line. Mark Carr is editor of Public Accounting Report, a newsletter covering the US profession based in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

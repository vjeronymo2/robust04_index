			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Mutiny rocks EC ship of state: Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty poses a grave threat to hopes for European integration Ratify or be damned. This was how Denmark's EC partners, and the European Commission, yesterday reacted to the thumbs down given by the Danish electorate on Tuesday to the Maastricht Treaty on political and monetary union. Since they will not now ratify the treaty, Danes can expect damnation, or at least to be cast into Community limbo. Some EC leaders were more diplomatic than others. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, warned of 'consequences not only for the Community, but for Denmark and Danes'. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign minister who has the unenviable task of being in the EC presidency chair at this crisis moment, was very blunt. 'We can't have a member state which does not accept the fundamental goals of the Community (as contained in Maastricht) continuing to be a member state,' he said. 'It could have another status, another relationship with the EC.' President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl said they regretted the Danish decision, but pledged 'their determination to realise the European union unswervingly'. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said the Danish vote was 'not a reason to stop others going ahead'. Do Denmark's partners mean business or just bluster? That will become clearer later today when EC foreign ministers hold an emergency meeting while they attend a Nato gathering in Oslo. But it is clear that the small number of Danish voters - some 46,000 - who tipped the referendum against Maastricht have precipitated the worst Community crisis since 1965. It was then that General Charles De Gaulle took France out of the Council of Ministers, insisting that his partners could not make decisions in his absence. They refused, stiffened by Dutch resistance, and six months later France came back into the Council. There is a parallel to today's crisis. 'If Denmark's 11 partners stick together on Maastricht, this will not be a big crisis,' said a senior EC official yesterday. 'But if they start to have second thoughts, then this will indeed be a big crisis.' It is not a question of facing down a Danish government, which is wholly mortified by what its voters have done. Even if it were, small Denmark faces 11, mostly larger, partners; big France dominated the original six. It is the dark doubts that so many countries have, or have had, about aspects of the great integrationist leap of Maastricht that are the difference between now and the 1965-66 crisis. Darkest of these doubts is whether governments are not simply way ahead of their populaces in their acceptance or enthusiasm for tighter European integration. The only test of that would be to put Maastricht to a EC-wide plebiscite, which no-one is proposing. But Mr Mitterrand yesterday grasped part of the nettle by announcing a French referendum on Maastricht; his gamble, high-risk for his own political domestic fortunes, is for a resounding French Yes to quash the impact of the marginal Danish No. The initial, flat refusal yesterday of Denmark's partners to renegotiate Maastricht reflects their fear that the treaty was like a boat, carried safely to harbour by a high-tide of Europeanism that may now be ebbing away. Renegotiation could well sink it, in new cross-currents of fears about central control from Brussels; about immigrants flooding across newly-opened borders within the EC; about Maastricht's new powers for the European Parliament robbing national parliaments of their legislative birthrights. Any renegotiation of Maastricht would also invite a double broadside against its key provisions for economic and monetary union (Emu) and common foreign and eventually defence policies. Bonn would almost certainly not be able to renegotiate Emu, unless it secured the clear-cut opt-out that Britain and Denmark won; and if Germany were allowed a 'maybe' commitment to Emu, all momentum would be lost. The Maastricht commitment to a European foreign policy and defence would also be eroded by the Atlanticists - the UK, Portugal and the Netherlands - and by neutral Ireland and by Denmark, many of whose citizens showed this week that they want to keep the Community in civvies, not in military uniform. But before Maastricht's opponents drain their champagne glasses, they should spare a thought about what might happen if the treaty dies. Its death will not necessarily mean the death of Emu or of European defence, Indeed, both could occur on terms vastly less pleasing to most EC states. As Mr Karl Otto Pohl used to say, only half-jokingly, when he was Bundesbank president, Germany is ready right now for Emu with some of its immediate neighbours - France, the Benelux (and he used to mention Denmark). But there would not be any democratic European structure to such a monetary union, outside the Community. Breathing a sigh of relief at not having to take in spendthrift southerners, or Britons, Germany could pick and choose its partners for a northern continental currency club. Emu on these terms might be very attractive to many of those Germans who currently rail against Maastricht. And the loud howls from excluded Italy would not make it any less so. Likewise, the death of Maastricht might not make President Mitterrand and Chancellor Kohl any less keen to pursue their plan to create a European army corps by 1995. It might render them keener. At present, they only have a rather implausible joint brigade of 4,000 men. But in the absence of partners, they might try to put substantially more of their armies together. More important, Maastricht enshrined the Western European Union, the nine-nation defence organisation with established links to Nato, as the body through which Europe would develop its defence interests. Any European force would come under a WEU umbrella. That umbrella could be blown away along with Maastricht, making the Americans even more irritated about Franco-German rivalry to Nato than they already are. These, then, are some of the stakes involved in the current Maastricht mess. There are, basically, two ways of sorting it out. The first is for the 11 to stick to the line that most of them espoused yesterday. This involves them all plodding on with ratification, as if Tuesday's Danish rejection had never happened. Then, at the end of the year, they would tell Denmark to find some way of approving Maastricht, or take itself out of the Community at least out of the European Union created by Maastricht. The second option would involve listening carefully to what the Danish government suggests might mollify its voters, and trying to do something about it. A compromise might exploit the fact that the European Union contains three 'pillars', in the Maastricht jargon - one covering standard EC business (enlarged to Emu), and two 'inter-governmental' pillars covering foreign, defence, police, immigration and home affairs. It was not ruled out in Brussels yesterday that Denmark could stay in the EC, but forego participation in the new inter-governmental business. Myriad problems leap to mind; for instance, what about sanctions on Serbia which are decided inter-governmentally by all 12, but implemented by EC machinery? 'But, legally, we can always arrange something,' said an EC expert. The snag about letting countries dine a la carte off the European menu - as the complaints that followed Britain's Maastricht opt-out clause on social policy highlighted - is that it opens the way to ever-greater fragmentation of Community activity. In particular, if Denmark can pick and choose, why cannot the new members queueing to join the EC? Ironically, it was enlargement, or rather its implications for EC integration and institutions, that may have just tipped the Danish vote against the treaty. At President Mitterrand's suggestion, last December's Maastricht summit decided to ask the Commission to prepare a report for this month's Lisbon summit on how the Community could cope with a more numerous membership. The Commission has taken the study seriously: perhaps, it belatedly realised, too seriously. Certain ideas for the report, which is still not finalised, started to leak out a month ago. These included reducing the required minimum votes for taking decisions by majority and transforming the Commission into a more powerful executive, particularly on the foreign policy side. Alarmed at seeing all his work on Maastricht, particularly on Emu, slip away, the Commission president back-pedalled by rightly denying these ideas had any official status. But this was not before newspaper headlines such as 'Delors wants to rule Europe' had had their impact in Denmark. It is equally ironic that Danes were yesterday being sharply criticised by some of their fellow Nordics. The one certain consequence of the Maastricht mess is that, unless it is very speedily sorted out, it will prevent accession negotiations with Sweden, Austria, Finland and Switzerland starting, as the forthcoming UK presidency planned, next January. Thus, Denmark may bring down on its heads the wrath of its fellow Nordics in Sweden and Finland, while perhaps indefinitely deferring an EC entry application from Norway. Another item on the Community's agenda - that of its future financing over the next five years - now becomes even more pressing. Spain has warned that it will not ratify Maastricht until it get satisfaction on more 'cohesion' cash, via the EC budget, from northern countries. But the latter may now reply: 'What's the point in paying the bill for Maastricht, with Maastricht itself in such doubt?' On such issues, the united front which Denmark's EC partners sought yesterday to present could well come apart.</p>

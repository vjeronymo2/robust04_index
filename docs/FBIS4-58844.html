			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Talk carried within the "Issues and Events" program] </F>   [Text] Brothers and sisters: We say that what is taking  place in our country is an internal matter and that it needs no  mediation from any side because the forces of apostasy and  secession have ignited an all-out war in our homeland. They,  therefore, are considered rebels against the constitutional  legitimacy around which the people are rallying and which they  freely chose.    We want to explain here that we appreciate the interest and  sympathy of brothers and friends. We also want to make it clear  that there is no longer any excuse for mediation. Also, the  forces of apostasy and secession are on the verge of surrender  and they will be taken into account for their acts. This matter  is known by everybody. The armed units that receive orders from  al-Bid and his clique, which dominates the [Yemeni] Socialist  Party, are collapsing one after other. Many of these units'  officers and personnel have surrendered now that they have  become aware of the objectives of those who misled them. The  door is open before the other units to join the units that are  defending unity and chasing those rebelling against  constitutional legitimacy.    We want also to say that through their calls for mediation  the leaders of apostasy and separation want another opportunity  to continue their game of undermining Yemen's unity. This is  rejected by the legitimate leadership, which was patient for a  long time and tried to achieve reconciliation with the gang of  apostasy, separation, and evil, but to no avail.    Since the gang of apostasy and separation has not desisted  from its path and is not aware of the pains caused by its  practices, the only way is to apply the law on the criminals who  worked to drive a wedge among the people, ignite the fire of  sedition, and launch a all-out war [words indistinct] units of  our Armed Forces, which they deceived, to fight the units  defending unity and constitutional legitimacy.    What, then, is the meaning of the talk about mediation? In  the past, the gang of apostasy and secession resorted to  maneuvering and procrastination in the face of mediation. It  used to ridicule the mediators and the legitimate leadership in  order to evade all agreements. Arab brothers and friends became  aware of this fact and knew full well the practices and twisted  methods of the gang of apostasy and secession, which is  considered -- in accordance with the Constitution, law, and  reason -- a rebellious clique. It even committed crimes of high  treason. It ignored national constants, called for  estrangement, and worked to destroy unity. It tampered with  public funds, shook security, and undermined the stability of  the whole Yemeni people.    After long patience and indulgence, can we ignore all this  and accept any mediation just so that the gang of apostasy can  regain its breath and prepare to replace the scenario of this  war, which it ignited, with a scenario of another war?    Our country -- leadership and people -- are awaiting the  natural end of the gang of apostasy and secession that aimed at  spreading bloodshed throughout the homeland and which is still  dreaming of spreading a civil war in the streets. [words  indistinct] know that there is no civil [word indistinct] at  all. What is taking place are military operations aimed at  subjugating the party rebelling against constitutional  legitimacy, the party that seeks (?separation) and bloodshed.</p>

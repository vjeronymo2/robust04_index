			<p>BFN     [Text] In accordance with the decree signed by Georgian  leader Eduard Shevardnadze on Friday, a national bureau to fight  drug addiction and drug business has been created in Georgia.  The bureau has been created on the basis of the department in  charge for fighting drug addiction within Georgia's Interior  Ministry in order to strengthen the fight against drug addiction  and the drug business.    A section in charge for supervision over the cases on  illegal  circulation of narcotics and psychotropic substances is being  created in the republic's prosecutor's office "to observe  legislation with respect to fighting drugs."    The republic's customs department has been commissioned to  create services to prevent transit of drugs through the border.    The decree stresses that the difficult social-economic  situation in Georgia, aggravation of the criminal situation,  weakening of border control have facilitated the spread of drug  addiction in Georgia. Spreading of drug addiction among young  people arouses special concern. In addition, the drug mafia is  showing an interest in Georgia as a country which is convenient  for drug transit.    Vice Premier Irakly Menagarishvili, chairman of the  governmental commission on drug fighting declared at a  conference on Friday in Tbilisi that there are about 100,000  drug addicts in Georgia now, more than 200,000 have died as a  result of their addiction. He said that these are predominantly  young people aged 16-20.</p>

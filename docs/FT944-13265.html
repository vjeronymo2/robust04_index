			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Cost of library to be announced Firm projections of the costs of the new British library and its completion date will be announced before the Budget, the Department of National Heritage said yesterday. Controversial sprinkler and cabling provisions will also be announced. In July the Commons national heritage committee described the new library, near London's St Pancras station, as 'one of the ugliest buildings in the world' and said costs had increased to Pounds 450m from an original estimate of Pounds 116m. The National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, is due to investigate the delays and expense involved. Yesterday the department confirmed that Mr Richard Pardey, the project manager brought in from the private sector to oversee the building seven years ago, was moving to a new position, liaising with the office's investigation. It said Mr Pardey was 'uniquely well-placed to be in charge of our response'. His contract ends next year, and the department said his successor would have a reasonable amount of time to do the job.</p>

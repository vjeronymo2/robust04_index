			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> DWARF CITRUS TREES CAN DECORATE A PATIO, MAKE A MOVABLE FEAST;  </P> <P> ALTHOUGH SMALL ENOUGH TO BE GROWN IN CONTAINERS, THEY STILL PROVIDE FULL-SIZE  FRUIT.  </P> <P> One of the most attractive ways to display the evergreen foliage, fragrant  blossoms and showy fruit of citrus trees is in containers. Dwarf or semi-dwarf  varieties are best for containers, providing the same full-size fruit and lush,  green foliage of standard-size citrus trees. The fruit of most citrus trees can  be left on the tree for weeks, adding a colorful accent to your patio or  garden.  </P> <P> The mobility of containers allows you to move your trees whenever you choose --  perhaps for a special occasion, or to move the tree to center stage when it is  loaded with colorful fruit or fragrant flowers. Choose a container slightly  larger than the container the tree was in when you bought it.  </P> <P> Clay pots, wooden containers, even wine or whiskey barrels make good containers  for citrus trees -- just make sure they have drainage holes in the bottom. For  added color, plant cascading flowers at the base, such as ivy geraniums,  petunias, pansies, lobelia or alyssum.  </P> <P> To avoid the possibility of your citrus tree quickly outgrowing its container,  choose a dwarf or semi-dwarf tree. These are citrus trees which have been grown  onto under stocks (the bottom half) of natural genetic dwarf citrus trees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variation in Cold Tolerance  </P> <P> According to Don Durling of Durling Nursery in Fallbrook, an authority on the  growing of top-quality container citrus, a true dwarf citrus tree grows up to 6  to 8 feet, a 75% reduction from full-size citrus. A semi-dwarf citrus grows to  a maximum of 9 to 14 feet, a reduction of about 50%. Semi-dwarfs are the most  commonly found and are plenty dwarf enough for containers.  </P> <P> When deciding what type of citrus to buy, keep in mind that although all citrus  are susceptible to frost damage when temperatures fall much below freezing,  there is significant variation in cold tolerance among different citrus  varieties. While limes require an almost frost-less climate, the kumquat has  been known to tolerate temperatures as low as 15 degrees Fahrenheit.  </P> <P> In addition to individual cold hardiness, another consideration when selecting  a citrus variety is the fact that a certain amount of heat is required to ripen  citrus fruit. Some varieties need more heat than others to ripen and become  sweet.  </P> <P> If you live in a cool coastal area it will take much longer for your citrus to  ripen than if you live in a hot inland area, and the fruit may not be as sweet.  Valencia oranges need less heat to ripen than do navel oranges. Grapefruit has  a high heat requirement and is best grown in the low desert or hot inland  areas. It is sometimes tricky to tell when citrus fruit is ripe. Fruit color is  often not an adequate indicator of ripeness -- the only sure way to determine  ripeness is to taste the fruit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Low Heat Requirements  </P> <P> Lemons and limes are acid fruits with low heat requirements (they don't need to  sweeten up), and are ideal for coastal areas. The Meyer lemon is a wonderful  variety, as hardy as an orange, with large, ever-bearing fruit. It is a natural  genetic dwarf, as is the kumquat, and naturally remains small. The Mexican  lime, your standard bartender's lime, is your best choice if you live near the  coast. Another exceptional lime is Bearss Seedless, which is light-yellow when  ripe and almost as large as a lemon.  </P> <P> Whether in a container or in the ground, citrus trees need little pruning --  prune only to shape or to reduce the height slightly. Dead branches and suckers  arising from below the graft line should be removed. If you are pruning to  remove shoots or branches damaged by frost, wait until new growth clearly  defines the damaged areas.  </P> <P> Citrus trees in containers need to be watered more frequently than those in the  ground. When you do water, make sure you water thoroughly, until water runs out  the bottom of the container. Depending on the weather, you will probably need  to water your tree once or twice a week. If it is very hot or windy you may  need to water more often.  </P> <P> Container-grown citrus should be fertilized regularly with a complete  fertilizer made especially for citrus. Follow label recommendations regarding  container citrus. If chlorosis (yellowing) is not corrected by the usual  applications of nitrogen fertilizer, suspect a micronutrient deficiency. To  correct, apply a fertilizer containing chelated forms of iron, zinc and  manganese.  </P> <P> Citrus can usually be grown successfully by the home gardener without a regular  pest control program. You really don't need to spray unless the infestation is  severe or the fruit is being affected.  </P> <P> Many pests are controlled naturally by beneficial insects that feed on the  damaging ones. Aphids, mealybug and scale can be controlled with insecticidal  soap or Malathion. An occasional shower with the hose helps to control mites --  or spray with Volck oil or a miticide.  </P></p>

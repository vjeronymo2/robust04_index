			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, March 31 (XINHUA) -- The Security  Council voted unanimously today to extend UN operations in the  former Yugoslavia by six months and increase troop strength by  3,500.    The United Nations Protection Force, which was established  in  February 1992, now has 31,335 peacekeepers in the region.    With cease-fires achieved by Muslims and Serbs in Sarajevo  and by Muslims and Croats in central Bosnia, the United Nations  needs more troops in Bosnia to help maintain the peace.    The number of troops approved by the council today fell far  short of the 8,500 called for by Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali. This was partly because the United States is  already overextended in financing the operation.    U.S. Deputy Ambassador Edward Walker told the council that  the American concern has been to "ensure that the financial  resources are available to sustain this vital operation."    The United States, which pays about 30 percent of the cost  of  all peacekeeping missions, already owes more than 80 million for  UN operations in the former Yugoslavia.    Besides authorizing more troops for Bosnia, the resolution  also asks NATO to extend air cover for UN troops in Croatia.    The Chinese delegation expressed its concern over the use of  air cover for UN troops. "With regard to the question of close  air support over the territory of the Republic of Croatia, the  Security Council should act prudently," said Chen Jian, Chinese  deputy representative.    "It has been stated repeatedly by the secretary-general's  special representative on the former Yugoslavia that air support  should only be used to ensure the safety of UN personnel in the  performance of its mandate and for self-defense, rather than  using excessive force for punitive purpose," he added.</p>

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee shows the way with Dollars 220 rise - Week in the Markets Barriers were down across the London commodity markets yesterday. Nearby coffee futures raced past the Dollars 1,800-a-tonne mark to fresh five-year highs; copper prices surged above Dollars 2,000 a tonne for the first time in ten-months; and crude oil bettered Dollars 16 a barrel, in defiance of bearish projections by most analysts. Coffee's performance was easily the most impressive. Concern about nearby supply tightness had already helped to extend last week's Dollars 90-a-tonne gain in the July robusta position at the London Commodity Exchange by Dollars 135 before yesterday's explosion of speculative buying took it up another Dollars 182 to a peak of Dollars 1,880. It weakened in late trading, but at Dollars 1,789 was still up Dollars 91 on the day and Dollars 226 on the week. Supply worries were already reflected in the premiums commanded for nearby delivery positions before this week's upsurge. And that for prompt May delivery over July widened to Dollars 100 a tonne at yesterday's close from Dollars 52 a week earlier. But more significant, perhaps, was the increase in the September/November spread from Dollars 6 to Dollars 35, suggesting that availability problems were expected to continue. Dealers were worried, however, that the preponderance of speculative funds in the recent buying meant that the market was very vulnerable to profit-taking. 'The rise is becoming blown out of proportion. . . the higher it goes, the more vulnerable it becomes,' one told Reuter. 'There is sufficient coffee in the world, quite substantial stocks in consuming countries and producer-retained coffee which will be released,' said another. 'We are facing a low period of roastings, there is no drought, no frost and no major interruption in supply.' The London Metal Exchange copper market, buoyed by increased US physical demand and falling stocks, had been bracing itself all week for an assault on the mid-March peak of Dollars 1,983 a tonne for three months delivery. And when that hurdle was cleared yesterday morning a flood of short-covering and stop-loss buying quickly took the price to a high of Dollars 2,037. It closed at Dollars 2,027.50 a tonne, up Dollars 52.75 on the day and Dollars 75 on the week. The copper market's strength was fuelled by yesterday's announcement of a 17,025-tonne reduction in LME warehouse stocks, taking them to 456,425 tonnes, 26 per cent below February's 16-year high. In contrast, a rise in the aluminium price came in spite of an equally substantial rise in its LME stocks, which dashed traders hopes that recent production cuts would begin to be reflected in the stocks total. However, copper's performance ensured that the other LME market's were in no mood to wallow in such disappointments. The aluminium price succeeded in regaining its foothold above Dollars 1,330 a tonne to close at Dollars 1,332.50, up Dollars 5 on the day and Dollars 25.75 on the week. The reversal of sentiment in the oil market that has surprised many analysts was underlined yesterday when near delivery prices broke through the psychological barrier at Dollars 16 a barrel. The rise - which took the prompt June position at London's International Petroleum Exchange to Dollars 16.10 in late trading, up 30 cents on the day and 41 cents on the week - was attributed to news of North Sea shipment cancellations, following Monday's platform shutdowns, and concern about the civil war in Yemen.  ------------------------------------------            LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ------------------------------------------ (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------------ Aluminium         +18,275 to 2,629,050 Aluminium alloy    -1,480 to    38,360 Copper            -17,025 to   456,425 Lead               +3,225 to   343,000 Nickel               -804 to   132,948 Zinc               +1,575 to 1,148,875 Tin                  +615 to    26,960  ------------------------------------------</p>

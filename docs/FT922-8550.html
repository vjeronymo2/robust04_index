			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Australia to reduce immigrant numbers AUSTRALIA, one of the world's most popular destinations for European and Asian emigrants, yesterday announced plans to cut immigration by 27 per cent next year to about 80,000 people. Mr Gerry Hand, the immigration minister, said Australia would also require more skills and a higher level of competence in English from applicants other than refugees and close relatives of earlier migrants. The changes follow an anguished debate over the historically high level of immigration in the wake of an 18 month recession which has increased unemployment to 10.4 per cent. Immigrant organisations argue that high immigration benefits Australia by increasing economic activity. However, the government has accepted trade union arguments that immigration has worsened unemployment during the recession. Mr Hand said the level of immigration for future years would be decided in the light of 'national economic and social objectives'. He said the intake was likely to average 80,000 for several years. The cut was welcomed by Senator Peter Walsh, a prominent campaigner against high immigration, who urged a further cut to a maximum of 60,000 people in 1993-94. Immigrant organisations said the increased focus on English language skills was discriminatory, and would discourage applications from talented migrants from non-English-speaking countries. About 3.5m of Australia's 17m population were born overseas. About one-third emigrated from the UK and Ireland, and a further third from mainland Europe. Asian immigration has increased rapidly since 1980.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guinea-Bissau's national electoral commission  announced today that some 80 percent of the electorate is  already on the electoral roll. This is good news for another  process which has democratic intentions:    [Correspondent Fernando Pereira] The first pluralist  election  in Guinea-Bissau's history will probably take place toward the  end of June or the beginning of July. The date has already been  postponed three times, but everything leads us to believe that  this time is for real, since the electoral roll is complete,  which is the most important task. The CNE -- the National  Electoral Commission, the top electoral body -- announced today  the definite outcome of the process. A total of 404,000 people  have been enrolled, 97,000 people alone in the capital.  Attention is now focused on the head of state, Joao Bernardo  Vieira, the only person who can set the date of the election by  decree. According to law, that will only be done following the  official release of the final figures of the electoral roll,  which may happen within the next few days.</p>

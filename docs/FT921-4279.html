			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Singapore bank posts surprise 10% rise DBS Bank of Singapore has reported better than expected results with a 10 per cent rise in net profits to SDollars 315.3m (USDollars 197m) for 1991, up from SDollars 286.4m a year earlier, despite slower credit expansion and softer interbank rates, AP-DJ reports. However, turnover fell 2.3 per cent to SDollars 2.27bn from SDollars 2.32bn, while earnings per share were up 5.1 per cent at 62 cents against 59 cents. DBS, which is maintaining its dividend for the year at 16 cents a share, said net interest earnings grew by 9.7 per cent at group level and 6.6 per cent at bank level. The bank's loan portfolio expanded by 13 per cent. Other income declined by 23 per cent at group level and 9.1 per cent at bank level. The fall was largely due to lower contributions from investment banking operations. DBS Bank is seen as an indicator for the sector's earnings. Analysts had expected the banking sector to report weak earnings partly because the financial services sector slowed considerably last year, after strong growth in 1990. They said the sluggish financial sector was dragged down by foreign banks, which suffered poor growth in foreign exchange and offshore activities.</p>

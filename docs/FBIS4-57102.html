			<p>BFN     [Text] The mayor of the Hungarian capital has stated that  friendly ties of cooperation between Havana and Budapest, which  many thought long lost in the wake of changes in Eastern Europe,  can be revitalized and even expanded in the future.    This statement was made during a meeting with Cuban  Ambassador to Hungary Carlos Trejo Sosa. The Hungarian mayor  added that a visit of his Cuban counterpart to Budapest would  greatly contribute to establishing real possibilities for  cooperation between the two cities in the areas of environmental  protection, transport, and others.</p>

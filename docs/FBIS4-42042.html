			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Correspondent] We are speaking with Mr.  Shukurjon Zuhurov, representative of Tajikistan. Mr. Zuhurov,  representatives of the opposition groups have stated that  simultaneously with a ceasefire a nationwide amnesty ought to be  declared. However, the representatives of the state of  Tajikistan were against this proposal. What was the reason for  this opposition?    [Zuhurov, heard briefly speaking in Tajik, fading into  Persian translation] The reason for this is as follows: We  fully agree with this condition. However, we said that we need  time so that we can return to our country and approach the  related bodies to look into the cases of those against whom  criminal proceedings have been issued and to release them from  prison over a period of time. A document must be formulated and  a law must be adopted for this. This will require five to 10  days, or two to three weeks.</p>

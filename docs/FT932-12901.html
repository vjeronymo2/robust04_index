			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Monday Interview: A star of the small screen - Howard Stringer, president of CBS Broadcast Group, talks to Raymond Snoddy Howard Stringer's office in Black Rock, the New York headquarters of CBS, has no shortage of the memorabilia you might expect to find surrounding the president of a US television network. There is a display of Emmy awards and a weighty bronze statue of a bronco rider, a gift from Burt Reynolds, star of the successful CBS sitcom Evening Shade. But, as the Coronation mugs and Welsh national flag on his desk suggest, Stringer hardly fits the stereotype of a top American media executive. Born in Cardiff and educated at Oxford, he served with the US army in Vietnam before rising through the ranks of CBS. More recently, the Welshman has proved himself American television's most astute arbiter of taste, taking CBS's audience ratings from third to first place in the 1991-92 season - the first time any network has made such a jump in a single year. Its ratings supremacy was confirmed last week, with CBS completing the 1992-93 primetime season with the highest overall ratings, while increasing its number of nights with top ratings from two to four. 'Two years ago NBC said that in two years there would be only two networks and that CBS would be the one that would go away,' says Stringer with an understandable sense of satisfaction. It is now NBC that is mired in third place. As president of the CBS Broadcast Group, Stringer is in charge of all the company's broadcasting operations, a Dollars 3.5bn-a-year business which includes the CBS network as well as wholly owned television and radio stations. But although he is the boss of a leading US corporation Stringer is just as likely to be wooing the stars of rival networks as he is to be studying balance sheets. In January, after a long courtship, the CBS president lured away NBC's David Letterman, the popular late-night chat show host, in a deal believed to be worth more than Dollars 40m. Programming victories such as this are starting to translate into profits. Last year CBS had pre-tax profits of Dollars 227m with only Dollars 14m coming from the network, Dollars 170m from CBS television stations and Dollars 21m from radio. This year Ms Jessica Reif, media analyst at Oppenheim, the stockbrokers, is forecasting group pre-tax profits of Dollars 388.7m of which Dollars 170m will come from the network. This is despite the disappointing ratings for the network's sports programming - an area in which CBS has been criticised for overspending. The genial Stringer, 51, has risen to the top at a sedate pace. At 30, when he was a CBS television researcher, he was given the opportunity to produce programmes, and the result was four prize-winning news documentaries. His next big challenge was in 1981 when he was became producer of the CBS Evening News, the network's main evening news programme, which had slipped into third place, behind NBC and ABC. Within two years he had taken the programme to number one, partly by resisting the trend towards short news stories. It has since fallen back into second place. Stringer rose through the CBS ranks during the 1980s, changing jobs every two years as those above him - many brought in from outside the organisation  -were fired. 'I had relationships and a sense of loyalty to the organisation that kept me from being fired,' he says, although he concedes he came close to being sacked when CBS was acquired by Mr Larry Tisch's Loews Corporation in 1986. It was a time of rapid change and Stringer was not only one of the old guard but as executive vice-president of CBS News he was in charge of one of the big spending departments. When he accompanied Tisch on a train journey from New York to Washington he saw it as a make-or-break occasion. Tisch promptly fell asleep, which could have cost Stringer his one chance to get to know the new CBS owner. But Tisch woke up in time to talk, found he liked his employee and made him president of the news operation. 'Then I had to preside over the largest lay-offs in our history,' Stringer laments. 'The company was in third place, the network was in third place and news division was losing Dollars 50m-Dollars 60m a year.' In response, he came up with new programme ideas which, together with spending cuts, started to turn things round. Stringer was happy as head of the news operation. But in 1988, at the annual convention of CBS's affiliates - stations which take network programming - he walked into the centre of a bitter attack on network executives. The affiliates were in open rebellion over CBS's dismal ratings. 'For some reason I was the only one who decided to speak. I took on everything and everyone,' recalls Stringer. Two months later he was head of all of CBS with a brief to take the network out of bottom position. The challenge was not only to increase ratings but do it while cutting costs. In his first year, he cut Dollars 250m from the budget and had to push ahead with another round of lay-offs. How Stringer came to the CBS network in the first place is as remarkable as how he came to run it. Born in Cardiff, he won an assisted place at Oundle, the English public school, and went on to Merton College, Oxford, to read history. He was drawn to America by images of President Kennedy and his 'new frontier' and a belief that England by comparison was a stuffy place. But soon after persuading CBS to give him a clerk's job logging viewers comments, he was drafted into the army. 'For three weeks I had a dilemma. Do I join the army? Do I flee the draft? It was just stubbornness . . . I couldn't get on that plane to get out of the country,' says Stringer, who returned from two years in Vietnam as a sergeant with an army commendation medal. The experience, he says, has given him a certain perspective on the corporate hand-to-hand combat of network television. He has pursued a dual strategy. As CBS president, his first aim was to encourage stability and collaboration after the years of turmoil. He made certain all eight CBS divisions worked closely with one another, and that the corporate headquarters in New York and the entertainment headquarters in Los Angeles had a strong, open relationship. He also installed good communicators in senior positions. 'Whatever you could do in the 1980s, there is no place for autocrats in the 1990s,' Stringer says. In a more stable atmosphere he set about rebuilding his network's performance by concentrating on winning individual programme slots one at a time. On Monday nights, he brought in a hit programme called Murphy Brown, a sharp-edged comedy starring Candice Bergen, and used it as a lead-in to promote the rest of the schedule. On Tuesday nights he began showing popular films aimed at a younger audience. 'It's really a question of consistently slamming home building blocks over four years and when something doesn't work ditching it fast,' he explains. Yet the battle for ratings among the four American networks - CBS, ABC, NBC and Rupert Murdoch's Fox Television - is only one part of the challenge facing Stringer and his counterparts in broadcast television. The proliferation of rival cable and satellite channels - there are expected to be as many as 500 within the next few years - threatens to erode further the networks' audience share, which has declined by a third in the past 15 years to just over 60 per cent. Stringer, however, is relatively optimistic about the future. Technology may create excitement but the networks, he believes, will continue to create the bulk of original programming. On one recent Thursday evening between 9pm and 10pm, Stringer notes, the four networks got 90 per cent of the available audience. The total network share of viewing, he says, increased marginally last year from 62 per cent to 63 per cent and he believes the 60 per cent line can be held. Stringer has signed up for another four years at CBS at more than Dollars 1m a year, but after that he may return to the UK. Last year he was sounded out for the chief executive's job at ITV but he was not interested. If he was offered the director-general's job at the BBC, it might be a different matter. 'I wouldn't rule it out. But by then I'll be too old and probably seen as too American.'

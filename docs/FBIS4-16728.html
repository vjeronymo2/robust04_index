			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Georgian State Council chairman </F> Eduard Shevardnadze by correspondent Nato Oniani in Tbilisi --  live]    [Excerpts] [Oniani] Batono Eduard, in the light of  comparatively less encouraging information received from Geneva  lately, do you think more real significance will be attached to  a statement made by the CIS Security Council?    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. You are right. I  have  already expressed my considerations about the statement made by  the CIS summit. This is a statement which undoubtedly has good  prospects and which may acquire paramount importance in the  issue of settling the Abkhazian conflict. The thing is that we  can renounce none of these possibilities.    The process of negotiations under UN auspices in Geneva is  still in effect. This remains a major trend. And it is very  significant that the specific participation of the CIS countries  in the settlement of the Abkhazian conflict is becoming clearly  visible.    There may be yet another way, the way many people often  speak  about and try to induce us to take, I mean the military way. But  I would say that although we must be ready for this third way,  we have to do our best to exhaust all peaceful options.    This problem cannot and will not remain unsolved. Abkhazia  cannot and will not be lost. This will never happen. This cannot  be allowed to happen. The main thing is not just returning it.  The main thing is that it should happen on time, soon and in a  period as short as possible.    Therefore, the variant which was outlined in Moscow, I mean  the CIS variant can become more real if it leads to our  objective more quickly. If the UN forces are deployed there  mostly as neutral forces and the process drags, it was mentioned  in Geneva that certain units could be gathered by August or a  little earlier or a little after that, this variant will be  unacceptable for us.    Therefore, I attach special importance to what has happened  in Moscow. This is yet another chance to get the Abkhazian  conflict settled promptly and the people returned to their homes  so that they can start a normal life. We shall yield to those  who give us more guarantees.    Now, I am not going to remind you of a known formula given  in  the Moscow statement. However, this might be necessary. First,  we appeal to the United Nations to act promptly and take a  decision which will guarantee refugees a secure and honorable  return to their homes. This will also create guarantees for the  unity and integrity of Georgia and the protection of rights of  Abkhazs within this state.    This in one side of the appeal and the other side of the  statement is that if this cannot be achieved for whatever  reason, the CIS council of collective security will take its own  decision to deploy peace-keeping forces in Abkhazia. I think  this is an important achievement.    Today, I am having a meeting with a delegation I am sending  to Moscow. Mr. Sandro Kavsadze [Shevardnadze's personal envoy  on conflict situations] will return to Moscow together with  other members of the delegation to start seeking the best  possible variants in Moscow so that the statement will not  remain only on paper and the taking of a final decision will not  be dragged out.    Meanwhile, the process in Geneva has not stopped. Today or  tomorrow, talks will resume there. This time, the issue of  Abkhazia's status will be in the foreground. Yet another group  of experts left yesterday. Mr. Jaba Ioseliani is also there  with other representatives. Let's see which way is the  shortest, demanding no sacrifice and securing our territorial  integrity.    [Oniani] Among the documents adopted at the CIS summit, you  paid special attention to the declaration on the sovereignty,  territorial integrity and noninterference in the internal  affairs of the CIS member states. Do you believe that this is a  real guarantee for our sovereignty?    [Shevardnadze] The CIS charter itself and other statutory  documents of political nature and importance contain, in  principle, the ideas and provisions outlined in the declaration,  albeit in a scattered form, in separate clauses, different  documents and so on. But at a time when many CIS countries are  facing serious problems relating directly to their territorial  integrity, when there are a few border disputes - not so many in  our region as elsewhere, when there are movements in some  countries calling for border revision and so on, when conflicts  are going on the territories of a number of countries and the  unity, integrity and inviolability of the borders of many  countries are under direct threat, I believe that today, at the  current stage, when we are heading for a crisis, the declaration  has great importance.    To be honest, I left the news conference slightly  disappointed because neither journalists nor other participants  in the news conference paid proper attention to this document  and ignored its highly important provisions. I repeat that the  recognition of territorial integrity, sovereignty, equal rights,  noninterference in internal affairs, and some other principles  should become the CIS's cornerstone and foundation. At least,  that is what the document says.    Apart from these interesting and highly significant  provisions, there is also a clause which is of special  importance to us and, in my opinion, not only to us. It says  that separatism and separatist movements should not be used to  violate the integrity of states. In fact, a common approach and  position have emerged and they are shared by all the CIS member  states. This is very important today and in the future.  [passage indistinct: Oniani's remark on definition of separatism]    [Shevardnadze] It can be said without exaggeration that it  is  Georgia's priority to look for formulas and definitions, and not  only Georgia's. Everybody has finally understood how serious a  threat -- at least within the CIS -- aggressive separatist  movements are today. I would add on this subject that if the  CIS remains committed to these principles, then it will acquire  more and more (?qualities) of a true interstate organization and  an international status.    What we have at the moment...[pauses] I repeat that if our  relations within the CIS are built on these principles, it will  become an international organization in which all the states of  the former Soviet Union -- and perhaps others too in the future  -- will cooperate freely and successfully with the aim of  achieving their goals and receiving guarantees of their freedom  and independence. If these principles are adhered to, the CIS  may become one of the guarantors of a free and independent  development of its members.    [Oniani] Thank you. Agreements of economic character were  signed at the summit, for instance, about a free trade zone, or  pertaining to an integral economic space and others. Later, you  defined these documents as a favorable economic integration. To  what extent do you think Russia feels the necessity of  establishing economic relations based on equal rights and to  what extent do you think economic integration will promote  political integration?    [Shevardnadze] Economic integration is one of the major  tendencies in the world today and among not only developed  countries but also numerous developing countries that have  overcome an economic and social crisis of which we have numerous  examples in the east, south or west. This is a result of an  involvement in the process of economic integration, which  answers the standards of today's requirements.    Economic integration is a basis of any sort of modern union  or alliance. Economic integration must become the basis of the  process of the unity of the Black Sea basin countries we have  already started. The CIS can become a major, one of the major  guarantors of stability across the space of the former Soviet  Union and it will become this if economic processes are managed  correctly. If this fails, additional political difficulties and  additional difficulties in social sphere will arise.    I think that unlike the previous years, we, all the states,  have to take care of the CIS as of a formation which can act as  a sort of guarantor of independent development. This is  possible all right. Unless we take care of this, we may receive  variants which will be hard and unacceptable for our life and  development.    We could speak about former Yugoslavia as an example. We can  all see an eventuality when a region does not care about its own  guarantees. The present horrible tragedy is a result of  disregarding all that was useful and essential for the  countries, even from the point of view of economic integration  only. Therefore, I think that economic integration, care about a  single space in science, culture, judicial and other spheres may  become definite guarantees of economic, social and political  stability for the CIS countries. But economic integration still  remains the basis.    I will naturally be asked a question whether a manifestation  of great-power tendencies can be expected along with the  usefulness and beneficial features of integration. It is  impossible to rule out this. But when we are together, when  there exists a system of managing all processes like the council  of heads of states, the council of heads of governments and many  other securing instruments, I think a domination of negative  tendencies is less likely. At least we are capable of  preventing those today. At least, it is easier to do this when  we all are together than separately, when we deal with bilateral  relations. However, I would not like to diminish the  significance of bilateral relations with it.    Once documents in the sphere of economy are signed, a lot  will depend on an initiative abilities of the Cabinet of  Ministers, individual ministries, associations, private business  and generally ordinary citizens who also have possibilities and  rights at the same time to establish relations with other  countries, citizens of other countries in the economic sphere.    Thus, prospects are good and interesting. Now, the main  thing is how much initiative and courage we shall be able to  demonstrate in our activities at the present stage.    [Oniani] You mentioned the former Yugoslavia. In assessing  last week's bombing by NATO planes of Serb positions near  Gorazde, you said that it was the first serious attempt to  counter the phenomenon of war with force. Do you think that  NATO's involvement in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia was  a success? Does it mean that NATO has begun taking up a  peacekeeping role -- something you were discussing a long time  ago, at the beginning of the war in Abkhazia?    [Shevardnadze] As for the specific issue of Yugoslavia, I  think that a great number of mistakes and sins have been  committed there, starting from the first stage, when the  disintegration of the state was beginning. My impression is  that countries which could have played a role in preventing this  drama and tragedy failed to agree among themselves. However,  this is a thing of the past.    I would like to touch upon another issue, which is more  fundamental and substantive. Today it is Yugoslavia, tomorrow  it may be Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan or Tajikistan.  Unfortunately, it is difficult to rule out that such conflicts  can break out in other regions. Therefore, I think that endless  debates and discussions as well as slowness, which is so typical  of the UN -- I called it an academic style in the past, now I am  speaking about slowness -- lead to most serious results in the  end.    We are often prisoners of regulations created by ourselves  and our predecessors. We keep failing to free ourselves from  this captivity. I am profoundly convinced that, in the end, the  UN with all its institutions and structures should take up the  role of supreme judge in the world. By the way, this function  is enshrined in its charter and in its structure. Everything is  there in theory. Unless this happens, the UN itself will be in  serious danger.    The interesting ideas of reforming the UN, as outlined in  the  secretary-general's report -- and I welcomed these ideas --  should result in concrete action, not in a large number of  resolutions. You know how many wonderful resolutions on Abkhazia  have been passed during the past year. And what do we have now?    [Oniani] Nothing in the end.    [Shevardnadze] How many wonderful resolutions were passed on  Yugoslavia and other countries. There were five or six  resolutions in connection with the Karabakh conflict. The  shower of resolutions must end and practical actions should  start, practical and courageous actions to solve conflicts.  Otherwise, we will have to deal not only with conflicts, but  also large-scale wars in the near future.    [Oninai] Having returned from Moscow, you said at the  meeting of the Union of Georgia's Citizens: I want you to be  tolerant toward other political organizations, it is necessary  to begin a dialogue with political parties, to cooperate and  unite around at least those five or six basic principles which  by themselves can unite any force and so on and so forth. Now  that we can say that we live virtually in the period of election  campaign, do statements like this made by the chairman of the  Union of Georgia's Citizens mean that it will not participate in  elections separately but jointly with another political  organization or other political organizations?    [Shevardnadze] When speaking at the meeting of the board of  the Union of Citizensabout about the tolerance and principles  that all Georgian citizens should live with, I meant the Union  of Georgia's Citizens and the whole population of Georgia. I  cannot help hailing our great academic and great philosopher  Niko Chavchavadze, who put forward this issue so courageously at  a parliament meeting recently.    The issue of Georgia's existence will very much depend on  our  ability to live a friendly and brotherly life with all the  people actually living alongside us in Georgia. This was the  main line when I spoke about tolerance and I want this feature  to become an essential and integral part of each member who  linked his fate with the Union of Georgia's Citizens.    I have also suggested that we cooperate with all forces  whose  thoughts meet state standards and who place the state interest  above all. I mean all patriotic forces. I certainly do not rule  out a joint platform in various aspects of elections, be it  parliament elections or elections of the head of state or  president in future, in the elections of local authorities and  so on.    I have observed that there certain gradual changes are  taking  place in the stances of many political parties. This has  occurred in issues pertaining to relations with Russia, with the  CIS. The aggressiveness so characteristic two or three months  ago has diminished. Some even try to overtake us. We have long  wanted to be friendly with Russia, they say. They do not  renounce the CIS and so on. I can only welcome this. Because  this is an evidence of our parties' becoming more tolerant. At  least those, who did not share this stance in the past, have  become more realistic in relation with life.    If this process keeps going I do not rule out that the Union  of Georgia's Citizens will propose a joint platform with some  other political forces in order that we all together build a  democratic state of Georgia and solve the most difficult  problems that have accumulated in social spheres and save the  people, the country and the nation. I reiterate, I do not rule  out our cooperation with any really patriotic force and every  individual citizen.    [Oniani] In recent days, relative cleanness and order have  been established in Tbilisi. It has become perceptible, at  least. More public transport have appeared in the streets.  Does it mean that this process of stabilization, as seen by  these first signs, will go on or this will have a shape of a  one-time campaign to which we are quite accustomed,  unfortunately.    [Shevardnadze] We can now speak of first steps only. We have  grounds neither for great joy nor for a bitter disappointment.  We become convinced that a lot, if not everything, depends on  us and we are to handle it.    Every morning, the moment I get into the car, I request a  report on crimes committed in Georgia during the past 24 hours.  It was only this morning that I heard that a mere seven  criminal offenses were committed in the past 24 hours. There  were no cases of homicide, no other grave crimes. Even in the  past, when that huge machine was fighting crime, days like this  were rare.    I do not mean that all is well now, that everything has been  well arranged, but do we not see that there can be a positive  result? [passage omitted]    Almost 80 enterprises have started running in recent days.  Nothing has been produced and nothing has been done for the past  two or three months. Some of these have been shown on  television, but not all. We have to show the people this  process. Work is beginning, production is beginning. Once we  yield production, we shall have goods and small resources and  reserves will be created for the country to exist. [passage  omitted]    We often hear reprimands that the government is anti-reform,  that there are no reforms, no program, no concept. To tell you  the truth, I am tired of such talk. I beg everyone to read what  has already been written, what is known, what is in effect.  Take the plan of coming out of the crisis approved by the  Cabinet of Ministers and which I endorsed and which was drafted  on the basis of my edict. There exists a plan like this.  Stages for the implementation this plan in the countryside as  well as in town, in industry and trade have been defined. We  have the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank  recommendations which have been arranged lately and have  received their ultimate shape.    I would like to appeal to everyone to get familiarized with  all this. Sheer words that reforms do not exist and the  authorities are anti-reformist cannot do any good. This is not  a way out.

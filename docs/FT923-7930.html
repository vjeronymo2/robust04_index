			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / International Company News: Second-quarter loss for Equitable Life parent EQUITABLE Companies, the parent group of Equitable Life, the fifth largest life insurer in the US, yesterday reported a second-quarter after-tax loss of Dollars 17.6m in the wake of heavy losses from real estate investments. The result, however, was still a considerable improvement on the Dollars 212.6m loss incurred at the same stage of 1991. Yesterday's results cover the period before Equitable was transformed from a mutual to a stock company by last month's Dollars 392m stock-market flotation. The group had to take an extraordinary Dollars 25.9m charge to cover the cost of the demutualisation, which meant the final net loss for Equitable in the second quarter was Dollars 43.5m. The primary factors in the losses on Equitable's insurance investment portfolio were additions to valuation allowances and write-downs in publicly traded securities, which over the past six months have totalled Dollars 131.7m, although they were partly offset by investment gains of Dollars 61.8m. The bulk of the investment losses was for valuation allowances set aside for mortgages. Equitable said problem commercial property mortgages at June 30 represented 7.5 per cent of the commercial portfolio, up from 4.4 per cent at the end of 1991. After the write-downs and additions to valuations, Equitable's insurance units produced an after-tax loss of Dollars 43.7m in the April-to-June period, compared with the Dollars 218.5m loss incurred in the second quarter of 1991. The company, however, believes the insurance operations are regaining their footing after a difficult 1991. New individual premiums and deposits were up on a year ago, and surrenders and withdrawals of individual insurance and annuities were down. Equitable's investment businesses segment, which includes the brokerage firm Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and asset management companies, put in a strong second-quarter performance. They contributed after-tax profits of Dollars 48.9m, almost double the contribution of a year ago. DLJ was the star performer, thanks to market share gains in the underwriting business, which led to higher commission and fee income. Investors were slightly disappointed with Equitable's results, and the company's share price was marked down Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8 7/8 .</p>

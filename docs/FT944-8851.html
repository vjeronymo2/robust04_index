			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / EU telecoms deadline set EU member states last night set a clear deadline of January 1 1998 for liberalising telecommunications infrastructures. In a move which should sharply lower prices in Europe's highly regulated telecoms sector, industry ministers agreed to open up all networks to competition within three years. Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece can delay by a further five years if they choose. The move will allow companies offering telecom services a much greater choice of network provider and the right to build their own infrastructures. The decision fell well short of Commission ambitions to press ahead with liberalisation of infrastructures next year, however. And at the end of the meeting advocates of swifter deregulation - Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland and Britain - issued a statement urging Brussels to 'come forward as quickly as possible with proposals' to liberalise the alternative networks such as cable TV, road, rail and energy networks. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, is considering using special powers that would allow him to force open cable TV networks to competition, without a vote from the council of ministers.

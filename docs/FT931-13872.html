			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Letter: Russian arts need proper funding Sir, John Lloyd's article, 'The arts perform a dance of death' (January 16), reads a mite pessimistically. Russian culture does indeed risk both bastardisation and provincialism, but it has withstood worse. What is of particular concern is the use of what funds are available. A fraction of the cost of the 'operatic pageant' which Lloyd argues 'should have been' a showcase event this summer could have enabled the reopening of the first few splendidly restored rooms of the State Historical Museum, under the very windows of which it was held. That museum, an architecturally unique 19th century building, has breathtaking collections that travel the world but remain invisible at home. The government has appeared to lack any arts policy at all, but perhaps there are signs of change. John Lloyd also fails to mention the question of cost. Massive funding for films 'that three people saw' and musicians who 'never perform in public' is all very well, but people need running water too. A proper arts policy requires a solid safety net of government funding. This implies a properly administered taxation system. Verina Glaessner, 80 Balcombe Street, London NW1 6NE</p>

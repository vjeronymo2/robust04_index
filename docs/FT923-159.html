			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Canada lifts interest rates to aid dollar THE Bank of Canada pushed domestic interest rates up sharply yesterday in an attempt to brake a sharp fall in the Canadian dollar. The Canadian currency began sliding in early September but the fall has accelerated in the past two weeks, first in response to the turmoil in international financial markets, and more recently on fears that voters will reject proposals for a new Canadian constitution in a referendum scheduled for October 26. The drop in the dollar led the Bank of Canada to lift its overnight call rate by 3 percentage points yesterday morning to 7.75 per cent. Commercial banks have not yet raised their lending rates, however. Their prime rate is currently at 6.25 per cent. Based on yesterday's peak in money market rates, the prime rate should be in the 7.5-8 per cent range. But no bank wants to be first to reverse a two-year decline in rates, and the banks are also unsure how long the upturn in money-market rates will last. By late yesterday the Bank of Canada had lowered its call rate again below 6 per cent. The dollar, which was trading at almost 84 US cents at the end of August, has fallen by 2 cents in the past two days. It tumbled as low as 79.27 US cents yesterday, its lowest level since early 1988 and some 11 per cent below the peak reached in November 1991, before staging a partial recovery following the jump in interest rates to close at 79.94 cents. 'The markets are starting to build in the worst-case scenario of the country breaking up,' the chief economist of one Toronto securities firm said yesterday. Recent public opinion polls show that opponents of the constitutional deal have a clear lead in Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia. Mr Brian Mulroney, prime minister, warned earlier this week that a No vote would mean 'the beginning of the process of dismantling Canada'. With inflation in Canada running at an annual rate slightly above 1 per cent, most economists are confident that interest rates will drop back once the political uncertainty and international currency upheaval is over. Goldman Sachs in New York told clients earlier this week that recent turmoil in Canadian financial markets 'may be overdone'. The firm said that even in the event of a No vote, 'nothing happens - at least immediately - and we simply revert to the status quo of the last few years'. Although opponents of the constitutional deal, known as the Charlottetown Agreement, have made a strong showing in the early stages of the referendum campaign, most commentators expect the Yes campaign to catch up in coming weeks. The constitutional reforms would be the most far-reaching changes to Canada's system of government since the federation was formed 125 years ago. They include changing the Senate from an appointed to an elected house, giving wider powers to provincial governments, and recognising the right to self-government for Canada's 600,000 aboriginal people. Quebec would gain the right to 'preserve and promote' its distinct identity. Some experts contend that the resource-rich prairie provinces and the less well-off regions of Atlantic Canada will gain extra clout in Ottawa through the revamped Senate.</p>

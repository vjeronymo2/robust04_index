			<p>Korea       SUMMARY:  Two South Korean press reports warn that U.S. and ROK  leaders would be making a "grave mistake" in thinking that the third  round of U.S.-North Korea talks would lead to an agreement with  North Korea, allowing the two Koreas to exchange special envoys and  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to conduct full-scale  inspections of DPRK nuclear sites.  Both press reports conclude that  North Korea will not easily relinquish its "nuclear card" and that  the United States and the ROK should not be too optimistic when  dealing with the DPRK.      According to the 2O January CHUNGANG ILBO, several Beijing-based  diplomats of former Eastern Bloc nations and western analysts with a  background on PRC and DPRK affairs believe that North Korea will  hold on to its "nuclear card" as long as it is useful.  These  experts said the DPRK is "well aware that the nuclear issue is only  the beginning," and once that is settled, the Clinton administration  will just move on to the human rights issue, which will eventually  lead up to Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il.      CHUNGANG's sources opined that North Korea will stand firm on the  nuclear issue until the U.S. Government guarantees it will:  1)  suspend Team Spirit, 2) refrain from imposing economic sanctions on  North Korea, 3) re-establish diplomatic relations with the DPRK, 4)  recognize and accept the current North Korean political structure,  and 5) give aid to North Korea.  CHUNGANG notes that a "high-ranking  ROK Embassy official" in Beijing agrees with this assessment, and  furthermore is of the opinion that since "the PRC leaders know what  North Korea is after, they can only go so far in influencing and  advising the North on the nuclear issue."      The February WOLGAN CHOSON quotes Yi Tong-pok--an expert with 2O  years of experience on North Korean affairs at the National Security  Planning Board (NSP) and a special assistant to the NSP director  until December 1993--who holds the view that the DPRK created the  nuclear weapons program to sustain its political structure, in other  words, to "keep the Kim dynasty alive."  Yi also sys that North  Korea will not give up its "nuclear card," unless it is a matter of  life or death.  Furthermore, he affirms, the North "cannot  financially afford to start a war against the United States and  South Korea at this time, or in the near future."  He also states  that the North is playing a waiting game, hoping that the  "impatient" U.S. Government will "cave in" first.  Fortunately, the  U.S.-South Korean side has the advantage, because the North "can  only buy so much time," given the state of its economy, Yi says.  He  further advises that approaching the North with only "carrots" would  give the wrong signal, because this will be viewed as a "sign of  weakness," whereas using "more sticks" might bring better results.  Many experts believe that economic sanctions will not hurt North  Korea since it has so little trade with other countries, but in Yi's  opinion, the country will be "hurt badly" if the sanctions can  effectively stop the flow of cash from the "Chochongnyon" (pro-North  organization of Koreans in Japan).      Yi goes on to say that continuing efforts to carry on a dialogue  with the North to deter it from making or attempting to make nuclear  weapons and to prevent it from "weakening or destroying" the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Non-Proliferation  Treaty (NPT) are the "current tasks" of the U.S. Government.  He  believes that both the United States and South Korea must show that  they do not fear North Korea and know how to cope with the  situation, even if that country already has one or two nuclear  weapons.  As long as the United States shows patience in dealing  with the DPRK, time is on its side, according to Yi.      (AUTHOR:  TOMPKINS.

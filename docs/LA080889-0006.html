GERMANY  </P> <P> One hundred East Germans who took advantage of Hungary's dismantled border  fences to flee to the West will arrive in West Germany today.  </P> <P> Giessen city official Hans Haeuser said the refugees, leaving in two special  cars of a train from Vienna on Monday night, will be housed in the main transit  camp for East Germans in Giessen.  </P> <P> In Bonn, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the refugees had made their way to  the West German Embassy in Vienna after Hungary removed its border fences with  Austria.  </P> <P> Since taking down the fences, Hungary has stepped up border patrols further  inland to turn back East Germans trying to take advantage of the holes in the  Iron Curtain.  </P></p>

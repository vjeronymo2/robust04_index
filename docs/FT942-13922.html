			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Investigators raid Schneider to hunt for evidence of fraud Criminal investigators launched raids across Germany yesterday in a hunt for evidence to support suspicions of fraud after last week's collapse of Mr Jurgen Schneider's private property empire. The search covered Schneider offices in Frankfurt, Munich and Konigstein, and the homes and other properties of family members and their tax advisers, officials said. A private inquiry has been opened at Deutsche Bank, which is owed DM1.2bn (Pounds 475m) by the Schneider group, and which has become the centre of a storm of political and popular outrage over the affair. According to Mr Hilmar Kopper, the bank's chairman, any 'mistakes' uncovered by independent auditors - who are due to report to him in three weeks - would lead to 'consequences' for those responsible, including main board members. Mr Kopper, who is expected to face the press at a briefing next Monday, admitted there may have been 'mistakes' after reports that Deutsche Bank had advanced excessive credits on properties which contained less lettable space than Mr Schneider claimed. These revelations led to speculation that employees at Deutsche and other creditor banks may have been involved in the suspected fraud. The Hesse prosecutors' office said 'in clarification' yesterday it was not investigating any bank employees. This followed a statement from the office's spokesman on Wednesday that such a probe could not be ruled out. The property group's bankruptcy, with debts of more than DM5bn, has stirred up further popular antagonism against a banking community already under fire for allegedly failing to pass on lower interest rates to customers and being reluctant to invest in eastern German industry. Deutsche Bank has also been heavily criticised for its part in the recent near-collapse of the Metallgesellschaft group, prevented only by a DM3.4bn rescue package. The Schneider affair, in which most of the banks' loans are secured against valuable properties, has now prompted accusations that their lax lending practices have led indirectly to heavy financial and job losses among contractors, architects and other Schneider suppliers.

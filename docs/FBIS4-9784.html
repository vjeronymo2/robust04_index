			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Betancur from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] As has been reported, Zambian Foreign Minister Remmy  Mushota is visiting Cuba. Foreign Relations Minister Roberto  Robaina has commented on possible economic ties that might be  established with Zambia and other topics of interest.    [Begin recording] [Robaina] Our people want to find an  economic solution to the situation we are facing. This economic  solution does not only depend on finding business deals that are  more or less advantageous. It also depends on what constitutes a  need for us but which could become an investment opportunity for  others. In all honesty, we have things that could be useful to  other countries and, in this particular case, to Zambia. The  foreign minister is visiting with this delegation to expand on  the talks we began in Zambia and to contact the Ministries and  institutes that control agriculture, tourism, sports, health,  and education.    [Unidentified reporter] What trade potential does...  [pauses]  What does Zambia have that Cuba needs, and what does Cuba have...    [Robaina, interrupting] No, the potential is not excessively  great. We cannot develop it based on whether or not great  potential exists. We develop it by opening a path in the fields  of education, health, and sports. We have attained significant  results, and the Zambians are very interested in learning about  these results and in establishing important economic trade under  conditions of mutual benefit.    [Reporter] Are there any Zambians here?    [Robaina] There are Zambian students who are attending  universities here mainly in the eastern provinces.    [Reporter] They are not on the Isle of Pines?    [Robaina] No. In the particular case of Zambia, they are  studying at the university and [words indistinct].    [Reporter] How many are there?    [Robaina] Just a few of them; not very many, but a few. [end  recording]    Robaina also discussed aspects relating to his next Latin  American tour.    [Begin recording] [Robaina] Soon, I will begin a tour  through  Latin America on an official visit that includes several  countries.    [Reporter] Which countries?    [Robaina] Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru, and Argentina.    [Reporter] And how about Paraguay?    [Robaina] We are discussing the possibility of an official  visit to Paraguay. We have no relations with Paraguay; we are  trying to find a way. It all depends on a confirmation and any  step that is taken is important, particularly any step that  helps us know one another better.    [Reporter] Any comments on the apology made by the Colombian  daily EL TIEMPO about the...    [Robaina, interrupting] There is a saying that goes like  this: Sooner or later, life will prove you right. In this case,  sooner or later, time proved we were right.    [Reporter] What is the current status of relations with  Colombia now that this issue has been resolved?    [Robaina] Well, I would avoid using the term current status  because we feel these relations were never affected. In other  words, since relations were established, nothing has affected  them as far as we are concerned. I believe that for those who  had any doubts, life and reality have proved we were right. We  have nothing to rectify because from the very beginning we  voiced what our position was.    [Reporter] What did EL TIEMPO say?    [Robaina] EL TIEMPO said it regretted having published  statements that were unfounded, and this evidently made it  retract the story. I prefer that a final conclusion be made by  those who read the newspaper's apology. We have nothing else to  say. Whatever we had to say, we said it at the appropriate time.    [Reporter] How about visits by Colombian officials to Cuba?    [Robaina] These visits continue; there are no problems in  this area.    [Reporter] Including the visit by the foreign minister?    [Robaina] That is right, including the visit by the foreign  minister.    [Reporter] What is your opinion of Gaviria's election to the  post of OAS secretary general?    [Robaina] I think comments on this topic should be made by  those who are members of that organization. I think Gaviria is a  conscientious person who has prestige and is well respected, and  this will be helpful.    [Reporter] He speaks about more solidarity and a strong  relationship among all countries of the region.    [Robaina] I think that this is a good thing for a new  secretary general to say. [end recording]    You have just heard statements made by Cuban foreign  minister  after receiving in Havana his Zambian counterpart, Remmy  Mushota. In addition to the official talks with his counterpart,  the Zambian visitor will also meet with the heads of the sugar  industry; public health; the Sports Institute; the State  Committee for Economic Cooperation; and Carlos Lage, vice  president of the State Council.</p>

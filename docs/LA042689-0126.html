			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Marvin Davis Loses a Round: A Delaware Chancery Court judge denied, for now, a  request by Marvin Davis for an injunction on NWA Inc.'s "poison pill"  anti-takeover defense. But Chancellor William P. Allen said Davis could return  to court after NWA's annual meeting May 15. Davis contended that a provision of  the poison pill would make it hard for a Davis-backed board of directors to  sell the company. Davis is trying to unseat the board of NWA, the parent of  Northwest Airlines, and has made a hostile $2.7-billion bid for the company.  </P></p>

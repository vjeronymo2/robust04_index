			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Jobs: Ex-cathedra injustice to the vast majority - Public clocks, pillars of the establishment and the known facts about the executive-pay question WHY are most of Britain's famous public clocks, such as Big Ben, marked with Roman numerals rather than Arabic figures? While the question may seem abstruse, there is more than one way in which it is timely. My reason for posing it is that it's the best answer I can give to another question lately thrown at me by several callers in reference to my comments on executive pay a fortnight ago. What they demand to know, usually with a cackle, is why the Archbishop of Canterbury doesn't read the Jobs column. But, just in case the connections between the two questions aren't instantly apparent, I had better offer a bit of explanation. The drift of the comments a fortnight back was that most public debate in Britain about executive pay is pointless. Whenever the topic is raised, the discussion typically degrades into sweeping exchanges between folk professing themselves opposed to greed on one side, and self-declared proponents of enterprise on the other. Being not only a member of both camps myself, but failing to see any necessary conflict between them, I dubbed their bickering the 'dialogue of the deluded'. Whereupon the very next Sunday the Archbishop of Canterbury ascended to the pulpit of Derby Cathedral, and threw in his lot with the anti-greed party. Hence the cackling callers' question about why he doesn't read the Jobs column. The straight answer is that, not having managed to contact him, I don't know. Most probably, he just feels no need to. But some additional light may be thrown on the matter by the question about the famous timepieces. For one suggested solution to it is that such clocks were erected to the wishes, and so designed to the tastes of pillars of the country's establishment, who had traditionally received a Classical education. While that versed them in Roman numerals, the argument goes, it left them un-familiar with Arabic figures and loth to heed the more complex data that can be couched therein. They prefer to think on the broader, bolder scale associated with the ancients. How far that theory applies personally to the archbishop is another thing I am unsure of. Nor, it must be admitted, was I present at his sermon. Moreover, from the numerous press reports and commentaries I have pored over, it is clear that he expressed admiration for industrialists and 'affirmed wealth creation'. Even so, that did not deter him from also tainting them with avarice, and using an unjustly broad brush to do it. For most reports are agreed that a key passage of his homily ran: 'Within our own society, our collective commitment to industrial enterprise will remain under-powered if the fruits of success appear to be concentrated too heavily in the pockets of shareholders and senior executives. For example, massive individual pay rises during a recession do not encourage public support for wealth-creation.' Although he did not say how many shareholders and senior executives he was impugning, the implication is surely that they were appreciably large in number and to be found throughout the wealth-generating sector. That implication is at odds with such facts as are known, the latest of which emerged well in time for the archbishop to scan ahead of preaching. They come from the British Institute of Management's yearly pay survey, and I cited them two weeks ago to show that, excepting the fat-cattery of City banking, the number of Britain's managers enjoying high pay and 'massive' rises is small and confined to the top ranks of the biggest outfits. Even though the attempt proved vain, I'm having another go in the shape of the underlying table. The latest survey covered managerial staff (20,609 all told) in 340 companies. But my figures refer only to the 289 of them that also took part in the previous year's study, so as to give a fairer idea of recent rises in pay as well as present levels. The managers are divided into chief executives, other board-members, five lower ranks of management, and senior staff. Besides giving the findings across all the 289 companies, I have broken them down into four categories by sales turnover. As may be seen, the only group who received increases appreciably above the 8 per cent average for Britain's whole workforce are the chief executives of outfits with sales of over Pounds 600m. And while the eminences in that group did egregiously well - on average, they are now paid Pounds 3.74 for every Pounds 1 going to the chiefs of companies with less than Pounds 25m turnover - there were fewer than 20 of them. In pointing that out, however, I do not expect it to count for much with establishment pillars who, in line with the clock hypothesis, scarcely deign to ponder such pettifogging details. Indeed, to judge by the FT's letters column, they've already risen above the mere pay issue. With the aid of an article by Professor Charles Handy which we published the day after the archbishop had spoken, they have seized on another of his preachings - to the effect that one of the things which ought not to be the prime purpose of business is serving the interests of shareholders. Whether that in fact should or should not be the case seems now to be the hot as well as the broader, bolder topic. All I can say on it is, whatever the ethical rights and wrongs of putting shareholders first, British companies don't seem to do it in fixing top pay levels. Witness a study of 51 of the biggest groups by Stefan Szymanski of London Business School, in which he examined the links between directors' pay, sales turnover, and value to stockholders in terms of earnings per share over the decade from 1981 to last year. The pay had gone up - on the whole, nearly five-fold - and in individual companies had some link with sales turnover. But the relationship with earnings per share was virtually zero.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Kuwait offers payment terms for bad debts KUWAIT'S parliament yesterday approved a law outlining repayment terms for a Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.5bn) bad debt problem which has handicapped the economy for more than a decade, Reuter reports from Kuwait. The law, which offers a 54 per cent debt write-off to the biggest borrowers if they pay back the money within two years, follows a nine-month struggle for a solution to the issue. The law was submitted by a joint committee of the parliament's legal and economic affairs committees last week. It won 34 out 43 votes after yesterday's heated 12-hour debate. Economists said long-term economic revival was impossible without a solution to the issue, which stems from the crash in 1982 of an informal stock exchange and from commercial losses aggravated by Iraq's 1990-91 occupation. The 9,546 corporate and individual borrowers include big business concerns. Their names have not been published.</p>

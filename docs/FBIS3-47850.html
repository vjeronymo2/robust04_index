			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News Behind the News" column] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu came to the [Foreign  Ministry] press room on 17 January and strongly denied reports  that the United States was pressing the government to change the  declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula into  an international treaty by saying that "the contents are  exaggerated."    Minister Han explained that "after North Korea withdrew from  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in March last year, some  U.S. officials suggested that such a measure may be possible.  However, no further discussion or exchange of propositions  between the ROK and U.S. Governments have taken place."    This incident is known to have developed from Minister Han's  slip in a discussion held on 14 January in which he said,  "Although the United States feels that the denuclearization  declaration should become an international treaty, the  prevailing opinion in the ROK is that there should be room left  to possess nuclear reprocessing facilities."    Regarding this remark, Minister Han explained with  embarrassment, "I answered that way thinking that it would be  too beautifying to simply say `no' when asked whether there was  any difference in opinion between the ROK and the United States  on the nuclear issue, and I meant that such may be a  possibility."</p>

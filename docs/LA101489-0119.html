			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: BUYING LIFE INSURANCE RIGHT FROM THE SOURCE  </P> <P> Let's face it, buying life insurance can be a drag. Most consumers assume they  must buy it through an insurance agent -- and prefer to do so anyway.  </P> <P> But if you are willing to bear the extra burden of shopping for yourself and  buying directly from an insurance company, you could save big bucks.  </P> <P> A small but growing number of insurance companies are offering so-called  "low-load" insurance policies that carry lower sales commissions than policies  bought through agents -- if you buy the policies directly from the companies.  </P> <P> The concept of direct marketing has also reached auto and homeowners'  insurance. Firms such as 20th Century, which bypass sales forces and sell  directly to the public, have saved consumers hundreds of dollars through  reduced commission fees. Buying a no-load or low-load mutual fund can also save  you hundreds of dollars in commissions.  </P> <P> Similar savings can be had in life insurance, particularly if you are buying  universal life, whole life or another type of cash-value policy that has a  savings component as well as a death benefit. Those are the types of policies  on which sales commissions are the greatest.  </P> <P> With low-load policies, you will usually save in the form of a lower surrender  charge -- the part of your premium that you forfeit if you cancel the policy.  With agent-sold policies, you'll usually forfeit most or all of your premium if  you cancel in the first one or two years. But with a low-load policy, you'll  likely get most or all of your premium back, says James H. Hunt, a director of  the National Insurance Consumer Organization.  </P> <P> For example, for a policy where you pay a $2,000 annual premium (not unusual  for someone age 45 on a policy with a $100,000 death benefit), you may get as  much as $1,800 back on a low-load policy that you cancel within the first year,  Hunt says. But if you cancel an agent-sold policy, you may get little or  nothing back, he says.  </P> <P> In effect, the cost of changing your mind is much lower with a low-load policy.  </P> <P> Further, a low-load annuity -- an investment contract that allows you to  receive future payments, presumably after you retire -- might give you a better  investment performance in the form of a higher interest rate because fees will  be lower.  </P> <P> Low-load annuities can earn as much as 75 basis points more in a year (100  basis points equals 1 percentage point) than standard plans, says Glenn Daily,  an independent insurance consultant in New York and author of an upcoming book,  "The Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Insurance Products."  </P> <P> So, even if you eventually go through an agent, at least inquiring about  low-load policies can be helpful. "It will give you some starting point, some  basis for comparison," Daily says.  </P> <P> But beware: Low-loads have potential drawbacks, too.  </P> <P> For one, not all low-load products perform better or are less expensive than  conventional policies. In the case of term insurance -- the type that offers a  death benefit only, with no investment or cash-value component -- the savings  can be negligible. You may be able to find agent-sold policies that are  cheaper, Daily says.  </P> <P> Some low-load policies also are available only through financial planners. The  policy may be less expensive, but you may have to pay a big fee to the planner.  </P> <P> Also, remember that buying on your own means you must do research yourself. You  won't have an agent do a lot of the shopping, product comparison and  hand-holding for you.  </P> <P> And you will have fewer choices. Daily says he has identified only eight  companies that offer low-load plans, far fewer than the several hundred  offering full-commission policies.  </P> <P> Having considered these drawbacks, where can you go for a low-load plan?  </P> <P> For cash-value life insurance, analyst Hunt recommends USAA, at (800) 531-8000,  and Ameritas, (800) 255-9678. Other firms offering low-load, cash-value  policies include: American Life of New York, (212) 581-1200; Colonial Penn,  (215) 988-8000; Essex (201) 325-3655; John Alden through Fee for Service, (813)  874-5662, and Lincoln Benefit, (800) 525-9287.  </P> <P> For annuities, Hunt suggests starting with USAA. This company has shown some of  the highest and most consistent investment returns on its annuities, Hunt says.  </P> <P> Other firms also offering low-load annuities, Daily says, are Essex, John Alden  and Lincoln Benefit.  </P> <P> For term insurance, try American Life, Lincoln Benefit or USAA. The latter  tends to offer the best rates of the three, although generally for younger  customers, Hunt says.  </P> <P> When shopping for these, specify that you are interested in their low-load  products, because some also sell full-commission plans as well.  </P> <P> Gail Hillebrand, an attorney in the San Francisco office of Consumers Union,  publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, suggests asking several questions: Is  there a load? What are the surrender charges? If I only keep the policy for one  or two years, how much of the premium will I get back? This is especially  important if you are looking for whole or universal life policies, because  commission fees can be so huge in the early years, she notes.  </P> <P> If you need more help, consider the booklet "How to Save Money on Life  Insurance" ($11.95; National Insurance Consumer Organization, 121 N. Payne St.,  Alexandria, Va., 22314.)  </P> <P> Bill Sing welcomes readers' comments and suggestions for columns but regrets  that he cannot respond to individual' letters.

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOATS, PEOPLE  </P> <P> Killing 2,000 goats on Santa Catalina is a very logical act. The balance of  nature is necessary for the survival of all things.  </P> <P> When an "unbalanced" situation occurs -- too many goats -- how divine of  mankind to step in and set it straight.  </P> <P> Using this same logic, we will notice the other "unbalanced" situation that is  going on -- too many people -- and thus proceed in the same fashion. (Pity that  the goats can't pull the trigger.) By reducing world population by 50%, I am  certain that the "native grasses, shrubs and animals -- such as fox -- will be  able to thrive." As Jane Goodall mentioned, it is "the arrogance of mankind"  that uses one form of logic for animals and another for the human race.  </P> <P> DIANE MINZEY  </P> <P> Canyon Country  </P></p>

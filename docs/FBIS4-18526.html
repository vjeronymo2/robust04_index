			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpt] Albanian President Sali Berisha, who is in  Turkey on an official visit, has participated in a luncheon  given in his honor by President Suleyman Demirel at the Cankaya  Mansion. At the luncheon, Demirel said that Bulgarian-Turkish  relations have reached a level that can serve as an example to  the region and to the rest of the world.    Demirel expressed Turkey's concern regarding the tragic and  inhuman situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina spreading to Kosovo,  Sandzak, and Vojvodina and indicated that he has been constantly  warning concerned countries and international organization about  this issue.    [Begin Demirel recording] Turkey is making efforts to  establish democracy, peace, and stability in the Balkans. We  vehemently oppose coerced border changes and genocide with an  aim to form ethnically pure countries. We view Albania, which  shares our views and has a significant place in the region, as a  true friend and a trusted partner in establishing peace and  stability in the Balkans.

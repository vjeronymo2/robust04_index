"While maintaining a small number of capable scientists to  continue their work at research institutions, the municipal  government is encouraging most research workers to apply their  talents to the market-oriented economy and turn their research  findings into commodities," a local official explained.    He noted that the Shanghai government will provide a more  flexible social environment for them to display their talents in  the market both at home and abroad.    In addition, research institutions are expected to  streamline  their structures by setting up more productive economic entities  in the form of companies with responsibility for their own  profits and losses.    Such companies will be entitled to raise their own funds,  transfer or purchase property rights, and annex small businesses.    In addition, they will pave the way for the further  development of the technology market.    A survey shows that Shanghai has 269 independent scientific  research institutions, employing about 900,000 scientists and  technicians.    Until 1985, under the old central planning system, all the  funds for research institutions were allocated by the central  government, which assigned research tasks. Scientific workers  concentrated on their studies and paid little attention to  whether their research findings were put into practice or not.    "In those days we were told what to do, and had little say  in  the outcome," a scientist said. "But the new policy has given an  enormous boost to the morale and enthusiasm of scientific  workers," he acknowledged.    Last year saw Shanghai's 269 independent scientific research  institutions earn a record total of four billion yuan.    According to the latest figures, Shanghai has more than  5,000  enterprises specializing in the development of science and  technology, including 60 Sino-foreign joint ventures.    These enterprises are engaged in such major industries as  automobiles, telecommunications equipment, computer software,  bioengineering and pharmaceuticals.    Zhu Jiping, a leading official of the Shanghai Commission  for  Science and Technology, said, "In the new situation Shanghai's  scientific work must focus on economic and social development.  In fact it should guide the municipal economic growth as a  whole."    Shanghai's scientific workers developed 1,995 research  findings last year, 734 of which reached or approached the  advanced world standards.    The Shanghai Technology Exchange, which does business  nationwide, concluded transactions topping two billion yuan in  value last year.</p>

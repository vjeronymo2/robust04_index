			<p>BFN     [Text] Artillery shells landed on the Thai side of the  border during fierce fighting in western Cambodia yesterday  morning, according to Thai military sources.    The Phnom Penh force led by 12th Division commander Gen Lai  Virak deployed troops and six T-54 tanks against the Khmer  Rouge's 450th Division which has its stronghold on Phnum Malai  Hill.    The fighting took place about five kilometer from Poipet, a  town bordering Ban Nong Ian, 15 kilometers southeast of  Aranyaprathet.    On Sunday, the Burapha Task Force fired four M-81 mortar  warning shots after artillery shells crossed the border. No  casualties were reported.    The task force is considering revising its strategy in an  attempt to pressure Khmer Rouge guerrillas to pull out from  border areas.    In another development, Khmer Rouge forces launched a series  of attacks on the villages near Highway Route 5, about 15  kilometers southwest of Sisophon.    The guerrillas set fire to more than 150 houses, sending  almost 1,000 villagers fleeing into Banteay Meanchey province  where about 15,000 people from many war-affected zones have  sought refuge.    Highway Route 5 linking Poipet and Sisophon is unsafe for  passage as fear looms over the possibility of KR guerrillas  ambush.</p>

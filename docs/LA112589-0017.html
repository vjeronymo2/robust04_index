			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANLEY'S LIFETIME BAN IS MESSAGE TO YOUTH  </P> <P> Why does a gifted athlete such as Dexter Manley give it all up for drugs? One  of the great talents of professional football, who admitted he was illiterate  and sought help to improve himself, he commanded a fine salary, did local  television work and had a solid future once his playing days were over.  </P> <P> If there's a lesson to be learned from this sad ending to the career of Dexter  Manley, maybe, just maybe, the youth of America will take heed and listen and  learn -- Don't Do Drugs.  </P> <P> PETER M. CAVALLO, Port Hueneme  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that  U.S. President Bill Clinton's report to Congress on the Cyprus  issue is descriptive and its contents are being studied by the  Foreign Ministry.    Commenting on the U.S. President's position that the  confidence-building measures represent a window of opportunity,  Kasoulidhis said that with the acceptance of the 21 March  document we opened wide a door, not just a window, from which  the Turkish side is called upon to go through.</p>

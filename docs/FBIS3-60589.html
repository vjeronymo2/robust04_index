			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Sergey Startsev and </F> Georgiy Shmelev]    [Text] Rome, 30 Nov -- New challenges to security and  cooperation in Europe are taking on an increasingly dramatic  character. The threat of aggressive nationalism has replaced  that of totalitarianism. This was stated today by Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, speaking at the fourth session  of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the CSCE which is taking  place in Rome.    The fact that manifestations of aggressive nationalism are  gripping not only eastern but also central and western Europe  demands much more decisive and urgent reactions, the minister  emphasized. He considers that what is needed above all is  "unambiguous moral condemnation of these manifestations." The  Russian side has therefore proposed the adoption of a document  in which the CSCE participant states would declare that  intolerance and xenophobia are incompatible with a civilized  Europe standing on the threshold of the 21st century.    In A. Kozyrev's opinion it is important that the Rome forum  should adopt measures to support and strengthen the institution  of the CSCE's Supreme Commissar for National Minority Affairs.  "There should be a guaranteeing of the effectiveness of  humanitarian law in armed conflicts engendered by aggressive  nationalism," he declared.    Andrey Kozyrev believes the CSCE has another important task;  namely, to reinforce its peacekeeping potential in order to  settle conflicts where agressive nationalism has led to  bloodshed. He pointed to the special role of CSCE observers,  who are "working heroically in South Ossetia, the Dniester  region, and Abkhazia, acting hand in hand with the Russian  Federation peacekeeping forces."    In this connection A. Kozyrev called upon the CSCE to  support  Russia's peacekeeping efforts and to reexamine the issue of CSCE  observers returning to "hot spots" in the territory of former  Yugoslavia. The minister thinks it would be correct for the  CSCE to make the authorities in Belgrade aware that constructive  steps on their part would open up prospects for the FRY to  rejoin the CSCE. The minister believes that the CSCE should take  upon itself the political coordination of peacekeeping efforts,  within the framework of such organizations as NACC [North  Atlantic Cooperation Council], CIS, NATO, and the Western  European Union.    A. Kozyrev described as a fresh and unprecedented challenge  to European security the fact that "for the first time since the  signing of the Treaty on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons in  1968, we are seeing under way in Europe not a strengthening of  the nonproliferation regime and new states joining it, but  essentially the reverse." "One of the CSCE member states," the  minister pointed out, "has, contrary to the obligations it  assumed, officially announced that it possesses nuclear weapons.  Furthermore, we are speaking here of an awesome nuclear  potential exceeding that of some powers possessing nuclear  weapons." The Russian Federation minister believes that this  creates a completely new situation in terms of security on the  continent of Europe. A. Kozyrev called upon the CSCE to make a  determined declaration of the inviolability of the  Nonproliferation Treaty.</p>

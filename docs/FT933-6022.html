			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / US Money and Credit: Bonds' strength unnerves analysts NOW that 30-year bond yields, currently at 6.1 per cent and falling, look as if they will breeze through the 6 per cent barrier, some Wall Street analysts are beginning to have second thoughts about the robustness of the market's rally. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette is one broking house clearly unnerved by the bond market's strength. In its latest weekly report, it warned: 'We regard the long end of the fixed income market as severely overbought and vulnerable to a 35-45 basis point intermediate-term back-up in rates.' It predicted a sharp upturn in yields would follow on the heels of this week's economic data. The people at Bear Stearns have similar reservations, although they believe any upturn in bond yields is probably a bit further down the road. In a report entitled 'Bond Overshoot,' Bear Stearns economists wrote: 'It is our judgment that people are underestimating the US economy at present . . . We believe that the pace of growth in the second half of this year will be stronger than many people think. Based on the fundamentals, the bond market will face a correction later in the year.' Mr Robert Brusca, the chief economist of Nikko Securities who has long been unconvinced by the bond market's rally, took a similar track. His argument is that inflationary pressures are lurking in the economy, ready to reappear. Some of these remarks must have been prompted by last week's bond market performance, which was nothing short of remarkable. It was a week when no important economic data was published, and when nothing new about the direction of monetary policy was said. Yet it was a week when the 30-year bond gained one and a quarter points, and yields dropped from 6.22 per cent to 6.1 per cent. All of this was achieved without any particular support from fundamentals, or even the technicals - it seemed that the momentum of the market's summer rally was the only thing keeping prices moving higher. At least this week dealers and investors should have something substantial to get their teeth into, in the form of a fresh supply of economic data. If bond yields are to drop quickly under 6 per cent, the economic news will have to be consistently bearish. Today's release of preliminary second-quarter real GDP figures should cause a stir. Two weeks ago, the government announced an unexpectedly wide June trade deficit, since when economists have been predicting that the real GDP numbers would be revised downward to reflect the drop in export sales. Consequently, analysts expect real GDP growth to come in between 0.8 per cent and 1.0 per cent, down from the original estimate of 1.6 per cent. These revisions are already priced into bonds, but any figure under 0.5 per cent would probably prompt heavy buying, and could well send the 30-year yield below 6 per cent for the first time. Tomorrow's purchasing managers' index for August will also be closely watched, and the consensus of forecasts shows the NAPM index of manufacturing activity edging above 50 per cent for the first time since May. The most important number of all arrives on Friday. The August employment data will provide the latest look at the still-depressed labour market. Economists, however, anticipate broad improvement in the data, with non-farm payrolls rising between 85,000 and 200,000. An increase in the civilian labour force, however, will probably have pushed the national unemployment rate up from 6.8 per cent in July to 6.9 per cent or 7.0 per cent.</p>

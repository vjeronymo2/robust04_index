			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Arts: Mixed bag at the Vienna Festival Vienna being a sumptuous stage set, one should not be surprised if people take advantage of the fact. So, one evening last week, Placido Domingo not only sang in two separate opera houses - Il Tabarro in the Volksoper started an hour early to allow him to cross the city for Pagliacci in the Staatsoper  -he even made the journey between the two by tram. What the opera houses put on is not part of the Vienna Festival as such; but the visitor can and does dip into it, as well as into splendid exhibitions like The World of The Mayas at the Kunstlerhaus and The Gold of Kiev at the Kusthistorisches. This year's festival has had a strong drama content, from a variety of sources. The shows which have been most remarked on include the Moscow Taganka production (by Lyubimov) of Schnittke's remarkable music drama Doctor Zhivago, which sets about 20 scenes from the novel to a combination of live electronic music. It was premiered in Vienna before going on to open successfully in Moscow. Luc Bondy's French-language John Gabriel Borkman from Lausanne impressed by its lightness of tone. The Ibsen characters were for once not absolutely doomed from the start: they were permitted a certain development. The Borkman couple was even granted a suppressed love for one another: an interesting, maybe even valid, concept. The special theme this year has been classical antiquity; it has given rise to a not wholly successful ragbag of productions. There was a new Orfeo opera by Walter Hus, from Antwerp; the Berlin State Opera brought the 1776 Paris version of Gluck's Alceste. In drama proper, Slovenia gave us Antigone and Romania Phaedra. The Italian IRAA Theatre, now based in Melbourne, contributed The Trojan Women. Fortunately or unfortunately, according to your point of view, all these were rewrites of the original Greek to make contemporary political points. A further example of the genre, Matthias Braun's The Persians (Kammerspiele, Munich), started interestingly with members of the chorus scattered about the audience, but soon revealed itself as yet another allegory of the last days of the Nazis, and a turgid one at that. By far the finest production on show was the oldest: the 26-year-old Piccolo Teatro version, by Giorgio Strehler of course, of Goldoni's Le Baruffe Chiozzote (Trouble in Chioggia). It comes close to perfection, commedia dell'arte with heart. A tale of quarrelsome fishermen and their women folk, finally reconciled by a deft young law officer, it is based on an early experience of Goldoni himself. Strehler choreographed it as lovingly as a Buster Keaton film. The main set, a quay with a fishing boat's sails and nets outlined against the sky, was exquisite; and the people were presented with both wit and affection. One was left with an aching sense of having eavesdropped on genuine human lives. Strehler, now in the veteran category - he was born in 1921 - is still full of plans: to produce a life of Goldoni as well as Pirandello's Mountain Giants at the Picolo, to plug at least part of the 2,000-line gap still remaining in his marathon production of Goethe's Faust. So, this year's festival has been a mixed bag. As it was ending, a large screen in front of the City Hall was showing the first of a series of video recordings of Mahler's symphonies, conducted by Bernstein; they will be followed by Karajan opera performances on film. These are part of yet another event, Klangbogen (Sound Spectrum) which overlaps the festival, which in its turn had overlapped with the spring festival . . .</p>

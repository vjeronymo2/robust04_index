			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Local difficulties When the Local Government Commission was launched in June 1992, ministers expressed the hope that it would settle the structure of local government in England for decades to come. That hope looks increasingly forlorn, with little coherence in the commission's recommendations and continuing ministerial interference in its work. Now comes the threat of a revolt by backbench Tory MPs, concerned over the upheaval and its attendant costs. The commission has been flawed from the start by its presumption that opinion polls are an appropriate tool for deciding local government structures. Its initial proposals were based on polls about people's feelings about their local identity. In most cases, those proposals proved unpopular and have had to be substantially revised. In trying to please everybody, the commission has predictably ended up satisfying nobody. It is not yet clear whether the revised plans will be more palatable to local opinion. However, business leaders have already reacted with horror to plans to create small single-tier authorities in areas such as Bristol and Middlesbrough. They believe that wider strategic local government is needed for urban areas such as these, which reach out beyond the city boundaries to the larger economic areas around them. Ministers argue that single-tier unitary authorities will cut administrative costs and be more accountable than the present two-tier structure. Yet if unitary authorities are smaller than counties, they will multiply the administrative costs of county services. And if they are too small to provide strategic services such as police and fire services, these will pass to quangos and joint boards which are much less accountable than elected councils. There is a case for single unitary authorities for special cases such as the Isle of Wight. Some larger cities such as Bristol, Leicester and Southampton might also function better as unitary authorities - like the old county boroughs abolished in the 1974 local government reorganisation. But in much of England outside the conurbations, a two-tier system is needed if local government is to think strategically yet deliver services responsively. Recognising this would allow the government to restrict the work of the commission to authorities where there is overwhelming local support for change. There are, in any case, much more important tasks than drawing lines on maps in search of a chimerical perfect structure. One is the problem of making the quangos which provide an increasing share of local public services more accountable to their customers. Ministers, alas, show no interest in this subject. It is time they reined in the Local Government Commission and switched agendas.</p>

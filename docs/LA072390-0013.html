			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GETTING THE ASBESTOS MESS UNDER CONTROL;  </P> <P> THE SYSTEM IS BOGGED DOWN IN LITIGATION; JUSTICE HAS BEEN ALL TOO BLIND  </P> <P> Two federal judges recently moved to end one of the most expensive and  waste-riddled legal free-for-alls in U.S. history. They want to consolidate the  ongoing flood of litigation brought against asbestos manufacturers by  individuals who have been exposed to the toxic fiber. The judges are calling  for a comprehensive and innovative resolution to this bitter litigation, which  has taken so long that thousands of victims literally die before their cases  are heard.  </P> <P> Any asbestos exposure can cause cancer, and long-term exposure can cause  disabling or fatal pulmonary diseases. Although the oldest claimants were  exposed to the insulating material while working under federal contract, the  government has denied responsibility.  </P> <P> A creative solution is needed because the number of claims is mushrooming -- at  present, about 100,000 cases are pending nationwide. In Los Angeles alone, some  5,000-8,000 cases have been closed since the 1970s, and a similar number are  believed to be pending. Estimates of the cost of compensation surpass the GNPs  of some Third World countries.  </P> <P> Even though the substantive legal issues have been decided, defendants continue  to fight the claims. Manufacturers and insurers are also fighting each other  over whose asbestos injured a given claimant. Amid this legal war of attrition,  some defendants threaten or declare bankruptcy before all victims are  compensated.  </P> <P> Judges Jack Weinstein of New York and Thomas Lambros of Ohio want to stop this  protracted litigation from siphoning off any more of the dwindling funds. The  system has satisfied no one except the attorneys collecting lucrative fees.  </P> <P> Judge Weinstein (who settled the massive Agent Orange case) took the first step  toward clearing the growing thicket of briefs when he ordered restructuring of  the nation's largest asbestos compensation trust so that there will be enough  assets to pay all present and future asbestos victims. Judge Lambros took an  equally bold step, establishing a national class- action suit, joining all  present and future asbestos claimants. Both judges say that justice in this  case has been so blind -- to waste and inefficiency -- that it is too often  rendered posthumously or not at all.  </P> <P> The tort system is failing asbestos victims. Either judge's plan may offer a  path out of the tragic impasse. What is most important is to pay all claimants  quickly and fairly, limit legal fees and establish health monitoring for  asbestos victims. The right solution could set important precedents for other  mass product-liability suits.  </P></p>

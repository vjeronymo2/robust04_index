Today's 'Screen Two' is Sin Bin in which Pete Postlethwaite plays a nurse in a mental hospital who sees a colleague batter one of the patients to death. Should he blow the whistle or turn a blind eye? (9.00 BBC2). It will be surprising if the audience for that is anything like as big as the audience for Three Men And A Baby on ITV, even though the 1987 movie has been shown on television before.

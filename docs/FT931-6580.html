			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due WILLIAMS HOLDINGS, the industrial conglomerate, is expected to have suffered a 5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 168m to Pounds 160m, when it announces its full-year results on Thursday. The company's exposure to DIY and aerospace markets are behind the likely slip in earnings per share to 20.1p (22.8p). The dividend is expected to be maintained. Another round of write-downs on property and the Channel Tunnel contract is thought to have kept BICC's pre-tax profit flat at about Pounds 80m last year. It reports on Wednesday. This time the cables and construction group is expected to provide for its Spitalfields joint venture among roughly Pounds 40m of charges. Although this will again leave the 19.25p total dividend uncovered, BICC said it would maintain it when it made a Pounds 154m rights issue last year. The proceeds went towards buying continental and US cables businesses and helped to reduce debt. Two more composite insurance companies, General Accident and Guardian Royal Exchange, are expected to report sharply reduced losses this week. Rising premium rates and milder weather are mainly responsible for the improvement at both companies, neither of which are heavily exposed to losses from domestic mortgage indemnity business. General Accident is expected to report a loss of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m tomorrow, compared with a deficit of Pounds 171.6m in 1991. On Wednesday, Guardian Royal Exchange could also report losses of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 40m, against losses of Pounds 209.7m in 1991. Fisons, the drugs and scientific instrument group, reports its full-year results tomorrow. Analysts are unsure about the net impact of disposals during the last 12 months, which must now be carried above the line to conform to the new FRS3 accounting standard. Lehman Brothers estimates the underlying business will report profits down from Pounds 190.5m last year to about Pounds 105m. This represents a 50 per cent improvement during the second half of the year. Followers will be watching for a statement about future prospects more than the historic results. The 1992 results for Barclays will be announced on Thursday. These will be preceded tomorrow by Abbey National, and on Wednesday by Midland. Barclays is expected to make a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 100m, and a retained loss of Pounds 500m-Pounds 600m after maintaining the final dividend. However, BZW is predicting a cut in the dividend. Abbey National will make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 570m, and retained profits of about Pounds 200m. Its provisions for possible bad debts are expected to double to about Pounds 320m, reflecting the depressed UK housing market. Midland is expected to show the effect of a significant lightening of its provisions for possible bad debts to about Pounds 700m for the year compared to Pounds 903m in 1991. This is expected to boost pre-tax profits to about Pounds 200m from Pounds 36m. DIVIDEND &amp; INTEREST PAYMENTS TODAY Abbey National Treasury Servs. 13 3/8 % Gtd.

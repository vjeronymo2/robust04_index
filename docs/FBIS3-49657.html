Mindlessly attacking the area around Buzim, the  separatists have suffered a fresh defeat. In a strong  counterattack, members of the 5th Corps of the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina captured two companies of separatists, about  200 of them, together with a large amount of equipment,  ammunition, and weapons.    Not only have they suffered a fresh defeat in this region,  but Fikret [Abdic]'s separatists have simply being routed in the  region of (?Trzac). A significant amount of ammunition and  equipment was captured in the fighting there. They could not do  anything else but resort to artillery. Thus, the areas of  Pecigrad, Skokovi, and Vitkovac are coming under constant fire,  where further material damage has been caused to residential  property. Some civilians have also been wounded.    The reports from this region on the consolidation of the  situation are encouraging. The population are slowly retuning  to their homes. [passage omitted]</p>

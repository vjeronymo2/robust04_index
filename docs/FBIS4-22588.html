			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Mogil: There Is Money. We Await the </F> Elections"]    [Text] In order to report on the trip to the Central  Election Commission in Moscow and answer questions that had  accumulated during their absence, Chairman of the Kray Election  Commission S. Knyazev and Ye. Khrustalev assembled journalists  in the White House the day before yesterday.    It appears from what they said that the decision of the  governor of the kray concerning delaying the elections to the  kray Duma until autumn made sense to the Central Election  Commission. They also did not fail to pay attention to the  financial needs of Maritime Kray regarding the conduct of  elections. The necessary amount of money was released. Thus, the  kray election commission was able to return half a billion  rubles [R] to the kray budget, from where the money was borrowed  to finance the initial stages of the election campaign, and  which the governor also promised to release for social programs.    S. Knyazev dispelled the concerns of journalists about the  safekeeping of the money allocated for the elections postponed  until autumn. But so that the millions will be safer, he will  probably even cancel a trip to Moscow, where on 20 April the  Supreme Court plans to examine an appeal filed by Messrs  Gilgenberg, Kandarakov, and Isayev concerning the, in their  opinion, improper cutting up of electoral districts. According  to the law, the complaint can be examined even in the absence of  representatives of the kray election commission.    As for the Supreme Court finding on the essence of the  complaint, the delay of the elections to a later date only  contributes to objectivity. In the words of S. Knyazev, such a  subjective factor as an already elected kray Duma would  complicate the work of justice.    Mentioning that we all walk under God, the visitors  explained  the situation regarding the candidates for deputy who are  already registered. This is how matters stand: If 55 days before  the scheduled date of the elections there are less than two  candidates for deputy in any electoral district for any reason  whatsoever, a prenomination mandatory collection of signatures  will be held as before.    It was decided not to change the composition of the kray and  district election commissions. They will continue their work.</p>

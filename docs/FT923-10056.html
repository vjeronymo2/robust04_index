			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Increasing gloom over sterling STERLING lost around one pfennig in early European trading against the D-Mark yesterday as the markets became increasingly gloomy about the prospects for the UK economy, writes James Blitz. Several dealers said that the market had been badly affected by comments from several leading British businessmen, including the chief executive of Midland Bank and the Chairman of ICI, that a realignment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) was needed if the government was to take control of the economy. Yesterday, Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton, the Bank of England Governor, tried to counter these comments, saying that the UK authorities were fully committed to membership of the ERM. But the darkening economic climate in Britain makes many dealers wonder whether realignment or devaluation are in prospect. The July survey of independent forecasters issued yesterday added to the gloom, predicting that the UK economy will contract by 0.2 per cent in 1992, compared to the treasury forecast of 1.0 per cent growth. Under these conflicting pressures, sterling fell back to a low of DM2.8353 in the early afternoon, but soon recovered to close unchanged on the day at DM2.8425. A particularly worrying aspect of its performance was its slide in the EMS grid. Dealers said that both the Bank of Portugal and the Bank of England were forced to intervene in the market, buying the pound, after sterling fell below its permitted floor against the strongest currency, the Portuguese escudo. That divergence does not worry dealers excessively, as trading in the escudo is only a small part of the foreign exchange market. But dealers tend to be particularly bearish towards currencies at the bottom of the grid. Yesterday, the gap between sterling and the second weakest currency, the Italian lira, widened to 2.75 percentage points. The dollar again moved in narrow ranges against the D-Mark in European trading. Strong US factory orders for June, which rose by 2.3 per cent on the previous month, and an up-beat Chicago Purchasing Management survey for July, triggered an advance of nearly a pfennig up to DM1.4831. But in late American trade, the dollar subsided in a wave of profit-taking, falling back to a low of DM1.4727. The dollar will continue to be trapped in narrow ranges next week. Dealers believe that central banks will intervene if the currency falls towards DM1.45, while US indicators are not strong enough for dealers to feel bullish. However, the US currency could rally if July's non-farm payroll data, due out on Friday, rises. The market expects an increase in jobs by 100,000 on the previous month.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FRANCE;  </P> <P> FIRES NEAR RIVIERA STILL OUT OF CONTROL  </P> <P> Wind-driven fires that gutted at least 22 homes and forced thousands of Riviera  vacationers to flee continued to burn out of control in southern France.  </P> <P> Reinforcements arrived from all over the nation as authorities declared a state  of emergency. A 42-year-old volunteer firefighter died near Nice when heat  caused the tires of his firetruck to explode and the vehicle rolled over.  Farther east, in the Var, 1,200 firefighters and 300 soldiers battled flames  that have destroyed at least 10 homes and consumed more than 20,000 acres of  dense brush.  </P></p>

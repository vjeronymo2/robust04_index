			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATIN LEADERS PUSH FOR REGIONAL ALLIANCE;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: NO LONGER DO THE SOUTH AMERICANS BLAME THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD FOR  ALL OF THEIR PROBLEMS.  </P> <P> Seven Latin American presidents, their nations mired in inflation and  recession, resolved Thursday to push forward with economic integration by 1992  to keep from falling behind the world's emerging regional economic blocs.  </P> <P> Ending their third annual summit a day early, the group also reaffirmed the  suspension of Panama to protest Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's crushing of democracy  there. However, the seven presidents stopped short of expelling Panama  outright, as some countries wanted.  </P> <P> While condemning Noriega for flouting democracy in Panama, the presidents noted  that democratic rule has been consolidated throughout the region in the 1980s,  including this year in Chile and Paraguay. The priority now, the group  declared, is to match that political freedom with economic and social justice.  </P> <P> The presidents' remarks in opening the conference Wednesday and the closing  communique Thursday offered a measure of the changing attitudes in the region:  No longer did they place all blame on the industrialized world for their  problems of debt, violence and economic decline. Rather, the tone was one of  looking within both for the diagnosis and the cure.  </P> <P> The presidents said their foreign ministers will meet Dec. 4-5 in Argentina to  devise a program for major advances in Latin American integration before 1992.  That year is both the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America and  the year when the European Community will complete its economic integration,  cited as a model by several presidents.  </P> <P> They stated several goals: substituting regional import bans with tariffs and  then gradually reducing those tariffs; removing physical obstacles to trade,  especially in transport and communications, and adopting joint scientific and  technology ventures. Communications and transport ministers will meet within 60  days to work out accords on joint projects involving satellites and transport  links.  </P> <P> The so-called Group of Eight was formed in 1986 to build a political voice for  Latin American democracies and initially focused on demanding concessions from  more developed countries, particularly on the region's foreign debt of more  than $400 billion. This time, the stress was on self-help.  </P> <P> The three newly elected presidents, Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, Carlos  Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, emphasized  the need to modernize the region's economies and join the world marketplace --  or perish in isolation.  </P> <P> All three of those countries have adopted painful reform plans to cut  inflation, streamline their bureaucracies and reduce subsidies to industries  that encouraged inefficiency and lack of competitiveness.  </P> <P> "In this new world, there will be constantly less space for those stuck in old  nationalisms," Menem said. "Nobody will be able to do for us that which we are  not capable of doing for ourselves."  </P> <P> He cautioned against a vision of Latin American unity that would merely mean  regional protectionism. "That would be repeating on a larger scale the same  isolationist concepts of the past," he said.  </P> <P> The four other presidents at the summit are all in their final months in  office. Virgilio Barco Vargas of Colombia and Julio Maria Sanguinetti of  Uruguay already have embraced conservative economic programs, and their  economies are comparatively healthy.  </P> <P> The final pair, Alan Garcia of Peru and Jose Sarney of Brazil, have largely  avoided the market-opening policies of their colleagues, and both economies are  sinking in inflation and economic malaise. The front-runners to succeed them,  however, have proposed orthodox reform programs.  </P> <P> Thus, the Latin group is likely to offer a markedly more conservative, uniform  outlook at its next annual summit in Venezuela.  </P></p>

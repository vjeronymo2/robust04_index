			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo (Brazil), 26 Mar (EFE) -- It was disclosed  today in Sao Paulo that Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso will announce on 29 March his decision to  resign as minister in order to participate in the October  general elections as a candidate for the Presidency. A report  appearing in the newspaper FOLHA DE SAO PAULO discloses that  Cardoso has already advised President Itamar Franco of his  intention to participate in the elections. The report adds that  the minister has told Franco he would use the weekend to hold  final consultations with his family.    Cardoso's decision was confirmed by Pedro Simon, Senate  government spokesman, who believes the minister will be a strong  contender. "If today, Cardoso is obtaining a 12-percent  popularity rating at the polls with the inflation rate at 40  percent, then most surely, when inflation falls to 12 percent,  Cardoso will receive a rating close to 40 percent," Simon has  said.    Simon also disclosed that Franco, who discussed the issue  with Cardoso on 24 March, has promised the finance minister that  his resignation would not entail changes in the current cabinet  or the country's economic program.    The minister is the mastermind behind the economic  adjustment  program, which has been being gradually implemented since this  past December and which entered its second phase three weeks ago  with the introduction of a new economic modifier, the real value  unit (URV).    With this program, which is scheduled to be completed in a  month when the real, a new monetary unit on par with the U.S.  dollar, enters into circulation, Brazil is seeking to balance  its public finances, which currently have a $22.10-billion  deficit. The program also seeks to cut the inflation rate, which  surpasses 40 percent monthly.    "Whatever decision I may make, it will be based on my  conviction that it is best for the economic program as well as  for the country," Cardoso told "FOLHA DE SAO PAULO."    A commentary that appeared in the same newspaper states  Cardoso will officially present his resignation on 29 March and  that the minister will be replaced by Pedro Malan, president of  the Central Bank of Brazil. The report adds Malan will in turn  be replaced by Public Debt Negotiator Persio Arida.    Cardoso's candidacy is being promoted by the country's  business sector as well as by leaders of several political  groups interested in offsetting the presidential aspirations  momentum of Luis Ignacio "Lula" da Silva, head of the socialist  Labor Party. For the past year now, da Silva has led public  opinion polls with a 30-percent preference, and he stands out as  Franco's most likely successor during the general elections  scheduled for 3 October.</p>

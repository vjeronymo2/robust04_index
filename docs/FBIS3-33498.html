			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] During four campaign stops in Cali,  Liberal Party presidential hopeful Ernesto Samper said that, if  elected, he will "pay the debt owed to Colombian women."  Speaking to various female audiences ranging from professionals  to factory workers, Samper said he would adopt a policy of  "positive discrimination" in favor of women whereby a woman  would be given preference over a man in situations where equally  qualified male and female candidates are being considered for a  job or promotion. Samper's seven-point program to benefit women  would include: Formulation of a National Development Plan to  promote greater opportunities and equality for women; measures  to reduce unemployment among women, especially those between  25-35 years of age; a promise that, by the end of his term,  women would occupy half of the managerial and advisory positions  in his government; flexibility in work schedules to accommodate  the needs of working mothers; better training for child-care  providers to improve their wage status; more severe punishment  for violence against women; and subsidies to help female heads  of households.    During one address to a group of factory workers, most of  whom were single mothers, Samper also said his administration  would provide 500,000 subsidized housing units and implement a  program of microenterprises for female heads of households.

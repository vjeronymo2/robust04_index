			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Interest cut helps Sweb to 17% rise SOUTH WESTERN Electricity, the regional supplier from Bristol to Land's End, yesterday reported steady growth from electricity distribution, but disappointing results from Sweb Retail, its High Street domestic appliance division. Pre-tax profits increased 17 per cent, from Pounds 13.6m to Pounds 15.9m, in the six months to September 30, helped by a lower interest charge on reduced net borrowings. Mr John Seed, yesterday promoted from managing director to chief executive, said electricity sales fell on average 1 per cent due to recession. But the company continued to improve efficiency levels and remains on course to easily achieve its three year target to cut costs 10 per cent by the end of next year. Turnover increased 5.2 per cent to Pounds 381.4m helped by average price increases of 3 per cent, with a 1 percentage point discount for customers switching to standing orders. Operating profit from electricity distribution was little changed at Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 35.6m) despite a 6 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 107.5m. Electricity supply, where profits are strongly skewed towards the second half, incurred losses of Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 16.7m). Sweb Retail increased sales 31 per cent to Pounds 32.8m upon integration of the outlets of its joint venture partner, South Wales Electricity. But the division reported a loss of Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 200,000), due to recession and bad debt provisions of Pounds 1.2m. Net borrowings were reduced to Pounds 84m (Pounds 99.7m), gearing fell from 25 per cent to 19 per cent and interest charges were Pounds 1.6m lower at Pounds 6.5m. Tax took Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3.2m). Earnings per share were 19 per cent higher at 10.1p (8.5p). The interim dividend is raised by 12 per cent from 5.25p to 5.9p. COMMENT Although the weather will still play its part, these figures suggest another strong year for South Western. Combined operating profits from distribution and supply increased 20 per cent, despite flat sales, as improved efficiencies flowed through. The rise in the dividend, while in line with other recs, looks confident. Longer term, the company must hope its efficiencies, customer service improvements and 'underrecovery' of price increases will stand it in good stead upon regulatory review in 1995. On the downside, the company remains more highly geared than many in the sector, and cash generation is weaker. Full year forecasts of Pounds 97m put the shares on a prospective yield of 5.9 per cent, characteristically towards the low end of the recs' yield range.</p>

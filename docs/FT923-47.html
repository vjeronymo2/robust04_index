			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Investing after the currency turbulence  -Three international money managers discuss their views with Peter Martin If you are a fund manager, how you view the events of the past few weeks depends on where you sit. For sterling-based international investors, the devaluation of the pound has produced a helpful boost to performance: in sterling terms the FT-Actuaries World index excluding the UK has risen by 13 per cent in the past three weeks; in dollars it has fallen 2 per cent. For investors elsewhere, the news has been more mixed. As the chart shows, since the Bath meeting of EC finance ministers at which the ERM's tensions first came to a head in early September, only three of the ten stock markets shown have risen in value in local currency terms: the UK, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The others have all fallen, with Japan - down nearly six per cent - the worst performer. For one international manager, Henry Looser, head of private banking at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, a lot has changed in the past few weeks. Until recently, he had taken his most aggressive equity position of the past 20 years. Now, with rallies in the UK, Switzerland and Italy, he has readjusted his portfolios towards a more normal weighting, pulling out of a number of equity markets entirely. 'We have no further holdings in Italy or Spain,' he said yesterday, 'and Britain is a market we have really sold out of in the last two to three days - and we have even started to go short there.' In equity markets generally, the risk of earnings disappointments is high, he believes, and it will be possible to buy back in at lower levels. 'There is a lot of disappointment ahead,' he says. 'It's a minefield, and we will see mines exploding, taking the market down with them.' In particular, the outlook for the German economy is very poor, he says, and D-Mark interest rates are likely to remain at high levels into the first or second quarter of 1993. For Robin Apps, head of European equities at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management in London, the outlook is dominated by currency considerations. The dollar is still cheap on a purchasing power basis, he argues; sterling could go a lot lower if the British government decides to dash for growth; the French franc has probably escaped imminent danger of devaluation against the D-Mark but at a price - in terms of short-term interest rates - that may prove unsustainable. 'As a house we've been perennially bearish on equities,' he says, because of an overall expectation of recession, and that position has not changed. 'At the margin, however, in certain countries one might expect slightly more growth.' One of these is the UK, 'if it can get away with a beggar-my-neighbour devaluation.' Germany is slowing down quite markedly, he believes, with little prospect of an interest rate easing there until the federal government either raises taxes or cuts back on payments to the east. 'That is the moment at which the Bundesbank will ease,' he says. Even before that moment, however, he is overweight in Germany, believing that many German companies would offer good value if they were managed on an Anglo-Saxon basis, with return to shareholders the central consideration. 'Whether they ever do that is debatable, however,' he says. That long-term play is also part of the investment strategy of William Holzer, who manages the Scudder Global Fund in New York. Like Apps, he is significantly overweight in Germany and Switzerland. In other respects, however, his views offer a marked contrast: as a US-based manager, he can afford to display an Olympian disregard of the events of the last few weeks. He is overweight in Switzerland not so much as a country decision but because he believes 'you can buy global companies cheaper there than anywhere else.' Elsewhere, his decisions are dominated by big-picture themes. The last big shift, into undervalued financial services companies, dated back 'a couple of years or so'. He thinks another big shift is coming up soon, to adapt to the impact of an ageing baby boom and a shift of manufacturing out of developed countries to the Third World. 'The dynamic of the old system was the inflation of collateral,' he says. 'This time round, it is the infinite ability of the ldcs to absorb capital and offer a high return on it.' That leads him to favour global companies which are the essential technology transfer agents for this process, and savings institutions which will handle the baby boomers' need to save for retirement.</p>

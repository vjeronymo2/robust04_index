Provincial leaders and more than 200 veteran comrades and  liaison men in charge of the work toward veteran cadres happily  gathered together to jointly celebrate the Spring Festival.    Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor of the provincial government, chaired the  tea party. On behalf of the provincial party committee and the  provincial government, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the  provincial party committee, first offered, at an earlier date,  the Spring Festival greetings to the veteran comrades and the  liaison men in charge of the work toward veteran cadres who were  present at the tea party, the veteran comrades retired from  various fronts in the province, and their families and  relatives; and also extended cordial greetings and sincere  respects to them.    He said: In the past year, the province ensured the  political and social stability, the economy of the province was  developed, and all provincial undertakings were flourishing. A  good situation characterized by vitality and progress has  emerged. New headway has been made in improving party style,  administrative honesty, spiritual civilization, democracy, and  legal system and developing various social undertakings. Such a  good political and economic situation results from the diligent  and arduous labor made in a unified manner by the broad masses  of party members, cadres, and people across the province. This  cannot be separated from the warm concern and enthusiastic  support of all veteran comrades and all seniors. The practice  has fully proved that the vast number of retired cadres are the  precious wealth of the party as well as a key force to promote  reform and construction and stabilize the society. The party  committees and governments at various levels should be concerned  with, respect, and cherish the veteran comrades and enable them  to bring their key roles in the building of the two  civilizations.    He urged: On the premise of taking care of their health, the  veteran comrades will continue to be concerned with and support  the work of the provincial party committee and the provincial  government, do some work according to their ability, and make  new contributions to consolidating and developing the province's  gratifying situation.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: The year 1994 is a key year to  promote the package reform and build the socialist market  economic operation mechanism as well as the first year to  realize the second-step strategic target. At the time of  deepening reform, expanding the scale of opening up, and  ensuring a sustained, fast, and healthy progress of the economy,  we should continue to attend to party building, the improvement  of party style and administrative honesty, the setup of  democracy and legal system, and the improvement of spiritual  civilization. The tasks are glorious and arduous. Now, we are  confronted with not only favorable opportunities for development  but also many difficulties and problems. Both favorable  opportunities and challenges coexist. Under the new situation,  we should be prudent and modest and guard against arrogance and  rashness; persistently use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm our  brains; grasp favorable opportunities to deepen reform, promote  development, and maintain stability; and creatively carry out  our work with new ideas, new pose, and new work style. Under  the leadership of the party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin  as its nucleus, we should deeply implement the guidelines of the  14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 14th  party Central Committee, persist in the principle of taking a  two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough,  emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, be united to keep  forging ahead, do solid work, and further capture a bigger  success in building socialist spiritual and material  civilizations.    Present at the tea party were some other leading comrades of  the province, including Li Chunting, Li Wenquan, Han Xikai, Li  Zhen, and Lu Maozeng; some veteran comrades, including Pan  Qilong, Su Yiran, Liang Buting, Zhao Ding, Gao Keting, Qin  Hezhen, and Li Zichao; some retired cadres at the deputy  provincial chief level; and families of the late cadres at the  provincial chief and deputy provincial chief levels.</p>

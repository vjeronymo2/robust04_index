			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Special Correspondent] </F>   [Text] The first indigenously-built cryogenic engine to  power the Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) of the  Indian space programme will be ready in four years.    Impressed with the performance of the Space Department, the  Government is likely to double the Plan outlay on space research  in the on-going Eighth Plan period from 1,804 crore to  Rs.[rupees] 3,500 crore, originally sought by the department.    This is revealed in the tenth report submitted to the  Standing Committee of Parliament on Science and Technology,  comprising members of both Houses.    Though the contract between the Indian Space Research  Organisation (ISRO) and the Russian space organisation  Glavkosmos had been modified under the threat of U.S. sanctions,  ISRO was in a position to develop indigenous technology, the  panel said.    The committee was informed by the representatives of the  Space Dapartment that industries like L&amp;T [Larsen and  Toubro],  Walchand Industries, Godrej, NOCIL [National Organic Chemical  Industries Limited] and Andhra Sugar had been involved in  producing various subsystems and hardware for the cryogenic  engine.    Secretary (Space) Dr. K. Kasturirangan informed the  committee  that according to the modified agreement with Glavkosmos, in  addition to the supply of the originally planned two cryogenic  blocks, two more flight stages and two ground models would be  supplied in lieu of the technology transfer, within the original  agreement cost of Rs. 235 crore.    ISRO has also exercised the option to buy three additional  cryo stages at a cost of U.S. $3 million each as negotiated in  the original contract, Dr. Kasturirangan told the committee.    The committee was also informed that, for this programme,  the  Government has approved an outlay of Rs. 245 crore.    The body wanted the Department of Space to make concerted  efforts in this direction because with the realisation of the  cryo stage, if the GSLV is operationalised, the Indian launch  services would be priced much lower than the current  international market price.    The indigenous cryogenic engine, burning liquid oxygen and  gaseous hydrogen, will power the upper-most stage of the GSLV  which will give ISRO the capability to launch 2.5-tonne class  communication satellites into geostationary orbits. Such a  capabilily, married to the ISRO's success in fabricating  low-priced satellites, would provide the Indian space  organisation a major slot in the international space launch  market.    The committee was informed that the work relating to GSLV  was  proceeding and that, so far, 216 technologies or processes  developed had been transferred to the firms.    ISRO representatives told the committee that the next flight  of the PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) would take place  later this year. Asked about the reason for the failure of the  PSLV's first flight last September when it failed to place the  IRS-1E [Indian Remote Sensing-1E] satellite into orbit, they  told the committee that the launch was ``almost a success'' and  that barring a software implementation error, all the stages and  their sub-systems had performed very well.</p>

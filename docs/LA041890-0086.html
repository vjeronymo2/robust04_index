			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOCKEY STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> SHORT REST FOR BLACKHAWKS AS THEY PLAY BLUES  </P> <P> After surviving a seventh-game showdown to stay alive in the NHL playoffs, the  Chicago Blackhawks plunge right back into the game-every-other-night grind  tonight, opening a second-round Stanley Cup series against the St. Louis Blues.  </P> <P> The Blackhawks at least will be at home, where they finished off the Minnesota  North Stars, 5-2, Monday night.  </P> <P> Other second-round series open Thursday night, with the New Jersey Devils  playing the New York Rangers and the Montreal Canadiens playing the Boston  Bruins, who won the seventh game against the Hartford Whalers Tuesday night,  3-1.  </P> <P> In their seventh game, the Blackhawks, trailing 1-0, had to kill consecutive  first-period major penalties that left them two men short for more than two  minutes. They held Minnesota scoreless during that stretch, then got two goals  apiece from Wayne Presley and Jeremy Roenick.  </P> <P> The Blues, who eliminated the Toronto Maple Leafs in five games, could have  their best goalie, Curtis Joseph, back after he suffered a severely bruised  shoulder. If Joseph doesn't return, Vincent Riendeau will start.  </P> <P> The Blues' offense is led by Brett Hull, who followed a record-breaking regular  season (72 goals, 113 points) with five goals and five assists in the first  round against the Maple Leafs. The Blues ranked eighth in the NHL in goals for  (295) and goals against (279) during the regular season.  </P> <P> Blackhawk goalie Greg Millen, who opened the season with St. Louis and wound up  in Chicago after a stop in Quebec, played well for victories in Games 3, 5 and  7, but was pulled in Games 2, 4 and 6.  </P> <P> Presley and Roenick each had five goals and Greg Gilbert scored four against  the North Stars. Steve Thomas led the Blackhawks with 40 goals during the  regular season and Steve Larmer had 90 points. The Blackhawks were fifth in  goals for (316) but 14th in goals against (294) during the regular season.  </P> <P> Defense was at a premium in games between the two teams this season. Three  games ended 8-3, another 9-6 and two more were 6-4. The Blues won the season  series against the Blackhawks, 5-2-1 -- going 3-1-0 at St. Louis.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kresimir Meler: "We Are Strong Enough"] </F>   [Text] (From our correspondent) -- "Milosevic has betrayed  us. What does the establishment of telephone connections between  Belgrade and Zagreb really mean? It means that the republic of  Serbian Krajina [RSK] will have to be connected with Zagreb. If  that happens, then we will some day see Croatian police in the  middle of Knin again. Then it will be too late." This was Rade  Leskovac, president of Seselj's Radicals in Knin, commenting on  the signing of the declaration on the normalization of relations  between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. We  talked to him at the Serbian Army Center in Knin, where he and  his followers were assessing the "situation following the  endorsement of the betrayal of the republic of Serbian Krajina."    [Meler] What did you decide at the meeting?    [Leskovac] Without doubt, it is almost obvious that  Milosevic  and Tudjman have done everything to stay in power, regardless of  the circumstances. To put it more simply: Milosevic has sold out  his people in Krajina to remove the sanctions against Serbia. As  far as we know, within a month Krajina will receive practically  no help.    [Meler] Are you sure that people in the RSK just want him as  president? [sentence as published]    [Leskovac] Babic is the only one who insists that the RSK  must be an independent and sovereign country, without having  Belgrade, Zagreb, or Sarajevo as a patron. Babic is one of the  few who are aware that this area must not become anybody's  protectorate. I am convinced that Babic, as president, would not  sign anything with the Croatians as long as Croatia does not  recognize our country.    [Meler] Have you thought that he could change his position  if  Serbia threatened to discontinue aid?    [Leskovac] I am sure he would not. It is true that Serbia  helps us, but we pay dearly for this help. Did you know that  Serbia is taking bauxite from Obrovac along with some other ores  for which it pays only one-fifth of the market price? You did  not know that, did you? Our standard of living is higher than in  Belgrade. True, we are without power occasionally, but this is  certainly not the worst problem.    [Meler] Without aid you might experience certain  difficulties...?    [Leskovac] What kind? If you have military aid in mind, I  must tell you that we are strong enough. Over the last few days,  the Vojvoda [Seselj] has sent us heavy weapons. We also expect  300 Cossacks from Zhirinovskiy. These are people who have gained  experience in various commando operations and are ready to  liberate the occupied Serbian territories. All expenses are  covered by our organizations in the United States, particularly  Vojvoda Djujic's, which supports Babic and us. If necessary, he  will even help us overthrow Milosevic. Milosevic has no right to  be the president of Serbia anymore. He lost that right by  signing the agreement which had sold out the Serbs in Krajina.  His puppets Martic, Novakovic, and Bjegovic must also resign. If  they do not leave voluntarily, they will be forced to. They have  to go.</p>

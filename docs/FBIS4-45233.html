At a Ministry of Internal Affairs news conference a week  ago, we received a hint that officers from the Bureau To Combat  Drug Trafficking, in cooperation with DEA agents, were preparing  operations such as the following: Good cooperation among the  Vienna branch of the DEA, the Bureau To Combat Drug Trafficking,  and the Koper police resulted in a successful operation when 1.5  kg of cocaine was seized in Koper on 21 April. Martin Vrancic,  chief of the Bureau To Combat Drug Trafficking, said the drugs  had come through Brnik airport and that this was not the first  time something like this had happened. He believes that an  extremely well-organized group is behind the cocaine-smuggling  operation, that it is organized in a pyramid structure, and that  it uses computer technology. The drugs were hidden in two  computer magnetic-tape boxes. The Koper police turned three  persons over to the local prosecutor's office. They are  citizens of Colombia, Italy, and Slovenia. The Slovene citizen  lives in Colombia. One of the foreigners was taken into  custody. The investigation has not been concluded. Just today  at noon, that is Wednesday, another suspect belonging to this  group was arrested in Ljubljana. He is a Croatian citizen. He  was also turned over to the Koper prosecutor. The cocaine seized  has a market value of approximately 200,000 German marks.  [passage omitted]</p>

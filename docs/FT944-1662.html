			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / International Company News: Listing for Deutsche Waggonbau Deutsche Waggonbau, eastern Germany's railway carriage manufacturer, which is one of the last remaining enterprises in the hands of the Treuhand privatisation agency, will be listed on the stock exchange, according to agency officials. The listing will be made after Advent International Corporation, a Boston-based venture capital company, and Siemens, Germany's electrical and electronics group, which have teamed up to buy DWA, have completed a modernisation and investment programme. The purchase contract should be signed next month. Although the Treuhand would not confirm the price, officials from IG Metall, the steel and engineering union, said Advent and Siemens will pay about DM120m (Dollars 76m) for DWA, which has subsidiaries throughout eastern Germany. The consortium will also guarantee 3,000 jobs. Before unification, DWA employed more than 24,000 people. However, the state government of Saxony, where two DWA plants are located, has already protested against the deal, on the grounds that the Treuhand and the ministry of finance had pledged to keep all the DWA plants operating as part of retaining a small industrial and manufacturing base in the east German states.</p>

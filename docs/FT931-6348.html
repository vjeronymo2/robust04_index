			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / A colour-blind vision Police chiefs everywhere will recognise the powerful phrases used by Mr Paul Condon, the new commissioner of London's metropolitan police, at the weekend. 'The dire consequences of racially based nationalism, ignorance, prejudice and outright thuggery,' he said, 'have already been seen to a greater or lesser extent in Italy, in France, in Belgium and of course in Germany.' He did not exclude his own country. 'Our society is in the process of becoming an even richer mix of races and nationalities,' he reminded his audience at a three-day conference on 'fairness, community and justice', organised by the Metropolitan police. His clear implication was that 'outright thuggery' is used against Asians, Africans and West Indians in Britain. We all know this. England's assaults on Indians and Pakistanis long preceded Germany's recent murderous attacks upon Turkish guest-workers. On the western side of the English channel, the perpetrators are usually young louts, but sometimes police constables. 'This is an area where we must be totally intolerant - intolerant of racially motivated attacks, intolerant of those who indulge in racial abuse, and intolerant of those who use hatred and violence as the tools of their political expression,' said the commissioner. As to the police themselves, 'we must be equally intolerant of our own colleagues who fail to meet the required standards. The argument that there is some excuse for poor behaviour because the culture of the service can only be expected to mirror that of wider society . . . is simply specious.' Mr Condon's words echo the warnings given to the Los Angeles police by Mr Willie L Williams, the black successor to Mr Daryl F Gates as chief in LA. In saying this, I acknowledge the substantial differences between Scotland Yard and LA law. Blacks constitute a far greater proportion of the Los Angeles population. The ugly beating by four white officers of the black motorist, Rodney G King, on March 3 1991, and the subsequent riots in Watts county, caused much more damage in California than anything that has happened in Britain. The burned-out acres of Watts are evidence of that, as I saw the other day. Yet the fears in both cities are the same. The British theory of assaults on ethnic minorities is that the less said about them the better. The Commission for Racial Equality has so far failed to persuade the government to create a new offence of racial violence. The government does collect figures showing reported attacks. But, although these suggest that there have been sharp increases over recent years, the actual numbers are meaningless, since black or brown victims often believe that there is no point telling the police. Worse, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that some younger members of the force automatically assume that the non-white participant in any fight is the aggressor, no matter who started it. My exposure to such stories started a few months ago with a telephone call from the CRE. It proposed a new set of annual media awards, for sensitive reporting or interpretation of racial matters. Would I be one of the judges in the radio section? A few weeks later 32 tapes arrived - a total of 22 listening hours. Heavens] The only solution was to keep them for the motorway. What I thought would be a bore turned out to be fascinating. The Britain revealed by these tapes is every bit as multi-ethnic as Mr Condon says it is. Non-whites constitute only 5 per cent of the population but a disproportionate number of them are under 16. These young new Britons may be visible in the streets, but many are indistinguishable to the ear. The really interesting voices were exactly those of natives of these isles. On one tape a Chinese girl spoke with a pure Ulster accent; on another we had a Glaswegian Singh; on a third a Patel of the Welsh valleys. West Indians who speak undiluted Birmingham are well-known; I heard a few as I sped along the M4. Some of those interviewed, such as Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North (Harrow County grammar school and Newnham College, Cambridge), have clearly been able to look after themselves; many have not. Accounts of racial harrassment, by pavement thugs or by the very police officers to whom the incidents were reported, were too consistent to be ignored. There is a contrary argument. Some forces have officers whose duty it is to record complaints of racial abuse, and to follow these up. The good intentions are there, but one or two individuals in a large and busy force cannot plod through the huge volume of reported incidents of violence. None of the above should be taken by contestants as an indication of which tape has won. That is a separate matter, to be decided at the CRE ceremony at the end of the month. The point this morning is that Britain's ethnic community speaks to the rest of us through many hours of air-time. What it says fully justifies Mr Condon's weekend observations. These might serve to increase the propensity of victims to report racial incidents. Beyond that, it is hard to see what can be done. British race relations are governed by a tacit agreement between the government and the majority of the electorate that remains suspicious of foreigners in general and black or brown ones in particular. The deal is this: whichever party is in government, and whichever the official opposition, will combine to enact an increasingly severe series of laws aimed at keeping non-whites out. The latest example, debated in the House of Lords last month, is the Asylum and Immigration Appeals bill. On February 16, Lord Bonham-Carter observed that 'there is racial discrimination in the way in which the system works at present; and that will become worse if there is no appeals procedure', as there will not be under the new legislation. 'I should be surprised,' he added, 'if the more than one-in-1,000 Americans who were refused . . . entry  -as opposed to the one-in-five Ghanaians and one-in-27 Jamaicans - were not black.' In return for this restrictive covenant, the native inhabitants of the white homeland of Britain are expected to treat the few Africans, Asians and West Indians in their midst with a degree of decency. Most do. Mr Condon's is the right approach to those who do not.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ceslovas Skarzinskas: "Some Crimes Have </F> Declined, While Others Have Increased"]    [Excerpts] Yesterday's plenary meeting of the Interior  Ministry Collegium was attended by President A. Brazauskas,  Prime Minister A. Slezevicius, Seimas [parliament] Deputy  Chairman E. Bickauskas, Prosecutor General A. Paulauskas,  Justice Minister J. Prapiestis, Supreme Court Chairman M. Losys,  V. Petkevicius, chairman of the Seimas National Security  Committee, many state officials, and leaders of police stations  in towns and regions.    The criminal situation in Lithuania is complicated. The  police have registered 12,848 crimes over the first three months  of this year alone. Interior Minister R. Vaitekunas expressed  his delight with the fact that the crime rate in the first  quarter of this year has dropped by 18.8 percent in comparison  with the same period last year. The situation is stabilizing.  However, the number of grave crimes increased in the beginning  of this year and reached a total of 2,239. The only consolation  is that a large number of these crimes -- 44.5 percent -- have  been solved. Criminals have used firearms 105 times this year.  It is difficult to predict what will happen in Lithuania now  that the official permit to buy firearms for self-defense came  into effect on 1 April.    Incidentally, the rate of thefts of personal, state, and  stockholders' property has declined.    Minister Vaitekunas' assessment of the law on preventive  detention was very positive. It may be this law that helped  disclose a larger number of grave crimes. For example, 75  people have been detained under this law this year. However,  there is no place to hold detained people. Currently, there are  1,400 suspects in confinement cells. Jails are overcrowded with  prisoners. The meeting addressed the expansion of new  confinement facilities. [passage omitted]    The last speaker to address the meeting was President A.  Brazauskas, who assessed the work of the Interior Ministry  favorably. After the restoration of independence, there were  attempts to politicize the ministry. The president said that  free market relations triggered corruption and led to a number  of other problems in the country.    The president placed emphasis on economic crimes. "We," said  A. Brazauskas, "collect only about 60 percent of taxes from  organizations. Private firms employ 55 percent of the  population. Do they settle their accounts with the state? It is  necessary to apply police measures here."    Among other economic crimes, the president mentioned the  "Sekunde" bank, which deceived 14,000 depositors. He also  criticized self-governments that engage in politics instead of  dealing with municipal problems. They should be a serious help  for the police. Participants in the meeting also discussed  contraband, border defense, and bribery.    Successful attempts to suppress the surge of crime will  depend on joint and resolute actions of all judicial  institutions. This idea was voiced by all the speakers.</p>

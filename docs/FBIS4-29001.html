			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning the National Assembly deputies worked  at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall under the direction of Chairman  Nong Duc Manh. Members of the government cabinet continued to  answer questions raised by National Assembly deputies on the  implementation of socioeconomic tasks in the first six months of  the year and plans for the next six months.    Tran Dinh Hoan, minister of labor, war invalids, and social  welfare answered questions on the calculation of pensions for  retired cadres, pensions and allowances for wounded soldiers,  death benefits for survivors of war dead, allowances for cadres  and soldiers [formerly] on combat duty in the south leaving  families behind without support, and wage scales for cadres of  education and medical agencies at the grassroots level.    On the issue of spontaneous immigration, Minister Tran Dinh  Hoan revealed major measures that the Ministry of Labor, War  Invalids, and Social Welfare are applying, including the setting  up of new economic zones projects in areas with many spontaneous  immigrants already settled there or in areas to which they like  to move. On the issue of rehabilitation for drug addicts, the  minister spelled out measures currently used by the government  to set up a rehabilitation service at the ward and commune level  with wide cooperation from local authorities, mass  organizations, and families of drug addicts. Drug addicts who  use intravenous drugs should be sent to institutionalized  centers; however, the most important task is always the active  prevention of this social vice.    Construction Minister Ngo Xuan Loc answered questions on the  price of houses in Ho Chi Minh City, and revealed that in the  recent past his ministry has quickly rectified errors previously  committed when carrying out the task of appraising house prices .    Trade Minister Le Van Triet answered questions on cases  concerning paper imports, import quotas for motorcycles, and one  case concerning 38 motorcars imported into Binh Dinh Province.  The minister held that the Trade Ministry was basing its work  on the amount of paper produced domestically to allow the import  of a necessary amount of paper -- types of paper that cannot be  produced here -- for use in the sector concerning external  relations. The decision to withhold motorcycle import permits  is in line with the government policy to use foreign currency  reserves to import production supply.</p>

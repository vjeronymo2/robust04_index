			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Technology: Blocks on the superhighway - A warning that the US communications industry could be strangled by red tape Excessive government regulation could put a road block on the 'information superhighway', the US Council on Competitiveness, an independent group of US industry executives, academics and labour leaders, warns in a new report on communications competition policy issued yesterday. 'Just as the nation is poised to deliver a seamless web of communications and information products and services, we find ourselves stymied by a tangled web of regulations and public policies,' the report says. The vision of multi-media information, communications and interactive entertainment services distributed on high-speed networks is spurring a frenzy of mergers and alliances which is reshaping the US communications industry. Cable television, telephone, broadcasting, computing, publishing, wireless communications and power companies are currently rapidly converging as new technologies create overlapping markets. As this industry fusion takes place, US regulators and legislators are struggling to keep pace. Next month, the Clinton administration, which has made the creation of an advanced 'National Information Infrastructure' the central element of its technology policy, is scheduled to publish proposals for a new Communications Act. This landmark legislation, drafted by an inter-agency team headed by vice president Al Gore, will establish new 'rules of the road' for the information superhighway. Industry leaders hope it will also dismantle the restrictions and regulations that provide US regional telephone companies and cable TV operators with local market monopolies while preventing them from directly competing with one another. The Council report states: 'The National Information Infrastructure will only develop fully if competition can flourish at all levels. It is imperative that industry and government focus on removing obstacles to competition in the immediate future.' The Council has achieved a consensus among key industry factions which are often on opposite sides of regulatory issues. These include long-distance telephone companies such as AT&amp;T, regional telephone companies such as Pacific Bell and Nynex, and cable TV companies such as TCI and Viacom. 'We are all agreed that everyone should be able to compete in any part of the communications business,' says John Young, retired chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and co-chairman of the Council's 21st century information infrastructure project. 'The question is what are the transition rules that can get you from regulated monopolies to open competition.' To enlarge competition, the Council recommends the 'unbundling of essential services' by all communications providers, including regional telephone companies. This would encourage new entrants into the market by enabling them, for example, to make use of existing networks and switching equipment. At the same time, the Council recommends dominant existing communications companies should be given greater flexibility in determining prices for their services. Council members also agreed that all service providers should share the cost of providing 'universal service' at minimal prices, a key tenet of the administration's policy. Currently, local telephone companies provide basic local telephone services at minimal prices. Typically, the phone companies subsidise these by charging higher prices for business services. 'If some Teleport comes in and wants to compete in just the business market, they are going to have to contribute' to the cost of universal service, Young explains. The Council also agreed on the contentious issue of allowing regulated service providers to enter new markets. Regional telephone companies, for example, are prohibited from entering the long-distance telephone service market and from providing video programming. Council members differed strongly, however, on whether new competitors should be allowed to achieve a specified share of an established provider's market before restrictions on entering new businesses are lifted.

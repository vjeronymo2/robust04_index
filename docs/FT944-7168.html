			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Tisa loan in general syndication A Dollars 1.1bn syndicated loan for Spain's Telefonica Internacional (Tisa), a subsidiary of Telefonica de Espana, has been launched into general syndication, Reuter reports. The seven-year loan, which carries a spread of 27.5 basis points over London inter-bank offered rate (Libor), is a refinancing of a Dollars 1bn seven-month bridging facility signed in May to buy two Peruvian telecommunications companies. Arrangers of the syndicated loan are ABN-Amro Bank and Banco de Negocios Argentaria, together with underwriters Bank of Tokyo, Fuji Bank, Banque Nationale de Paris and Bank of America. An Dollars 850m revolving credit for Saga Petroleum, the Norwegian energy group, has also been launched into general syndication, writes Martin Brice. Arrangers are ABN Amro, Deutsche and Barclays, with co-arrangers Christiania Bank and Den norske Bank. The seven-year loan is priced at 30 basis points over Libor for years one to five and 35 over for years six and seven, with undrawn facilities at 15 basis points for years one to five and 17 1/2 for years six and seven. Underwriting for the Kingdom of Sweden's Dollars 5bn syndicated loan should be complete by the middle of next week, said Ms Christine Holm of the Swedish National Debt Office.</p>

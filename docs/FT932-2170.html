			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Books: Joyceana is still blooming - James Joyce still generates literary excitement JAMES JOYCE'S DUBLINERS: AN ANNOTATED EDITION edited by John Wyse Jackson and Bernard McGinley Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 25, 200 pages JAMES JOYCE: REFLECTIONS OF IRELAND by Bernard McCabe and Alain Le Garsmeur Little Brown Pounds 12.99, 156 pages ULYSSES: THE 1922 TEXT edited by Jeri Johnson Oxford/Worlds Classics Pounds 6.99, 900 pages LAST WEDNESDAY - June 16 - was Bloomsday. That was the day in 1904 when Leopold Bloom walked through Dublin in pursuit of his business and desires, encountered Stephen Dedalus and brought him to his home where Stephen met Bloom's wife Molly. It is the best documented single day in the whole of fiction and it has become a red-letter day in the literary calendar; publishers like to release their latest Joyceana on Bloomsday. But can there really be anything of any importance left to release? It was way back in 1968 that Richard Ellmann introduced from Faber a hitherto unpublished fiction from the hand of the master, and he suggested that this would be the end: 'It seems probable (Ellmann wrote) that Giacomo Joyce will be the last of James Joyce's published writings. He wrote it over half a century ago in Trieste, at that stage of his life when he was completing A Portrait of the Artist as A Young Man and was beginning Ulysses. Giacomo Joyce pivots between the two books.' It was only 16 pages long - as was the original notebook in Joyce's handwriting in which it was discovered - but is, even so, complete. It is a meditation by Giacomo - an Irish teacher of English in Trieste, clearly Joyce himself - on one of his female pupils who is Jewish and who attracts him. It is highly autobiographical. But it now seems that Ellmann was wrong. Research on Joyce's life and his papers has continued unabated since then. Another Joyce scholar, Danis Rose, has been working for the past 16 years on a critical edition of Finnegans Wake and he is convinced that there was another transitional work of fiction, Finn's Hotel (the name of the hotel where Nora Barnacle worked when she first met Joyce), composed in between Ulysses and Finnegans. This was projected as a series of stories about Ireland and the myths of Ireland. They were begun in 1923 and abandoned in 1924, and then later incorporated into the larger work. Rose claims to have reconstructed this lost work and publication of it was to have been this year's great Bloomsday event. But not for the first time in the history of the publication of Joyce's works, the project seems to have ground suddenly to a halt and is for the moment on hold. Even so, this year will see in the autumn publication of a 'new' book by Joyce, his Political, Critical and Occasional Writings from Viking. Little of the contents will come as a surprise to dedicated Joyceans. They will include his early book-reviews, his student paper on Drama and Life (quoted in Stephen Hero), his youthful salute to the dying Ibsen, as well as later pieces on Wilde, Shaw and Home Rule. Many of these fugitive writings have up to now been difficult of access. To have them all conveniently placed in one collected volume at an affordable price should be a boon. Meanwhile the work of unlocking the mysteries of the existing published texts reaches new levels of thoroughness. Joyce's love of word-play grew and grew until it became an obsession, a madness. There are signs of it even as early as Dubliners. One of the two sisters who have just attended the death of their brother, a priest, in the first story is guilty of malapropism. She recalls a plan for a nostalgic ride that never took place: '. . . he kept on saying that before the summer was over he'd go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again where we were all born down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with him. If we could only get one of them new-fangled carriages that make no noise that Father O'Rourke told him about, them with the rheumatic wheels . . .' In their new annotated edition of Dubliners the editors not only give us a gloss on Irishtown, the poor area of Dublin south of the Liffey, they also explain that the new-fangled carriages were not motor-cars but horse-drawn carriages with pneumatic tyres. These tyres were invented by an Irishman, JB Dunlop, who was later described by Joyce in Finnegans as 'the best tyrent of ourish times'. They add too that Joyce would have seen an advertisement for a patent medicine containing the word 'rheumatic' underneath an early version of his story in The Irish Homestead. Then they give us two facsimile pages from the issue of this popular magazine for August 13 1904 containing the beginning of 'The Sisters'. It appears under the heading of 'Our Weekly Story'. The text of the story here differs significantly in places from the later published version we all know. Such exemplary exegesis takes up a great deal of space; the editors' footnotes become in fact sidenotes; and with the illustrations and afterwords at the end of each story, the material the editors contribute to the book is more copious than the stories it elucidates. Anyone who just wants to read the stories without fuss had better do so in the standard paperback and use this as a reference book. It is invaluable as an insight into the young Joyce's mind and to the condition of Ireland at the turn of the century. A less exacting way of getting to Joyce's source-material is to look at the photographs by Alain Le Garsmeur that illustrate James Joyce: Reflections of Ireland. Much remains in Dublin that he would recognise. North Richmond Street, for example, a cul de sac used by Joyce as the setting for the story 'Araby', and where at one time the Joyce family lived. We have the opening of the story on one page, and a photograph of the street as it is now on the facing one. But we need to turn to the Annotated volume for an explanation of the street's name (after Charles Lennox, Fourth Duke of Richmond) and to discover there were at this time two Joyce families living there. Le Garsmeur is a fine photographer, whether catching a customer at Mulligans raising glass to lips or the grim grandeur of such landmarks as the Poolbeg lighthouse and the Martello Tower where Ulysses begins. No area of Joyce's work has proved more contentious than the text of this book. The edition prepared by Hans Walter Gabler published in 1984 and currently on sale in Penguin as 'The Corrected Text' has been heavily assailed for a host of alleged inaccuracies and was the subject of a blazing long-running row in the literary press on both sides of the Atlantic. The assault was led by an American academic John Kidd, who is editing the whole thing afresh. Meanwhile yet another American scholar, Jeri Johnson, currently Senior Tutor at Exeter College, Oxford, has reissued the 1922 text of Ulysses published by Sylvia Beach from her bookshop in Paris, Shakespeare &amp; Co. This edition was superseded even in Joyce's lifetime and is now extremely rare. Judged by the text of later revisions, errors abound; but when all is said, this remains the text from which the novel made its initial impact. It is the one that its first reviewers - TS Eliot, Ezra Pound, Virginia Woolf, Arnold Bennett et al actually read - and from which they made their assessments. With Johnson's full introduction, there is no reason at all why it should not give a new generation of readers their first experience of this great work.</p>

			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: TRIPLE FEATURE  </P> <P> Faster than a speeding sequel comes news that Universal's already-announced  "Twins" sequel may actually spawn something new. Are you ready for "Triplets"?  </P> <P> Yes, according to a studio source, Arnold Schwarzenneger and Danny DeVito will  apparently be joined by another sibling. And there's a further twist: sibling  No. 3 is a she. We're told that the top candidate for the part is . . .  Roseanne Barr.  </P> <P> A spokesman for producer-director Ivan Reitman said the only thing being  developed at his company is "a vacation" following the frantic work to finish  "Ghostbusters II."  </P> <P> "We may do a sequel and it might be called 'Triplets,' " the rep said  diplomatically. "Right now we've got a lot of ideas but nothing set in  stone."SI Leonard Klady  </P> <P> </P></p>

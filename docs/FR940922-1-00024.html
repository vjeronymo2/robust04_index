Overview of Title I Scheme  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The OTC's recommendation under section 184(c) of the Act that EPA mandate that states in the OTR adopt the LEV program arises in the context of the program designed to address ozone (or ``smog'') pollution in subpart 2 of part D of title I of the Act. This program is described in detail in EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992), and the Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble, 57 FR 55620 (Nov. 25, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of provisions in subpart 2 and elsewhere in the Act are particularly important to emphasize here. Part D establishes a system for more polluted areas to have more time to attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and subjects those more polluted areas to a graduated program of additional and more stringent specific control requirements to be accomplished over the longer timeframe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 181(a) provides for classification of ozone nonattainment areas based on the degree of the nonattainment problem in the area (as measured by the area's ozone design value), and provides that attainment ``shall be as expeditiously as practicable but not later than'' specified deadlines expressed as years after enactment. The areas and the corresponding attainment deadlines are: Marginal (1993); moderate (1996); serious (1999); severe (2005 or 2007, depending on the design value); and extreme (2010). The Act also provides for designation of areas as attainment or as ``unclassifiable.'' All classifications other than extreme are represented in the OTR. Section 184(b) also specifies additional requirements applicable for attainment areas in ozone transport regions, including: (1) Enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance programs in cities meeting specified size thresholds; (2) state-wide implementation of reasonably available control measures (RACT); (3) ``Stage II'' vehicle refueling vapor controls or ``comparable measures''; and (4) treatment of major stationary sources of ozone precursors as if they were in moderate nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 182 establishes the graduated control measures applicable for each nonattainment classification. These measures are additive in that the higher classifications must generally adopt, in addition to measures specifically applicable to that higher classification, all measures identified for lower classifications as well. A basic requirement applicable to marginal and above classifications is that states are to submit inventories of actual emissions from all sources in each nonattainment area. See sections 182(a)(1) and 172(c)(3). These emissions inventories may be important in determining whether the LEV program is necessary in the OTR. The inventories are critical inputs for models used to determine the magnitude of emissions reductions that may be needed for attainment and the effectiveness of various measures to obtain such reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another potentially key requirement is that moderate and above areas must submit attainment demonstrations. Under section 182(b)(1)(A), for moderate and above areas, states are to specify in their plans specific annual reductions in emissions ``as necessary to attain the [NAAQS] for ozone by the attainment date applicable under this Act.'' Under section 182(c)(2)(A), for serious and above areas, states are to submit a demonstration that the SIP, ``as revised, will provide for attainment of the ozone [NAAQS] by the applicable attainment date.'' Further, this provision continues, ``[t]his attainment demonstration must be based on photochemical grid modeling or any other analytical method determined by the Administrator, in the Administrator's discretion, to be at least as effective.'' The modeling information is, of course, important to determining the reductions necessary in areas to achieve attainment throughout the OTR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is also relevant that states are obligated to adopt various measures specified for progress toward attainment, and to achieve certain percentage reductions in emissions by interim dates. In general, section 172(c)(2) requires that SIPs ``require reasonable further progress'' (RFP), defined in section 171(1) to mean ``such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by this part or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the [NAAQS] by the applicable date.'' Section 182(b) specifically provides that, by November 15, 1993, states were to submit SIP revisions for moderate and above areas providing for, with a limited feasibility exception, a 15% reduction by 1996 in emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a 1990 baseline. Further, section 182(c)(2)(B) provides that, by November 15, 1994, states are to submit SIP revisions for serious and above areas that will result, subject to a limited feasibility exception, in additional reductions in VOC emissions from the 1990 baseline of 3% each year averaged over consecutive 3-year periods beginning in 1996 and until the attainment date. Section 182(c)(2)(C) provides for substitution of reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) for VOC, in accordance with EPA guidance. These RFP requirements establish minimum reductions that certain nonattainment areas in the OTR will be required to achieve apart from whether EPA approves or disapproves the OTC recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, section 110 of the Act establishes general requirements for SIPs. Section 110(a)(2) specifies minimum elements of a state's SIP, and subparagraph (D) specifies that a state's SIP shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contain adequate provisions_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Prohibiting, consistent with the provisions of this title, any source or other type of emissions activity within the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (I) Contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other State with respect to any such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This provision, as discussed in detail below, is the key mechanism under the transport provisions of sections 176A and 184, and is central to the OTC recommendation and to EPA's action on it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

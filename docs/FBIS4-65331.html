			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 16 (AFP) -- French objections to  Russian sales of cheap uranium held up a decision by European  Union [EU] foreign ministers here Monday [16 May] to sign a new  trade, cooperation and partnership accord with Russia.    But diplomats predicted that the agreement would be wrapped  up in mid-June.    The Greek chairman of the EU council of ministers, Theodoros  Pangalos, said it might be signed by EU leaders and Russian  President Boris Yeltsin at an EU summit on the Greek island of  Corfu on June 24 and 25.    The accord would give Russia better access to western  European markets and open up the prospect of a Russia-EU free  trade area after 1997 if Moscow implements market reforms.    It also recognises Russia as an economy in transition  towards  a free market, rather than state-controlled. This concession  tranlates into better trade terms.    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe blocked the agreement on  the grounds that it would favour Russian exports of cut-rate  uranium to the EU, where France has 60 percent of the market.    Juppe insisted that nuclear fuels should be excluded from  the  accord, at least until it had won more favourable terms from  Moscow. He is due in Moscow later this week to discuss the issue.    But diplomats suggested that the French objection was  tactical and temporary, aimed at placating the influential  French nuclear industry.    EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said: "I'm delighted  at the reception given by our proposals on nuclear and banking.  The agreement is effectively resolved and I am confident it  will be agreed in June."    The accord has been held up for more than a year by Moscow's  insistence on incorporating nuclear fuels, and on restricting  the operations of foreign banks in Russia.    In a gesture to France, the European Commission has proposed  that the EU retain the right to curb surges of cheap imported  Russian uranium.    The EU executive has also accepted Russian insistence that  foreign banks should be allowed no more than 12 percent of the  Russian banking system's capital -- at least until a review  after five years.    An EU diplomat reported a general sentiment at Monday's  meeting that Russia would not budge and that the deal was the  best that could be got.    The EU ministers also gave their approval to the signature  of  a similar trade, cooperation and partnership agreement with  Ukraine, which was initialled in March.    Diplomats said Ukrainian President Leonard Kravchuk might  sign the accord with EU foreign ministers at a meeting in  Luxembourg on June 14.    They said he had asked for the signing ceremony to be held  ahead of a Ukrainian presidential election at the end of June.</p>

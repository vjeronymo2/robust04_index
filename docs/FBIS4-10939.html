			<p>IDB   <F P=102>   PY1904221194 La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 9 Apr 94 p 5 </F> <F P=103> PY1904221194 </F> <F P=104>  La Paz PRESENCIA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] On 8 April, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada  admitted the country's "major dependency" on foreign power  factors that have an impact on various Bolivian fields that  cannot change from one day to the next without placing financial  stability at risk.    In his speech during the main ceremony to mark the 42d  anniversary of the national revolution, Sanchez de Lozada said:  "Our dependency is on the IMF, the IDB [Inter-American  Development Bank], and the U.S. Embassy, which tell us what we  can and cannot do. And this is due to our weakness, but I want  to tell you that what this government is doing is to go beyond  what we are told to do."    Before an auditorium full of supporters, the chief of state  asked the country for patience by pointing out that the major  reforms will take some time to yield results because the  government is determined to carry out a third revolution in  democracy, "free of violence and shots... but with measures as  important as those of the 1952 National Revolution and those  that allowed the stabilization of our economy in 1985."    Addressing his political allies in the government, he asked  them to get rid of susceptibilities and, above all, the idea  that the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] might  disappear some day. He stated: "I am a businessman and my  businesses and partners do well and each one has their separate  share; the people are our common business now."    But he also warned the MNR that it would be disastrous to  try  to be a hegemonic party again because when this happens "one  loses touch with reality and infighting starts, which is  something the party already has experienced in the past.  Competition is better than hegemony."    Regarding the opposition, he said that many parties  disappeared because they believed in dogmas and myths and others  because they let pragmatism prevail over their principles.    He also devoted several minutes of his speech to the reforms  his government upholds. He said he intends to consolidate what  the MNR started during the six times it came to power since 1952  and project this work into the future.    Sanchez de Lozada said: "Capitalization, the peoples'  participation, the education system's reform, and sustained  development fall within the MNR's much-desired objective to  consolidate the national state with social justice."    The capitalization project seeks to rescue the public  enterprises to prevent them from the same fate as COMIBOL  [Mining Corporation of Bolivia]. He added that it is not only  an economic measure but also a social one because it is designed  to redistribute wealth.    He said the peoples' participation project is a 500-year-old  debt that is being honored because it will give the people  economic and political power. It will allow a fair distribution  of wealth according to the population, which means that a person  from La Paz will have the same status as a person from Pando and  a person from Potosi will be the same as a person from Santa  Cruz. Let's hope it will work because the future of new  generations is tied to the project's success.</p>

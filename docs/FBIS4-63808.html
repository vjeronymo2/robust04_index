			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is proposing to make Sevastopol the main base  for the Russian part of the Black Sea Fleet and to relocate the  Ukrainian navy outside of the town. Options include having the  Ukraine navy stationed in Balaklava, in Crimea, or in Odessa.  Our correspondent was told this by unofficial sources. Those  unofficial sources think that a final document may be signed  this evening.</p>

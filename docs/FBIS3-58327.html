Head of the Foreign Policy Commission of the German  Parliament, Hans Stercken, in a meeting with Larijani said that  Iran and Germany would further cooperate in regional issues and  added that Bonn attaches importance to the recent visit to  Tehran of a team of German parliamentarians including.  [sentence as received]    Stercken said his country is willing to extend supervisory  assistance to countries keen on privatization programmes. He  hailed the views shared by the two countries on Karabakh  conflict as the best key to resolve the Azerbaijan-Armenian  conflict.    Larijani said Iran was willing to have constructive  cooperation with Germany during Iran's second Five-Year  Development Plan (to start in March). Iran could be a reliable  partner for Germany and Europe, he hoped.    Larijani said Iran was ready to cooperate with Germany and  the European Union (EU) for disarmament of nuclear and chemical  weapons of mass destruction in the entire region. The West  alleges arms buildup in Iran, whereas the fact is, Western arms  sale to Persian Gulf states are worth twice as much as Iran's  oil revenues in the past year, he noted.    Larijani had a separate meeting with German Deputy Foreign  Minister Dieter Kastrup, with whom he exchanged views on  bilateral relations, peace in the Middle East, Central Asia, the  Persian Gulf and developments in the former Soviet republics.  Kastrup referred to expansion of Tehran-Bonn relations, and  emphasized the important role of the Islamic Republic of Iran in  regional peace, security and stability.    Larijani replied that the Islamic Republic of Iran would  continue to assist in peace and security efforts in the region  and the West should welcome Iran's capability in this regard.  Iran's interests lie in peaceful joint cooperation in the  region, he said, and that the Islamic Republic was ready to  implement a regional cooperation system in the Persian Gulf to  provide all the international guarantees and remove suspicions  and anxieties.</p>

After  meeting with the ministers of finance, industry and commerce,  science and technology, and culture -- Fernando Henrique  Cardoso, Elcio Alvares, Jose Israel Vargas, and Jose Roberto  Nascimento e Silva, respectively, whom he briefed on his  negotiations in Washington last week -- Amorim declined to say  if an agreement will be reached. He said:    "I believe the agreements of the Uruguay Round give both  sides a set of conditions for reaching an agreement. However, I  cannot give assurances such an agreement will be reached."    Amorim confirmed that under U.S. law, 28 February is the  deadline for an agreement. He added that an eventual accord  must be ratified by the Brazilian Congress within the normal  deadlines for the approval of the patent law. Once approved by  the Chamber of Deputies, the bill will be submitted to the  Senate and return to the Chamber of Deputies if the  modifications requested by the United States are included.    Amorim said that during a conversation with U.S. Commercial  Representative Mickey Kantor last Wednesday, "suggestions, new  ideas, and imaginative proposals were made" for resolving the  problems created by Brazil's reluctance to recognize  international patents.    After yesterday's meeting, Minister Cardoso said Brazil will  uphold its basic demands during the negotiations with the United  States.</p>

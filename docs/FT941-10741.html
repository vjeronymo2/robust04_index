			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Jargon adds to the meaning Sir, While we should applaud Lucy Kellaway's tirade against the murky bathwater of management jargon ('Time to walk the talk', February 4) please mind the baby. She is wrong to sneer at companies which have partners rather than suppliers: partners is a plain word, and companies which turn ordinary suppliers into partners enjoy a cost and quality-effective business relationship. A workforce which 'buys into' a new initiative does much more than accept it. The commitment which comes from the involvement of the workforce makes that initiative work, whereas mere acceptance does not. By all means find a more felicitous phrase, but do not lose the sentiment. David M. Carlile, 1 Dinglewood Close, Coombe Dingle, Bristol BS9 2LL</p>

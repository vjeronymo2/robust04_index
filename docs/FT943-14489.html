			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Jobs for life' were never the norm for Japanese Sir, It is unfortunate that the myth of 'lifetime employment' has been trundled out again in the FT ('Fujitsu staff go it alone', July 12). Even in big Japanese companies it has never applied to the large number of temporary and part-time employees, who can be fired at any time. Small and medium-sized companies may revere it as an ideal, but cannot afford it - some 70 per cent of employees work in such companies. Far from being the norm, 'lifetime' employment, which even some Japanese companies are trying to rename 'long-term' employment, probably applied to no more than 30 per cent of all Japanese employees at most - including those in government offices. In other words, only a minority has ever enjoyed the job security that it offers, at a price. In the present recession, such large companies as Pioneer and TDK are making 'permanent' staff redundant, while others are reducing the compensation of those who will not take early retirement. SME employees must, as usual, take their chances in an external labour market that is even harder than before. While not denigrating the significance of 'one career' employment in the large corporations as an instrument of control and as an ideology or idea with considerable emotional pull, the fact is that this practice, which has only ever applied to those at the top of the pile, now applies to even fewer. While it would be an exaggeration to predict its total disappearance, a growing number of companies is finding it increasingly unrealistic.

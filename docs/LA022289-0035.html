			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> HORTA CREATES DIN AT LE CAFE  </P> <P> At the heart and soul of the Brazilian guitarist Toninho Horta one suspects  there is great musicality lurking. But he made it very difficult to discover  Monday night at the Room Upstairs at Le Cafe.  </P> <P> After waiting more than an hour for his first set to even begin, Horta  proceeded to make the full house wait even longer for anything of musical  significance as he led his sextet through a series of tunes that could best be  described as deafening.  </P> <P> Granted, the Room Upstairs is far better suited for softer acts, but Horta, who  has recently been featured with singer Flora Purim, and his fellow players  should know how to make such adjustments (leaving half of the amplifiers at  home would have been a good start). It was a sad mistake that short-changed an  enthusiastic audience as the rich textural qualities, rhythmic excitement and  subtle flavorings of much of Horta's music were exchanged for a muddled din of  monotonous excesses.  </P> <P> Horta has fueled the Brazilian compositional traditions with electricity,  creating an unattractive fusion like one that might occur if Jobim ever sat in  with Spryo Gyra. And from the few established fusion traditions, Horta has  borrowed such elements as unison melody statements, odd-metered transitions and  riff-based improvisations. It was the samba that couldn't dance, the bossa  without the nova.  </P> <P> Contributing to all of this nonsense was the ever-dashing drummer Mike Shapiro  and the booming bassist Gary Brown, both of whom seemed eager to be heard in  Riverside without ever having to leave Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> All of Monday evening's interminable first set wasn't lost, however. Like the  momentary aural refreshment offered when the subway finally stops, came a  handful of beautiful ballads to offer pleasant respite. Horta's guitar playing  took on new dimensions -- ones of grace and simplicity -- and his vocal on  "Waiting for Angela" revealed a sensitive vocal stylist. A. JAMES LISKA  </P></p>

			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK dairy company makes premium offer to farmers NORTHERN FOODS has announced that it will pay British farmers a premium of 1.2p a litre for their milk above the level set by Milk Marque when the country's market is freed in April. Milk Marque is the voluntary farmers' co-operative set up by the Milk Marketing Board following its abolition in September. The premium to be paid is higher than many farmers had expected and reflects Northern Foods' need for a steady supply of liquid milk, which commands higher prices than milk for processing. 'It's a very brave thing for them to do - I didn't think there was that amount of margin in it,' said Mr Hugh Black, a dairy farmer in Herefordshire. 'They must be prepared to lose a bit of money at first because the margin must be fractions of pennies,' he said. The premium contains a one-off goodwill bonus to all producers of 0.5p a litre, which means that prices could drop slightly after the first year under the new arrangements. The Northern Milk Partnership, which has been set up by Northern Foods to buy milk directly from producers in the new free market, has already signed up enough farms to supply its annual requirements of 2bn litres. The group has 3,100 producers on its books representing 18 per cent of the UK's annual output. Milk Marque has not yet set an official price for payment to farmers, but Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive, has suggested that the price could rise by 2p a litre or more above current prices of 22p a litre as supplies remain tight in the UK market. However, Mr Roland Williams who recently retired as director of economics at the Milk Marketing Board, said he does not believe Milk Marque will be able to afford to pay farmers more than 23p to 23 1/2 p in the 1994 to 1995 marketing year. Mr Williams' comments will add to the row about pricing in the free milk market, where farmers are hoping to see their margins improve. Mr Dare has said consumers should not see large price increases.</p>

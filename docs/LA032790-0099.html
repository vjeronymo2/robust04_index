			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DRIVING MISS DAISY,' TANDY WIN TOP OSCARS;  </P> <P> ACADEMY AWARDS: DAY-LEWIS IS NAMED BEST ACTOR. STONE IS BEST DIRECTOR FOR  'FOURTH OF JULY.'  </P> <P> "Driving Miss Daisy," the surprise hit about a tart Southern matron and her  black chauffeur, won Oscars for best picture and best actress, as Hollywood  scattered its laurels around the globe during the 62nd annual Academy Awards  ceremony Monday night.  </P> <P> Oliver Stone won his second statuette for best director on Universal Pictures'  "Born on the Fourth of July," the political and psychological odyssey of  Vietnam veteran and anti-war activist Ron Kovic.  </P> <P> "Fourth of July" also took an award for film editing, but those were the  movie's only Oscars, despite eight nominations.  </P> <P> Britain's Daniel Day-Lewis edged aside "Fourth of July" star Tom Cruise to  capture the Oscar for best actor for portraying Irish writer-artist Christy  Brown's struggle with cerebral palsy in Miramax's "My Left Foot."  </P> <P> Brenda Fricker was named best supporting actress for her role as Brown's mother  in the film, which had also received nominations for best picture and best  director after it was initially overlooked by audiences.  </P> <P> In a widely expected award, London-born stage and film veteran Jessica Tandy  was named best actress for her portrayal of the cantankerous Jewish dowager in  "Miss Daisy."  </P> <P> "I'm on Cloud 9!" the actress said as she picked up her statuette -- and became  the academy's oldest best-actress winner at age 80.  </P> <P> Alfred Uhry, who won a 1987 Pulitzer Prize for the play on which "Miss Daisy"  was based, won for best screenplay adaptation.  </P> <P> The film also won the makeup award, reflecting the difficulty of making up  actors to reflect their changing ages in the story.  </P> <P> "Miss Daisy," initially turned down by the major studios, was made by Warner  Bros. only after producers Richard and Lili Fini Zanuck slashed its budget and  secured additional backing from British film financier Jake Eberts.  </P> <P> It nonetheless racked up nine Oscar nominations and, to date, $70 million at  the U.S. box office, and bucked the conventional wisdom again by becoming one  of the few films ever to win the best-picture Oscar without its director having  been nominated.  </P> <P> "We're here for one very simple reason. Bruce Beresford is a brilliant  director," Richard Zanuck said in accepting the best-picture Oscar.  </P> <P> Stone, who previously won Oscars for directing "Platoon," the best picture of  1986, and for writing "Midnight Express," had been widely favored to win this  year's directing Oscar.  </P> <P> "My deepest thanks for your acknowledgement that Vietnam is not over, although  some people say it is," Stone said of the war in which he fought and was  decorated.  </P> <P> Denzel Washington was named best supporting actor for his portrayal of a  maverick black soldier in the Civil War drama "Glory," distributed by Tri-Star  Pictures.  </P> <P> "I want to pay homage to . . . the black soldiers who helped make this country  free," Washington said in accepting. His was the only major prize for "Glory,"  but the film also took Oscars for best cinematography and best sound.  </P> <P> Monday's ceremony, produced by film and TV director Gil Cates, carried an  international theme that was supposed to reflect the growing  internationalization of the film business and the way new communications  technologies have helped break down cultural barriers. Several Oscar presenters  announced prizes by satellite hookups from London, Moscow, Sydney, and Buenos  Aires.  </P> <P> "How can you have a closed society when the skies are open from Moscow to  Beijing to, you name it, Gary, Indiana?" academy President Karl Malden said as  the show began.  </P> <P> While the Oscar telecast was seen in about 27 million homes in the United  States last year, the show's international audience has grown to over a billion  viewers in about 90 countries.  </P> <P> Hollywood studios such as Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures say they  currently get nearly half their film revenue abroad, with some films, such as  Paramount's "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" pulling in substantially more  from foreign markets than in the United States.  </P> <P> The show, broadcast on the ABC television network and hosted by actor-comedian  Billy Crystal, was slow-paced, and lasted 3 hours and 35 minutes after opening  shortly after 6 p.m. The show had moved back to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion  of the Music Center, where it was held previously, amid grumbling about  congestion at the much larger and older Shrine Auditorium.  </P> <P> Yet it is expected to return to the older venue again next year.  </P> <P> In his opening monologue, Crystal took some satirical jabs at modern-day  Hollywood, as he quipped about Jack Nicholson's huge salary, Japan-based Sony  Corp.'s takeover of Columbia Pictures, and Paramount's much-publicized fight  with Art Buchwald over the profits from its hit, "Coming to America."  </P> <P> Of 330 films in an opening montage, Crystal joked, "not one has yet gone into  profit" according to Paramount.  </P> <P> Yet the relatively subdued presentation contrasted with last year's show, which  attracted a larger-than-usual TV audience but was sharply criticized by  Hollywood insiders for its glitzy production numbers staged by producer Allan  Carr.  </P> <P> The earlier show included a song and dance by Snow White and actor Rob Lowe,  which proved an embarrassment when Walt Disney Co. later sued the Academy of  Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for trademark infringement. The suit was  dropped after the academy apologized.  </P> <P> Monday's ceremony included a special tribute to Japanese filmmaker Akira  Kurosawa, who has inspired such American directors as George Lucas, Steven  Spielberg and Lawrence Kasdan with dramas such as "Yojimbo," "The Seven  Samurai" and "Ran." Many of those films in turn drew inspiration from  non-Japanese sources that ranged from Shakespeare to American westerns.  </P> <P> Kurosawa's "Rashomon" and "Dersu Uzala" won Oscars for best foreign language  film, but the 80-year-old filmmaker has never been honored as best director.  </P> <P> "I really don't feel that I have yet grasped the essence of cinema," Kurosawa  said in accepting a lifetime achievement award from Lucas and Spielberg. "I  promise you from now on, I will work as hard as I can at making movies. Maybe  by following this path, I will achieve an understanding of the true essence of  cinema, and earn this."  </P> <P> "Cinema Paradiso," director Giuseppe Tornatore's tribute to the movie culture  of the 1940s and 1950s, captured the award for best foreign language film for  Italy.  </P> <P> "Henry V," a Shakespearean adaptation that won best-actor and best-director  nominations for 29-year-old Kenneth Branagh, won an Oscar only for best costume  design.  </P> <P> Warner Bros.'s "Batman," the year's biggest box-office success, was nominated  only once, but took the prize for best art direction by Anton Furst.  </P> <P> "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," which was directed by Spielberg and  became Paramount's biggest hit last year, also won a single Oscar, for sound  effects.  </P> <P> "Dead Poets Society" -- nominated for best picture, best actor, and best  director -- received only a single award for Tom Schulman's screenplay.  </P> <P> "The Little Mermaid," Walt Disney Co.'s animated entry, won best song and  original score prizes for composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman.  </P> <P> "The Abyss," an underwater epic that proved to be a box-office disappointment  for 20th Century Fox, received an Oscar for visual effects.  </P> <P> This year's Oscar nominations were laced with surprises, as academy members  overlooked some critical and box-office favorites to honor films that escaped  wide notice before the balloting.  </P> <P> Among the critical favorites overlooked in this year's nominations were  actor-director Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," which received nominations  only for best supporting actor and best screenplay, and "Glory," which was  bypassed for best picture, director, and screenplay.  </P> <P> Actress Kim Basinger gently chided the academy for all but ignoring Lee's  picture, which had been critically acclaimed for its tough look at race  relations in New York City.  </P> <P> "It might tell the greatest truth of all," Basinger said during her appearance  on the telecast, asserting that "Do the Right Thing" should have been among the  best picture nominees.  </P> <P> Howard Koch Sr., a longtime film producer and director who was once Paramount's  top movie executive, was awarded the academy's Jean Hersholt Humanitarian  Award.  </P> <P> Producer Charles Guggenheim's "The Johnstown Flood" was named best documentary  short, while Robert Epstein's and Bill Couturie's "Common Threads: Stories from  the Quilt," about the AIDS epidemic, won for best documentary feature.  </P> <P> The documentary nominees did not include Michael Moore's popular anti-General  Motors satire, "Roger and Me" -- an exclusion that has prompted proposals that  the academy change its documentary-nominating procedures for next year.  </P> <P> James Hendrie's "Work Experience" was the best live-action short film, and  Christoph and Wolfgang Lauenstein's "Balance" won the Oscar for best animated  short.  </P> <P> RELATED STORIES, PICTURES: F1, F2, F3  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DREXEL AIDE'S SENTENCE VACATED  </P> <P> A federal appeals court today upheld the perjury conviction of former Drexel  Burnham Lambert Inc. trading assistant Lisa Jones but vacated her 18-month  sentence as too harsh.  </P> <P> Three judges of the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to the  trial judge for resentencing.  </P> <P> A federal jury in March, 1989, found Jones guilty on five counts of perjury and  two counts of obstruction of justice for lying to a federal grand jury in  January, 1988, in an investigation of Drexel trading. She was sentenced last  August to 18 months in prison and fined about $50,000 by U.S. District Judge  Leonard B. Sand.  </P> <P> The appeals court ruled that Sand incorrectly enhanced her offense level under  federal sentencing guidelines, which resulted in a stiffer sentence.  </P> <P> "These instances of perjury, standing alone, do not constitute the type of  egregious conduct envisioned by the guidelines as substantial interference with  the administration of justice," the judges said in a 24-page opinion.  </P> <P> Under the offense level suggested by the appeals court, Jones faces 10 months  to 16 months in prison.  </P></p>

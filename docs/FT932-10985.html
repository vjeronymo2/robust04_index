			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Maastricht skirmishes IT IS hard for any normal British citizen to understand the Byzantine legalistic wrangles between the government and its opponents during the House of Commons' interminable debates over the Maastricht treaty. But it is becoming increasingly difficult to resist the feeling that the parliamentary procedures which have been on display are unbecoming to parliament and profoundly ill-adapted to the ratification of this kind of international agreement. The first reason for unease is that these procedures are in fact demeaning to the working of British democracy. The House of Commons prides itself on its reputation as the mother of parliaments, sovereign in all things. But it should be a cardinal rule of a model parliament that the legal significance of its debates should be clearly comprehensible, at least to the participants, and certainly to the government. This is not the case here. In February, the government produced two contradictory legal judgments on the consequences of a defeat on the social chapter: first (from the Foreign Office) that it would wreck the whole treaty, and second (from the attorney-general) that it would have no effect on the treaty at all. In principle the attorney-general's advice should carry the greatest weight; yet it has entirely failed to silence continued legal argument, or to introduce any real clarity into the consequences of the continued parliamentary skirmishing. Some opponents of the treaty seem to believe they could yet challenge Maastricht in the courts of law; other experts deny that such a judicial challenge would be feasible. On grounds of democratic principle, it would seem most undesirable that a judge, however eminent, should decide a political question which ought to have been settled by the elected representatives of the people. The dismay of the ordinary voter does not end here, however. By common consent, both of its supporters and of its opponents, Maastricht is an ambitious treaty which could have far-reaching consequences for Britain and Europe. But many British voters will have been surprised and even shocked to observe that the ratification process in the House of Commons does not seem to grapple with these large European policy issues at all. On the contrary, most of parliament's attention, and most of its legislative power, seems to be focused narrowly on those bits of the treaty which would have direct legislative consequences in Britain itself. The Conservative Euro-sceptics and the opposition parties have tried to derail the treaty by overthrowing the social protocol. But the government is astonishingly entitled to maintain, by some extraordinary anachronism, that ratification proper is merely a matter of the royal prerogative. This procedure has had the effect of avoiding the main issues, while fuelling a phony trench war between parliamentary factions on endless technicalities. The fact that the government, even when defeated on a substantial issue like the social chapter, can claim to ignore it reveals the dishonesty of the entire exercise. The mother of parliaments is going to have to work out a more effective relationship with the EC if it is to have any hope of representing its citizens' concerns effectively.</p>

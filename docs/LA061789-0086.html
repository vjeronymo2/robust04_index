			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR ASSAILS U.S. DELAYS OF DEATH CASES  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian on Friday assailed long delays in resolving capital  cases and urged that federal judges curtail reviews of constitutional  challenges to death sentences already upheld in state courts.  </P> <P> "Federal courts should accept these petitions as seldom as is necessary," said  Deukmejian, appearing at a hearing on behalf of the National Governors Assn.  "If there has been a full and fair adjudication of the issues in state courts,  they should accept that."  </P> <P> The governor said that delay in reviewing appeals prevents capital punishment  from serving as an effective deterrent to crime and enables criminals to "thumb  their noses at the law," knowing that even if they are caught, they still can  avoid paying the full price.  </P> <P> Deukmejian testified before a special task force of judges and other legal  authorities that is studying time-consuming delay, repetitive appeals, court  congestion and other problems that critics say are plaguing federal  constitutional challenges in capital cases.  </P> <P> Such challenges are made in federal habeas corpus petitions that are filed  after a defendant's conviction and sentence have been upheld in state courts.  The petitions are restricted to claims of violation of federal constitutional  rights, but the ability to file them has been substantially expanded by the  U.S. Supreme Court in recent years. Currently, about 9,500 federal habeas  corpus petitions are being filed annually in the United States, an estimated 5%  of them in capital cases.  </P> <P> The 11-member panel, sponsored by the American Bar Assn. and co-chaired by  California Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas, is receiving testimony from  prosecutors, defense attorneys and officials in a series of nationwide  hearings. The panel began two days of proceedings here at a time when there is  growing concern among judges, lawyers and other authorities over the prospect  of long delays in the review of California capital cases in the federal courts.  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court under Lucas has sharply accelerated its review of  death-penalty cases, upholding 54 capital sentences in just two years. But the  death verdicts upheld by the state court are being challenged further in what  officials expect will be a wave of constitutional appeals in the federal  courts.  </P> <P> Deukmejian and other witnesses cited as an example of their concern the case of  Robert Alton Harris, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the murders  of two youths in San Diego in 1978. His is the furthest along of any California  capital case now in the federal court system and has been before federal judges  since 1982.  </P> <P> Harris' conviction and sentence were upheld in separate appeals by the state  Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court and, last July, by the U.S. 9th Circuit  Court of Appeals. But his subsequent petition for a rehearing before the  federal appellate court is pending -- nearly a full year later.  </P> <P> The governor urged the panelists to seek reforms in the process that would  impose new time limits on federal habeas corpus appeals and require federal  judges to defer to the factual findings made by state courts.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. George M. Palmer told the panel there  could be substantial additional delays when capital cases that have been in the  state courts for years begin to flow into the federal courts. "When the bulk of  the California cases hits the federal system, the road to final judgments will  be long indeed," he said.  </P> <P> To date, six habeas corpus petitions from condemned California inmates have  been filed in federal courts. But the number is expected to increase  considerably in coming months and a special committee of judges, lawyers and  officials has been at work preparing new procedures to deal with the influx.  </P> <P> In an apparent rebuke to Deukmejian, San Francisco attorney Dennis P. Riordan,  representing California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, a group of defense  lawyers, said that appeals to the federal courts would present little problem  if state court judges would act to protect the rights of capital defendants.  </P> <P> Riordan noted that unlike federal judges, state judges do not enjoy lifetime  tenure and warned that thus they are far more subject to election  considerations and other political pressures that could influence their rulings  in capital cases.  </P> <P> Alluding to the bitter 1986 California election that saw three high court  members rejected by the voters, largely because of their reluctance to affirm  death judgments, Riordan said:  </P> <P> "A state judge who rules in favor of any capital defendant on any issue can be  assured his ruling, no matter how clearly dictated by controlling  constitutional precedent, will be publicly attacked by an opportunistic  politician too dense to understand our system of constitutional rights or too  cynical to care about its preservation."  </P> <P> Riordan observed that in the seven years after the U.S. Supreme Court  reinstated capital punishment in 1976, federal appeal courts, reviewing cases  mainly from the South, found constitutional violations in 73% of the state  court death rulings they reviewed.  </P> <P> Now, as more cases from the Western states are taken to federal courts, there  is no less reason for careful review of death verdicts, he said.  </P></p>

He even had time to speak about his heart.    Argentine President Carlos Menem today gave President  Gaviria  a strong endorsement in his bid for the post of OAS secretary  general. Menam also announced both presidents will seek the  support of other countries.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Do you think the  role President Gaviria will play at the OAS, if elected  secretary general, will be a good one?    [Menem] He would be a good secretary general for many  reasons. The OAS, under the leadership of President Gaviria, if  he is indeed elected, can improve its work and performance. [end  recording]    Carlos Menem went on to talk about more than the OAS. The  Argentine president, who has generated many controversies over  family scandals in his country, confirmed not only that his  heart is good, but also that it is still beating.    [Begin recording] [Menem] Thank God, my heart is doing very  well.    [Reporter] Are you in love or not?    [Menem] I thought you were asking about the clinical and  medical condition of my heart.    [Reporter] I am asking about both.    [Menem] Well, my heart is doing fine in both senses. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

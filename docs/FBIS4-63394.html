			<p>BFN     [Text] President Boris Yeltsin has no reason to distrust or  punish his Interior Minister Viktor Yerin, presidential  spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said in a statement issued in  Moscow on Friday. This follows a proposal from a number of  parliamentary factions that the minister be dismissed following  the recent assassination of Russian deputy Andrey Aizderdzis.    The president has examined materials related to the case and  thinks the ministry's actions to be prompt and impeccable, the  statement says. It also quotes Yeltsin as saying there has been  certain progress in the ministry's campaign against crime and  corruption.    The spokesman said the question of Yerin's dismissal was not  on the agenda.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / SEC rules on access to executive pay data THE US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday voted for a package of reforms aimed at boosting shareholder democracy and placing curbs on the expanding pay packages of some company executives. The new rules will require companies to provide clear and understandable comparisons of their top executives' pay packages, including bonuses and share or option rights, as well as of their own stock price performance. Mr Richard Breeden, SEC chairman, said this would allow shareholders to decide on fair pay for their executives, rather than have the government set rigid rules. 'Armed with information, and empowered to act on that information, market forces should hopefully restore a better sense of balance to America's board rooms,' Mr Breeden said. At the same time, the SEC voted to remove some of the restrictions now imposed on shareholders who want to meet or write to their fellow shareholders. This change is expected to make it easier for dissidents to challenge a company's board of directors on policy issues or to stand for election themselves. At present, shareholders have to notify the SEC if they meet more than ten other shareholders, and have to obtain commission approval in advance of any written material they might circulate. This year, the SEC responded to a wave of anger about bloated pay for executives - critics were charging that this continued to rise even though their companies' performance had plunged - by ruling that the subject was a 'significant policy issue'. This meant that companies would no longer be allowed routinely to exclude shareholder motions on pay from the list of resolutions put to annual meetings.</p>

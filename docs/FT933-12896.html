			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour leads Britain's local authority associations LABOUR leads all of Britain's local authority associations, following the election of a Labour chairman by the Association of District Councils, John Authers writes. The ADC, which had been chaired by Conservatives continuously since it was formed in 1974, elected Ms Margaret Singh, a Labour councillor from Reading, Berkshire, at its biennial meeting yesterday. But Labour does not have overall control of the ADC, and the previous Tory chairman, Lady Elizabeth Anson, is now deputy chairman. Labour has 58 seats on the ADC's council, with 55 for the Conservatives, 17 Liberal Democrats and 11 Independents.</p>

In the brigadier's opinion, "petroleum is a strategic  element, and therefore it is necessary to remain alert to the  international interests that want to conquer the Brazilian  petroleum reserves." According to the ESG commander, "society  must not accept that Brazil be treated like a marginal country."    Ferolla advocated state control on petroleum exploration  during a Science Forum discussion and during a meeting with  federal university directors, both of which were held at the Rio  de Janeiro Federal University (UFRJ). In his assessment,  society has not discussed this issue at length, and it would be  too early to implement such an important change. Ferolla  claimed: "If the Constituent Congress decides to break the  petroleum monopoly, it will be an untimely decision." In the  ESG commander's opinion, "serious issues like those of  monopolies should be decided with more coldbloodedness and less  emotion."    The brigadier said it was necessary for society to be more  conscious to discussion of the great national issues. He asked  this "especially from young people, who will be carrying out the  development of our country." Ferolla believes Brazil lacks a  development model that takes into account the great differences  existing between its regions.    Ferolla noted: "We require strategic planning. This is not  a job for the military but for the whole of society, because the  enemy is advancing. All it takes is to notice that our country  is breaking apart." In the ESG commander's opinion, this  planning must not take into account the desires of the  multinational companies "that are viewing the commercial side  alone." He explained that this does not involve opposing the  multinational companies. Ferolla concluded: "They may and must  gain their money, but they must not meddle with our country's  sovereignty."</p>

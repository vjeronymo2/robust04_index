			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Arts: King Priam - Grand Theatre, Leeds All credit to Opera North for making Tippett's opera available again, in only the third British staging since he completed it in 1962: since the inspired Hytner/Norrington production went down with the much-lamented Kent Opera, King Priam has looked like enduring a long exile. If 'inspired' is hardly the word for Tom Cairns' Opera North version, it is at least worthy, serious and effective enough to capture much of the weight of Tippett's noble work. New audiences will be impressed, as Friday's audience plainly was. Those who have memories of the Kent production - which cannot but be vivid - needn't rush (to Leeds this week, or Manchester, Hull or Nottingham on the subsequent Thursdays); but those performances will undoubtedly acquire greater force of conviction as they go along. The basic lines of the opera are already well in place. The principals, mostly youngish, are evenly matched, led by Andrew Shore's strong, intelligent Priam: not an epical patriarch, but a tough head-of-the-family (and Tippett has described the opera as 'essentially an 'opera of the family''). The conductor, Paul Daniel, has prepared the score in precise detail, as Tippett's frieze-like construction requires, and its sense is projected sharply. In the hands of Michael Cleaver and Kenneth Heggie, the vital piano and guitar parts have flair and bite. On Friday the dramatic pacing had less than its full grip yet: in particular, the rich third act - anger and despair among the Trojan ladies, Priam's abject visit to Achilles and his withdrawal from life - meandered ruminatively, where we should feel an inexorable progress to the catastrophe. In that act, both Eiddwen Harrhy's Hecuba and Linda McLeod's Andromache (too similar on stage, though that was hardly their fault) were excellent in distress, set in ripe contrast against Patricia Bardon's languid, glamorous Helen. In their scene, as elsewhere, the producer has done too little to animate the characters fully. There is a lot of unhurried strolling to stand-and-deliver and then stroll off - not enhanced by sudden little bursts of melodramatic arm-waving. The few places in which a bit more is attempted (a decorative hunting-tableau, a violent tussle between Hector and Paris, Priam's spiritual agonising) only throw the physical limpness of the rest into stark relief. In any case, the various track-suits in which the men are generally garbed are inimical to any sense of wartime pressure and individual heroic airs. In battle they pick up some blood and dust, and shorter haircuts, but it is rather too late. (Opera chaps are as weedy as the rest of us, and need more help to make a brave show.) The male chorus appear, thriftily, in modern suits; all the women are luckier with their vaguely antique dress. In fact Cairns's own designs are content to make detached, aesthetic pictures. He likes tall walls and curtains that part to reveal new vertical planes behind them (and in Act 1, part of a gigantic Greek vase lying on its side). At the end, Priam's chamber might be a whitewashed Cretan barn, ready for conversion by some owner abroad. Hermes, brightly and engagingly sung by Mark Curtis, has wild hair, winged heels and a sporty yellow mac: a designer's little joke. Brian Cookson makes a properly sturdy Hector, Christopher Ventris a pleasant, slightly gormless Paris (his younger self is portrayed with a will by young Thomas Jackson). Neill Archer's fine, thoughtful Achilles delivers his homeland-song beautifully, and there is a breath of sober tragedy in his meeting with Priam. Unfortunately, the electro-acoustic arrangements were inadequate to his great war-cry, which should freeze the blood but didn't; nor were they altogether happy for the choral opening and close. George Mosley's eager, manly poise was notably well-found for Patroclus. The important 'Chorus'-trio - Nurse, Old Man and Young Guard - is rightly cast from strength. Tamsin Dives was as eloquent as the royal Trojan ladies; Tom McDonnell, if not as Old as he might be, had the tones of authority, and Gordon Wilson's Guard was alert and communicative. Their measured commentary was a vital strand in the action. There is a good trio of huntsmen, too. In short, this was a creditable performance which may have the makings of a really exciting one; musically, it is nearly that already, and only needs everybody to seize the bit firmly between the teeth.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Foreign public circles  denounce the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and express  support and solidarity for the Korean people's struggle of  justice.    The chairman of the Central Committee of the National Union  of Democratic Youth of Nepal in his speech at a mass rally in  Katmandu on April 8 condemned the U.S. hostile policy toward the  DPRK.    The ralliers adopted a letter of protest to U.S. President  Bill Clinton and marched toward the U.S. Embassy shouting  slogans with the placards "U.S. Imperialists, Promptly Stop  Campaign Against North Korea Over Nuclear Issue" and "U.S.  Imperialists, Quit Korean Peninsula." They handed the letter  signed by 100 political and public figures to the U.S. Embassy.  The letter demanded that the United States pull all its troops  and nuclear weapons out of South Korea and give up the projected  "sanctions" against the DPRK.    At a solidarity meeting held in Cuba earlier, the U.S.  campaign against the DPRK was denounced and support and  solidarity were expressed for the Korean people's just struggle.    A letter to the Korean people was adopted at the meeting.    The French Institute for the Development of International  Relations in a communique April 6 expressed full support and  solidarity for the Korean people's just stand toward the  situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula.    Pierre Welo Ahondju Ewale, chairman of the Zaire-Korea  Friendship Association, in a statement April 5 stressed that the  United States must sincerely approach the unshakable attitude of  the DPRK Government to find a peaceful, negotiated solution to  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.</p>

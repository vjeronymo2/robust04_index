Paek Nak-wan, director-general for European Affairs, met  with  Georgiy Toloraya, minister at the Russian Embassy in Seoul, and  explained South Korea's interest in the matter and requested  Moscow to disclose the scope of the sale.    Latest press reports quoted a senior official at the Russian  Pacific Fleet Command as saying Russia signed a contract to sell  North Korea 10 Golf II class submarines not long after it  exported four Fox-Trot class submarines to the communist country.    The Golf II submarines are similar to the Fox-Trot types in  size, but excel them in speed and cruising range and can carry  three SS-N-5 ballistic missiles.    Reports said that the sales were under condition that North  Korea use the vessels for scrap.    "If these reports turn out all true, I hope that the vessels  will indeed be used for scrap only," said Paek, "but we express  concern that North Korea might try to use the submarines for  other purposes."</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Management: Pizza to stay - with extra tenacity - A bankrupt company is every manager's nightmare. How one man survived If Stateside Foods ever becomes grand enough to merit a coat of arms, Roy Goodall has his Latin motto ready - nunc etiam adsumus, meaning 'we are still here.' The English version has been his standard phrase to customers inquiring after Stateside's corporate health during the past 18 months. It lost Pounds 1.65m during 1990 and 1991, scraped through to break even last year, but is forecasting Pounds 526,000 profits for 1993 on projected sales of Pounds 5.5m. The company makes chilled pizzas for half a dozen supermarket chains at its factory in Haslingden, Lancashire. Checks on its health followed lay-offs, a withdrawal of overdraft facilities by its bank and a whispering campaign by some competitors in the UK pizza makers' war for supermarket shelf space. In the jargon of corporate finance, the company is a bimbo - a buy-in-management-buyout. In September 1991, Goodall bought into a management-buyout gone wrong. It needed his expertise as a former big-company general manager and, before that, a marketing man. The company had been bought by its management two years before, but inadequate controls had seen rapid sales growth offset by deepening trading losses. Goodall's career had plateaued with middle age. He and his wife decided to do something on their own and opted for Stateside. But, as Goodall told a CBI-Grant Thornton north-west regional conference last month, a nightmare was about to begin. After three months, he upgraded the quality of its advisers from the 'man and a dog' level his predecessors had been content with and discovered that the balance sheet had a Pounds 500,000 hole in it. Over-optimism had led to mis-statements of creditors, debtors, stocks and assets which the previous auditors had ticked, rather than challenged. The accounts had looked satisfactory at the time of the buy-in, but it needed some hands-on experience of Goodall's type to make the realistic assumptions that would pierce the facade. As the reality sank in, he realised he was in up to his neck in a bankrupt company. In the days between Christmas and New Year, he told his bank. The business was originally founded in the Midlands and the bank was 170 miles away. He and the manager hardly knew each other. Facilities were immediately withdrawn. 'I certainly don't blame them,' he says. 'I would have done the same.' An interview followed with an insolvency practitioner which made Goodall feel much better. He was told he was legally obliged to act in the best interests of Stateside's creditors. Here was a dilemma. Closed down, Stateside's assets would not fetch enough to pay everyone off, but the company was by then trading in profit on a day-to-day basis and he believed its sales forecast was healthy and realistic, with a firm contractual base. The creditors' best chance of getting their money was for Stateside to carry on trading - without incurring more debt, as this would have been illegal. The main creditors took the point and converted what they were owed into medium-term loans, bolstering the balance sheet and taking pressure off cash flow. Sales were factored, so that 80 per cent of revenue was immediately guaranteed each week and supplies could be bought on a pay-as-you-go basis. 'If you want to see just-in-time practised as an art form, we are it,' Goodall says. The payroll had already been slimmed from 80 to 34. He told everyone what was going on, asked for commitment and co-operation - and Stateside gingerly started trading its way out of the nightmare. Confidence grew with sales, and Stateside made an important capital purchase  -a second-hand burglar alarm, bought for cash, after a spate of pizza robberies. Next came a Tannoy and music system to bolster morale on the production line. By this time last year, suppliers and - encouragingly - would-be suppliers resumed talking about credit. Sales grew and Stateside achieved a Pounds 200,000 trading profit last year, although this was reduced to break-even, pre-tax, by finance charges. The company now looks like surviving. Two prospective buyers have already been turned down. Sales, production and profits are rising weekly. Goodall is confident enough to talk about his experience and pass on what he hopes are the lessons. The 60 company owners and their advisers at the conference - on why some companies break through to big growth while others do not - listened spellbound. Tenacity, commitment and realism were some of his messages. Others concerned simplicity of vision, hard work, consistent quality of product and making the best use of people. 'The majority of venture capitalists and bankers only look at the balance sheet and past performance,' he said. 'The emphasis is on the past, which usually undervalues the business and most certainly undervalues the people. Surely, sustainable profits and earnings per share are what really count.' He stressed the need for good professional advice, even though this might cost more. Cheap audits cannot be worthwhile if they merely comply with legal requirements and do not reveal the company is heading towards bankruptcy. Advisers should add value, offering constructive criticism to ensure accounts reflect reality.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (19): A variety of skills needed - A look at how to stage a buy-out MOST buy-outs have one thing in common. They are carried out by management teams who have never done it before. This makes negotiating a buy-out a particularly stressful experience for the managers involved. Executives, often from small corporate divisions or subsidiaries and without a financial background, find themselves dealing with venture capitalists, bankers and other financial specialists for the first time. However, a wealth of specialist advice can be called upon from accountants, lawyers and the venture capitalists themselves. The buy-out is now much better understood as a means of restructuring business than it was a few years ago and wide range of literature is available. The first step is to put together a management team. Financial backers expect to see a well-balanced group of managers headed, preferably, by some with managing director experience. It will probably also have to include people with financial, marketing and production skills. The financiers will be looking to back people with senior experience but who have also not lost touch with the realities of doing business. Running your own small company is very different from managing part of a large organisation with extensive support systems in place. Keep the buy-out team to a manageable size. Most involve three or four people. This is enough to provide a spread of skills while reducing the risk of disagreements. It is also important at an early stage to find out whether your business might be available to buy. Some large companies refuse outright to allow buy-outs on the grounds that if there is untapped potential in the business it should be exploited within the corporate structure. However, the depths of the present recession have meant that far more corporations are being forced to consider the sale of non-core or under-performing parts of the business. Managers are still advised to tread warily when approaching head office about a buy-out in case an unwelcome approach damages their career prospects. It may make sense to use an accountant or another business advisor to make an anonymous approach in the first instance. If it is for sale, will your proposed buy-out be able to attract finance? Venture capitalists and other financial backers prefer to support mature businesses in low technology areas with strong positive cash flows. The bankers in particular want to be sure that cash flows will amply cover interest charges and will not be keen to support businesses with uncertain prospects. Advisers should be chosen for their experience in the buy-out field and for their ability to get on at a personal level with the management. You will soon know if the size of the deal contemplated is suited to the financial backer. The adviser will be able to help management over what is often the most daunting obstacle - negotiating with the boss. Many managers find it difficult to adopt a dispassionate negotiating stance. The professional adviser can take the heat out of the negotiations and is also freer to point out any the weaknesses of the business. The advisers will also be able to help with the preparation of a business plan though it must remain demonstrably the work of the management team. It should explain the background to the buy-out and describe the managers' experience, the products, the market and the strategy for future development. Summaries of past and projected profits, balance sheets and cash flows should be included. The plan should start with a short summary of the main points. Unless this grabs the venture capitalist's attention he is unlikely to go on and read the rest of the plan. Avoid unduly elaborate plans. Financial backers are rarely impressed with elaborate projections of the future which can be upset by any number of unforeseen circumstances. The financial commitment demanded of the managers may be small in terms of the overall cost of the deal - managers would typically be expected to put up between Pounds 25,000 and Pounds 50,000 each - but it is still likely to be a considerable sum in relation to the individual's financial resources. In return, the managers will obtain a stake in the ordinary equity which far exceeds their relative financial contribution. Backers are happy to go along with this because they believe the managers will be highly motivated to do well. Some buy-outs involve 'ratchets' - agreements whereby the managers increase their shareholding if they meet certain targets. Ratchets have fallen out of favour recently because they are seen as further complicating the deal and encouraging a short-term approach on the part of the management. What happens if the buy-out does not go ahead? Professional fees may already have mounted up. It is common practice to reach an agreement with the vendor for him to meet these costs. If this is impossible the leading financial backer will normally agree to pay. Even as they are negotiating their independence, managers need to give some thought to what will happen in three to five years time when their financial backer may be thinking of an 'exit'. Financiers normally expect to sell or float the business so as to realise their capital gain. The route chosen will depend on how well the business does, on stock market sentiment and on whether a potential buyer is looking for acquisitions at the time. The buy-out period is an exhausting time because management has to run the business while conducting negotiations. Once the deal is struck managers can concentrate on the business. They are then likely to find that running a completely independent company without head office to rely on for support requires a new set of management skills.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LARGER MANAGEMENT BUY-OUTS 1988/1992 (TOTAL FUNDING POUNDS M)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- POUNDS M  1988                          1989 10-25  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Kirklees Chemicals (10)       Busways (10)           Radstone Tech (10)            Citytab (10)           Celebrity CP (10)             Rosenthal (10)           National Express (10)         Fine Art Wallcoverings (10)           Lowfield (11)                 * Range Valley (11)           Burlington INT (12)           * Abacus (11)           Motor World (13)              Seckers Silks (11)           * Burn Stewart (13)           Coin Industries (11)           AMG Inds (13)                 * Maison Caurette           Harrap Publishing (13)        Lancashire Enterprises (11)           * Autoclenz (13)              * Haigh Castle (12)           * Clairmont (14)              Golden West Foods (13)           Grand Transport Systems (14)  * Severn (13)           Lowndes Lambert (16)          Tallent Eng (13)           Grampian CF (18)              Horlicks Farms &amp; Dairies (13)           Peerless (18)                 * Valor Stoves (14)           Maccess II (18)               * Country Casuals (14)           ABI Caravans (20)             Country Holidays (14)           John Perring (21)             BREL (14)           Welland Homes (21)            Eurovein (14)           Travellers Fare (21)          * Hill Leigh (15)           * European Brands (21)        May Gurney (15)           Meteor (22)                   * British Air Ferries (15)           Yorkshire Rider (23)          * Exide Batteries (16)                                         Wilcomatic (17)                                         Geest CD (17)                                         Godiva (17)                                         * Britannia Data Mgt (18)                                         Barbour Campbell (19)                                         Mercado (20)                                         Solicitors' Law Stationery                                         Soc (20)                                         * Service Tec (20)                                         Harland &amp; Wolff (21)                                         Slade (21)                                         * Themes Int (22)                                         * Rubatex (22)                                         * Hamleys (24)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- POUNDS M  1990                          1991 10-25  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Mercury SDS (10)              * Ambion Homes (10)           Viscount Catering (10)        Davenhame (10)           Peter Cox (10)                Pleasureworld (10)           * Wilcox (10)                 * Bianco (11)           Chemical Manuf &amp; Refin (10)   * Boythorpe (11)           Morris Homes (10)             Arncliffe Homes (11)           Saith (10)                    Samuel Banner (11)           * Fairmead (10)               Games Workshop (11)           * Anglian Fast Food (10)      * Wallace Int (12)           SMT Omnibuses (10)            Carpetland (12)           Lambert Smith Hampton (12)    * Drawlane (12)           Nyge CSE Aviation (10)        Gibson International (12)           * East Lancs Paper Mill (11)  Lodge Care (13)           Eaton Williams (11)           Power Group International (13)           * Juliana Sound Services (11) Bramail Dealerships (15)           Fogarty (12)                  * Sitex Security Prods (15)           Licensed Clothing (12)        Systems Reliability (16)           Camb.

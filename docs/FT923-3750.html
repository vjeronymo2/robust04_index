			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: Carnaud Metalbox ahead at interim stage CARNAUDMETALBOX, the Franco-British packaging group, yesterday continued to report steady progress as it registered a 16 per cent improvement in interim net earnings to FFr549m.( Dollars 115m). Sales rose by just 1 per cent to FFr12.6bn in the half-year to June 30 in the face of tough trading conditions but profits improved at a faster rate due to improved operating efficiencies and cost reductions, the company said. CarnaudMetalbox, formerly known as CMB Packaging, was formed three years ago through the merger of the packaging interests of Metal Box of the UK and the French Carnaud. It forms Europe's biggest packaging concern with about 85 per cent of its sales of plastic and metal packaging materials in Europe. Operating profits were 8 per cent higher at FFr1.2bn as productivity improved and the profits margin widened from 9.1 per cent to 9.8 per cent. Net profits were flattered by a net reduction in exceptional restructuring charges. Mr Jurgen Hintz, the American chief executive who was brought in a year ago to ease the frictions that had accompanied the birth of the merged company, said customers were 'responding to the group's improved quality, service and marketing performance'. The company said packaging markets remained generally weak but expected its results to maintain their progress over the full year. Capital expenditure was a shade lower at FFr713m and the number of employees was cut by 6 per cent to 30,740 during the half year. Net debt fell 15 per cent to FFr5bn. Sales would have been 3 per cent higher had comparable exchange rates and company structure applied during both periods, the company added. Earnings per share rose to FFr6.8 from FFr5.9</p>

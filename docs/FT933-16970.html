			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Shake-up urged for civil justice A RADICAL shake-up in the civil justice system to cut costs, reduce delays and provide more user-friendly justice was called for yesterday by the Bar and the Law Society. Ms Hilary Heilbron QC, who chaired a joint working party of barristers and solicitors, said civil justice was available only to the very rich or the very poor. Even for those who could afford to litigate, costs had escalated, delays had increased and trials had become more complex and took longer, she said. The working party calls for a re-organisation of the High Court. The Queen's Bench Division and Chancery Division should be merged into one Civil Division presided over by the lord chief justice - the Family Division remaining a separate entity. A number of specialist courts or case lists should be created. These would include the commercial court, a company and insolvency list, a jury list, a judicial review list, a patent court and a revenue list. Judges would be allocated to these specialised case lists according to their expertise. The report calls for courts to exercise greater control over litigation. Once proceedings have been started the court should remind parties to litigate quickly or risk having the action struck out. Judges are urged to take a more interventionist approach in cases to ensure parties focus on the relevant issues. More emphasis should be placed on alternatives to litigation, particularly mediation. The report has been sent to the lord chancellor for consideration. Ms Heilbron said most of the recommendations could be implemented without the need for primary legislation.</p>

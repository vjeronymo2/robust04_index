			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Another warning from Betterware Betterware, the direct selling group, lost more than a third of its market value yesterday as it issued its third profits warning in five months. The company's shares fell by 23p to 50p, having plummeted over the last 14 months from a peak of 278p. Analysts pulled back full-year forecasts from Pounds 11m to about Pounds 9m. Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said first half operating profits were not expected to be more than Pounds 4m, compared with Pounds 7m last year. The decline was blamed on difficulties recruiting people to distribute catalogues in the UK, stock delivery problems arising from the move to a new distribution centre, and increased investment in international expansion. Betterware has committed to provide up to Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.2m) over time in a joint venture, also announced yesterday, with Avon, the world's largest direct seller of beauty products, to sell household products in North and South America. Mr Cohen said the cash-rich Betterware was not in any serious difficulty, in spite of the market's reaction. 'We have an exemplary record on past performance, we make full disclosure, comply with Cadbury. We have never failed to do something we said we would do. The one thing we have failed to do is meet analysts' expectations,' he said. The group issued a caution on trading in May with its annual results and again in July.</p>

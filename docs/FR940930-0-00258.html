			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to be eligible for the pre-foreclosure sale procedure, a mortgagor must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) be an owner-occupant in a single family residence that is security for a mortgage insured under 24 CFR part 203, unless otherwise prescribed by the Secretary;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) have an account in default with at least three monthly installments past due and unpaid; (The default must be the result of a documentable involuntary reduction in income or an unavoidable increase in his or her expenses, including job relocation.);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) have been made aware of the assignment program, as discussed below under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notification of PFS Procedure <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and have been either turned down for it by HUD, or have decided not to apply for it;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) have, at the time application is made to pursue a pre-foreclosure sale, a mortgaged property whose current fair market value, compared to the amount needed to discharge the mortgage, meets the criterion established by the Secretary, unless a variance is granted by the Secretary; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) have received homeownership counseling, as defined by the Secretary, and have executed a certification to that effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These criteria are contained in new section 24 CFR 203.370(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has decided to continue a policy begun during the PFS Demonstration, under which those mortgagors who are small investors with only one FHA-insured mortgage (e.g., a former owner-occupant who may be renting out the property) can be considered for PFS eligibility. Under no circumstances, however, will the pre-foreclosure sale option be made available to ``walkaways'' who have abandoned their mortgage obligations despite their continued ability to pay. Mortgagors determined to be eligible for, and who participate in, the pre-foreclosure sale procedure will  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> be pursued for deficiency judgments by the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Use of Mortgagees To Facilitate Pre-foreclosure Sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is adding the pre-foreclosure sale to the list of existing foreclosure alternatives that can be offered by mortgagees to mortgagors facing financial difficulties and who meet certain qualifying criteria. Although offering the pre-foreclosure sale option to a qualified mortgagor is arguably a part of ``normal'' servicing under FHA procedures and guidelines which require mortgagees to act prudently and with HUD's interests in mind, the Department is encouraging mortgagees to incorporate pre-foreclosure sales without delay into their overall servicing procedures by paying mortgagees an administrative fee for each successful pre-foreclosure sale that they facilitate. Payment of the administrative fee via the claims process is provided for in 24 CFR 203.402(t), which is being implemented as part of this interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Justification of Incentive Paid to Mortgagors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has decided to retain the practice used during the Demonstration of paying certain cash incentives drawn from sale proceeds to qualified mortgagors who close a pre-foreclosure sale; however, the amount of this incentive is being reduced from that which was used in the Demonstration. Also, in cases where a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure follows bona fide but unsuccessful participation in the PFS procedure, the Department's policy of strongly encouraging mortgagees to offer such mortgagors the full $500 consideration payable for a deed-in-lieu (authorized in HUD Mortgagee Letter 93&hyph;16) is being continued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is aware that other mortgage insurers and financial institutions have not authorized the use of a portion of sale proceeds for consideration payable to the mortgagor, and do not otherwise reward mortgagors who engage in a pre-foreclosure sale or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, beyond the fact that PFS necessarily precludes the foreclosure. However, the proportion of pre-foreclosure sales occurring in these other agencies and institutions among defaulting mortgagors is generally much lower than the level of participation which HUD would prefer for its nationwide pre-foreclosure sale procedure. Furthermore, although the Department acknowledges that the avoidance of a foreclosure on their credit records is a prime motivation for mortgagors to dispose of their properties via pre-foreclosure sales, HUD has a number of other justifications for offering monetary consideration to participants in the PFS procedure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "On the Level" column by Alex Magno: "Descent to </F> Madness"]    [Text] The far Left has managed to remain in the news by  virtue, principally, of the scandalousness that has  characterized the factional fighting afflicting its tattered  ranks.    That scandalousness has gained in shrillness lately. As a  consequence, the far Left managed to remain in the news --  helped along by the sheer uneventfulness of newfound  predictability in the political mainstream.    A former NPA [New People's Army] commander, identified with  the "rejectionist" camp was murdered in Antipolo a few months  ago. The assailants never bothered to claim responsibility.  Pro-Sison partisans are believed culpable by the victim's  colleagues.    Early this month, Leopoldo Mabilangan was assassinated in  front of a church. After four discomfiting days of hesitation,  the Melito Glor Command -- led by a fanatical follower of  self-exiled Jose Ma. Sison [Joma] -- took responsibility for the  crime.    The Utrecht-based troika of Jose Ma. Sison, Luis Jalandoni,  and Antonio Zumel first attempted to deny their faction's  involvement. When the Southern Tagalog NPA commander, Gregorio  "Ka [Comrade] Roger" Rosal, admitted to the crime, the Utrecht  troika quickly reversed itself and supported their last  guerrilla loyalist to the hilt.    Encouraged by the support from his self-exiled bosses, Rosal  announced he would proceed with his "people's court" proceedings  against senior leftist personalities associated with the  anti-Sison factions. Sison had called for the trial of his  rivals last year.    At that point, the international "debate" within the CPP  [Communist Party of the Philippines] descended into new depths  of madness.    Former CPP personalities now operating in the open dared  Sison and his loyal serf Rosal to go ahead and shoot them. The  scene was both tragic and comic. Those who once observed with  awe the seriousness and heroism with which the Left activists  went about their self-styled political mission could not believe  what they were seeing and hearing.    From the outside, it would seem that the contending factions  in the CPP have fielded death squads against each other. What  is left of the Left appears ready to go down in an orgy of  mutual liquidation.    Carlos Forte, head of the CPP Manila-Rizal Regional  Committee, warned Sison that, should the "people's court"  venture proceed, the self-exiled leader's own safety would only  be "a phone call away." The counter-threat was hardly veiled.    The counter-threat threw Sison into one of his increasingly  frequent hysterical moods. The man who ordered, from the  relative safety of distant self-exile, that "people's courts" be  set up against his erstwhile comrades was last heard throwing a  tantrum over the possibility that he may not be so safe after  all.    By irresponsibly leveling the wildest charges against his  erstwhile comrades, Sison burned the bridges of reconciliation  among the contending factions of a confused movement. By  threatening his erstwhile comrades with liquidation (after some  gesture of a "trial" by a kangaroo court), Sison made them  vulnerable to violent tricks played by third parties.    Confronted now by the possibility that his erstwhile  comrades  could balance the terror, Sison flew completely off the handle,  conjuring a "plot" participated in jointly by his own comrades  and by the military.    Loosening the rein on his deep-seated paranoia, Sison  declares that a hit squad was now in Europe to get him. The  squad, he says, is led by a certain "Narding." It is, he says,  funded by the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the  Philippines to the tune of P500,000 [Philippine pesos].    The pathetic exile is obviously picking his facts from thin  air. His paranoia is laced with a generous dose of megalomania:  he thinks he is important enough for so many people to bother  having him killed.    If Sison were not so far detached as he is, he might have  noticed his own irrelevance. Were it not for the comic relief  that he brings to our front pages, he would have been ignored.  He has single-handedly degraded the political debate in the  Left to the level of the burlesque, laden with cheap intrigue  and bizarre accusation. Having squandered the credibility of  the movement he pretends to lead, Sison now widens the  possibility for fraternal bloodshed.    The man is beyond help. The real wonder is the handful of  fanatical loyalists who continue to take him seriously.    It is not the many goblins in Sison's mind that is the more  substantial question. There is no political solution to that  problem.    The real challenge confronting those in the Left still in  possession of their sanity is how to retrieve what remains of  the movement from the abyss of madness into which it has fallen.  There is nothing to gain from joining Joma in the game of  mutually assured destruction. There is nothing to gain from  this silly exchange of threat and counter-threat.    There is much to save in the political Left: its example of  selflessness, its faith in the possibility of a more humane  future, its exemplary patriotism. That could be saved by the  recovery of sobriety, reasonableness, and sympathy for the best  in others -- virtues that used to be in abundance in this  community of militants and activists.    If the Left's retrieval of sanity is not accomplished soon,  this entire community will be condemned not to the dustbin, but  to the asylum of history.</p>

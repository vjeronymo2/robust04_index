			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on 2 June 1994 interview by AFP correspondent </F> (Avreck) with Pham Van Dong, adviser of the Communist Party of  Vietnam Central Committee; place not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] [Correspondent] How does your excellency view the  current renovation process? In your excellency's view, are  there any obstacles that may cause this process to stray off  course? If so, what are they?    [Pham Van Dong] In the current renovation process in  Vietnam,  our nation is advancing on an uncharted path. In such an  advance, our nation will certainly face many obstacles in  various forms. With our clear-sightedness and vigilance, we are  trying to exploit all our potential to prevent, overcome, and  remove all obstacles in order to achieve our goals.    [Correspondent] What were the reasons that led to the  decision by Vietnamese leaders in 1986 to embark on such a  renovation? Did your excellency take part in that decision? In  your capacity as adviser to the party Central Committee, will  your excellency continue to participate in the drafting of the  renovation policy?    [Pham Van Dong] In the years immediately after our national  reunification, we thought we could advance directly to  socialism. Now we realize that this was a mistake caused by our  willful, subjective, and leftist thinking, one that is usually  made by revolutionaries. It is imperative to find a new path, a  path that can be used only as a transition in conformity with  the pattern of history. This is precisely the goal our people  have pursued over the past 15 years as it is suitable to our  country's geographical, political, economic, and social  characteristics. These developments led to the Sixth Congress  of the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1986 -- a congress of  renovation, clear-sightedness and revolutionary bravery, and  culture.    Life has attested even more clearly to the diversified  potential of the renovation movement. We have done our utmost  to discover and develop these potential through our actual work  and our theoretical studies. A large movement of history is  always inbuilt with great cultural and humanistic values that  can only be fully developed with the wisdom and savvy of the  entire nation.    As provided for in my functions, I have been and will  continue to participate in the drafting of the renovation policy  and in the implementation of the renovation process.    [Correspondent] While shifting to the market economy, will  there be any danger of Vietnam renouncing its socialism? How do  you guarantee that the transition takes place without any  political and social upheaval? Does President Ho Chi Minh's  thought still have value for contemporary Vietnam?    [Pham Van Dong] Your very interesting question inspires my  answer. First, it should be recalled that the market economy,  one of the great achievements of humanity, has existed in  different social regimes. Since time immemorial before the  arrival of capitalism, there has been many stages in which the  market economy has developed magnificently. It is not our  policy to develop just any market economy, but one in accordance  with the socialist orientation and the appropriate management of  a state governed by law. To us, it could only be a law-governed  state of the people, for the people, and by the people, and  imbued with the Vietnamese identity.    Such a market economy would be the future course for  achieving the goal of building a prosperous people, a powerful  country, and a equitable and civilized society. From there,  they will develop gradually and proportionately in a ever more  intensive and extensive fashion. The liberal and comprehensive  development of each person is the condition for the liberal and  comprehensive development of all people. Here we see one of the  main aspects of the integration between culture and renovation  in our country.    In this domain as well as in the entire renovation process,  Ho Chi Minh thought will be a source of inspiration and the  orientation for action for the entire nation. It should be  added that the core of Ho Chi Minh thought is to liberate the  nation, society, and humanity. It is also a driving force in  the evolution of history. Because of this Ho Chi Minh thought  has contemporary value and will always remain so.    [Correspondent] How does your excellency view Vietnam as  it is about embark on the 21st century? Can Vietnam become a  potential tiger [economy] of Asia? Can or should Vietnam join  the ASEAN community? Does your excellency have any observations  on Vietnam's current relations with France, China, and the  United States?    [Pham Van Dong] Our foreign friends have often talked about  the possibility of Vietnam becoming a tiger in Asia. There are  reasons for their saying so. For us, we are striving for an  ever-faster economic growth on a firm basis in parallel with  social justice, constantly improving the people's material and  cultural life, thus modestly contributing to peace, national  independence, democracy and social progress in the world.    As for Vietnam's ties with ASEAN countries, representatives  of our government have time and again clearly stated: China,  France, and the United States are countries that have friendly  ties with us. However, each country has its own particularities  that we are fully aware of its importance. We are trying our  best to develop fine relations with each of them in the interest  of each side as well as for the sake of peace and development in  the region and the world.    [Correspondent] With your abundant experience of many years  in the leadership role, what is your excellency's view about the  progress Vietnam has made over the past 20 years?    [Pham Van dong] As time goes by, people see their past more  clearly. On the other hand, in our era which is one of constant  and eventful changes, we must be equipped with a new vision so  that we can see this era more clearly. As in our national  situation, this vision is precisely the vision of culture.  Culture, in its broadest definition, means the most profound  aspiration and the finest achievements of human beings in the  history of mankind.    After the embryonic period and the initial stage of 20  years,  the renovation has meant overall progress for the country. It  is similar to a great cultural motivation with an inbuilt  inexhaustible source of human potential to be discovered and  developed. Here I would like to say a few words about the  Vietnamese people. They are people who have been steeled  through the countless ordeals of the country's history and  through their millennium-old heroic struggle. This has helped  the Vietnamese people find their own creative path of  development. The Vietnamese people have achieved constant  growth imbued with humanistic and nationalistic traits. The  renovation in Vietnam at present is a great undertaking of the  Vietnamese people and will constantly advance to new horizons.</p>

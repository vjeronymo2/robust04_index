			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM disagrees with the commenters' characterization of the rule language. The proposed rule language is clear in standing for the principle that a person is entitled to his or her challenge opportunity before an administrative or judicial tribunal. Nevertheless, a person is not entitled to the multiple relitigation of issues which he or she has already litigated to conclusion. Accordingly, the proposed rule is explicit in requiring that a person who is bound by a prior administrative or judicial determination with respect to the status of a violation may not relitigate such issue. In determining whether a person is bound by a prior determination, traditional principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel will apply. Contrary to commenters' view, however, it is insufficient to assume that such principles will apply as a matter of law and that there is no need to provide an explicit limitation in the regulation. Such a limitation is necessary to eliminate any ambiguity in the regulation with respect to this issue and to assure that judicial and administrative tribunals are not clogged with duplicative, repetitive claims by persons who have already litigated such claims. The limiting language provides a clear statement of OSM's intent and will be adopted as part of the final rule. Commenters representing environmental advocacy groups indicated approval of the provisions of the proposed regulation which would have limited challenges of the existence of the violation at the time it was cited. Such commenters did indicate concern, however, that the proposed regulation did not provide an explicit time limit for OSM to make its decision with respect to a challenge. They urged that the regulation incorporate an explicit time limit of 30 days for OSM to make a decision to avoid undue delay with respect to the permit application process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with the view that the regulation needs to contain an explicit time limit for the agency to make a decision with respect to challenges of ownership or control links or the status of violations. While OSM makes every effort to decide these issues in an expeditious manner, the review and determination of an ownership or control link can be a complex endeavor, requiring the review of significant amounts of complex documentary material. Such a process typically involves a dialogue involving the exchange of numerous documents and testimony between the agency and the challenger. Such issues may require extensive research and investigation by trained specialists. The imposition of artificial time limits on the process could create a risk that decisions will be inaccurate and that investigations will be incomplete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, there is no risk to the environment during the period of challenge. During the period of challenge, the permit is not issued. Once a presumption of ownership or control has been established pursuant to 30 CFR 773.5 and such presumption is shown on AVS, the burden is upon an applicant to rebut the presumption. The regulatory authority should not issue the permit until the presumption has been rebutted. While an expeditious process is encouraged, the regulatory authority should not be rushed in making such a decision. It should conduct a thorough investigation and review all of the relevant evidence presented. Some challenges can be resolved within 30 days. Other challenges may require six months. Imposing an absolute time limit disregards the differences that particular cases have with respect to factual and legal complexity. Accordingly, OSM must reject the commenters' suggestion that a time limit should be incorporated into the proposed regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter representing State regulatory authorities criticized the provisions of proposed &sect;773.24 which would require that challenges of ownership or control links shown on AVS be heard before OSM. In substance, the commenter was concerned that, for such challenges to be meaningfully addressed, OSM would need copies of supporting documentation from the States and challengers would be referred to the States to review various documents with respect to ownership or control relationships and with respect to violations. The commenter asserted that the States would have an ``unnecessary burden'' to provide duplicate copies of documents to OSM and other participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

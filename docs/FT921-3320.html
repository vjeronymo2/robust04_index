			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UN bid to end Azeri conflict with Armenia THE UNITED NATIONS is sending Mr Cyrus Vance to try to help end the bloody conflict over the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh in the former Soviet Union. Mr Vance's mission was announced yesterday as an ex-Soviet general warned that Armenians and Azerbaijanis were attacking towns in each other's republics in an apparent escalation of the dispute. Mr Vance, 74, a former US secretary of state, recently helped arrange a ceasefire between Serbs and Croats in Yugoslavia, opening the way for deployment of 10,000 UN peacekeepers. But he said his mission next week to the two ex-Soviet republics, including the embattled enclave, was simply to gather information, not to arrange for despatch of peacekeepers. The UN is already committed to a large-scale peace force for Cambodia, as well as Yugoslavia. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, disclosed Mr Vance's fact-finding mission in a telegram to Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak foreign minister. Mr Dienstbier, who is president of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), is also planning a peace mission to Nagorno-Karabakh, as international efforts mount to quell the dispute. Nagorno-Karabakh is a largely Armenian populated enclave within Moslem Azerbaijan. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, ethnic hatred has bred a violent struggle to control the mountainous region, leaving about 1,500 dead in the last four years. In the Russian parliament, Lt-Gen Boris Pyankov said fighting had gone beyond the borders of Nagorno-Karabakh, with incursions into the two republics. He said Armenian militants were storming into the region of Agdam, several kilometres inside Azerbaijan. At the same time Azeri forces were also pushing over the border of Armenia. Gen Pyankov is deputy head of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which both Armenia and Azerbaijan joined on the collapse of the Soviet Union. He claimed CIS army families were 'in effect' held hostage in the two republics, as 27 out of 67 CIS posts were still not evacuated because of attacks by militants. Earlier, Turkish Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel in Ankara quoted Azerbaijani leaders as saying the two sides had achieved a ceasefire. According to a military commander in Agdam, an Azerbaijani official had left Agdam for talks with Armenian authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh. But according to Reuters news agency, both Armenia and Azerbaijan reported fresh clashes, shattering a ceasefire less than 24 hours after it took effect. There was only sporadic artillery and automatic gunfire in Stepanakert, capital of Nagorno-Karabakh. But further east in the Agderi region of the enclave, Azerbaijan said Armenian gunmen killed 50 people in a big offensive. Azerbaijan's Turan news agency reported hundreds were wounded in the onslaught and seven villages had been seized. Armenian forces were massing again near Agdam, it added. Itar-Tass news agency reported from Armenia that Armenian guerrillas neutralised Azeri attacks on three villages in Agderi. Russia and Ukraine buried their differences on repaying the Soviet Union's foreign debt in a political breakthrough for the Commonwealth of Independent States yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. Commonwealth premiers reached a series of economic accords including one to take joint responsibility for the Dollars 60bn-Dollars 70bn Soviet debt - clearing the way for new western credits. Russian first deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar told reporters: 'I think it is the start of a movement towards towards common sense.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on a speech by Vice President Gonzalo </F> Aguirre to the Uruguayan Chamber of Industries' Directors  Council following his announcement that he will be a  presidential candidate in the 1994 election; place and date not  given]    [Excerpts] Vice President Gonzalo Aguirre was received  yesterday by the Uruguayan Chamber of Industries' Directors  Council. He made a long speech on the current conditions  affecting the manufacturing industry and on the basic measures  the next government must implement to shore up industrial  activities.    He began by saying that he generally believes in the  government's economic policies, including the opening of the  economy, Uruguayan participation in the regional integration  project, and the struggle against the fiscal deficit and  inflation. [passage omitted]    Aguirre said this concept could be applied to industrial  policies and industries in general because when you seek  prosperity and competitiveness it is not merely to protect  industrialists; it is to ensure the contribution of industry to  society and its capacity to create genuine jobs and general  well-being. [passage omitted]    Aguirre talked about the role of the state in society. He  said: "The state should not suffocate private companies with  regulations, bureaucratic requirements, state competition, and  inefficient monopolies. The private sector is the power behind  economic development."    He added: "The state should not, however, become a  spectator--leaving each individual free to do as he pleases--or  abandon individuals--even if their efforts are not in the  interests of society as a whole."    Aguirre said: "The state must decide on priorities,  establish  controls, orient, stimulate, and simultaneously discourage  certain activities through credits, tax exemptions, or foreign  exchange rates. These are just a few of the ways the state can  guide economic activities."    He dismissed the idea that Uruguayans are pessimistic,  reluctant to change habits and mental dispositions, or that the  small size of the country hinders growth.    Talking about the concerns of industry, "government  officials, and those of us who wish to govern the country for  the next five years," Gonzalo Aguirre said that the so-called  "unreal foreign exchange rate" and the loss of competitiveness  it causes despite the undeniable industrial increase in  productivity "are real factors." He added, however, that the  situation did not follow a deliberate government policy. On the  contrary, "had the Central Bank not intervened, the difference  would be much greater," Aguirre said. [passage omitted]    Aguirre said Central Bank policies on foreign exchange have  been contradictory because of the general decisions implemented  by this government. "If the market determines prices, the value  of the dollar--which is just one type of merchandise--should be  freely determined by the market. We should not intervene,  creating an artificial demand," said Aguirre referring to the  Central Bank purchase of dollars when the exchange rate falls  due to a lack of demand.    Aguirre said the solution is not to implement an abrupt  devaluation "on which there is general consensus, except for  some groups." Devaluation would temporarily bring the exchange  rate to more realistic levels but it would also affect the  prices of all products, Aguirre added.    Aguirre said: "The solution is not simple, but I would  support a proposal to let the dollar float freely. There would  be little risk that the foreign exchange rate will fall  drastically, given our market conditions. Besides, inflation  will also drop when the Central Bank stops issuing money to  intervene in the market (through monetary contention)."    The vice president admitted that to be competitive we must  reduce inefficiencies in industry as well as in the state, and  possibly seek a compromise between devaluation and inflation.    Aguirre then talked about the need to reform the state. He  said the problem is not just the size of the state. The real  problem centers on operating costs, public spending structures,  and the fiscal pressure to finance an oversized state. He said  the state influences costs when it determines public utility  rates, the price of gasoline, interest rates through the Bank of  the Republic, bus fares, insurance rates, taxes, and social  security contributions.    He said the government has been implementing measures to  reduce the size of the state as of 1990. In some ways it has  succeeded and in some ways it has not, partly due to resistance  to change by politicians and the population.    Aguirre said that despite some progress, the state as a  whole  continues to be inefficient and the cost of this inefficiency is  transferred to local consumers and foreign consumers in the case  of products we export.    Among the reforms, Aguirre mentioned the social security  system, which must be reformed without altering acquired rights.  He said that workers compensations (family subsidies, health  insurance, unemployment insurance, etc.) must be corrected  because they do not have genuine financing, as should the funds  that operate in the red--particularly rural funds. These items  are a burden on the Industry and Commerce Fund (which operates  in the black) because they prevent it from lowering costs.  [passage omitted]    Aguirre said other factors harming industries are the  compensatory mechanisms, which do not exist or are insufficient  to face direct or indirect protectionist policies.    Aguirre said: "Tariff reductions implemented within the  framework of the Asuncion Treaty [which created the Common  Market of the South, Mercosur], or practiced in general in a  gradual manner, are not bad and the productive apparatus has  accepted them. What is unreasonable is to implement them under  unfair or unequal conditions without full reciprocity inside and  outside Mercosur."    The vice president said Uruguay must adopt compensatory  mechanisms when Argentina and Brazil adopt protectionist  measures against Uruguayan exports through their statistic rates  or other mechanisms. He added that this does not mean we will  abandon the policy of economic opening. They will be implemented  only to prevent suffering undue and unnecessary damage.    Aguirre closed his speech by citing some items of what could  be a considered a tentative Program of Industrial Policy as of  1995.    Objective:    A. To create the minimum conditions for industries to  compete  in the international market.    B. To maintain policies to cover the entire field, seeking  competitiveness among our industries without neglecting official  support to specific groups.    C. To increase worker training in new technologies.    D. To reform the state.    E. To reform the Social Security System, the tax system, and  interest rates, and to eliminate state monopolies.    F. To introduce flexibility into the labor market.    G. To continue the program of economic opening and regional  integration on the basis of reciprocity and compensatory  mechanisms for specific situations.</p>

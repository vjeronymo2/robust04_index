			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Russian parliament lower house  speaker Ivan Rybkin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who  met at the lower house on Thursday, expressed satisfaction with  the development of relations between the two neighbouring  countries.    Russian-Finnish contacts, including those at the  parliamentary level, will develop in future too. Rybkin  informed the high guest that Russian people wait with interest  for a visit to Moscow by the Finnish parliament speaker.    The sides pointed to the importance of developing further  economic cooperation between the two states, which, as they put  it, should be given a boost. The president displayed interest  in how investment legislation progresses in Russia. "The  question of guarantees is of top priority for us," he noted.    Rybkin described the economic and political situation in the  country to the president, stressing that "it was not an easy  thing for us to adopt" the Social Accord Treaty.    He noted that it was fathered by the State Duma (lower  house)  which adopted a decision on economic and political amnesty last  February.    "When the process was joined by the president who buttressed  it with his prestige, the cause of consolidation picked up much  more speed," he said.    "We in the State Duma supported the government's unpopular  measures by adopting a very tense federal budget for this year  in the first reading and made this move consciously," Rybkin  said, stressing that "we should bear the burden of our reforms  together with the government".    "It is important that social accord was reached and that  cooperation between the two arms of Russian Government is  successfully developing," Ahtisaari said. "I had the same  impression after my talks with Boris Yeltsin and Viktor  Chernomyrdin," the president added.</p>

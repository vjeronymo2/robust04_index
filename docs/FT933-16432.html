			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Rentokil raises Securiguard bid terms and snaps up 29.7% stake RENTOKIL, the environmental and property services company, yesterday lifted its bid for security and cleaning group Securiguard and then bought 29.7 per cent of the company in the market at the revised offer price. Securiguard's board, which rejected Rentokil's earlier approach, said it wanted to meet with Rentokil and consider recommending the revised bid. Rentokil raised its cash offer from 270p a share to 345p, which includes Securiguard's 4.5p interim dividend payable next month. The offer, which was declared final, values Securiguard at Pounds 70.9m compared to its market capitalisation before the offer of about Pounds 40m. Securiguard's shares gained 25p to 340p. Analysts said Rentokil was offering a 'very full' price and would probably win control of the target. Mr Clive Thompson, Rentokil's chief executive, said the revised offer gave shareholders more than 18 times last year's earnings. 'The reason we've paid a very substantial premium is in order to realise opportunities in the security market,' he said. Rentokil wants to use Securiguard's UK and US manned security operations to break into the security market, which it sees as a good fit with its other business services like property management. Securiguard's cleaning activities, expanded in 1990 through the purchase of Madison, could fit with Rentokil's office cleaning activities. Rentokil was less interested in Securiguard's other divisions, communications and personnel, according to Mr Thompson, who said he would consider Securiguard's offer of talks over the weekend. Rentokil bought its stake from 12 institutions. It stopped buying just short of the 30 per cent trigger, when it would have been forced to launch an unconditional offer. Securiguard, which gained a full listing in 1987, has seen its shares under-perform since 1990 because of fears about the quality of its management and business. Although it holds some high profile contracts, such as providing security for New York's Kennedy airport, its cleaning division is thought to be skewed towards low margin, local authority business.

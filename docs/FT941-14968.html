			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / People: Finance moves - J Henry Schroder Wagg &amp; Co Michael Templeman has switched from gamekeeper to poacher in his new role as director responsible for group taxation at J Henry Schroder Wagg &amp; Co. Templeman was until the end of last year an under-secretary at the Inland Revenue, most recently in charge of the Financial Institutions Division. He joined Schroder as a director at the start of January, and replaces Eric Henbrey, who will retire in June as head of the tax department. Henbrey himself joined Schroder from a job as an inspector of taxes in 1966, at which time he says there was just a 'trickle' of Revenue staff moving into the private sector.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Terrorist bombings could not destabilize the  government, police chief Prathin Santipraphop said yesterday,  while admitting that the government's intelligence gathering  ability is weak.    Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin said police had tightened  security along southern rail roads after the recent bomb which  derailed a train. Police patrolled around the clock in certain  areas.    Last week, a passenger train that left Hat Yai for the  southern border town of Sungai Kolok detonated a bomb under the  tracks, derailing 14 carriages and injuring 10 people.    Asked if the incident was aimed at ousting the government,  Prathin said the government could not be removed because it was  elected by the people. The government had done nothing wrong  and was not involved in corruption.    "Those who want to oust the government by bombing are  fools,"  he said.    He said the bombing was intended to create a disturbance. It  was the work of the people with mental problems.    Prathin admitted that the country's intelligence service was  ineffective. He had been told about the matter on several  occasions, and found that it was true after he was appointed  police director general.    Officers had not seriously performed their duty. They would  try hard only when there was an incident. However, the  intelligence had been improved, he said.    Prathin said police had done their best to provide security  for people's lives and property. However, some acts of  terrorism were impossible to prevent.</p>

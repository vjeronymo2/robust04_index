			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SALVADORAN REBELS ASK CEASE-FIRE  </P> <P> Salvadoran rebels today proposed a cease-fire in their country's decade-old  civil war, prosecution of human rights violators and reduction of the armed  forces.  </P> <P> Rebel leaders made public their proposals at a news conference moments before  renewing talks in Mexico City with representatives of President Alfredo  Cristiani's rightist administration.  </P> <P> But both sides said they have scant hope of negotiating an early end to the  war, which has cost more than 70,000 lives. Three previous attempts to  negotiate peace from 1984 to 1987 ended in deadlock.  </P> <P> Joaquin Villalobos, a top leader of the leftist Faradundo Marti National  Liberation Front guerrillas, and seven other rebel chiefs distributed a  document outlining their proposals, which they said they will present to the  government.  </P></p>

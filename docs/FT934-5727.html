			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / International press review Japan Capital punishment made a rare appearance in the Japanese press highlighting the new fashion for public debate of sensitive matters symbolised by the open style of the Hosokawa government. Reports by Amnesty International and other human rights groups in the Daily Yomiuri and Japan Times say that up to four convicted murderers were hanged on Friday, the first executions under the new government. The most recent executions were in March, when three were hanged. Curiously, as the Japan Times points out, Japanese law only allows the death penalty if it is not 'cruel', an ambiguity which gives human rights groups a field day. Just as oddly, the Justice Ministry never announces executions, beyond telephoning families a day later, in an attempt to keep hangings out of the press. Neither do the authorities inform those on death row, so they live every day thinking the end is imminent. On this, the government is a secretive as ever, despite the Hosokawa effect. The information only comes out thanks to Amnesty's diligence in keeping in touch with families of those under penalty of death, of which 55 remain. Amnesty admits in the Yomiuri that it still had difficulty over the weekend in persuading people to sign petitions against capital punishment. Still, the coverage accorded to the executions by the normally compliant Japanese press, could indicate emergence of public opinion on the subject. Serbia If Vecernje Novosti, the Belgrade daily in the grip of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, is to be believed, UN sanctions on Serb-led Yugoslavia will be lifted any day now. Headlines promise Serbs a swift improvement of the grim economic situation, heralding a 'winter without sanctions'. The United Nations 18 months ago slapped sanctions, including an oil embargo, on Belgrade for supporting the violent partition of Bosnia. But Novosti, the biggest circulation newspaper, boasts how Serbia has been vindicated, with the west finally coming round to the Serbian side. There is no mention that sanctions will be lifted only if Bosnian Serbs hand over land to their Moslem foes. The alleged promise to allow the delivery of heating oil and petrol to Serbia coincides with parliamentary elections due to be held on December 19. While the independent newspaper Borba or weekly Vreme more realistically inform Serbian readers on the current chances for a peace settlement and lifting of sanctions, few people can afford to buy them. Recent surveys indicated only 5 per cent of the population buy newspapers; most people rely on the seemingly omnipotent Television Serbia for information. Pro-Milosevic papers are heavily subsidised by the cash-strapped government. Loath to miss an opportunity to demonise their independent competition, Belgrade press under Mr Milosevic dismissed their rivals as 'traitors to Serbia' when Borba and Vreme recently received a badly-needed delivery of newsprint and other supplies from the European Community Humanitarian Organisation (Echo). Germany Mr Steffen Heitmann, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chosen candidate for the presidency, might finally believe the gods are on his side. He and his aides were dreading the days after his decision to pull out of the race for the country's highest office. But the media has been distracted by scandal in the state government of Saxony-Anhalt in eastern Germany. Finding a consensus candidate for the presidency after the resignation of Mr Heitmann, an east German, ran a close second in yesterday's papers - from Welt am Sontag to Berlin's Tagesspiegel - to the story about the resignation of the Saxony-Anhalt cabinet. But the press has made clear it is not getting at the east Germans: in fact, it is the Wessis, the west Germans, who come in for stick, since the key positions in Saxony-Anhalt's government are held by west Germans. This seems to rule out the conspiracy theory, held by many in the east German press, that all Ossis are seen by their western counterparts as incompetent and inarticulate. The fact that any notion of a media conspiracy against Ossis might be misplaced can be of little comfort to Mr Heitmann. It has been clear in the press in the past three weeks that the governing Christian Democratic Union, which endorsed him as its presidential candidate, was getting cold feet. The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung has been cheering for Mr Roman Herzog, president of the constitutional court. Not just because he is more careful and articulate than Mr Heitmann; but because the CDU's rank and file were fed up with the way Mr Kohl and Mr Peter Hintze, general secretary of the CDU, had foisted the Saxon upon the party without any discussion. By early last week, publications ranging from the weekly Stern magazine and the liberal daily Suddeutsche Zeitung to the left-wing Frankfurter Rundschau were all in agreement that it was time for Mr Heitmann to go. The east German press has expressed anger about the way Mr Heitmann was foisted upon them too, and the way the campaign discredited the presidency. In a sober leader, the Dresden-based Sachsische Zeitung said it was time to repair the damage. This would probably mean Mr Kohl forgoing his chance to have an Ossi - and a subservient one at that. It wrote: 'Ostkandidate Ade' - easterner candidate, Adieu] United States The ground of American culture shifted last week as America's most powerful theatre critic wrote his last review. Mr Frank Rich, who for 13 years has been the New York Times' chief theatre critic, will leave that position on Wednesday to become columnist for the Times, an appointment which is among the highest honours for a Times staffer. Mr Rich, who is 44, will write a twice-weekly column on American society and culture. Mr Rich has been replaced as chief theatre critic by Mr David Richards, 53, who has served as the Times' Sunday theatre critic since 1990, after nine years as theatre critic of the Washington Post. The position of Times chief theatre critic is traditionally a powerful one which, under Mr Rich's tenure, has taken on new heights of influence. Though his name has been largely reviled among theatre folk, he earned the respect of his colleagues in the press; local and national coverage of his move has been surprisingly decorous. Press and theatre community alike are adopting a wait-and-see attitude towards Mr Richards, whose graceful writing is widely admired.

He has described the Slovenian foreign ministry's  demand as provocative, saying he will leave the country as  previously planned on Sunday.    The ministry says Zhirinovskiy's escorts were reported by  police to have kicked up a row and destroyed property in the  resort city of Bled. The ministry reacted with the demand that  Zhirinovskiy and his men leave Slovenia.</p>

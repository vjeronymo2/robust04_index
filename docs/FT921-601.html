			<p>920328 FT  28 MAR 92 / Letter: Which class of reader? Sir, Roy Greenslade's argument ('Book Review: A better class of reader', March 26) that British newspaper reading habits in 'a nation with two distinct presses appealing to two different audiences' are class-based is, I believe, mistaken. First, it assumes too easily that the upper and middle class constitute 'an articulate, literate elite' without indicating what literacy ought to mean in such a context. Second, it ignores the subtle but significant differences between broadsheet newspapers and what might be regarded as serious intellectual and emotional divides - as for example between Guardian readers and Times readers. The notion that the upper and middle classes in Britain nowadays constitute any sort of literate elite in an age when genuine discussion is notable for its absence, when Lord Young regards Radio 3 as an 'indulgence', and when few people other than academics seem to read anything other than newspapers is remarkable (and creditable) for its optimism.

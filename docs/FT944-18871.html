			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Improved skills will be answer to contracting European workforce Sir, In your Business Locations supplement (September 27), Philip Coggan addressed the problem of Europe's high manufacturing cost base relative to Pacific Rim economies. He reviewed the argument that Europe needs to concentrate on technological development, but pointed out that this will not necessarily reduce unemployment. He cited an economist's view that 'what is causing Europe's problems is structural unemployment caused by technological change'. The following article by Eva Kaluzynska examined the European problem of an ageing population and a low birth rate which implies a future shortage of labour. She quoted a number of experts who suggest a variety of solutions, ranging from later retirement to increasing the rate of female participation in the workforce. The problem of a small workforce having to support an ageing population is a real one and the tide of technological change is unlikely to change. Moves to expand the total workforce, assuming Europe does not follow the US route of creating more unskilled and low-paid jobs, would be unhelpful. The solution must lie in improving the education and skills of the reducing numbers coming into employment and encouraging those already in employment to make greater provision for their retirement.

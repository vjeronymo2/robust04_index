			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Observer: Old smut Given life after death, Shakespeare could be nudging one of his eastern contemporaries and saying: 'There, see what you've done now.' If so, he'll be referring to a jail sentence imposed in China on a certain Wan Jianguo. Arrested for publishing pornography, he has been given four years in prison. But if that seems a long time, it is nothing to the age of the smutty book he published - the Golden Lotus, the work of an undisclosed hand during the Ming dynasty. Dating from about 1610, it has been blacklisted by Beijing censors pretty well ever since. However, it is available to officials and scholars who consider it a central work in the Chinese literary canon. It evidently struck Wan Jianguo as having popular appeal as well, since he printed 60,000 copies. Indeed, somewhere up there, the anonymous author might be telling Shakespeare that if he'd been more erotic and got his works banned, Britain's present government wouldn't have to order that children be made to read them.</p>

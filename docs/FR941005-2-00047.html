CoBank claimed a right to apply on behalf of these cooperatives based on security agreements entered into with each of them. These security agreements listed specific assets, accounts receivable, equipment and leaseholds as collateral with CoBank. However, none of these security agreements listed oil overcharge refunds as one of the secured items. The security agreements did list deferred patronage refunds from Farmland Industries, a regional cooperative, as a secured item, but the Decision determined that deferred patronage refunds from a regional cooperative are not oil overcharge refunds for which local cooperatives are eligible on behalf of their member/owners. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Texaco Inc./Donley's Texaco Service Station, 7/28/94, RF321&hyph;16838, RF321&hyph;21012, RF321&hyph;21013 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund submitted by Donley's Service Station (Donley's), an indirect purchaser of Texaco motor gasoline. Donley's requested that the refund be paid to the firm, which is a partnership currently owned by four partners. However, in accordance with prior Decisions, the DOE determined that the partners during the refund period were eligible for the Donley's refund in proportion to their ownership interest, except for those partners who had transferred their right to a refund. One of the Donley's partners both currently and during the refund period owns 75% of the shares of the corporation that supplied gasoline to Donley's. The DOE decided not to treat the two firms as a single firm for purposes of determining the applicable presumption of injury available to Donley's. However, since the supplier had received a refund for its direct purchases of Texaco gasoline, the Donley's refund for the common owner was reduced by 75% so that he would not receive two refunds for the same gallons. The total of the refunds granted to the three Donley's partners who had joined in the outlet's refund claim was $7,285 ($5,192 principal plus $2,093 interest). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Texaco Inc./Lehigh Service &amp; Supply, 7/29/94, RF321&hyph;19561,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RF321&hyph;19562, RF321&hyph;19563, RF321&hyph;19564  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning four Applications for Refund filed in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding by four partners on behalf of Lehigh Service &amp; Supply, a reseller located in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. Two of these partners had previously received a refund for purchase made by Lehigh Gas &amp; Oil, the firm that supplied Lehigh Service &amp; Supply with Texaco product. The DOE determined that these two partners were ineligible for a refund for purchases made by Lehigh Service &amp; Supply because they had already received a refund for these gallons, and accordingly, these two Applications for Refund were denied. The other two applicants received refunds in proportion to their ownership interest in Lehigh Service &amp; Supply. The total amount of refunds granted in this Decision was $2,366 ($1,686 principal plus $680 interest). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Texaco Inc./Ryder Energy Distribution, 7/29/94,RF321&hyph;14683 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding on behalf of Ryder Energy Distribution (Ryder). Ryder is the fuel purchasing and distribution subsidiary of Ryder Systems, a nationwide truck leasing company. In its application, Ryder requested a refund based on the end-user presumption of injury for its Texaco purchases which were consumed by its own fleet of trucks. It also claimed a refund under the medium-range presumption of injury based on the purchases it made from Texaco which it later resold to its leasing customers. The DOE determined that, in accordance with Gulf Oil Corp./Ryder Energy Distribution,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21 DOE &para;85,345 (1991), Ryder must be considered a retailer, since as a vehicle rental firm, it was involved in the retail sale of petroleum products. Furthermore, the DOE determined that it would be inconsistent with the adoption of a $50,000 maximum refund under the medium-range presumption of injury for Ryder to receive in excess of that amount without having to prove injury. Accordingly, Ryder was awarded $50,000, plus interest, under the medium-range presumption of injury. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

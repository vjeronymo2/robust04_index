			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Markets watch krona after Riksbank raises rates The Swedish krona was again in the spotlight yesterday after the central bank's decision to lift interest rates by 20 basis points, writes Philip Gawith. The decision to raise the key repo rate to 7.4 per cent, which had been well flagged, had a mixed reception, and the krona finished lower on the day. It closed in London at SKr4.741 against the D-Mark from SKr4.723. The trading range for the day was SKr4.7290-SKr4.7510. Elsewhere, there were few surprises when the Bundesbank council decided to leave its official rates unchanged - the discount rate at 4 1/2 per cent, the Lombard rate at 6 per cent - and to fix the repo rate at 4.85 per cent for a further two weeks. The dollar had a quiet day ahead of today's closely watched third-quarter GDP release. It closed in London at DM1.4972 and Y96.895, from DM1.4953 and Y97.035. The US currency is now experiencing increasing difficulty breaking above the DM1.50 level again. Sterling rose by more than a pfennig to close at DM2.4519 from DM2.4412. Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.6377 from Dollars 1.6326. The trade weighted index finished at 80.8, up from 80.5. The Riksbank last increased the repo rate, from 6.92 per cent to 7.2 per cent, on August 11. A combination of surprise, and the announcement being linked to currency weakness, then caused the market to sell the krona down to SKr5, from SKr4.94. The krona has recently been firmer, mainly as a result of market optimism that the Swedes will vote 'yes' to joining the European Union in a referendum on November 13. Signs that the government intends to rein in spending have also helped the currency. Contrary to the August move, when the market was not sure why rates were being increased, Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London, said this time 'the justification for raising rates is certainly there'. Capacity utilisation figures are on a rising trend, and producer prices are growing at a 5 per cent year on year rate. Mr Hawkins said the rate increase was potentially a double-edged sword, because higher interest rates mean a higher interest bill for the government, putting further strain on the public sector borrowing requirement which the market is already worried about. 'The Swedish krona is going to have to go through a potentially protracted period of undervaluation until the budget is addressed,' said Mr Hawkins. Mr Peter Luxton, international economist at MMS, said the Riksbank's decision, coming soon after its recomposition, was 'astute'. In Sweden, the make-up of the central bank board reflects the distribution of political power in the country. There had been some concern that with a social democrat government replacing a more right-wing outgoing government, monetary policy might be more lax. Mr Luxton, however, said: 'This latest move reinforces the independence and credibility of the Swedish central bank.' Part of the 'Kiwi' dollar's strength is attributable to the firmer Australian dollar which has been strong in recent days on the back of interest rates being raised earlier this week. The currency also has independent strength, however, as a result of buoyant commodity prices, one of the best growth performances in the industrialised world and a central bank with considerable market credibility. The Reserve Bank last month raised the effective exchange rate index ceiling to 60, up from 59.2 in March and 57.5 before that. The exchange rate is the anchor of monetary policy and short-term interest rates are set at levels consistent with these targets. Lifting the index is an acknowledgement by the central bank of potential price pressures, with an appreciation in the nominal exchange rate a way of countering them. Mr Hawkins said the stronger currency was probably in part due to the market anticipating higher rates, in the wake of the Australian move. Overnight money traded between 3 and 6 per cent as the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.55bn daily shortage in the UK money markets. Three month LIBOR was unchanged at 6 per cent. In the futures market, prices firmed across the board following bullish inflation comments from the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England. The March short sterling contract closed at 92.66, from 92.60.</p>

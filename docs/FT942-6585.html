			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Honecker: hardline keeper of the Wall Erich Honecker, the former East German leader who personified the intransigence of hardline communists of the 1980s, died yesterday of cancer in his exile in the Chilean capital, Santiago. He was 81. Honecker, a miner's son who spent years in a Nazi jail, opposed many of the liberal reforms in Eastern Europe in the Gorbachev era. But, in 1989, he could only watch helplessly as the communist state he helped to build since the second world war was swept away in a popular tide that led to German reunification. He flew to exile in Chile early last year after the collapse of a trial in which he was charged with responsibility for the death of 13 East Germans killed trying to cross the border to the west. Hockecker was reviled by many as Politburo member responsible for building the Berlin Wall in 1961. German television brought almost hourly updates during his trial and accompanied him on his aircraft to Santiago. Fascination with the man, by then pale and wizened, faded away only after he retired to the seclusion of his daughter's house - a world away from his life's violent political struggles. Honecker was born into a left-wing family in the mining state of Saarland. Both his parents were communists and he distributed party pamphlets at the age of eight. He joined the party, studied in Moscow, was arrested by the Gestapo - as events and political schooling cast him in a tough and resilient mould. Walter Ulbricht brought Honecker into the party's central committee after the second world war. Long regarded as Ulbricht's 'crown prince,' he took charge of military and state security. The top job fell to him in 1971 after Ulbricht resisted Moscow's efforts to reach an accord with Bonn. Few East Germans expected much from the stern-faced Honecker, who had a reputation for orthodoxy and was a notoriously bad speaker. But the early Honecker years, until about 1975, were seen in retrospect by many as East Germany's most prosperous years. Relations between the two Germanies improved as Willy Brandt, West Germany's Social Democratic chancellor, sought to improve ties. Honecker pursued a twin-track policy of sealing off the East German people from West Germany while seeking recognition and financial help from West German politicians and business leaders. This policy, aimed at solidifying the communist state, was capped by the visit to East Germany in December 1981 by Mr Helmut Schmidt, the then West German chancellor. Throughout the mid-1980s Honecker longed to crown his political career with a visit to Bonn. He finally made an official visit in 1987. But Honecker found himself increasingly isolated as the Soviet Union and other East European states struggled to adapt to pressures for economic and political reforms. After the Berlin Wall came down, Honecker was spirited to Moscow only to find himself spurned there and eventually extradited back to Germany for his abortive trial. 'Honecker failed in his political goals,' a German government spokesman commented yesterday. 'His policies caused pain to countless people in Germany.'</p>

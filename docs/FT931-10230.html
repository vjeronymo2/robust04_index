			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: JCI to hold payout in spite of fall in profits JOHANNESBURG Consolidated Investment, the South African mining house, yesterday reported lower half-year profits but, thanks to solid progress by the group's industrial investments, the outturn was better than many analysts had feared. Attributable earnings for the six months ended December fell by 6 per cent to R155.6m (Dollars 49.8m) with income from investments accounting for R136.3m, against R144.7m last time. The contribution from operating subsidiaries fell to R4.8m from R16.8m. Equity-accounted earnings fell by 7 per cent to R176.5m, or to 119 cents a share from 129 cents. However, the dividend is being maintained at 42 cents a share. Mr Pat Retief, chairman, said trading had been very difficult with all the commodity markets weakening. Although Mr Retief felt the group had performed reasonably well, he cautioned that earnings during the current half were likely to stay under pressure. Full-year results would be 'significantly lower'. Mr Retief said the 50 per cent decline in profit from platinum - the JCI group is the largest producer - had had a 'major adverse impact' on results. There had also been a 'substantial' decline in income from coal interests, while ferrochrome producer CMI made large losses. The industrial interests had again contributed more to group earnings than mining. JCI's main interests are in South African Breweries, the food group Premier, newspaper interests and the Toyota motor group. Mr Retief said the purchase of a 10 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, would not have a significant effect on JCI's balance sheet and would not dilute earnings.</p>

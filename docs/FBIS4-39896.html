			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with DPRK Ambassador Son Song-pil by Sergey </F> Turchenko, date and place not given: "Threat of Blockade: Son  Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, Talks About the Provocative  U.S. Policy on the Korean Peninsula"]    [Text] The situation on the Korean peninsula has flared up  again sharply recently. The reason for this is apparently an  internal matter relating to the DPRK's domestic economic  activity: The latter has decided to replace some fuel rods at an  experimental nuclear reactor. IAEA experts were invited in good  time to monitor this work. Hardly had they had time to begin  work than people in the United States kicked up what is clearly  a propaganda fuss about the impossibility of the technical  inspection of the fuel rods and began voicing a priori  suspicions that the DPRK is producing plutonium for nuclear  weapons. And it is on these grounds that the "world policeman"  is demanding an economic blockade of North Korea and other  sanctions. What is behind this campaign? We put that question  to Comrade Son Song-pil, DPRK Ambassador to Russia.    [Son Song-pil] I want to stress that we immediately gave the  IAEA experts all the documentation relating to the method for  the technical inspection of the fuel rods. The same  documentation was also sent to the U.S. side. They promised us  that they would study it. We expressed a readiness for any  compromise if our method failed to satisfy the specialists in  any way. However, a calm solution of the question was clearly  not in the U.S. side's plans. Without waiting for the  specialists' assessment the politicians mounted a noisy  propaganda campaign aimed at inclining the United Nations toward  sanctions against our country. But the main task of the United  States remains unchanged -- it is to stifle a socialist state in  Northeast Asia. In this connection we state that if sanctions  are imposed on us we will take appropriate measures. At the  same time we state that we will regard the imposition of  sanctions as a declaration of war against us. At the same time  we stress that we do not want to aggravate the situation and we  believe that the nuclear problem can be resolved only on the  basis of a simultaneous and comprehensive solution of all the  questions connected with it.    [Turchenko] Can you tell us in greater detail what kind of  documents were handed over to the U.S. side, because for some  reason the press is saying nothing about them?    [Son Song-pil] They contain a technical description of our  methods of measuring fuel rods. These methods have been  approved and fully correspond to our technical capabilities. In  this connection I repeat that we have informed the United States  of our readiness for compromise options. But we have not  received any suggestions from the United States. Apart from a  completely unjustified demand for the inspection of two military  installations which have nothing to do with the reactor. And  that, after all, is a flagrant violation of the country's  sovereignty. We will not agree to such a step.    [Turchenko] Can you explain, please, what is meant by the  simultaneous and comprehensive solution of the problem?    [Son Song-pil] The United States is demanding steps only  from our side right now. We, however, propose that everything  be resolved as a package. For our part we are ready to ensure  the possibility of regular and random inspections under [po]  nuclear guarantees. We are also ready to return to the  framework of the nuclear weapon nonproliferation treaty, which  the DPRK suspended in response to the high-handedness of the  United States toward North Korea. This, so to speak, is our  contribution to the settlement of the problem. But at the same  time the Americans must renounce the threat to use nuclear  weapons against our country. In this context the U.S. nuclear  weapons and nuclear bases must be evacuated from South Korea.  The "Team Spirit" military maneuvers directed against us must  also be terminated. In addition to all this we demand the  renunciation of the provocative policy toward the DPRK and the  normalization of relations with our country. That is the U.S.  contribution to a solution.    However, the Americans are demanding that we unilaterally  accept their jurisdiction and then they will see whether it is  worth fulfilling our demands. The problem cannot be resolved on  that basis, which is, to put it mildly, unjust.    [Turchenko] You spoke of appropriate measures in response to  the sanctions. What do you mean?    [Son Song-pil] Concrete sanctions will lead to concrete  measures. It is difficult to make predictions just now. But we  have stated that if any country takes part in sanctions we will  view that as a declaration of war with all the consequences that  such an action entails.    [Turchenko] How do you view Russia's proposal to convene an  international conference on the solution of the Korean problem?    [Son Song-pil] A conference is a step toward the solution of  the problem by peaceful means. Of course, we give the due  assessment to this proposal. It has special significance also  because the Americans have stated that it is impossible to  continue the Korean-U.S. talks. If an international conference  is held on a fair and equal basis we will support it.    [Turchenko] Apart form the general proposal, has the Russian  side provided any materials which give concrete substance to the  form and content of the conference?    [Son Song-pil] Unfortunately our side has not received any  such materials to date. I recently had a conversation with  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Panov. The ideas suggested so  far relate purely to the framework of this conference. It is  to be hoped that this question will receive a positive  development.</p>

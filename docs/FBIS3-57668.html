It was mentioned in  the speech by the UN secretary general on the situation in  Abkhazia, which was circulated here in the United Nations as a  document of the Security Council.    It is mentioned in the speech by Butrus-Ghali that the  Security Council on 4 November 1993 adopted Resolution No. 881  and approved maintaining a presence of a small UN mission of  observers in Georgia until 31 January 1994 for establishing  links with both of the conflicting sides as well as Russian  military contingents. The Security Council decreed not to  prolong the mandate of the mission beyond 31 January 1994 unless  the secretary general reported to the council of considerable  progress in carrying out the measures aimed at achieving a solid  peace.    The Geneva memorandum of understanding signed on 1 December  1993 points to a hopeful progress in establishing a solid peace  in the region, said Butrus-Ghali. It was exactly in this  connection that on 22 January 1994 the Security Council adopted  Resolution No. 892, said Butrus-Ghali, which gives a sanction to  the United Nations to gradually deploy about 50 additional  military observers -- besides the five who are already there [in  Georgia].    Butrus-Ghali said: In Paris, the Georgian head of state  Eduard Shevardnadze and I thoroughly discussed the situation in  Abkhazia. He asked me earnestly to give recommendations to the  Security Council for a speedy deployment of the UN military  observers in Abkhazia. Considering the results of my talks with  Shevardnadze, I ordered my colleagues and the chief military  observer of the UN observers' mission in Georgia to study the  expediency of a further growth -- over 55 observers -- of the  number of UN observers in Georgia.</p>

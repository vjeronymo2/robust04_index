			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / TUC denounces jobseeker's bill Unions and voluntary organisations have promised to campaign hard against the government's new Jobseeker's Allowance, which the Trade Union Congress described as a 'nasty and vindictive measure'. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, denounced the bill to implement the allowance, which was published yesterday. He said it was 'based on the wholly false view that the unemployed are work-shy shirkers that need to be forced back to work by the heavy hand of state control'. The new six-month allowance will replace unemployment benefit and income support in April 1996. Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, estimates the scheme will mean a Pounds 100m net cut in government spending on unemployment in 1996-97, the first year, and would then save Pounds 200m every following year. The government described the allowance as 'a major step forward in the reform of the benefit system but Mr Monks described it as 'a cruel parody of redistribution'.</p>

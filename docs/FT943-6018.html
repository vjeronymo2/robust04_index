			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Molyneaux holds the power of veto It was no accident that Mr James Molyneaux was in 10 Downing Street within hours of the IRA's announcement yesterday of an end to its campaign of violence. Nor was it by chance that his publicly voiced concerns about the absence in the IRA statement of the word 'permanent' were echoed by Mr John Major. Mr Molyneaux, the MP for the Protestant stronghold of Lagan Valley and leader of the mainstream Ulster Unionists, holds a veto over the prime minister's search for a durable political settlement in Northern Ireland. Without his tacit consent, Mr Major could not have struck the political deal with Dublin which provided the essential backdrop to the IRA's decision. Mr Molyneaux did not like the Downing Street declaration or the subsequent clarifications. But he acquiesced. Had he decided otherwise, Mr Major - an embattled prime minister with a perilously small majority and plenty of enemies on his own backbenches - would have had to abandon the enterprise. The same will be true now. Assuming that the IRA is genuine in its intent, Mr Molyneaux will have a similar influence over the pace and extent of Mr Major's government's response. An eventual political settlement will depend on his signature. Mr Molyneaux is no soft touch. One of the most experienced figures in Ulster politics - he has been an MP since 1970 and celebrated his 74th birthday at the weekend - his commitment to unionism is as strong as any in the community he represents. Taciturn but instinctively a shrewd political operator, he has survived longer than many expected as the top of one of the roughest political environments in western Europe. Over 15 years he has headed off several potential challenges to his leadership of the Official Unionist party, which has nine MPs. He has contained the threat to his party's position from Mr Ian Paisley's more extreme Democratic Unionist party. He is deeply suspicious of any negotiation between London and Dublin. Like many in the unionist community he sees no reason why the republic should have any role in discussions on the future of part of another sovereign state. His stated preference for a political settlement has been greater integration of Ulster into the political process at Westminster - or failing that, the creation of a devolved assembly in the province with no interference from Dublin. But Mr Molyneaux is a man of Westminster as well as of the raw politics of Ulster. He lacks the intemperate bigotry of some in the unionist community. He believes that if deals are to be made, then it is better to remain on the inside track than to join Mr Paisley in shouting from the sidelines. Mr Molyneaux has judged so far that the interests of the unionists would not be served by derailing the process which led to the IRA ceasefire. And in spite of his insistence on proof of its permanence, the signs yesterday were that he is willing to acquiesce in further moves along the same road. To his opponents in the nationalist community, Mr Molyneaux is a stubborn and blinkered man whose refusal to admit even the possibility of Irish unity will be a permanent obstacle to a political settlement. But without him Mr Major and Mr Reynolds would not have got even this far.</p>

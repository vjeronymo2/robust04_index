			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GEOTHERMAL FIRM GOING FULL STEAM  </P> <P> As recently as 1987, the geothermal brines that flowed in superheated,  subterranean rivers coursing beneath this Imperial Valley agricultural hub were  thought to be commercially unsuitable for power generation.  </P> <P> Several power developers tried and failed with geothermal projects in the  Salton Sea area 120 miles east of San Diego, including a San Diego Gas &amp;  Electric-led group that closed a $188-million experimental plant in 1987 after  two years of effort.  </P> <P> The problem was that the geothermal resource -- a liquid of up to 600 degrees  Fahrenheit that is found between 3,000 and 9,000 feet beneath the earth's  surface -- contained too many dissolved solids. The salts, silica and other  particles tended to clog pipes and confound the chemical engineers who tried to  separate out the power-giving steam.  </P> <P> Magma Power Co. seems to have solved the riddle of dealing with Imperial Valley  brine, thanks in large part to technological and financial assistance from Dow  Chemical Co., which owns 42% of the company's publicly traded stock.  </P> <P> Magma Power, based in San Diego, has put three new geothermal plants totaling  126 megawatts of power on line since January, 1989. Except for a two-week  period in June when hurricane-force winds toppled power transmission lines, all  three have been operating at or near maximum capacity, except for scheduled  maintenance. That performance has earned Magma Power a reputation as one of the  most technologically advanced geothermal companies.  </P> <P> "Magma has been able to use geothermal resources that most everyone else  thought were unusable," said Claude Harvey, senior vice president of Pacific  Energy, a power-generating subsidiary of Commerce-based Pacific Enterprises  that operates geothermal plants in the Mammoth Lakes area.  </P> <P> Magma Power's quadrupling of its power-generation capacity and ability to  deliver it profitably to its sole customer, SCE Corp.'s Southern California  Edison power utility unit, has made it one of the fastest-growing publicly  owned companies in California -- in terms of sales, profit growth and stock  value. The company's financial performance has been enhanced by royalties from  its vast geothermal rights leases, which cover 48,000 acres in California and  Nevada.  </P> <P> But just as Magma Power and other geothermal producers appear to be finding  their way on the new geothermal frontier, and as the specter of war and  disrupted oil supplies in the Middle East seem to suggest that nonfossil-fuel  energy may become more attractive, the market for geothermal energy is in flux.  </P> <P> The federal and state programs that in the early 1980s provided incentives to  alternative energy producers such as Magma Power have lapsed and not been  replaced. Moreover, most California utilities now say they have all the  generating capacity they need for several years.  </P> <P> Even if utilities were in a mode to buy more capacity, geothermal producers  would have to supply it at prices comparable with natural gas, the utilities'  lowest-cost source of energy. Geothermal companies say they cannot match that  rate.  </P> <P> The success of Magma Power highlights the importance of state and federal  incentives to alternative power producers. A 1983 federal law forced utilities  to sign power purchase contracts with independent alternative power producers,  including Magma Power, at fixed, escalating rates. The program was designed to  help wean U.S. utilities from their dependence on imported petroleum.  </P> <P> By virtue of those power sales agreements with Edison, Magma Power was able to  secure $210 million in financing from J. P. Morgan &amp; Co. for construction  of the three new geothermal plants. Morgan was also influenced by a $24-million  guarantee from Dow to help Magma Power finance construction of 65 miles of  power transmission lines and by Dow's long-term technology agreement with Magma  Power.  </P> <P> A geothermal plant, with current technology, is three times as expensive to  build as a natural gas plant.  </P> <P> Magma Power took a $210-million gamble that it could build and operate the  costly plants according to schedule and provide power profitably to Edison  according to the terms of its sales contract -- while breaking new ground in  geothermal technology.  </P> <P> The gamble seems to be paying off. Magma Power reported a 1989 profit of $22.3  million on revenue of $63.1 million, up from a 1988 profit of $9.3 million on  revenue of $26 million. The successful construction of the plants has boosted  the company's stock value to more than $750 million from $30 million in 1981,  when Magma Power was formed.  </P> <P> Magma Power's explosive rate of growth will level off after fiscal 1990, the  first full on-line year of its fourth geothermal plant, because no new  generating plants are in the works. But analysts are optimistic about the  company's prospects for continued growth at more modest rates because of  escalation clauses that provide for a 7.5% annual increase in the price Edison  pays for its power.  </P> <P> Despite its growth, the company does little to publicize itself and until  recently declined to give interviews. In that sense, Magma Power is a  reflection of its chief executive, Arnold L. Johnson. He took the helm in 1987  after retiring as treasurer of Dow Chemical USA following 30 years with the  chemical giant.  </P> <P> Johnson is a no-nonsense, no-glitz executive who moved the company's  headquarters from Los Angeles to San Diego's Rancho Bernardo suburb in 1987 to  be closer to the Imperial Valley. Johnson is one of four ex-Dow executives now  at Magma Power.  </P> <P> When Johnson arrived, the company was in sad financial shape. Magma Power owned  widespread, lucrative mineral rights that had been secured by company founder  and geothermal pioneer B. C. McCabe, who helped develop the Geysers geothermal  area north of San Francisco. But Magma was losing money on its two geothermal  power plants in the Imperial Valley, one of which subsequently was sold.  </P> <P> Johnson, who had been a Magma Power director since 1984, took the chief  executive job only after he received commitments from Dow for technical and  financial assistance. Johnson saw the enormous profit potential in the power  sales contracts but knew that Dow chemical-process technology was essential to  dealing with the problem of treating Imperial Valley brine.  </P> <P> Dow Chemical, which has been a venture capital investor in Magma since the  early 1970s, not only agreed to give additional financial backing but also  technological assistance in exchange for stock. Both companies agreed that all  geothermal technology developed would become the property of Magma Power.  </P> <P> "I knew (Dow) had the technology," Johnson said. "At Dow, there's this  confidence that they are able to run any kind of a chemical-process plant. You  change this, observe that, tweak the process a little and see what happens."  </P></p>

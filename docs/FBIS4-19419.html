			<p>BFN     [Text] The CSCE's troika of foreign ministers held a  meeting today in Venice. Attending the meeting, apart from Geza  Jeszenszky, were Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta,  and Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas.    Our country will hold the presidency of the CSCE for one  year  beginning in 1995. The minority question was given special  emphasis at today's meeting. The issues to be on the agenda of  the security conference in Paris in May were reviewed and  agreed. In this regard, the CSCE had earlier taken a unified  stance; the work of the high commissioner for minorities will  still be supported, the reports of those in charge of monitoring  minority affairs will be continuously processed, and the agenda  of the Balladur conference will be shaped from the conclusions  which are drawn.    The foreign ministers consider it desirable that Latvia and  Russia should agree at the presidential level on improving  relations between their countries, and they welcome the  agreement reached on the withdrawal of Russian troops and the  Skrunda radar station, but they consider it desirable that these  agreements should come into force as soon as possible. A  similar agreement must take effect between Russia and Estonia  too, because the Russian troops stationed in the Baltics are  currently present as a destabilizing factor in Europe.    The foreign ministers reviewed the most recent developments  in the southern Slav crisis.    U.S. President Bill Clinton will also attend the CSCE summit  in Budapest in December, the foreign ministers confirmed.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Bupa rates move BUPA, the UK's biggest private health insurer, yesterday announced that it will not increase small-business customers' insurance premiums in January, thereby stemming the drift upwards in rates over the past four years. Customers of Bupa's CompanyCare scheme, available to businesses with fewer than 100 employees, will face average rate rises of 7.2 per cent on policies renewed through to next spring, reflecting an increase announced last May. Bupa said rates for bigger corporate subscribers, whose premium rates directly reflect the value of claims during the year, are not affected by yesterday's move. Individual customers renewing their BupaCare programme will face a total rise of 14.7 per cent, reflecting changes in July and an average 6.1 per cent increase from January. Bupa has negotiated a number of deals with hospital groups - reducing the cost of hospital care - and has also persuaded more subscribers to use day-care surgery.</p>

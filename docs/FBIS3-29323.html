One in five  companies accepts amakudari. The triumvirate are the Ministries  of Construction, Finance, and International Trade and Industry.  The actual state of bureaucracy and industry adhesion is clear.    Japanese society has been formed by the "iron triangle" of  politicians, bureaucrats, and industrialists. The arena  cultivated for a long time by both politicians and  industrialists has become too fat and now, a series of general  contractor bribes has shaken the islands of Japan.    The bureaucratic system, which is another apex, was shaped  in  the early Meiji period [1868-1912], and its system of control  has extended for over one century. Particularly after World War  II, politicians and industrialists united to push economic  reconstruction based on the leadership of the bureaucrats in  order to rebuild the devastated country.    The structure of bureaucrats and industrialists leaning on  each other has been formed in the shape of industry accepting a  large number of amakudari bureaucrats to obtain protection for  their own company and industry and the newest information.    A survey of amakudari officers from the bureaucracy in  private firms was made recently by TOYO KEIZAI, and all of their  names have been ascertained. The target firms were 2,175  companies with a total of 40,800 employees. Added to all 2,128  listed firms were 47 life and nonlife insurance companies and  other nonlisted firms, as well as major economic agencies such  as the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The firms accepting  them amount to 500 companies. Since there are a total of 1,012  officers and 474 companies pertaining just to listed firms, one  in 4.5 companies has installed amakudari bureaucrats as officers.    The number of amakudari officers in private firms at the  point in time of last year was 1,020 persons, and this number on  the 1,000 person level has hardly changed at all for the past 10  years.    It is said that the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has been  decisively at the top of amakudari to private firms for the past  20 years and according to the recent survey also, they were tops  with 189 people. Next was the Ministry of Construction (MOC),  which is the government agency supervising general contractors  that has been shaken by bribery, with 176 people, followed by  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) with 99.  However, if nonlisted firms are excluded and all listed firms  are made the target, the results are that MOF and MOC change  order--with the MOC in first, MOF in second, and MITI in third.    The fact that MOF becomes the top if the nonlisted firms are  added is because the financial institutions which are the domain  of MOF account for the majority of the nonlisted firms that were  the target of the survey. Viewing collectively that 75 percent  of the amakudari sites for both MOF and MOC are related  industries, the relationship of the bureaucracy and industry via  amakudaris becomes clear.    Moreover, 260 persons are also amakudari from special  corporations such as public corporations, but when separated by  supervising government agency, the prominence of MOC is  conspicuous here too. Since 75 percent of public corporation  officers come from the main ministry according to the "Amakudari  White Paper" by the Federation of Government Special Corporation  Employees (Seiroren), there should be several among these 260  people who came from a former government agency which this  survey did not touch.    The fact that bureaucrats with high positions in the main  ministry move to important jobs such as director of a special  corporation has been pointed out every year in the  aforementioned "Amakudari White Paper" which considers only  special corporations as the target of amakudari sites.  Therefore, a survey of the migrating group coming from the three  major ministries is in Table 2.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

There is Takanari Sugiura who was appointed chairman  of All Nippon Airways after serving as Ministry of Transport  (MOT) vice minister, president of Japan National Railways, and  chief director of Japan National Railways Liquidation Corp.  There is Shigeo Sawada who became vice president of NTT after  serving as Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications vice  minister and chief director of the Postal Savings Association.  It probably can be said that the pattern here of the high class  bureaucrat is to have a long, elegant amakudari life by  wandering through public corporations and finally settling down  in a private firm.    The treatment in private firms for one in four is generally  high, starting with former MOF bureaucrats, with a position of  president or higher. Moreover, the ranking of MOF and MITI has  taken the form of endorsing what are generally called "the  popular ministries."    Calculating on the basis of survey results (Labor  Administration Research Institute) that the average annual  remuneration for full-time officers is 18,507,000 yen, the total  annual remuneration for amakudari listed firm officers is  roughly 18.7 billion yen. You might say that an enormous sum of  about 20 billion yen has been appropriated as "amakudari officer  support expenses" by listed firms.    Moreover, making a trial calculation of amakudari officer  support expenses by ministry including positions, it becomes 4.5  billion yen for MOF, 3.6 billion yen for MOC, and 2.3 billion  yen for MITI. The various ministries must be eager to create  "designated chairs" of posts that can be inherited from senior  to junior. It probably can be taken that these expenses that are  paid by the firms indicate the vested interests as it were of  the three ministries.  <H5>  Construction Industry Is Still a Hotbed </H5>   With the coming of the Hosokawa administration, interest is  again increasing about relaxation of regulations, but what about  the relationship between permit/license authority and amakudari?    The total number of permits and licenses for 1992 reached  10,942 according to the Management and Coordination Agency, and  the ranking by numbers are the MOT (1,966), MITI (1,915),  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (1,357), and  thereafter to the MOF, Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the  MOC.    It would be thought that the ministries with the more  permits  and licenses would have stronger adhesion with firms, but the  ranking by ministry from which amakudari officers come is  somewhat different. The relationship with amakudari is not  simply the number of permits and licenses, and it can be  presumed that existence of power invisible to the eye that  controls the life or death of a firm operates in acceptance.    According to the National Public Services Law, approval of  the National Personnel Authority (NPA) is necessary if a  bureaucrat is reemployed in a private firm that has a deep  relationship with the post that he held within two years after  his retirement (approval for 208 people in 1992). However,  looking at the actual situation in which the majority are  amakudari into related industries, it is understood that the  process of approval by the NPA perhaps has become somewhat of a  shell.    As became clear in the recent survey, the majority of the  amakudari sites are related industries with the exception of the  National Tax Administration where on the scene veterans join as  auditors across various industrial sectors.    As opposed to the amakudari side which is in fact been  turned  to pasture, what kind of features are in the side accepting them?    Table 3.

Taken up in Table 3 is a list of former bureaucrats who are  amakudari to large and medium size general contractor listed  firms from MOC as well as special corporations related to  construction. It is learned that firms that accept public works  projects, which account for 30 percent of the total construction  demand, accept amakudari bureaucrats across the board.    The 475 listed companies that accept amakudari officers  equates to 22 percent of the whole. With regard to the 84  companies in the construction industry, it is 75 companies and  the acceptance rate climbs to 89 percent. In the construction  industry, in addition to those from MOC and related public  corporations accounting for half of the amakudari officers,  distribution for the remaining "three public works ministries"  is 20 percent for those from the Ministry of Agriculture,  Forestry and Fisheries, and those from other ministries or  agencies and public corporations sharing the remaining 30  percent.    Moreover, while it is said that amakudari officers "make use  of their experience and skill in private enterprise," almost all  becomes officers in charge of marketing. This industry indeed  has become a hot bed for amakudari coiling around various vested  interests.    It is said that the industry is mature and MOF influence in  city banks has become less that before, but nevertheless, 36  percent of the banks accept amakudari from MOF bureaucrats. If  those from the Bank of Japan are included in that, amakudari  officers exist at 46 percent of the city banks.    That is 53 percent at regional banks (72 percent including  the Bank of Japan). It is 68 percent at secondary regional banks  (79 percent including the Bank of Japan), including Hyogo Bank  where the former director of the MOF Banking Bureau was sent in  as president, and the smaller the scale of the financial  institution, the more the amakudari percentage climbs.    Is this because the larger the bank, the weaker the  influence of MOF or the smaller the bank, the more the power of  MOF old boys is needed?  <H5>  Expectations for Administrative Reform Council </H5>   The pipeline between central government ministries and  agencies and the industrial world, which has been built up over  a long time, is too large and fat, and its overall image is  difficult to grasp. It clearly was impossible in this survey,  and there are many other amakudari bureaucrats. amakudari  bureaucrats exist in public service corporations which amount to  20,000, special corporations and non-listed firms outside the  target of this survey, and in posts other than officers in  listed firms.    In the political world, the one-party rule of the Liberal  Democratic Party has crumbled and a crack is entering one corner  of the "iron triangle" that has controlled Japan for over a  century. At this juncture, the Third Administrative Reform  Council is preparing an Administrative Reform Council report  incorporating policy to correct amakudari.    An amakudari officer states, "Among large firms, there are  some areas that are more or less bureaucratic. There also are  some areas where things go smoothly that way. I serve a private  firm in those areas." The excellence of Japanese bureaucrats and  the strong bureaucratic structure have been known for a long  time in the world and here there is not the slightest doubt  about what is bureaucratic.    Indeed, among the officers recently revealed, there probably  are some to whom so-called amakudari does not apply. Moreover,  there probably also is a plus aspect in that amakudari has  smoothed the relationship between the bureaucracy and industry  and contributed to economic growth. There also is the aspect  that ministries and agencies have been able to demonstrate  efficiently the function of their organization by amakudari.    It is necessary not to criticize amakudari unilaterally  alone, but also to requestion a new way for personnel matters,  including an extension of the retirement age and increase in pay  for bureaucrats.</p>

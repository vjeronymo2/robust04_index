			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Move to dismiss Names attacked as 'diabolical' The Lloyd's insurance market's relationship with new institutional investors could be damaged by Lloyd's agents who attempted earlier this year to dismiss some Names from their syndicates, a senior corporate financier said yesterday. The agents had acted in anticipation of new rules that guarantee Names continued participation in syndicates. Sir Laurie Magnus, deputy head of UK corporate finance at Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank, told a London conference on corporate capital that failure by agents to 'respect the spirit' of the new rules on pre-emption rights would be seen as 'diabolical' by the investment community. The rules are designed to allow the Names, whose assets support the market, to increase their participation in line with any overall increase in syndicate capacity. Pending introduction of the changes last May, eight agents are understood to have written to Names - both individual and corporate - giving them provisional notice, effectively cancelling their participation as of December 31 this year. Sir Laurie last year co-ordinated the launch of the London Market Investment Trust, the biggest of more than 12 new investment vehicles at the market. He said the action of the agents, which affects corporate as well as individual Names, put 'the credibility of the centre (the Lloyd's corporation which manages and regulates the market) at stake'. Corporate investors pressed hard for Lloyd's to introduce pre-emption rights last year, when they supplied more than Pounds 800m to support syndicates. Lloyd's syndicates obtain about 10 per cent of their capacity from corporate sources, but are seeking more funding as a result of the expected fall in the number of individual Names. Lloyd's last month, reported losses of Pounds 2bn for the 1991 year of account, under its three-year accounting system. This brought its cumulative deficit since 1988 to Pounds 7bn and is expected to force many individuals to leave the market. Sir Laurie said that most corporate investors were now focusing on new so-called 'dedicated' investment funds in which they would back syndicates managed by one agency. Last year most money was invested in trusts which support syndicates managed by a range of agencies. The change was partly due to investors beginning to understand Lloyd's and wanting to build closer links with syndicate managers.</p>

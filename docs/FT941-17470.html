			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Revised All-Share classification takes effect Today's stock market trading will be the first to be reported under the revised FT-SE Actuaries classification of industry sectors. The traditional All-Share categories have been given their first thorough overhaul in two decades, to yield sectors that more accurately reflect the shape of today's market. From tomorrow's edition, the new arrangement will also apply to the FT's share price listings, the London Share Service. Several hundred of the 3,000 or so securities on the page will change categories, and a number of sectors change their names. A full alphabetical listing of stocks from these pages, together with the new sectors in which they can be found is contained in a special two-page guide to the new classification, inside this issue. Details, Page 22 Lists, Page 28 and 29</p>

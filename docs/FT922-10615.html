			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Return to the black at Norsk Hydro NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest stock market listed company, swung back to profit in the 1992 first quarter, after a net loss of NKr498m (Dollars 77.3m) for the whole of 1991. Last year's result followed a restructuring. However, first quarter earnings, at NKr201m, were half the year-ago figure of NKr410m. Hydro blamed this on the inflationary effects of the Gulf war. Group operating revenue for the 1992 first quarter decreased by NKr265m to NKr15.96bn, as operating costs rose by NKr395m to NKr13.55bn. Group operating income was reduced by NKr766m to NKr1.04bn. Mr Egil Myklebust, president, said although first-quarter results were unsatisfactory, they were a clear improvement over last year's fourth quarter. Hydro explained that net income was influenced by the effects of a stronger dollar. The realised and unrealised effects of foreign exchange movements meant a loss of NKr470m, compared with a loss of NKr450m last year. The agriculture division saw operating income fall NKr331m to NKr195m, as operating revenue dipped NKr33m to NKr7.24bn. Hydro said European fertiliser prices increased along with sales volume. The oil and gas division reduced operating income by NKr27m to NKr738m, as operating revenue advanced NKr200m to NKr3.31bn. Oil and gas production rose to 2.2m tonnes of oil equivalent from 1.9m, but average crude oil prices per barrel fell. Light metals suffered a NKr313m plunge in operating income, to NKr89m, as operating revenue was cut NKr459m to NKr4.14bn. Hydro said the effect of the decline was partly offset by lower raw materials prices and higher smelter productivity. Petrochemicals saw operating income fall NKr106m to NKr96m due to lower prices.</p>

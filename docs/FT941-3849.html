			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bongrain improves 22% despite flat turnover Bongrain, one of France's largest cheese makers, yesterday announced net profits of FFr434m (Dollars 76m) for 1993, an increase of 22.5 per cent over the figure recorded in 1992. The rise in profits, which included an exceptional gain of FFr145m, was achieved on flat sales of FFr9.6bn. Operating profits were also relatively stable, rising by just over 1 per cent to FFr593m. Bongrain said that the operating result was achieved despite a difficult economic environment and without reducing long term investments. It reflected the effectiveness of cost cutting and productivity measures, according to the company. The group said that its strategy of expansion was continued during the year, with acquisitions in Hungary and the Czech republic.</p>

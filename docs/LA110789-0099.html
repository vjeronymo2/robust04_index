			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pepsi Logo Will Appear on Video Game: Next time the kids get thirsty while  playing Nintendo, Pepsi-Cola has a new ploy to get them to say Pepsi, please.  The soft-drink maker said the Pepsi logo will appear next year in a new,  animated electronic video game called "Magic Johnson's Fast Break." The game is  made by Tradewest, a licensee of Nintendo of America. The logo will appear  twice in the video game -- once in the game's opening title sequence, and later  as a court side sign in the animated basketball arena. Details of the agreement  were not disclosed.  </P></p>

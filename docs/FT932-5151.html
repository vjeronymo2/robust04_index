			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / HK airport talks make good start TALKS between Britain and China about financing Hong Kong's multi-billion dollar airport project, the first since October last year, got off to a good start yesterday, according to British officials. They said Chinese negotiators were beginning to get to grips with the issues of financing the HKDollars 164bn (Pounds 13.85bn) project, although signs from the first round of talks were not sufficient to convince them that Beijing wanted to settle the issue quickly. More than a month ago Hong Kong presented a third financial proposal to the Chinese which seeks to address Beijing's concerns about the mix of debt and equity in the project. This appears to have found favour with China. Hong Kong's plan to build a modern airport, a connecting railway, and other related projects has been a political football since it was announced in late 1989 in the wake of the Tiananmen incident in Beijing on June 4 of that year. Until recently it was thought to be hostage to the outcome of talks in Beijing about Hong Kong's political development. However, it appear that Beijing might have decided to decouple the economic aspects of the colony's development from its row with Britain about politics. Work has started on many of the project's nine core public works programmes, but failure to agree key elements of the financing has cast a cloud over the Hong Kong government's ability to build the airport proper, and the railway. By the end of this month funding for the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA), the body responsible for the airport and its operation, runs out. The government said yesterday it would go the Legislative Council, the local law making body, for HKDollars 564m later this month for funds for the PAA to cover operating costs until spring next year. In an encouraging development yesterday Mr Tong Galsworthy, Britain's chief representative to the Joint Liaison Group, the body charged with overseeing the transfer of Hong Kong to China, indicated that his Chinese opposite number had raised no objection to extra funding for the PAA.</p>

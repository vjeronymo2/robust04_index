			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAR PHONES  </P> <P> Recently, three of my co-workers were injured while returning from a seminar in  Los Angeles when a man talking on a car phone caused a four-vehicle rear-ender.  The man readily admitted that his attention was diverted by the phone call and  that not only was he not applying the brakes, he was accelerating at the time  of the collision.  </P> <P> I'm sure I'm not the only one who sees people every day who are chatting away  on their car phones, virtually oblivious to everything around them. It's  against the law now for a driver to be wearing headphones while driving. How  many more people are going to have to be injured before a law is enacted which  makes it illegal to be talking on a car phone while a vehicle is moving.?  </P> <P> We need to take action now!  </P> <P> JANET BRENNAN  </P> <P> Trabuco Canyon  </P></p>

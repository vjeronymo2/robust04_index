			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt and Paris differ on Buba cuts THE Bundesbank's surprise cut in discount and Lombard rates hit bourses at different times, and to different degrees yesterday afternoon, writes Our Markets Staff. French equities, the UK investors' choice in recent years, moved fast, and further than other senior bourses. Germany, intriguingly, seemed to be declining at one point in the afternoon, but ended with a late surge on American money. FRANKFURT saw the rate cuts before the official close but failed to react, the DAX index falling 6.88 to 2,035.68 on the session as German stock market turnover eased from DM9.8bn to DM9.5bn. In the post-bourse, however, the Ibis indicated DAX closed at 2,048.05. Mr Patrick Bettscheider, head of equity sales at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt, said that German fund managers had been sceptical about the effects of the rate cuts  - Deutsche Bank, down DM4.50 to DM833 at the official close, fell another DM3 to DM830 at one point  - but that US fund managers came in late in the day. The buying had been phenomenal, he said: 'I've seen bigger US orders for individual stocks recently than I've seen in the past for the whole market'. Post bourse recoveries took Deutsche Bank back up to around DM837, Siemens by DM4 to DM720.50 and Thyssen by DM6 to DM224. Hoechst fell DM6.10 to DM277.40 after announcing a slide of one-third in operating profits from its pharmaceuticals business. PARIS welcomed the news from Frankfurt with a gain in the CAC-40 index of 50.04 or 2.3 per cent to 2,199.72. Turnover was strong at an estimated FFr6bn. The Buba announcement at midsession was the news that French investors had been waiting for since it makes a cut in domestic interest rates imminent. Among financials, SocGen added FFr19 to FFr706, Suez FFr6.80 to FFr363.40 and UAP FFr29 to FFr660. BNP continued to attract buyers on news that it will be included in the CAC-40 index from next month, gaining FFr4.20 to FFr283.10. BSN rose FFr11 to FFr896 in spite of announcing a 3 per cent decline in turnover to the end of September after the close of trading on Wednesday. LVMH gained FFr55 to FFr3,778 as it announced that it was forming a joint venture with Guinness, its UK partner, to sell spirits in China. L'Oreal was up FFr24 at FFr1,209 and reported a rise in first half profit after the close. ZURICH was propelled higher by the Buba news in active trading. The Swiss National Bank quickly followed, cutting its discount rate by 0.25 of a percentage point to 4.25 per cent. In addition, the rise in the dollar triggered in part by the German rate cut also helped lift shares of companies with large exposures to the US currency. The SMI index finished 21.7 higher at 2,690.1, with Swissair SFr26 higher at SFr726, SBC up SFr14 at ASFr489, and Brown Boveri SFr14 higher at FFr990. AMSTERDAM built on early gains, and accelerated towards the close as the central bank announced that it would cut three key rates from today. The CBS Tendency index put on 1.8 or 1.3 per cent to 135.7. Nedlloyd was one of the day's biggest gainers, up Fl 4.60 at Fl 53.60, as a large block of shares unexpectedly came to the market and were quickly seized by foreign buyers. KLM put on 90 cents to Fl 43.40. The airline said that it was to integrate its cargo activities in the Netherlands with its US partner, Northwest Airlines. Ahold, the retailer, slightly lagged behind with a rise of 20 cents to Fl 93.60. Some brokers have recently turned sellers of the stock ahead of its third quarter results in December, partly because of a possible downtrend in sales in the US. MADRID was busy, turnover climbing another Pta4.6bn to Pta29.6bn as the general index rose 1.87 to 305.18. Traders said that the market did little until lunchtime and that, when it did, interest was still directed at the high yield electrical utilities, Endesa among them. Bank results left Santander and BBV more or less flat on figures below expectations but Argentaria, with a good progress report, Pta110 higher at Pta5,950. Endesa rose Pta130 to Pta6,130. MILAN was little moved by events elsewhere on the continent as investors remained depressed by the weight of rights issues coming on to the market in the current trading period. The Comit index rose 1.48 to 589.73. Olivetti rose L9 to L1,882 helped by interest in Cir, the industrial holding company, which gained L33 to L1,608. In telecommunications Sip and Stet went in opposite directions, the former adding L5 to L3,642 and the latter losing L4 to L4,134. Among the financials, Generali rose L26 to L39,676. STOCKHOLM was another beneficiary from the German rate cut with the Affarsvarlden general index gaining 25.80 or 1.8 per cent to 1,411.30 in turnover of SKr2.2bn. Ericsson B shares rose SKr8 to SKr448. COPENHAGEN was also stronger with Carlsberg seeing a gain of 2.6 per cent to DKr276 in good turnover of DKr70m. The KFX index closed up 1.10 at 103.05. Elsewhere, Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical group, added DKr5 to DKr635. ISTANBUL fell back 1 per cent as many investors remained uncertain as to the future direction of the market. The composite index lost 154.6 to 14,826.8.

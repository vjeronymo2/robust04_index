			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kuldip Nayar: "The Bilateral </F> Approach"--quotation marks as published]    [Text] Policy-makers in Islamabad are apparently unaware of  the sea-change in the Indian scene on Kashmir. After many years,  the people, the press and most political parties are in a mood  to have a settlement with Pakistan. They are generally on the  defensive whenever Kashmir crops up because they are not happy  over all that is happening in the valley.    On the other hand, never before had the government  considered  Kashmir a disputed territory as it has done now even in a  roundabout way. The Shimla Agreement, which is India's Bible on  Indo-Pak relations, specifically mentions a final settlement on  Jammu and Kashmir and New Delhi has adhered to the formulation.  Even after declaring from the ramparts of Red Fort on the  Independence Day that Kashmir is an integral part of lndia,  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao wrote a letter to Pakistan Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto proposing talks, including Kashmir as a  subject.    As promised in Islamabad during the abortive meeting between  the foreign secretaries of the two countries, New Delhi has sent  a package of six proposals to improve the relationship. They may  not be ideal ones. But they concede some ground, which can be  expanded.    In contrast, Pakistan's response has been hysterical. It has  declared a country-wide hartal [strike] for February 5. Benazir  Bhutto has already gone to the UN Human Rights Commission  accusing India of having committed excesses in Kashmir. And her  foreign minister has threatened a nuclear war if Kashmir is not  settled.    All this is familiar. This time the rhetoric is more shrill  than before. Otherwise, it is the same exercise which Islamabad  has gone over many a time.    Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the late Pakistan prime minister, too  had threatened a 1,000 year war. Yet the same Bhutto turned so  peace-loving that he not only agreed to convert the cease-fire  line into a line of control but also hailed it as `a line of  peace'. He signed the Shimla Agreement to consecrate a bilateral  approach. He said he was sick of going to the world chanceries  for help. After the 1965 and 1971 wars, he realised that he  would have to sit one day with India, across the same table, to  settle all disputes, including Kashmir.    Islamabad, under the leadership of his daughter, Benazir  Bhutto, has taken a different course. It has unilaterally  repudiated the Shimla Agreement. It has said that future  bilateral talks will be aimed at finalising 'the modalities for  holding plebiscite in Kash mir'. But clause Vl [Roman 6] of the  agreement had mentioned `the modalities' in connection with `the  establishment of durable peace and normalisation of relations,  including a final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir'. Nowhere does  plebiscite figure.    Assuming that Pakistan wants nothing but a plebiscite, it  surely realises what it is in for. While proposing plebiscite,  the UN had laid down certain conditions. One is that the entire  State of Jammu and Kashmir will come under the control of India.  This means that Pakistan will have to vacate not only `Azad  Kashmir' but also areas like Gilgit and Baltistan, which are now  its integral part. (China too will have to vacate the Kashmir  territory, which General Mohammad Ayub Khan had given to it in  1962).    Two, the armed forces of Pakistan will have to withdraw from  `Azad Kashmir', Gilgit and Baltistan, leaving behind only a  contingent of Indian forces to enforce law and order. Three,  normalcy in the State must return before a plebiscite is held.    It is difficult to imagine Islamabad complying with these  conditions. The people in Pakistan will never agree to the  handing over of `Azad Kashmir', Gilgit and Baltistan even  temporarily. And Pakistan should note that there is no  time-limit for normalcy to return.    New Delhi too cannot go back to plebiscite because it will  revive religious animosities. When a referendum in the North  West Frontier Province (NWFP) was held in 1947 to determine  whether it should go to India or Pakistan, the choice got  reduced to whether the Muslims wanted to vote for the Gita or  the Koran. India cannot afford to rip open old wounds. Its  battered secularism following the demolition of Babri Masjid  cannot withstand any more knocks.    Both countries face a difficult situation. I am reminded of  what Jawaharlal Nehru told Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in London in  November 1961: "Zulfi, I know that we must find a solution for  Kashmir. But we have got caught in a situation which we cannot  get out of without causing damage to the systems and structures  of our respective societies."    Another development which has taken place in the last few  years is that the Kashmiris want independence. When India and  Pakistan agreed to a plebiscite in 1948, the choice was confined  to joining either India or Pakistan. Islamabad has repeatedly  said that it wants the Kashmiris to decide about their future.  Will it agree to the third option? And, is an independent  Kashmir a tenable proposition? After all, the Maharaja of Jammu  and Kashmir wanted his state to be independent after the British  left but failed in his endeavour. Pakistan never accepted the  idea.    The only solution possible is a settlement which may  displease all the three, India, Pakistan and Kashmir, but may go  some way in assuaging their sensitivities. One proposal is to  soften the line of control so that the bona fide nationals of  the state living in Kashmir and `Azad Kashmir' become one  people. They should enjoy autonomy except in defence and foreign  affairs. Both subjects should continue to vest in India and  Pakistan in their respective parts of Jammu and Kashmir.    The nationals of India and Pakistan should be able to visit  the state by getting a visa -- the Indian citizens from  Islamabad to go to `Azad Kashmir' and the Pakistanis from New  Delhi to visit Kashmir. This arrangement is not an ideal one but  it may enable the people on both sides to meet more often at  least in Kashmir. It is quite possible that one day the high  walls that fear and distrust have raised on the border will  crumble and the people of the subcontinent, without giving up  their separate identities, will work together for the common  good.  *</p>

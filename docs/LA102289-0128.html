			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RACIAL TENSIONS FLARE IN DISTRICT WHERE ETHNIC MAKEUP IS CHANGING  </P> <P> In the last 10 to 15 years, the ethnic makeup of the Centinela Valley Union  High School District has changed dramatically. For example, in 1976 the  district had about 7,000 students and was 65% white, 21% Latino, 7% Asian, 6%  black and 1% American Indian or Alaskan.  </P> <P> Today, the district is 52% Latino, 19% white, 17% black, 8% Asian and 4%  American Indian or Alaskan. Eighty-one percent of the teaching staff and 64% of  the administrative staff is white.  </P> <P> McKinley Nash, who became superintendent of the district in 1984, said he has  worked to recruit and promote black, Latino and Asian administrators, including  two black high school principals.  </P> <P> However, in recent months there have been several examples of racial tension  between members of the predominantly white teaching staff and minority  administrators. During a press conference Oct. 13, Nash said the district  "enjoys unusual racial harmony," yet he cited several racial incidents, which  he attributed to a handful of teachers who are having difficulty accepting  minority administrators.  </P> <P> * In April, administrators confiscated a black mannequin from a Hawthorne High  School teacher who said he was using it to teach makeup techniques to a  literature class. The mannequin, which is timeworn and has exaggerated  features, was criticized by Nash as being inflammatory.  </P> <P> * Also in April, Charles Prater, a black English teacher at Hawthorne High  School, received a threatening note in his mailbox after he asked  administrators to include at least one book by a minority author on the English  reading list.  </P> <P> * In September, Nancy Nuesseler, president of the Centinela Valley Secondary  Teachers Assn., referred to Nash as a "Stepin Fetchit," referring to a black  character in early 1930s films who fawned over his white bosses. In an  interview last week, Nuesseler said she did not intend the comment to be racist  and that she apologized for it at a meeting of teachers representatives. Hugo  Martin  </P></p>

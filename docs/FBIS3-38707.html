			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] With the rally that took place this morning in  Rome and with the unveiling of his manifesto, Silvio Berlusconi  officially entered the world of politics. He said that he  wanted to defeat the Left by allying himself with all the  moderate forces. He does not exclude Umberto Bossi or  Gianfranco Fini. He is convinced that he is the only one capable  of relaunching the Italian economy. Let us hear what he says.    [Unidentified correspondent] Moderates from all over Italy  are united in defeating the Left. This is the cry with which  Berlusconi is leading his Forza Italia troops in the hard  electoral battle. The enemy to defeat is the Left and the  Liberals, and his allies are all the moderate forces that draw  their inspiration from liberal-democratic politics. However,  and this is perhaps Berlusconi's weak point, he wants to draw in  the Right in the form of Fini and Bossi, who have nothing to do  with the liberal-democratic tradition. The messages of  Berlusconi are clear and direct and they are spread by an  imposing propaganda machine. Berlusconi said that Forza Italia  was born out of the desire of common people to turn a page, of  wanting to restore solidity and usefulness to politics. Enough  with professional politicians, Berlusconi said, what is needed  are new people anchored to civil society.    The values that Berlusconi referred to were the classic ones  of Western culture -- liberty, the individual, enterprise, the  family, and the Christian tradition. In contrast to Bossi,  although the two men are recent allies, Berlusconi considers the  unity of Italy to be inviolable. The manifesto of the new  movement aims to combat crime and to create new jobs.    [Begin Berlusconi recording] To the unemployed today we can  say, we can guarantee that these concerns will end, that we know  how to relaunch the Italian economy. [end recording]    [Correspondent] Berlusconi does not like the nanny-state  that  he says, keeps over half of incomes. Therefore, less taxation  and a spirited defense of the self-employed.

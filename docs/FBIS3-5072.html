This marks its single biggest commitment in a direct  investment fund so far. Called AIG Asian Infrastructure Fund  L.P., the fund could eventually reach U.S.$1 billion in three to  four months, when more subscribers are drawn in, officials said.    Singapore's investment is being made through the Government  of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), which has contributed  U.S.$200 million, and Temasek Holdings, which has injected  U.S.$50 million. This makes a total of U.S.$250 million (S$400  million). "This will be the single biggest commitment and direct  investment for GIC and Temasek," GIC's deputy managing director,  Dr Teh Kok Peng, said yesterday, following the fund's  contract-signing ceremony.    The other major investor in the fund is American  International Group (AIG), which has committed U.S.$100 million  through its wholly-owned subsidiary American International  Reinsurance Company.    The partners hope to attract other Singapore investors, who  must contribute a minimum of U.S.$10 million each.    The fund has already caught the interest of major American  pension and endowment funds, which account for most of the  remaining U.S.$411 million invested. Subscribers include General  Electric Co, the University of California and Princeton  University.    China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic)  -- one of Beijing's biggest conglomerates -- has invested  U.S.$25 million. State-owned Citic and the Bank of China will  give advice on the fund's investments in China.    GIC and Temasek will co-manage the fund through their  newly-set up affiliate, Singa Infrastructure Management. The  other co-manager is AIG.    Pakistan's former caretaker prime minister and ex-World Bank  chief of operations, Mr Moin Qureshi, will be the fund's chief  financial adviser. It is believed that Mr Qureshi's credentials  helped persuade the Singapore Government to participate in the  fund, when it was approached initially by AIG several months  ago. Another factor was the high potential financial returns.    As much as half of the fund is expected to go to projects in  China. The balance will be invested in Indonesia, Malaysia, the  Philippines Taiwan and Thailand. However, other Asian countries  may receive up to one-fifth of the fund. Said Mr Qureshi  yesterday: "China and ASEAN offer the most attractive  opportunities for foreign investment over the next decade."    The fund will focus on power, telecommunications and  transportation projects. It can, however, invest in other  resource developments, property or environmental services  projects.    Officials said they hoped to give investors a 20-25 percent  return on equity. The 10-year fund is allowed to invest up to  U.S.$80 million in any single project.    The fund is considering investing in projects in Thailand  and  China first. China alone is forecast to need between U.S.$55  billion and $60 billion to develop its power facilities. Asia's  cash-starved infrastructure sector has emerged as a red- hot  investment target for global funds.    In early February, billionaire financier George Soros's  Quantum Industrial Holdings teamed up with GE Capital to set up  a U.S.$2.5 billion global fund for power projects. Mr Soros had  also announced plans to link up with Hong Kong brokerage  Peregrine Investment to launch a U.S.$1 billion Asian  Infrastructure Fund. Officials said the success of these  infrastructure funds could spark off a flow of capital into the  region on an unprecedented scale.</p>

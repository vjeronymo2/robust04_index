			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Ports sold off short, say MPs The government failed to obtain the best price for five ports sold to the private sector in 1992, a cross-party committee of MPs found yesterday. The sale agreements also failed to take sufficient account of the interests of employees who were encouraged to buy shares in their companies, according to a report by the Commons public accounts committee. The trust ports of Tees and Hartlepool, Clyde, Forth, Medway and the Port of London were sold for Pounds 380m of which Pounds 169m went in the form of a levy to the government. The committee said it was concerned that in two of the five sales the price reached was below the lower benchmark valuation which had been made. The upper benchmark was achieved in only one of the sales. It was 'particularly concerned' that Medway was sold for Pounds 29.7m, little more than three quarters of the lower benchmark, and then resold 18 months later for Pounds 103m to Mersey Docks. This second sale led to the management and their backers making a far greater profit than the taxpayer on privatisation. There were also delays in collecting the government's share of these disposals which cost the taxpayer Pounds 4.5m, the committee found. This delay arose partly because of disputes with two of the ports about whether certain expenses were deductible. The committee urged the government to consider ways of inserting binding undertakings into agreements reached for any future sales to ensure that bidders stood by promises made to the workforce. The Port of Medway reduced its workforce from 688 to 260 in spite of an earlier statement from its management that it would maintain the terms and conditions of the employees at the existing level. Employees who lost their jobs were required to sell back shares worth Pounds 35 for only Pounds 2.50. 'We are surprised that the re-sale value of the shares was not covered in the sale agreement,' the committee said. It called for the government to consider introducing a clawback on increases in the value of shares where the increase resulted from the buyer's failure to meet undertakings given at the time of the sale. The reduction in the Medway workforce and the forced sale of employees' shares made a significant difference to profitability. Department of Transport: The First Sales of Trust Ports. HMSO.

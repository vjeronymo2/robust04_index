			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: CBOT to reconsider bund future sole rights THE CHICAGO Board of Trade, one of the partners in Globex, the global electronic trading system, is prepared to reconsider its position on retaining sole rights to trade bund futures on the system, CBOT chairman Mr Pat Arbor said yesterday. Last month, the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange pulled out of negotiations to join Globex when the CBOT insisted on its exclusive rights. Reuter and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CBOT's two Globex partners, subsequently blamed the CBOT for Liffe's withdrawal in a series of acrimonious letters. Mr Arbor told a press conference at the Swiss Commodities Futures and Options Association's annual meeting in Burgenstock, Switzerland: 'You might view this as an invitation to reopen negotiations.' However, he also insisted that there had been no fundamental change in the CBOT's position and emphasised that two other issues - the governance of Globex and the length of any contract between Globex and Liffe - would have to be resolved first. On this matter there seems to a difference of opinion between Mr Arbor and Mr Jack Sandner, chairman of both the CME and Globex. Mr Sandner said that the main stumbling block to an agreement with Liffe was the Bund contract issue. Liffe officials have expressed the same view, saying that progress has been made on the other issues. Mr Arbor said the length of Liffe's commitment was a crucial issue. France's Matif, the only exchange to have joined Globex since its launch over a year ago, agreed to a 12 1/2 -year commitment, while Liffe was asking for just a 1 1/2 -year contract, he said. Nevertheless, Mr Arbor seemed to be adopting a more positive stance, saying 'it's my feeling that we would be favourably disposed to giving up exclusivity' if the other issues were resolved.</p>

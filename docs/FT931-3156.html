			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Spanish inflation falls to 4.7% SPAIN'S year-on-year inflation rate has fallen to 4.7 per cent, its lowest level since June 1988, the consumer price index for January published yesterday showed. The January statistics, which were held over for a month while the index's weighting was overhauled, showed a CPI rise of just 0.9 per cent. Figures for February, which will be published next week, are expected to bring the 12-month inflation rate down to below 4.5 per cent. Domestic inflation began to peak in the third quarter of last year: Spain's GDP registered a negative growth over the last three months of 1992, - 0.2 per cent, and the CPI ended last year with a rise of 5.4 per cent that was marginally down on the December 1991 figure. The markets had expected the recession to be reflected by a fast fall in the inflation rate at the start of this year. Underlying inflation, which does not include the more volatile prices of non-processed foods and energy, fell by slightly less than the headline rate, to come down from 6.9 per cent at the end of December to 6.5 per cent in January. The lower inflation rate, which is a direct result of the slump in domestic demand, has fuelled hopes for a cut in the official intervention rate early next week at the Bank of Spain's routine repurchase tender for its certificates of deposit. Such expectations will be all the higher should the Bundesbank ease interest rates tomorrow.</p>

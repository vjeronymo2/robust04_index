			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / International Company News: Radio Marconi ahead midway Companhia Portuguesa Radio Marconi, Portugal's intercontinental telecommunications operator, yesterday announced a 15.2 per cent rise in net consolidated profits to Es2.2bn (Dollars 14m) for the first half of 1994, due mainly to a 16 per cent increase in traffic. Operating profits, buoyed by cost containment, rose 123.8 per cent to Es8.3bn. However, Marconi registered a financial loss of Es1.4bn compared with a profit of Es533m in the first half of 1993. The company attributed this to the negative results of telecommunication holdings, particularly Telecomunicacoes Moveis Nacionais, a mobile telephone operator of which Marconi owns 33 per cent. TMN's sales increased 48 per cent to Es9.3bn in the first half and the five-year-old company is forecast to show a profit next year. Marconi, which is 51 per cent state-owned, is expected to be brought into Portugal Telecom, the state telecommunications group, before 25 to 30 per cent of PT is privatised nextyear.</p>

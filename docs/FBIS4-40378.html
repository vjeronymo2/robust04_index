			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The state of affairs in Russia's economy is normal  and whatever kind of market has been formed, the state's  intervention in market relations has been minimal. This was  stated today at a news conference by the heads of the  government's Economic Reform Center. According to them,  inflation over the last couple of months has remained at a low  level -- 8 percent. However, there are certain trends toward it  increasing. The ruble has been losing its value at a slower  rate than prices have been rising, and the average wage has  moved closer -- calculated in foreign currency -- to $100.    Meanwhile, according to the Economic Reform Center, there  remains a considerable fall in output in the machine-building  and fuel and power complex. The failure of enterprises to make  payments are not too good, either. Their debts on wages remain  high. However, according to Richard Yard, an economist from  Britain, this type of nonpayment was reduced by 4 percent  compared with April. Moreover, according to Yard, the overdue  debts of enterprises are lower than the European average. The  London economist noted that in the sphere of employment among  the Russian population, as nowhere else in the world, the  redistribution of the working people in production outstrips  open unemployment. And the latter in our country increased by  only 1 percent during the past 18 months.    The most comforting news was given by Sergey Pavlenko, a  spokesman for the Economic Reform Center. Among the population,  faith in financial institutions has increased. The citizens'  savings are growing not in hard currency, but in rubles.</p>

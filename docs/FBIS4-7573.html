			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 30/3/1994 -- [passage  omitted] Romania's stance on the North Korean nuclear file was  presented at today's news conference of the Romanian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs by Simona Miculescu, deputy to the ministry's  spokesman.    The statement shows that Romania's attitude to this issue  derives from its position as party to the treaty of  non-proliferation of nuclear arms, and that by joining this  treaty the People's Democratic Republic of Korea voluntarily  assumed to strictly, unconditionally abide by the international  commitments to this end.    "We find it in the interest of security and peace in the  Korean peninsula that the DPRK complies with the regulations of  the guarantee agreement concluded with the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA], including inspections of the North-Korean  nuclear plants. At the same time, it is obvious that to reach  this target the direct negotiations between United States and  the DPRK have to be resumed, as well as the dialogue between the  North and South of Korea, a prime component of which should be  the issue of denuclearising the Korean peninsula.    "The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pronounces for  steps apt to favor such processes, which would contribute to  defusing tension in the Korean peninsula, and for a negotiated  settlement of the issues raised by the North Korean nuclear  file," the Romanian Foreign Ministry's statement says.</p>

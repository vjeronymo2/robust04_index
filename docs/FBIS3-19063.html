			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] So far, only Great Britain has  responded positively to the UN request to send more soldiers to  Bosnia. In Sweden there are discussions to move the Swedish  company in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] to  Bosnia. This could take place quickly, but there are several  problems; among other things, the Swedish UN soldiers must  accept to serve in Bosnia. They have been sent on a  peacekeeping mission in the FYROM and in Bosnia they will risk  ending up in conflicts.    [Correspondent Boerje Remdahl] The question on whether to  move the Swedish UN unit from FYROM to Bosnia is currently being  studied by the government. The military headquarters have not  yet received instructions to prepare the transfer of the troops  there. Sweden, Norway, and Finland all have their rifle company  and service and staff personnel in FYROM, and the redeployment  now spoken about concerns the 250 Swedes, among others. The  soldiers will be allowed to decide for themselves whether they  want to serve in Bosnia. The task in FYROM that they signed up  for is a peacekeeping contribution, while serving in Bosnia  includes the risk of ending up in conflicts, despite the fact  that there now is a cease-fire to monitor. [passage omitted]    The transfer of the Swedish company, or the whole battalion,  can take place quickly provided that Sweden, Norway, and Finland  can agree. It might be more difficult for Finland than for  Sweden and Norway to send its soldiers from FYROM to Bosnia,  because the Finnish Government does not accept participation in  any other UN tasks than strictly peacekeeping operations.  [passage omitted]    Swedish Defense Minister Anders Bjoerck says that he expects  a meeting of Nordic defense ministers to take place in a few  days to discuss the UN's wishes to transfer the FYROM battalion  to control the cease-fire in Bosnia. The tasks in FYROM can  possibly be taken over by U.S. UN units.</p>

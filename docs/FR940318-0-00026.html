			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section by Section Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a section by section analysis of each provision of SBA's regulations that is affected by this final rule: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs 121.1102(a) and 124.112(c)(2) are amended to take into account the statutory amendments to the Small Business Act regarding affiliation of tribally-owned 8(a) concerns made by Section 204 of the Small Business Administration Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2814, 2819. This statute specifies that, in determining the size of a small business concern owned by a socially and economically disadvantaged Indian tribe (or a wholly owned business entity of such tribe) for either 8(a) program entry or contract award, each firm's size shall be determined independently without regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of the tribal government, or any other business enterprise owned by the tribe, unless the Administrator determines that one or more such tribally-owned business concerns have obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair competitive advantage within an industry category. Prior to this statutory change, ownership by an Indian tribe, by itself, would not cause SBA to determine an 8(a) applicant/concern to be affiliated with the tribe or other entities owned by the tribe. Affiliation with other tribally-owned entities could have been caused by circumstances other than common tribal ownership (for example, affiliation through common management or common facilities). The two relevant paragraphs of SBA's regulations (one in the size regulations and one in the 8(a) regulations) are amended to provide for the statutory change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs 121.906(b)(3) (for small business set aside contracts) and 121.1106(b)(3) (for 8(a) contracts) are amended to provide for a second exception to SBA's nonmanufacturer rule. The nonmanufacturer rule requires that, for a supply contract, a small business that is not itself the manufacturer of the items being procured must supply the product of a small business manufacturer. SBA's regulations previously provided for an exception to this requirement where there are no small business manufacturers or processors in the Federal market. Section 210 of Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2814, 2821, amended the Small Business Act to authorize a second exception where the Administrator accepts a determination by the contracting officer that no small business manufacturer or processor reasonably can be expected to offer a product meeting the specifications (including period for performance) required of an offeror by the solicitation. The regulations are amended to incorporate this statutory change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 124.107 is amended to take into account the statutory amendments to SBA's two-year in business rule made by Section 203 of the Small Business Administration Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2818&hyph;19. The statutory criteria for waiver of the two-year rule are repeated in this final rule. In addition, the rule clarifies that, if an applicant concern has performed only government contracts or only private sector contracts, the applicant's performance on those contracts alone will be reviewed to determine whether the applicant possesses a record of successful performance. This implementation avoids the possible interpretation that a waiver is available only to those concerns that have successfully performed both public and private sector contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 124.111(a)(2)(ii) is amended to correct a typographical error. The paragraph speaks of maintaining eligibility in the transitional stage of Program Participation, but cross references to information on the developmental stage of Program Participation. This final rule amends the cross reference to refer to the transitional stage of Program Participation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraphs 124.112(a)(1) and 124.112(c) are amended to include a reference to entities which are themselves owned by wholly-owned business entities of Indian tribes, in accord with section 204(b) of Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2819. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph 124.112(a)(3) is amended to eliminate the regulatory provision requiring SBA to determine whether a specific ANC is economically disadvantaged. Section 10 of the Alaska Land Status Technical Corrections Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;415, 106 Stat. 2112, 2115, amended Section 29(e) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1626(e)) to provide as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

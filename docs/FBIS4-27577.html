			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam,  during his tour of Russia and Uzbekistan that starts June 1,  will be accompanied by six businessmen as guests at  economy-related events.    Chairmen Kim U-chung of the Daewoo Business Group, Cho  Sok-nae of Hyosung Group, Ku Pyong-hoe of Lucky-Goldstar Group  and concurrently head of the Korea Foreign Trade Association  (KFTA), and Chang Chi-hyok of Kohap Group, as well as presidents  of smaller businesses -- Wang Ho-sang of Dongho International  and Kim Yun-sik of Shindong Enercom Inc. -- will arrive  separately in Moscow but travel aboard the president's plane to  Uzbekistan due to poor air transportation there.    It is the first time for businessmen to travel with Kim on  his chartered plane.    "We weren't planning to invite businessmen on this tour, but  we finally decided to include six businessmen whose companies  have made inroads in Russia and Uzbekistan to attend only  economy-related events there at the request of the two  countries," a Chongwadae (presidential office) official said.    Just as some businessmen arrived separately to attend  economy-related functions during Kim's visits to Japan and  China, the business representatives will only take part in these  events, he said.</p>

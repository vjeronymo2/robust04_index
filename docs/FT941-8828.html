			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rise fades as inflation data awaited Wall Street US share prices posted modest gains yesterday in a lacklustre session highlighted by news of a Dollars 6bn contract for two US defence contractors, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 9.00 up at 3,937.27, some way below its session peak of 3,949.65. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 edged 0.27 higher to 472.79, while the Nasdaq composite added 2.50 at 792.62. Trading volume on the New York SE was 295m shares. Equities rose from the opening bell, thanks in part to the stability of the dollar. After big losses earlier in the week tied to concern about the possible outbreak of a trade war with Japan, the US currency held steady at about Y103.80 yesterday. Bonds, which had also been rattled by the trade dispute, were similarly becalmed, with the benchmark 30-year government issue showing little change on the day. Activity in the bond market was listless as traders awaited today's all-important inflation data. Analysts expect the January consumer price index to show a gain of about 0.3 per cent. Anything below that should boost share prices, but if consumer prices are seen to have moved substantially higher last month, fears that the Federal Reserve might put up short-term interest rates would resurface. It was concern about that possibility which kept some equity investors on the sidelines yesterday, and limited the stock market's advance. The biggest development of the day was the announcement that McDonnell Douglas and Boeing would split a Dollars 6bn order for commercial jets from Saudi Arabia. Boeing climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 46 1/2 on the news. The stock also benefited from Tuesday's announcement from the aircraft manufacturer that it planned to increase its monthly production of 767s. McDonnell Douglas, meanwhile, rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 118 7/8 . Hewlett-Packard was another of the session's stars, advancing Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 89 1/8 in volume of 2.6m shares after the computer manufacturer announced fiscal first-quarter net income of Dollars 368m, up from Dollars 261m a year earlier. The good news from Hewlett-Packard lifted other technology stocks. Motorola surged Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 104 1/2 in the wake of US threats to impose trade sanctions on Japan if Tokyo refused to give better market access to the company's cellular telephones. Many of the best performing blue chip issues in recent weeks had strong outings. 3M was Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 109 1/2 , Alcoa advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 79 5/8 and United Technologies climbed Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 71. On the Nasdaq market, QVC continued to rise following its defeat in the Paramount bid battle, adding Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 51 1/2 . Canada Toronto received a late boost from a recovery in the precious metals sub-sector and ended a sluggish session mildly firmer. An analyst said there were 'spotty areas of strength elsewhere - forest products, base metals - but the market is still showing some signs of hesitancy going into February 22' (the budget). The TSE 300 index gained 9.7 at 4,424.1. Turnover was 67.37m shares valued at CDollars 774m and rises and falls were almost equal at 406 to 405.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Even as another elephant in the North Bengal forests  is suspected to have fallen prey to the dreaded disease,  anthrax, veterinary doctors and wildlife officials are divided  over the cause of the recent deaths.    The carcass of an elephant was found in south Raidak on  Friday. Wildlife officials suspect it to be the fifth victim of  the disease.    The differences surfaced with the district veterinary  doctors  maintaining that no "Bacillus anthraxcis" could be  traced in the blood of the last three victims.    The wildlife officials were however, more than certain that  external symptoms showed evidence of the pachyderms being  affected with anthrax. Not satisfied with the findings of the  district veterinary doctors, they arranged to send blood samples  to Calcutta for re-examination.    The veterinary doctors' attempt to rule out an anthrax  attack  was not without reason. With signs of the disease still  spreading and taking its toll, there was an increasing  possibility of the doctors being criticized for having failed to  give advance warning.    The wildlife officials said that had there been the  slightest  indication of the disease, immunization programmes could have  been taken up in right earnest and the casualties could be  restricted. Even last year, the Forest Department undertook  immunization programmes.</p>

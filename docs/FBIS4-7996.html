			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F> Serbian Krajina, by Jovo Paripovic; place and date not given:  "We Are Asking Nothing of Croatia!"]    [Text] That he changed the camouflage uniform for a suit,  put on a tie, entered the preelection race, and then took the  chair of president of the so-called republic of Serbian Krajina,  Milan Martic accounts for by the fact that the "latest elections  in the republic of Serbian Krajina were a significant step in  actualizing its statehood," but, as in all other elections,  "politicians and parties appeared whose ultimate wish was to  seize power," which, according to Martic, means that this  "desire for power can go beyond the global national interests,"  which made him avert all this and prevent these "careerists"  from seizing power. So much for his attitude toward the taking  of the presidential seat, and as far as concerns the "strategic  orientation," which "will never be given up," according to Milan  Martic, it is "a historical task, with which the Serbs in the  republic of Serbian Krajina should secure the same rights as the  Slovenes, Croats, and other nations on the territories of the  former Yugoslavia have been given."  <H5>  Milosevic Is a Politician of International Caliber </H5>   [Paripovic] Did the fact that you are Slobodan Milosevic's  man, which you admitted yourself, help your "victory" after the  elections were repeated?    [Martic] It is correct that I once said I was Slobodan  Milosevic's man. That cannot be interpreted as some blind  obedience or subjection. I am Slobodan Milosevic's man to the  extent to which we are both dedicated to the historical task of  establishing Serb national interests. The president of Serbia  has become a politician of international caliber, respected by  the international factors that participate in the resolving of  the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Not even  the greatest Serb-haters and his opponents can dispute that.  Not even opposition leaders, such as Vuk Draskovic, attack  Slobodan Milosevic any more, because it is no longer popular  even abroad, let alone in Serbia and the republic of Serbian  Krajina. My relation toward the president of Serbia is clear,  but I think that did not have a crucial impact on the results of  the elections.    [Paripovic] How do you account for the sudden change of the  voters' decision to your benefit?    [Martic] In the first round my opposing candidate Milan  Babic won more votes only because there was no control in that  round. In the second round we established the control mechanism  and ensured that the voting was regular.    Milan Babic has an extremely bad political rating in Serbia,  and this he can primarily ascribe to the tactless actions and  statements with which he seriously endangered the unity of the  Serb people.  <H5>  Nothing Behind Knin's Back </H5>   [Paripovic] You talk of Babic's bad rating in Serbia, but  the elections were not held in Serbia. There is no doubt that  your nomination was aided by a shameless soliciting of the votes  of certain members of the SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia]  leadership who are close to Milosevic.    [Martic] Babic's prediction was that the opposition would  win in Serbia, and he gave verbal support to the opposition  several times before the elections. That is normal. However,  this is why he could not expect the support of the authorities  in Serbia. In fact, both of us received the support of those  who saw the similarity between their political programs and ours.    [Paripovic] What condition is the economy of the "Krajina"  in, and what is the social situation of its citizens? There is  talk of the economy and the citizens being exhausted, of poverty.    [Martic] It is understandable that the economic situation in  the state, after several years of war, is difficult. At the  same time, we are waging a war, building the state institutions,  and trying to revive the industrial and agricultural production.  However, the situation is not nearly what it is believed to be.    [Paripovic] Goran Hadzic, your predecessor, has again raised  the issue of the justifiability of the unification of Slavonia,  Baranja, and western Srem with the so-called Knin Krajina,  adding that it was a formal unification, and he has asked how  justifiable it was to send aid to Knin "when there is no one  there who is not too lazy to unload it." Could you comment on  that?    [Martic] I am not familiar with these statements by Goran  Hadzic, but I think that they are not important. He is the  former president of the state, who, I deeply believe, was not  suited for the job he was entrusted with. I really do not want  to comment on his statements, as I do not consider them to have  any political importance.    [Paripovic] All right. May I remind you of Jovan Opacic's  statement, according to which Serbia "is making a colony out of  Krajina," which Opacic called creating an "Indian reservation,"  and Serbia's attitude an "anti-Serb act"?    [Martic] The process of the integration of the Serb lands,  which has assumed its latest dimensions with the establishment  of a unitary monetary system, a unitary market and economy, can  certainly not be called by that name. I believe other steps  will be taken in the upcoming period, after which the issue of  unification will really be sheer formality.    [Paripovic] How do you see the normalization of the  relations between Serbia and Croatia, and the signing of the  Joint Statement in Geneva? According to certain estimates, this  normalization was done "behind Knin's back," while some have  interpreted Slobodan Milosevic's statement that the relations  between Croatia and the so-called republic of Serbian Krajina  should be resolved directly by the negotiators of these two  sides as "Belgrade's giving up on the republic of Serbian  Krajina."    [Martic] The normalization of the relations between the  FRY and Croatia represents quite a normal and logical factor in  the context of the strengthening peace initiatives for resolving  the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. If this  normalization contributes to resolving peacefully the conflicts  between Krajina and Croatia, that is, through political means,  we will welcome it. I see nothing there that could make the  position of the republic of Serbian Krajina more difficult, and  nothing that could have been done "behind Knin's back." The  statement of the president of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic is in  fact a confirmation of our position that only representatives of  the republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia can discuss any  disputable issues. In order to establish negotiations, it is  necessary for Croatia to stop the constant attacks on the  republic of Serbian Krajina, that is, it is necessary to  establish a permanent cease-fire.  <H5>  Demarcation Is the Way to Peace </H5>   [Paripovic] According to some political analysts, you are a  man who will only carry out, on the side of the so-called  republic of Serbian Krajina, what is possibly arranged with Mr.  Tudjman.    [Martic] We will insist on the negotiations being held on an  equal basis and on the principle of reciprocity. I see no  reason why such a dialogue should not be established, as I see  no way of resolving the disputes in another way. We are  prepared to discuss the economic and communication problems of  both sides, as well as of the demarcation between the republic  of Serbian Krajina and Croatia. I believe that is the best and  fastest way of reaching the normalization of relations very soon.    [Paripovic] In your statement: "Martic will exist as long as  there is Knin, and Krajina will exist as long as I do" many have  recognized the position that war with Croatia is inevitable.    [Martic] Our orientation is peace, not war. We have no  reason to attack Croatia if the other side accepts the peace  option. However, the experience we have had so far has taught us  that there is an extremely militarist atmosphere in Croatia, and  that the leading HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] regime thus  suppresses the social and political tensions. This is why we  have no illusions about the real intentions of the Croatian  authorities. We are prepared to convince them that they will  not be able to solve a single thing with a war against Krajina,  and that sooner or later they will have to sit at the  negotiating table with us. Another of Croatia's great delusions  is that Germany will do the job for them. All these delusions  lead to a long, exhausting war, which will bring neither side  any good.    [Paripovic] What is the lower limit in the negotiations and  the arrangement of relations with Croatia; how far will your  side go?    [Martic] As far as the relations between the republic of  Serbian Krajina and Croatia are concerned, I have already said  that there was no reason for them not to improve in the future.  In fact, we are asking nothing of Croatia. We expect the  international community only to give us what it has already  given the Croats, Slovenes, and Macedonians, that is, the right  to self-determination. We are prepared to hold a referendum in  the Krajina, most strictly controlled by the international  community, on whether our people want to live in Croatia, and  that is the limit below which we will not go.  <H5>  The United States Has Imposed It </H5>   [Paripovic] How do you see the Croat-Muslim agreement?    [Martic] As far as the agreement between the Croats and  Muslims in the former Bosnia is concerned, clearly that is  something the United States has imposed, and something that is  far from reality. That marriage was made out of interest, and I  do not believe in it, especially after everything that has  happened. As far as possible repercussions are concerned, they  are not insignificant, but I do not think they can have a  significant impact on the position of the republic of Serbian  Krajina.</p>

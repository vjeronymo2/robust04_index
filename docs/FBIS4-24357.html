			<p>BFN     [Text] The federal office of the Union of Independent  Democrats [UDI] at Matonge in the Kalamu Area was the target of  a terrorist attack in the night of 24 June. A locally made bomb  set in the building exploded. There was no loss of human lives  but property damage has been reported. This was disclosed by  Mr. (Tambo Mwamba), UDI national chairman. He was speaking this  morning at a news briefing he held before reporters of  state-owned and private media organs. The speaker said this is  the fourth time his party has been the victim of acts of  violence. He observed that his party has sufficient material  means to react, but in a democracy people must express views and  discuss or advance convincing arguments. It is not advisable to  resort to violence in the event of disagreement on a viewpoint,  UDI Chairman (Tambo Mwamba) concluded, adding that he is looking  forward to the findings of the inquiry on the bomb attack [words  indistinct].</p>

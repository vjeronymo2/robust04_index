			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Dubai (5): A stimulating environment - Nicholas Hills takes a look at business law in Dubai THE UAE is an interesting business legal environment because of the interface between the federal (UAE) legislation and regulations in force in individual emirates, including, of course, Dubai. The law is embodied in codified decrees published in either the Federal or individual emirates' Official Gazettes, which then need application and interpretation in the context of an active and established commercial environment. Businesses in Dubai are required to comply with federal legislation as well as Dubai's own regulations, which are designed to attract responsible and appropriate foreign businesses to Dubai, which itself has become a significant regional centre. In 1993, the Dubai government has established the Economic Department, which now looks after, controls and facilitates the registration of businesses in the Emirate of Dubai (other than in the Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZ). The JAFZ has its own individual registration and licensing requirements and operates under its own enabling legislation: an interesting recent development at JAFZ has been the introduction in 1992 of a single-shareholder limited-liability entity known as a Free Zone Establishment (FZE). While there are considerable advantages and incentives in setting up in JAFZ, many businesses still opt (or require) to establish outside JAFZ in Dubai itself. There are a variety of ways - many not mutually exclusive - in which a foreign business may operate in or into Dubai under the auspices of the Commercial Companies Law, some of whose provisions are at the moment under review, or under the Commercial Agencies Law. Care and advice needs to be taken over selecting how to establish. Outside JAFZ, with very few exceptions, some local connection ( a sponsor, agent or partner) is required. As a general rule, limited companies established with foreign investment need 51 per cent local participation. By far the most interesting prospective legal development in the UAE (and in particular in Dubai as a commercial and financial centre) is the imminent introduction of the Commercial Transaction Law, which will need to be considered very closely in parallel with the existing civil law. In the vibrant mercantile environment of Dubai, the introduction of regulatory commercial legislation will be particularly relevant and, it is expected, beneficial in terms of commercial activity. However, there is bound to be a transitional period while the experienced business practices will need to change to conform with the new law. The new legislation is comprehensive and, although it is similar to commercial legislation in other Gulf states, it has been carefully considered in the context of local requirements. With the recent introduction of intellectual property legislation, the UAE will, with the new Commercial Transactions Law, have a more complete body of business law. The development of business law and the constant inter-relation between local and foreign interests, particularly in Dubai (as a regional centre), will continue to provide a challenging and stimulating environment in which there will be an increasing need for sophisticated, but nonetheless practical, legal structuring and documentation. The author, who has worked in Bahrain, Oman and the UAE, is the resident managing partner of Trowers &amp; Hamlins regional office in Dubai.

KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky, in a statement given to CTK  December 29, said his movement would propose Hofbauer's  resignation at the next parliamentary session on the grounds of  his bad performance which "culminated with the ministry's  decision to terminate on January 31, 1994, an agreement with  Radio Free Europe to broadcast its programme in Slovakia by  means of this country's radio transmitters."    Cernak said he believed the current situation on the Slovak  political scene needed a fundamental solution. He said he did  not favour a method of trimming from the government, adding that  Slovak President Michal Kovac indicated possible solutions to  the current situation in Slovakia in his new year address.    The possibility of forming a broad coalition mentioned by  Kovac corresponds to SNS policy, Cernak stressed, adding that  also within the current coalition with the ruling Movement For a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) the SNS backs the idea of cooperation  of several political entities. "We fully support the ideas of  the president," he stressed.    The SNS Deputies' Club divided into two factions at the last  parliamentary session -- a national democratic one led by Cernak  and another one led by Deputy Premier Marian Andel which  supports Slovak Premier and HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar.  According to SNS parliamentary deputy Igor Chamula, Hofbauer's  resignation has not yet been discussed by the SNS Deputies'  Group.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, even with the State using information on AVS as part of its information gathering incident to making a determination with respect to a permit application, the State retains the authority, subject to Federal oversight, to decide whether to issue the permit or not. Appeals of such a decision are made to the appropriate State reviewing tribunal, in accordance with the provisions of the State program. Also, the final rules published today make clear that the State regulatory authority which issues a permit has responsibility, subject to OSM's oversight, for determining the ownership or control relationships of the permit. See &sect;773.25(b)(1)(ii). Contrary to commenters' assertions, the State's use of AVS does not transmute the process into a Federal proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To the extent that a State denies a permit based upon information in AVS indicating that the applicant is linked through ownership or control to an outstanding violation of the Act, such denial is made based upon the mandate of section 510(c) as implemented by the applicable State program, rather than some extraordinary Federal intervention in the State's process. A State regulatory authority denying a permit based upon ownership or control information shown in AVS would be obligated under the Act to take the same action based upon a phone call, letter, or other communication from another regulatory authority advising of an applicant's ownership or control of a surface coal mining operation in current violation of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, it must be emphasized that the cooperation of all regulatory authorities, including the States and OSM, is necessary to facilitate the implementation of section 510(c) of the Act. Information on violations wherever they have occurred is needed by each regulatory authority considering a permit application to ensure true compliance with the provisions of section 510(c) of the Act. It is unreasonable, ineffective, and inefficient for each regulatory authority to attempt to develop such information by itself. It is both reasonable and prudent for OSM to fulfill this role. See sections 201(c)(9) and 201(c)(12) of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industry commenters further asserted that the proposed rules will have the effect of ``Balkanizing'' (i.e., dispersing) regulatory authorities' permitting decisions. They were especially concerned about the provisions of &sect;773.26 of the proposed rules which allocated responsibility to particular regulatory authorities to make decisions with respect to ownership or control relationships. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;773.26 allocated responsibility among the respective regulatory authorities such that the regulatory authority before which an application is pending would have had authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the applicant; the regulatory authority that issued a permit would have had authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of the permittee; the State regulatory authority that issued a State violation notice would have had authority for making decisions with respect to the ownership or control relationships of persons cited in the violation; and the regulatory authority that issued a violation notice, whether State or Federal, would have had authority for making decisions concerning the status of the violation covered by the notice. The proposed rule provided that these allocations of authority were subject to OSM's oversight. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In substance, the industry commenters asserted that the provisions of this proposed section would impermissibly weaken the authority of the State regulatory authority before whom a permit application is pending. They asserted that the allocations of authority contained in the proposed rule would create confusion and delay in the permitting process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM disagrees with these comments. The interaction between the Federal government and the States described above does not constitute a ``balkanization'' of the permit application process. Nor will such interaction lead to confusion in the permit application process. Such interaction is consistent with the mandate of SMCRA to implement section 510(c) within a context of State primacy supported by Federal oversight. The proposed rules and the final rules adopted today attempt to establish a road map which is consistent with SMCRA for the making of decisions with respect to ownership or control and for the development of information to be used in AVS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the allocations of responsibility are consistent with the requirements of the Act. The provisions of section 510(c) of the Act mandate a separation of decisionmaking in the permit application process which commenters might characterize as ``balkanization.'' The provisions of section 510(c) of the Act are very explicit in stating that permits shall be denied to applicants who own or control surface coal mining operations with outstanding violations of the Act ``until the applicant submits proof that such violation has been corrected or is in the process of being corrected to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, department, or agency which has jurisdiction over such violation.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the Act contemplates that the State regulatory authority before which an application is pending could require information from another State regulatory authority with respect to violations issued by the other State regulatory authority before issuing a permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

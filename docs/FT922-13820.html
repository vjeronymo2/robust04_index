			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Recovery hint as executive vacancies rise A POLL of business sentiment and a rise in demand for top executives in private industry reported yesterday signalled an improvement in UK company performance and added to evidence of a possible end to the recession. A survey of business leaders by the Institute of Directors shows that sales volumes, profits and employment expectations have recovered to levels last seen in June 1990. Separately, MSL International, a recruitment consultancy, reported the first quarter-on-quarter increase in demand for senior executives for two years, as measured by newspaper advertising. The IoD polled 170 of its members from all sectors of industry and all parts of the UK in the first week of this month. It said 43 per cent reported increased order books compared with 28 per cent in February, while those saying order books were down had fallen to 31 per cent from 45 per cent. Those reporting increased business volumes increased to 47 per cent from 31 per cent previously while those complaining of lower turnover fell to 29 per cent from 43 per cent. The number of directors reporting lower profits, at 39 per cent, was still higher than the 37 per cent disclosing increased profits. But the gap between the two had narrowed to 2 percentage points from 16 points in February. The IoD said 52 per cent of businessmen surveyed reported that their company was investing, compared with 45 per cent in February. Three out of 10 businessmen polled now expect to increase employment, against one in four in February. According to MSL, demand for senior executives as measured by newspaper advertising rose by 27 per cent between January and March compared with the fourth quarter of last year. The rise came after two years in which the recruitment advertising market has been severely depressed due to the recession. MSL bases its figures on a seasonally adjusted index which has been used to track the advertising market for top jobs since 1956. The index is widely followed among recruitment companies as a barometer of the economy that gives advance warning of changes in demand. Mr Garry Long, MSL's chairman, said the increase appeared to be a sign that large companies were stepping up their recruitment efforts in readiness for an improvement in the economy. Advertising for jobs in retailing and in R&amp;D showed a particularly big increase between the two quarters.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Umberto Rosso report: "Agreement on Bossi in the North, </F> Fini in the South?"]    [Text] Rome -- The Black Knight is back. Berlusconi is  entering the arena -- now that [Pact for Italy leader] Segni has  eaten humble pie and returned to [Italian Popular Party (PPI)  Secretary] Martinazzoli -- and acting as a link between  [National Alliance leader] Fini and [League Secretary] Bossi, to  bring under the same banner the troops of the National Alliance  deployed in the South and the army of the League that commands  the North. The plan -- which also embraces the members of  D'Onofrio's and Casini's "Christian Democratic Renaissance" is,  as expected, about to acquire a "post-fascist" black tinge  imparted by Gianfranco Fini. In fact an electoral agreement is  apparently ready, though the people concerned are officially  denying it. "The situation is fluid and in flux," according to  Maurizio Gaspari, co-editor of IL SECOLO D'ITALIA, "but there is  a willingness to come to an agreement, even though the League is  dominated by Bossi...." Roberto Maroni, the League's lower  house floor leader, was cautious on the subject of portioning  agreements in a statement issued by the press bureau. However,  there were rumors in parliament that "technical" negotiations  have already reached an advanced stage, that there is a pact to  divide electoral Italy between the forces under Berlusconi's  umbrella. The Social Movement [MSI] -- or, rather, the National  Alliance [AN] -- which does not command huge support in the  North, would stand aside: According to these rumors, the MSI  candidates would not contest the northern constituencies. So  all Fini's votes would go to the League, the Berlusconi  Alliance's tank regiment in the Po Valley and the surrounding  area, which will not relinquish its own symbol. What would the  MSI receive in return? A free hand in central and southern  Italy. Here the League is virtually nonexistent, but the AN  would receive a shot in the arm from Berlusconi's supporters.  This, through agreements in individual constituencies whereby  backing would be granted either to the MSI candidate or to the  Forza Italia candidate. Fini would be left with the  traditionally strongest areas -- Naples and other southern  cities, for instance. Elsewhere, the lists would be headed by  Berlusconi and in some instances by Mastella's CCD [Democratic  Christian Center]. In these places the postfascists, Forza  Italia, and the CCD might share the same symbol -- a new one  created for the occasion. As for the proportional quota,  however, there would be no constraints, and each one would  compete under their own symbol.    But this "four-way" contest will be won and lost in the  first-past-the-post poll. Technical agreements may change and  the elaborate arrangements for the constituencies could be  modified, but it is Berlusconi who is the alignment's political  guarantor. Gianfranco Fini is pleased with Berlusconi's  self-investiture speech: "I agree with what he says and also  with his direct involvement in politics." On the eve of his  party's congress, the MSI secretary expressed the hope that "his  entry into the front that commands a majority in the country and  that stands in opposition to the left will not cause further  splits among the moderates, because if so, it would certainly  please [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto."    So everyone is united. Yesterday Fini drew closer to the  refugees from the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the  "extremists" of the CCD, in talks lasting an hour at the MSI's  offices at Montecitorio [lower house] with Pierferdinando  Casini, Clemente Mastella, and Francesco D'Onofrio. The AN was  also represented by Giuseppe Tatarella, the MSI's floor leader.  "We are watching the evolution of the AN with great interest,"  Casini said. "We have urged a more rapid process of revision  and, at the same time, have reaffirmed our desire for a  constitutionalization of the right."    Berlusconi had already reached an agreement with the MSI  leader in the local elections, having publicly declared that he  would be voting for him. And this fellow-feeling, despite some  ups and downs, has continued, through the convention, the MSI's  change of course, and Fini's tribute at the Fosse Ardeatine.  What about the League? Bossi's solemn and unyielding rejection  of the right could prove to be worth as much as his insults to  Segni, which were followed by a handshake, which has itself now  given way to further threats against Segni. In other words,  yesterday's enemies could become today's traveling companions on  the road to 27 March. Then there is Berlusconi, the heart of  the entire operation, who is opening up to Fini. As pointed out  by Valerio Zanone, the former Liberal secretary now a member of  Segni's alignment, who considers mistaken "the confidence placed  in the AN, it is necessary to set our sights on the center, not  on extreme positions." Yes, there is a new political factor, as  ACLI [Christian Associations of Italian Workers] Chairman  Giovanni Bianchi said: "Berlusconi is introducing into the  political scene his ability to bring Bossi and Fini together, to  act as a bridge between the armies of the League in the North  and those of the AN in the South...."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government has concluded that it is premature to consider  joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) since  membership would likely bring more harm than good to the country.    The Trade, Industry, and Energy Ministry said Friday it will  state that now is not the right time to discuss joining the  regional free trade accord, which took effect early this year,  if Mexico brings up the matter during bilateral trade  ministerial talks on May 16-17.    Korea has not yet been approached by NAFTA member countries  -- the United States, Canada and Mexico -- to join them in the  free trade agreement through either official or unofficial  channels, a ministry official said.    "But we want to clearly state our position now because Korea  has been under suspicion of intentionally spreading rumors of  its becoming a NAFTA member," he said.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor also brushed aside  the possibility of including Korea in the regional trade  arrangement at a Senate committee hearing last February.    He said Chile and other Latin American countries would be  the  first candidates to jump aboard and distant nations like  Singapore and Korea were not under consideration at present.    The initial idea behind NAFTA reportedly involves turning it  into "AFTA" -- an American free trade agreement -- that could  flex its muscles against rival alliances across the Atlantic and  the Pacific.    The ministry coordinated the views of economy-related  agencies and organizations and concluded that it is too early to  consider NAFTA membership.    Supporting this conclusion, traders' bodies like the Korea  Foreign Trade Association (KFTA) and the Federation of Korean  Industries (FKI) have said that joining NAFTA would cause more  harm than good.    Some foreign media have reported that Seoul and Washington  secretly agreed to link Korea to NAFTA, but these reports proved  groundless, a KFTA official said.    The Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) also pointed out  that  tariff benefits from joining NAFTA were limited and the  disadvantages great due to complete agricultural and services  market opening.    It recommended that NAFTA membership be considered long  after  the country adjusts to the impact of the Uruguay Round accord.</p>

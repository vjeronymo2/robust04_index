			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS WARN OF A BACKFIRE OVER BUILDUP;  </P> <P> STRATEGY: KREMLIN CAUTIOUSLY ENDORSES U.S. MILITARY MOVES BUT SAYS THE MASSIVE  PRESENCE COULD CAUSE ARABS TO COALESCE.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union on Monday cautiously endorsed the U.S. military buildup in the  Persian Gulf but warned Washington that its massive presence is becoming a new  issue around which hard-line Arabs would coalesce and that is obscuring the  original issue, Iraq's seizure of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Expressing both understanding for U.S. motives but also fears for the region if  Washington uses military force, Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign  Ministry's chief spokesman, sketched the probable approach that President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev will take on the gulf crisis in his talks in Helsinki,  Finland, on Sunday with President Bush.  </P> <P> While reiterating the Kremlin's call for a political settlement of the crisis  based on Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and other terms set out by the U.N.  Security Council last month, Gerasimov stressed the danger that Moscow sees of  a major conflict in the region.  </P> <P> "The Americans say that they do not want to have a war," Gerasimov told a news  briefing. "But the situation is complicated, and some people feel that Israel  is going to prod the United States to close this chapter with (Iraq's  President) Saddam Hussein. . . .  </P> <P> "The United States understands that its presence and, in particular, the  reinforcement of that presence will to some extent help Saddam Hussein  consolidate the anti-American bloc. Now everyone begins to forget the original  cause of the developments -- that Kuwait was seized and international law was  violated."  </P> <P> But Gerasimov, dismissing as "personal opinion" and "conjectural" recent  criticism from other Soviet officials of the U.S. buildup, stressed Moscow's  basic sympathy with most of the Bush Administration's actions in the crisis.  </P> <P> "The Americans appeared there (in the gulf) not on their own initiative, but  they were provoked into it by Iraqi actions," he said, adding that the United  States had come to the defense of Saudi Arabia at the kingdom's request. "Their  objective is to protect that country against possible aggression."  </P> <P> Only last week, however, Gen. Vladimir N. Lobov, the commander of Warsaw Pact  forces, had outlined a menacing scenario in which U.S. forces continued to  increase in the gulf region and across Southwest Asia, strengthening the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization encirclement of the Soviet Union. Washington's  moves have already imperiled a treaty reducing conventional armed forces in  Europe, Lobov said.  </P> <P> "I did not say that, and I cannot see the connection," Gerasimov commented. "I  see no direct link."  </P> <P> A deputy foreign minister expressed concerns similar to Lobov's to a  legislative committee last week, reflecting the widely different Soviet views  on the crisis. A commentator in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said  Sunday that chances of war are "50-50" and that a "military solution" would  have grave consequences for superpower relations.  </P> <P> But the government newspaper Izvestia, looking ahead to the Bush-Gorbachev  summit, on Monday backed the American President's swift reaction to Iraq's  seizure of Kuwait.  </P> <P> "Bush had no other choice under the conditions offered by Hussein, and his  resolute action prevented two worse possibilities, an attack on Saudi Arabia  and a possible Iraqi success," senior commentator Stanislav Kondrashev wrote.  "Besides, the speedy military buildup of U.S. forces and their allies created  military pressure on the aggressor without which the effectiveness of economic  and political pressure would be greatly diminished."  </P> <P> Gerasimov, speaking for the top Soviet leadership in advance of the summit,  stressed that Gorbachev sees the one-day meeting with Bush in Helsinki as a  significant break with the Cold War tactics in which the two superpowers played  each international crisis for their own advantage.  </P> <P> "The concept of prompting arranged, trustful contacts at the summit level fits  in perfectly with the new fiber of Soviet-American dialogue, based on the  renunciation of Cold War stereotypes and the transition to interaction on a  wide range of problems," Gerasimov said. "Such personal meetings, both  presidents believe, offer a unique possibility to compare notes on the  fast-changing situation, grasp each other's initial reasoning better and,  consequently, help enhance constructive trends and resist adverse tendencies in  world development."  </P> <P> Although the Soviet Union is not attempting to mediate in the gulf conflict,  Gerasimov suggested that Gorbachev would have some ideas to put to Bush on ways  that the crisis might be eased and a way opened to a political solution.  </P> <P> "Maybe it would be possible to come up with some formula to reduce the number  of forces there under international guarantees," Gerasimov suggested, again  stressing the Soviet preference for political means, such as a phased  de-escalation and military pullbacks, to ensure the implementation of the U.N.  resolutions.  </P> <P> Soviet officials anticipate that Bush will press Gorbachev to pull out the 193  military advisers the Soviet Union still has in Iraq training its troops to use  and maintain weapons Moscow has sold the Iraqis. The Izvestia commentary said  the Soviet Union feared that Iraq would halt payments on $6 billion in debts if  the advisers, supplied under long-term contracts, are withdrawn.  </P></p>

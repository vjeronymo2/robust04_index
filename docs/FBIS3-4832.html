"There are still some concrete problems that will be  discussed at the next meeting at the working level," a foreign  ministry spokesman told AFP without specifying when or where the  next round of discussions would take place.    U.S. State Department officials refused to comment on the  talks.    The bilateral meeting, the first since Washington lifted an  economic embargo on Vietnam on February 4, lasted two days and  brought together State Department, Treasury and Justice  Department officials with their Vietnamese counterparts.    Claims by the two sides are estimated to total more than 500  million dollars in assets seized or frozen following the fall of  Saigon in 1975.    The opening of reciprocal representative offices in Hanoi  and  Washington, proposed by US President Bill Clinton, has already  been accepted in principle by Vietnam.    U.S. delegation leader, James Hall, at his own request  visited sites of searches for American servicemen missing in  action, said the Vietnamese spokesman.</p>

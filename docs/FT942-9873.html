			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Arts: Bryn Terfel - Recital The figure who strode out on to the platform was as imposing as any Wotan, as awesome as any Mephistopheles, his locks as long and shaggy as those of John the Baptist. Bryn Terfel embodies any number of opera's larger-than-life characters, but for the moment all thought of those had to be set aside. On Wednesday he was at the Wigmore Hall for his London debut as a recitalist. Terfel came to prominence in the 1989 Cardiff Singer of the World competition, when Dmitry Hvorostovsky took the first prize and he was in effect a runner-up with the Lieder prize, but their careers out in the real world have served to reverse the jury's judgment. Hvorostovsky, faltering in opera, has increasingly found refuge in song recitals, while Terfel has gone on to take the world's opera-houses by storm. It was interesting to see Salzburg's Jokanaan, Vienna's Dr Miracle, everybody's Figaro, return to the song repertoire with which he made that striking first impression. At the Wigmore Terfel's baritone is undeniably a big voice, requiring suitably big handling. There is plenty of room in it for him to move around and the dynamic range between his loudest and his quietest singing was vast. There are a few big personalities in song as well, such as Schubert's 'Der Atlas' bearing the anguish of the world on his shoulders, who looms on a mighty scale in Terfel's singing. It took a while for him to find the flexibility for the subtler songs in his Schumann and Schubert first half. 'Mondnacht', sung in a low bass key, did not live up to Malcolm Martineau's hazy, moon-lit introduction; the consonants were too bumpy, the style short on precision. and refinement. His enticing 'Fischermadchen' was better. Power and tenderness, force and quietude, are all within Terfel's enormous range, but not always the ability to hit a specific tone in the voice. In the Heine settings of Schubert's Schwanengesang he missed the pain as the poet's knife cuts the flesh. Faure's 'Automne' was turbulent, but was that bitterness or melancholy swirling below the surface? It was difficult to tell. As a singer of his own two languages Terfel is without peer among his generation. From top to bottom of his voice he can sing English words without any distortion, making Vaughan Williams's Songs of Travel marvellously engaging, even when the music is at its weakest. In Welsh, he seems just as communicative, bringing vividly to life Meirion Williams's 'The Welshman' with his ready heart, his good sense, his love for his rugged Wales, all sung with unabashed ebullience. 'I enjoyed that one', exclaimed the patriotic Terfel proudly. So did we. Sponsored by Midland Bank, Wales</p>

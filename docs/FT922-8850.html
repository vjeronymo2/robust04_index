			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Gould seeks new leader-poll rules MR BRYAN GOULD, shadow environment secretary and contender for the party leadership, has proposed a one member, one vote system for future leadership contests that would end the block vote by unions and MPs. In an attempt to cast himself as the most radical candidate and to build support among constituency parties, Mr Gould says in an article in today's Morning Star that union members who pay the political levy should be able to convert it to party membership. That would allow the abolition of Labour's electoral college, which at present is composed of blocks of votes from the unions, constituency parties and MPs. 'Like any other democratic institution, there should be one category of individual membership, and membership alone should carry voting rights,' Mr Gould says. His support is strongest among the constituency parties. The parliamentary party would retain the right of nomination, though fewer signatures would be required under Mr Gould's scheme. Beyond that, MPs would have no more rights than constituency members. He argues, however, that there should continue to be a role for affiliated organisations, including the unions, during policy making at party conferences. The unions would also continue to be represented on Labour's ruling national executive committee and on other party bodies. His proposals may be received positively in the camp of Mr John Smith, front-runner in the leadership race. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary and a supporter of Mr Smith, said on BBC television yesterday that he favoured moving to a one member, one vote system in the Labour movement 'with trade union levy payers, who at present . . . pay money but gain very little influence, being brought into the Labour party'. Mr Blair said Labour shared 'a bond of values' with the unions which was more important than the institutional links, but he wanted to 'recast it for a modern age'. Mr Gould, who proposes a 'committee of inquiry' into Labour's structures and constitution, says in his article that 'the link with the trade unions continues to provide a crucial input from the real world of work into Labour's deliberations'.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following two-page advertisement  appears on 3 April in the Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English  on pages 16 and 17 and in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in  English on pages 22 and 23. A one-page version of the ad also  appears in Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 3 April, on page  11. The text of the Afrikaans ad is the same as that used in  the English.  <H5>  "`Now is the time to make the change' </H5>   "Imagine that you live in a country which has a strong  government, with a plan that works -- a plan which attracts  money to the country, so that factories and businesses are built  -- so that everyone can get a job.    "Imagine proper housing for all the families; hospitals for  the sick; and decent schools for the children -- so that  everyone might make the most of the gifts God gave them.    "Imagine all this in a truly free society. A society where  all people are equal in their right to vote, in their freedom to  state their views, and to worship how they wish.    "Imagine all the inequalities, which have damaged the life  of  the nation, disappearing as it becomes a truly colour-blind  country.    "A country which truly values the brightest and best of its  people, whatever their colour. A country which recognises that  ALL of its people have a contribution to make.    "A country in which law and order are respected. Where the  people feel safe in their homes, in their cars, on the streets,  in the fields -- and on their way to work.    "Imagine South Africa as that country.    "South Africa the peaceful!    "South Africa the prosperous!    "Africa's -- if not the world's -- first genuinely  successful  multi-racial society. How we would be envied.    "That is THE PRIZE. It is not a dream. It is perfectly  possible. It is there for us to grasp. All of us.    "AND NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGE.    "For too long we have, as a nation, been obsessed with the  things that divide us. Now it is time to think instead of all  the things we have in common.    "We all desire the strong economy, the jobs which come from  it, the houses, hospitals and schools. And above all, peace.    "In other words, we all want The Prize.    "In the last five years we have begun our long journey  towards it.    "Of course there have been bumps; but however rough the  ride,  it is to the credit of ALL our people that we have come so far,  so fast, with so much willingness to understand each other and  so much desire to build our new nation together.    "The vast majority of the people of South Africa want the  change that is coming. They have fears about it, yes. They are  anxious that their futures should be safe, yes. But they want  the change to come.    "AND NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THAT CHANGE.    "For this election is not about looking backwards. It is not  about liberation -- we are already liberated. It is not about  Black Power -- why replace domination by one race with  domination by another?    "Nor is it about revenge. Apartheid was wrong, and it hurt  the lives of millions of people. But President F.W. de Klerk,  has both apologised for it, and abolished it completely.    "This election is about one thing only. The future. It is  about us. All of us -- Blacks, Whites, Coloureds, and Indians.  It matters not the colour of our skin or where we came from.  What matters is where we are going to.    "AND NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGE.    "But who can we most trust to bring us The Prize?    "Consider two simple points: First: After the elections, the  next Government will be a partnership; and the two largest  parties in it will be the National Party [NP] and the African  National Congress.    "They will have to work together.    "But no partnership works if one of the partners is too  large, the other too small. Each needs to be strong enough to  have an influence on the other. But to be sure of it  working, the NP with its plan for the future needs to be the  leading one.    "Second: Both parties promise very much the same thing -- a  better life for all the people.    "But which one is most likely to be able to deliver its  promises, to deliver The Prize, in other words? "Ponder the  following questions.     -  "Which party has lost jobs through strikes, stopped the  building of houses, disrupted the children's education, and  intimidated and threatened people?       "The answer to all this is the ANC and its supporters and  partners.     -  "But which party has already given its people -- ALL its  people despite the inequalities -- the best life, in the whole  of Africa? The answer is the new National Party.    -  "Which party has taken the lead in transforming South Africa  and brought us to our first full and free election? The answer  is the new National Party.    -  "Which party will be the most truly multi-racial party  contesting those elections? The answer is the new National  Party.    -  "Which party has the best plan, and knows how to make it work  -- so that the jobs will come -- and the houses, the hospitals  and the schools? The answer is the new National Party.    -  "And which party is dedicated to peace and the rule of law --  because only if we have peace can all this be achieved?  The answer is the new National Party.       "SO NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGE THE NEW NP.    "On April 27, we all get a chance to vote. Your vote is the  heartbeat of democracy. It is yours and yours alone. It is  secret. And no-one can tell you how to use it.    "If you vote for the new National Party, you will be voting  for a party which can grasp The Prize.    "A party which is pledged to bring the jobs and make  possible  all the houses and schools that we need. A party with the  strength, the experience and the determination to live up to its  promises. And a party dedicated to peace and a secure future.    "If you vote for the ANC, you are taking a gamble on the  future. You will be voting for an organisation which promises  dreams; but simply does not have the experience to deliver.    "You will, in other words, be voting on hope. Which is  better -- to vote for the party you hope might deliver The Prize?    "Or the one you KNOW can do it.    "Don't just hope for a better life. Vote for one.    "Half the world is rich. The other half is poor. Ours are  the policies which have made nations rich. The ANC's are those  which make them poor.    "Vote for us, and look ahead, five or ten years, and imagine  this beloved country of ours with the economy booming, the jobs  coming, the houses and schools and hospitals being built.    "Imagine what we could be!    "NOW IS INDEED THE TIME TO MAKE THE CHANGE TO THE NEW  NATIONAL PARTY.    "BE SURE OF A BETTER LIFE    "VOTE FOR F.W. DE KLERK AND THE NEW NATIONAL PARTY    "We've made the change"    Between the previous two lines is a graphic depicting the  National Party's line on the election ballot with a "X" marked  in the space next to F.W. de Klerk's picture.</p>

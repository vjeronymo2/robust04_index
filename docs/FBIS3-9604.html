Following the signing of the Croat-Moslem federation  agreement in Washington March 18, the Croats had "found a means  to convince" the Serb forces around Maglaj to leave, Major  Richard Margesson, commander of British UN troops in Maglaj,  said.    In Zepce, 18 kilometres (12 miles) south of Maglaj, a  resident, who requested anonymity, said the Croat forces had  simply paid off the Serbs, although it was not known if it was  payment in kind or cash.    Margesson said that in the summer of 1993 the Croats in  Zepce  had feared they would not be able to repulse Bosnian army  offensives coming from Zenica, Zavidovici and Maglaj. They "made  an agreement" with the local Serb forces, who sent them several  hundred soldiers in return for food, the chance to evacuate  their sick and wounded, some military material and also cash, he  said.    The Serb lines are still clearly visible 600 metres (yards)  from the town centre, up on a hillside overlooking the city.  From time to time, shots ring out, though not as frequently as  before. On Friday, when a sniper targetted a British UN patrol,  the UN shot back with 30-mm cannon fire, curtailing, at least  for a while, further attacks. Since last Monday, the office of  the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has brought  humanitarian aid convoys into the town and public soup kitchens,  operating for the past two years, have started to wind down  their aid operations as more people are able to cook for  themselves at home. Rocket and mortar fire, which mark the walls  of every building, only stopped 10 days ago. But despite the  haunted looks in most people's eyes, the grim expressions, the  lack of smiles, it seems as if the city is starting to breath  again. Daniel de Schryver, head of mission for the Medecins sans  Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) aid group, said the arrival  of aid in the town had acted as a tremendous psychological boost.</p>

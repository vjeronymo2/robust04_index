Hosokawa made the comment to reporters who asked how Japan  will react to the U.S. decision.    In Washington, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  Tuesday unveiled steps to impose hundreds of millions of dollars  in trade sanctions in a dispute over access to the Japanese  celluar phone market.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said Japan has  not  breached a 1989 trade accord with the U.S., which was meant to  increase imports of U.S. cellular phones.    "We are concerned about the latest U.S. decision," the top  government spokesman told a news conference. "We expect them to  act sensibly."    Takemura also said the Japanese Government will examine the  content of the U.S. announcement and decide on what action it  will take.    Hosokawa is scheduled to call a meeting Thursday afternoon  of  subcabinet-level officials who negotiated with the U.S. In  bilateral trade talks to discuss increasingly strained ties with  the U.S.    The trade negotiations broke down last week when Hosokawa  and  U.S. President Bill Clinton failed to strike a deal on a new  framework to slash Japan's vast trade surplus and increase the  share of imports in its markets.    The mobile phone sector is not included in the framework  talks.</p>

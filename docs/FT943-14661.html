			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Electrolux expands in S America Electrolux, the world's leading maker of household appliances, has taken a 6 per cent stake in Refripar, Brazil's second-largest producer of white goods, in a strategic move to increase its presence in the South American white goods market. Electrolux is paying Dollars 10m for the stake, which will underpin an alliance to supply equipment for the production of washing machines by both Refripar and Electrolux's subsidiaries in South America. The Swedish group recently set up a wholly-owned subsidiary in Argentina to distribute household appliances under the Electrolux, Zanussi and Frigidaire brand names. Refripar, with 1993 sales of more than Dollars 350m, has a 50 per cent market share in Brazil for freezers, and a 35 per cent share of the refrigerator market. However, it is weak in washing machines. Electrolux sales in South America were SKr2.4bn (Dollars 315.8m) last year, but were mostly accounted for by floor cleaners.</p>

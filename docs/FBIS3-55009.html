The republican government met on Tuesday and accepted the  Russian proposal made two months ago that the end of August 1994  should be the deadline for the pullout.    Russia which initialy wanted to complete the withdrawal by  the end of 1994 agreed to speed it up on condition that the  radar in Skrunda is kept for another six years.    Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andreyevs said his country  is  advancing a compromise decision on the radar which does not ruin  the Russian proposal.    According to him, the dismantling of one of the units of the  radar can begin immediately, however, the station will be able  to continue working.    The minister refused to disclose other details saying that  this compromise will be offered to Russia at the new round of  talks the date of which had not been determined yet. Initially  it was scheduled for December 20, but was suspended because of  Russian elections.    He said that many foreign countries are ready to monitor the  future agreement on the radar station.    However, Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis said in a TV  interview that "no (foreign) country has yet expressed its  position on the Skrunda (radar)."</p>

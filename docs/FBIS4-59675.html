			<p>BFN     [Text] An Arab League delegation led by brother Major  General Muhammad Sa'id Bayraqdar, Arab League assistant  secretary general for military affairs, left Sanaa today  following a visit to our country.    During the visit, Maj. Gen. Bayraqdar conveyed a message to  brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the  Presidential Council and supreme commander of the Armed Forces,  from Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid.    In a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', brother  Bayraqdar explained that the brother Presidential Council  chairman yesterday briefed the delegation on the Yemeni  situation and on the great opportunities and concessions given  to the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] in order to safeguard  Yemeni unity. However, none of these achieved any result, Salih  added. Thus, the possibility of cease-fire is ruled out unless  the YSP elements which rebelled against legitimacy and which are  responsible for these events either leave the country or  surrender to legitimacy.    Bayraqdar pointed out that the brother Presidential Council  chairman and other officials in Sanaa welcomed the role the Arab  League is playing.    The delegation was seen off by brother [word indistinct] [?  Sami], deputy head of the Arab Homeland Department at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs; a representative of the  Presidential Council Protocol Office; and brother 'Ata Harun,  Egyptian ambassador in Sanaa.</p>

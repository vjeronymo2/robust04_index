In the area where the "Khimprom"  Production Association, which produces herbicides, is located  this figure is equal to almost 20,000 times the maximum  permissible concentration. Newborn babies take in up to 80  times the maximum permissible concentration of dioxin every day  with their mother's milk. The republic's gene pool is perishing  catastrophically. Mothers' milk and the blood and adipose  tissue of the inhabitants of Bashkortostan are literally  "larded" with toxic substances in quantities dangerous to life.  This has been stated by Gennadiy Minin, the republic's chief  state physician.    Misfortune came to the land of Bashkortostan in April 1990.  Unpurified waste and drainage water from Ufa's "Khimprom" flowed  into the city water intake, poisoning thousands of cubic meters  of drinking water with phenol. Knowing nothing, almost all the  residents of the city with a population of 1 million used  poisoned water for a long time. Then a large amount of dioxin  was discovered in the water, the air, and the soil.    Despite the city folk's protests, "Khimprom" is continuing  to  poison the environment or, rather, what is left of it. In  addition, one more installation in Ufa has been discovered which  is surreptitiously destroying nature and people with dioxin --  an experimental plant for the production of herbicides.    Equipment to analyze the content of dioxin in the  environment  was purchased abroad at tremendous expense. But this is not the  first year that it has been lying totally inactive. Taking  advantage of the lack of control over it, the Bashkortostan  State Committee for Ecology and Nature Use is squandering huge  sums allocated to nature conservation. But a start has not been  made on resolving the "dioxin problem" in the republic.</p>

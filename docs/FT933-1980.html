			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Government Bonds: Late rally in French sector spurred by futures trading IN THE absence of significant market-moving news or investor flows, most bond markets continued their sideways drift yesterday. FRENCH government bonds put on the strongest performance, surprising many market participants with a  1/2 -point rally in the afternoon. While some traders reported buying by futures funds and Far-Eastern investors, most of the rally was attributed to technical trading in the futures pits. Ironically, some dealers say prices were supported by the Bank of France's decision to leave its repo rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent, keeping hopes alive for an easing at the next repo operation on Thursday. But Mr Steven Major, senior European bond analyst with Credit Lyonnais, said he does not expect an easing before next week at the earliest, with the central bank intent on rebuilding its foreign currency reserves before cutting rates. Spanish bonds were the other strong performer, gaining nearly  1/2 point in largely technical trading. Spanish bonds' high yields also attracted some retail buying, traders said. UK gilts slipped about  1/2 point in slow trade before today's bond auction announcement. Traders expect the Bank of England to announce some Pounds 3bn of new benchmark stock for 2004 with a coupon of between 7 per cent and 7 1/4 per cent. Since last week's gilts sell-off, overseas investors have been keeping their distance from the gilts market, unnerved by the prospect of rising inflation as well as political jitters which threaten to pressure the currency. CONTRARY to expectations, the Bundesbank didn't release its keenly-awaited August M3 money supply numbers, leaving German bonds to drift in a narrow range. Uncertainty over the likely M3 rate, with growth forecasts ranging between less than 6 per cent to more than 8 per cent, subdued activity and held volume in check. The numbers are likely to be published today. Keeping bunds underpinned are expectations of lower inflation numbers for September. Germany's four largest western states are expected to publish their consumer price data late this week or early next week. The preliminary rate is widely expected to be unchanged on the month and down slightly on the year after 4.2 per cent in August. BELGIAN bonds shrugged off the  1/4 -point cuts in the Belgian central bank's end-of-day rate to 11 1/4 per cent and its central rate to 9 3/4 per cent, and ended little changed. AFTER a quiet morning session, longer-dated US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday afternoon in the wake of higher oil and gold prices. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  23/32 at 102 3/32 , yielding 6.063 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was slightly weaker, down  3/32 at 99 29/32 , to yield 3.908 per cent. The absence of economic news or a lead from trading overseas meant the bond market opened in a subdued mood. Dealers said investors were staying out of the market, and were waiting to see how this week's developments - the Federal Reserve's Market Open Committee meeting, the official release of President Clinton's healthcare reform plan, and the auctions of Dollars 27bn in two-year and five-year notes - affect prices. In the afternoon, however, selling pressure began to take its toll at the long end of the market as dealers reacted badly to news of higher oil prices.</p>

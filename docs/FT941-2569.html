			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Motoring: The Java - in tune with the times The parallels are striking. The Bentley Java concept took the Geneva motor show by storm this year; the Aston Martin DB-7 prototype was the sensation of last year's show. Both are the smallest models to come from makers which for years have produced nothing but very large (and even larger-engined) sporting saloons and coupes. They are in tune with the environmental awareness of our times. Even though aimed at buyers rich enough not to have to worry about fuel consumption, they are eco-friendlier than traditional Bentleys or Aston Martins. And the DB7 costs about half as much as a V8 Aston Martin or Lagonda. Rolls-Royce Motors (which owns and makes Bentleys, too) set the Java concept in motion nearly two years ago. It was a co-operative project with Design Research associates, a small but internationally-renowned British industrial design and styling house. Rolls-Royce will spend the next year discovering if the Java appeals to enough people who already own, or are likely to buy, its standard-sized cars to make the Java's further development and eventual production worthwhile. Then, it will have to find the money. Here, the parallels start to diverge. Aston Martin had the good fortune to be taken over by Ford at a critical time in its history. With Ford money and engineering resources, plus an off-the-shelf engine from Jaguar (also a Ford subsidiary), the DB7 moved so smoothly from prototype to small-scale production that it will be on sale later this year. But the Bentley Java is only at the start of the development curve. The truly beautiful car unveiled at Geneva on press day last week looked as if it could be driven out of the Palexpo building and on to the sun-drenched autoroute to Lausanne. In truth, it was not even a runner. The 3.5-litre, V8, twin-turbo engine due to power it is still being developed by Rolls-Royce's associate company, Cosworth Engineering, of grand prix racing fame. If Rolls-Royce decides to go ahead, it would be 1999 before the Java could reach the showrooms. And where would the money come from? Perhaps it is no more than a straw in the wind, but few visitors to the Rolls Royce/Bentley stand were taking a closer interest in the Java than Bernd Pischetsreider, BMW's chairman. Were Rolls-Royce to link with another car-maker, BMW is considered the likeliest partner; the two firms have been talking informally for several years. With Rover, the biggest British-owned manufacturer swallowed already, BMW might well fancy the most famous one for dessert. At the opposite end of the market was another eye-catcher; Ford's hot pink-coloured Ka, which is not shorthand for a motor car but the name of an ancient Egyptian spirit. The Ka, smaller than a Fiesta, has a very long wheelbase to maximise interior space and ride comfort, curvy body panels, and all the latest safety features. Ford claims it will be fun to drive - something that first-time buyers and women drivers are said to look for when choosing a car. Spaciousness is one of the features of Audi's mould-breaking A8 luxury saloon, which has the longest interior of any car in its class. Two versions of this trend-setter, which is made almost entirely from light alloy, go on sale later this year. The 2.8-litre, 174 horsepower V6 has front-wheel drive and a five-speed manual gearbox (four-speed automatic an optional extra); the all-wheel driven, 4.2-litre, 300 horsepower V8 quattro comes only with Tiptronic transmission. Tiptronic, used first by Porsche, combines the best features of manual and automatic. You can leave the selector lever alone and drive the car like any other automatic, or shift gears clutchlessly for yourself. The Audi A8 promises to compete head-on with BMW's soon-to-be-unveiled 7-Series as well as the perennial best-selling luxury car, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class, which was shown with some minor cosmetic changes to make it look a little smaller. Big, it seems, is no longer beautiful, even among German buyers of top management cars.</p>

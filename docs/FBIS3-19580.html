In a statement after the meeting, which took place  at the Foreign Ministry, Foreign Minister Mikhailidhis said that  Arsenis' visit shows that the political decisions of the Greek  and Cypriot governments are being implemented. Arsenis did not  make a statement.    This morning the Greek minister of national defense visited  the National Guard General Staff [YEEF], where with Cypriot  Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis, he chaired a meeting.  The meeting was attended by the Greek ambassador, members of  Arsenis' entourage, the National Guard chief and high-ranking  officers of the National Guard. Before the meeting at the YEEF,  Arsenis and Iliadhis had a private meeting.    Speaking at the Defense Ministry, Arsenis stressed that the  joint defense doctrine is not new. He said that it was used  even by Kimon [ancient Greek general] and this proves that even  in the days of the trireme Hellenism was projected in the  creation of Greek wonders. He also said that today, with modern  means of communications, distance has disappeared and we are  close, very close. Hellenism's soul, he stressed, is one.  Arsenis said that serious preparations have been made, and  expressed the conviction that by the end of the day we will  achieve everything we desire.</p>

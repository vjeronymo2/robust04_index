			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 30, 1987, LOOP asked the Coast Guard to make the waiver permanent. On February 8, 1988, the Coast Guard denied the request on the grounds that future exploration for or extraction of oil or gas might occur within one or both excursion zones. If such activity took place, the Coast Guard might have to revoke the waiver for the sake of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 21, 1992, the Coast Guard published a notice of petition for rulemaking and request for comments in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcing a request by LOOP that the Coast Guard expand the safety zone that surrounds the deepwater port (57 FR 2236). LOOP requested that the Coast Guard enlarge the safety zone by adding the two excursion zones and prohibit the erection of structures within the safety zone. This in effect makes permanent the annual waiver of the requirements of 33 CFR 150.337(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The expanded safety zone will include the present excursion zones, broaden the entrance to LOOP, and prohibit the erection of structures or mobile drilling operations. Enlarging the safety zone will reduce the number of required vessel maneuverings and eliminate structures from the zone, possibly reducing the risk of accidents and consequent pollution. This safety zone reflects actual tanker activity at LOOP based on detailed records the Coast Guard has required LOOP to maintain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To resolve the potential for conflicting use between the expanded safety zone and oil and gas leases actually within the new zone, LOOP has agreed to compensate CONOCO, Inc., the lessee of Grand Isle Blocks 53, 58, 59, and 65. CONOCO, Inc. will then relinquish these blocks to MMS. LOOP will not seek further expansion of the safety zone or oppose any exploration and production activity outside or adjacent to the expanded safety zone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 2, 1993, in a letter to the Department of Transportation, the MMS stated that it supports the agreement between LOOP and CONOCO, Inc. MMS stated that it is prepared to prohibit surface occupancy of offshore oil and gas facilities in the safety zone. However, MMS stated that it may be economically and technically feasible to develop the resources lying beneath the safety zone by directional drilling. MMS would not prohibit subseabed access provided that surface facilities are located outside the safety zone. Such subseabed activity would not interfere with vessel activity in the safety zone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Deepwater Port Act of 1974, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1509(d)(1)), the Secretary of Transportation is required to consult with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Commerce prior to issuing the safety zone around any deepwater port for the purposes of navigational safety. The Coast Guard has informed the noted Departments of the safety zone expansion, and they have taken no exception to the safety zone as it appears in this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

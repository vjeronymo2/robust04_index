			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Retail stocks decline on sales figures Wall Street US share prices held steady yesterday even though bonds moved higher ahead of today's crucial economic news, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.84 off at 3,758.99, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up a scant 0.02 at 457.65. Advances led declines on the Big Board by 1,275 to 866 after moderate turnover of 271.6m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite inched ahead 0.65 to 440.53 and the Nasdaq composite added 3.98 at 739.50. Early on, stocks were firmer, as the Treasury debt market built upon its solid advance in the previous session. But the mood in equities was decidedly more restrained, especially when the moderate gains struck by bonds began to be eroded near midday. Later, the long bond moved upwards again, but share prices nudged into negative territory where they tended to remain. On balance, the day's economic news was neutral for stocks. The Commerce Department said new orders of factory goods had slipped 0.1 per cent in April, against forecasts of a slight upturn. The data suggested that the economy was beginning to slow, perhaps in response to the series of interest rate increases init-iated by the Federal Reserve this year. While slower growth may eventually hold back corporate earnings - an obvious negative for equities - a moderating trend also increases the likelihood of the Fed delaying any additional rate actions. A better gauge of the economy's strength was looming just ahead. May employment data, due out this morning, may give investors more insight into the impact of the Fed's move to tighter money. Economists were forecasting an increase in non-farm payrolls of between 275,000 and 300,000, which would suggest steady, moderate growth. A figure that exceeds expectations could bring forward the Fed's next move. That prospect would probably trigger a fresh sell-off in stocks and bonds. In the meantime, the market had to be content with digesting monthly sales figures from the leading retail chains. The results were generally lacklustre and most retailing stocks dipped on their release. JC Penney posted a 5 per cent gain in sales for stores opened at least a year. But the market appeared dissatisfied, as its stock was marked down Dollars 2 to Dollars 49 3/4 . Sears Roebuck also disappointed investors with its hefty 8.8 per cent improvement. The stock dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 50. Best Buy, an electronics retailer, advanced Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 on news of a 30 per cent jump in same-store sales. Wal-Mart, the session's most active issue, slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 22 5/8 after posting same-store sales growth of 4.7 per cent. US Surgical, which climbed Dollars 2 1/2 in the previous session on takeover speculation, gave back Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19 3/4 after Ciba-Geigy denied that it was seeking to acquire the company. On the Nasdaq, most technology issues were flat. Oracle was an exception. Its share price added Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 37 1/8 after its chief executive said that he expected the software company's database business to grow by 40 to 50 per cent in the new fiscal year.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OZONE PROTECTION DEBATE GETS OFF TO A FIERY START  </P> <P> The debate over whether San Diego County will regulate the emissions of  ozone-depleting chemicals got off to a fiery start Thursday, as  environmentalists and businessmen gathered to discuss the county's proposed  curbs on the use of halons and chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.  </P> <P> About 90 people attended the public meeting, at which Air Pollution Control  District officials had hoped to field suggestions to help polish 16 draft  proposals they had intended to present to the San Diego County Board of  Supervisors for approval March 27. By meeting's end, however, the officials  said they would consider postponing that date to gather more information.  </P> <P> Among other things, the proposals would prohibit the sale of certain  non-essential aerosol products, ban the use of foam food-packaging containers  when alternatives are available and increase restrictions on businesses that  work with refrigerants and solvents.  </P> <P> Local environmental groups said the APCD's proposals could be tougher and more  focused. Diane Takvorian, executive director of the Environmental Health  Coalition, said it is not enough to rely on industries to police themselves.  </P> <P> "The evidence is fairly clear that all industries are not going to voluntarily  comply," she said. "The time for study is basically over. We should take  action."  </P> <P> Representatives of the automotive, electronics and firefighting industries that  use CFCs and halons, meanwhile, said the proposals are misguided and  under-researched. Many requested a chance to suggest revisions.  </P> <P> "I am not a county supervisor, and you should be thankful for that," said Ervin  Rubey of the San Diego County Auto Recyclers Assn. He said he is angry that  input from the affected industries had not been solicited earlier. "If I were  and, you brought this intellectual vomit to me, I would throw it back in your  face."  </P> <P> Al Thornton, a spokesman for Great Lakes Chemicals Corp., a Louisiana-based  halon manufacturer, agreed.  </P> <P> "I think a lot of people here have written that March date down and intend to  show up with their guns," he said, referring to the planned March 27  presentation to the county supervisors.  </P> <P> By the workshop's end, APCD officials said they would consider postponing their  presentation in order to hold a second workshop with those industries that  would be most affected by the restrictions.  </P> <P> But Paul Sidhu, a deputy director of the APCD, chastised those industry  representatives who are "saying San Diego shouldn't do anything because their  efforts will not solve the problem. It's a collective effort. You can't just  pass the buck."  </P> <P> "I don't think the idea is to close businesses down," he added. "But, if there  are alternatives, we want you to use them."  </P> <P> CFCs are widely used as a coolant in refrigerators and air-conditioning units  and as a solvent in industrial processes. Halons are used exclusively in  firefighting equipment.  </P> <P> Many scientists agree that both CFCs and halons have caused severe depletion of  the Earth's atmospheric ozone layer that, if allowed to continue, could cause  more skin cancer cases and gradual global warming.  </P></p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Germans march in Paris as allies For the first time since 1944, German armoured cars yesterday rolled down the Champs Elysees, as part of the new Eurocorps' participation in France's Bastille Day military parade - and won applause from those in the crowd who were able to spot their distinctive military crosses. After the parade, President Francois Mitterrand, who stirred domestic controversy by inviting German as well as Belgian and Spanish troops, said he felt 'emotion and joy' at having thus been able to help heal the wounds of the last war, in which he was taken prisoner, and to point France towards its future common European defence. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was 'happy to have been able to attend' yesterday's march-past, adding that it was 'completely normal' that his soldiers' participation should cause some criticism in France because 'the traces of history do not disappear immediately'. Mr Charles Pasqua, interior minister, complained earlier this week that the 50th anniversary of France's liberation was the wrong moment to invite the Germans. But in the last year of his presidency, Mr Mitterrand seems to have pulled off a piece of political symbolism that has won approval, judging by recent opinion polls, from most French people. The invitation to the Eurocorps, in which Germans play a big role, is likely to set a precedent from which any successor may find it hard to depart. It was at the suggestion of Mr Edouard Balladur, the conservative prime minister who is a candidate for the Elysee next year, that three Germans identified with the July 1944 plot against Hitler attended yesterday's ceremonies. They included Mr Manfred Rommel, mayor of Stuttgart and son of Field-Marshal Erwin Rommel, the 'Desert Fox' who also commanded German troops in Normandy and who shot himself after the failure of the July plot. For Mr Kohl, the presence of German troops in Paris yesterday constitutes a further step towards 'normalising' his country's military relationship with its allies, following the legal ruling this week by the German constitutional court that German troops could join their allies in conducting peace-keeping operations outside the Nato area. The 800-strong Eurocorps contingent, a fraction of the 6,000 troops in yesterday's parade, included troops from Belgium and Spain, which along with France, Germany and Luxembourg make up the five-nation force.</p>

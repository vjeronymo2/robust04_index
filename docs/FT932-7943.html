			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Court votes to try Perez THE VENEZUELAN supreme court ruled yesterday that there is sufficient cause to try President Carlos Andres Perez for alleged mishandling of government money. The court's decision, announced by Chief Justice Gonzalo Rodrguez Corro, is the first step in a process that may lead to the impeachment and removal from office of the 70-year-old president. The ruling came after a long and nagging political crisis that began in February 1992, when dissident army officers staged an unsuccessful effort to topple the Perez government. Announcing the court's decision, the chief justice said that nine of the 15 justices voted for an impeachment trial and six abstained. Now the 46 members of the Venezuela senate must decide, by majority vote, whether the president should be impeached. If the vote - which may come today - goes against Mr Perez, as is expected, he would be suspended from office and tried by the supreme court. If found guilty, he could not only lose his job but go to jail. If the president were to be suspended, his duties would devolve to the senate chairman, Senator Octavio Lepage. Mr Perez was preparing last night to deliver a national television address. He has long maintained his innocence and his intention to fight the allegations. His cabinet offered its resignation last night to give him or his successor a free hand in shaping the administration. On March 11, Mr Ramon Escovar Salom, Venezuela's attorney-general, petitioned the supreme court for a decision on whether there was cause to try the president on charges of fraudulently handling the equivalent of Dollars 17m in funds from a secret government account used for security and defence. Mr Escovar was fired as foreign minister during Mr Perez's first administration, of 1974-79. After the court's decision yesterday, small crowds of people in the streets of Caracas, the capital, cheered and demanded that the president be sent to jail. The government had stationed extra police and national guardsmen throughout the capital city to head off any disturbances.</p>

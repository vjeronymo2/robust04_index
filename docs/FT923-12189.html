			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Emitec enters Japan emission control market EMITEC, a joint venture between GKN and Siemens, is gaining access to the Japanese catalytic converter market by buying industrial property rights held by Behr, the Stuttgart-based industrial and engineering group. The deal, for an undisclosed sum, gives Emitec title to several hundred patents held by Behr for the manufacture of the substrates used in vehicle catalytic converter systems. Substrates are the porous core on which are coated precious metals which make up the catalytic agent. With catalytic converters rapidly being standardised on the world's annual production of around 40m cars, substrates are potentially big business for successful manufacturers. Following the Behr acquisition, Emitec has granted a licence for the manufacture of substrates to USUI (Mishima), the largest independent supplier of metallic substrates to the Japanese industry. Its customer base includes all the leading Japanese car makers. In Europe Emitec, headquartered near Cologne, expects its metallic substrate sales to rise from 600,000 in 1991 to more than 1m this year.</p>

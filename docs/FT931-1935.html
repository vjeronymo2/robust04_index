			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Letter: Russia: effective assistance with safeguards and a contradiction (2) Sir, I was alarmed by your leader ('The choice over Russia', March 17) advocating support for President Boris Yeltsin 'up to the point where the president concentrates authority in his hands'. You suggest that the west may have to choose 'an autocracy run by democrats'. This is a contradiction in terms and decidedly not the choice in Russia. The west told the Russian people that market reform and parliamentary democracy were indivisible. Yet now, when the Russian parliament asserts its prerogative to guide the reform process, they are told that some kind of emergency, presidential rule and the suspension of parliament, are preferable. If there are genuine concerns about democracy in Russia then there is an evident and simple solution: immediate parliamentary and presidential elections to determine whom the people wish to represent them. That is far better than the imposition of emergency rule which might unleash forces of disintegration that dwarf anything seen so far in eastern Europe.

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Italy found wanting on aid: Rome's Third World policy is under scrutiny INVESTIGATIONS by Rome magistrates into the alleged misuse of Italian contracts to supply food aid to impoverished Albania have thrown the spotlight on the whole issue of Italy's foreign assistance programme. Magistrates disclosed last month that they were acting on complaints from Italian deputies that food supply contracts had been put out to uncompetitive private tender and had then been improperly distributed inside Albania. Last September, Italy stepped in to assist Albania with a large programme of emergency assistance that included 125,000 tonnes of food to carry the country through the winter. As a sign of concern over the allegations, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro postponed a visit to Albania last week. Rome magistrates have indicated they intend to spread their investigations widely. The taboo of investigating state institutions was broken earlier this year by Milan magistrates examining illegal payments to political parties in return for being granted public works contracts. Deputies and subsequent newspaper articles have alleged this was merely the latest of a string of abuses of Italy's foreign aid. Other countries singled out include war-torn Somalia and Mozambique. This week, the police took away documents concerning Italy's foreign aid, understood to relate to Bangladesh. The investigation coincides with severe budgetary constraints on aid transfers and a more general scrutiny of both the nature and quality of Italy's foreign aid programme. The main complaint is that aid has been poorly focused and inefficiently co-ordinated; while the public accounts office has warned there is insufficient monitoring of programmes. Already there are signs that Mr Emilio Colombo, the foreign minister since August, is seeking to exercise more direct control over the directorate for co-operation and development, which is responsible for foreign aid. It was only during the 1980s that Italian aid flows began to match those of its main industrialised partners. In the period 1979-1989, Italy's foreign aid programme enjoyed a decade of continuous real increases, rising on average at 10 per cent a year. This was one of the highest rates among the industrialised countries, lifting Italian aid to Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2.2bn) a year. As a percentage of GDP, aid flows rose from 0.13 per cent to 0.42 per cent, close to that of France. Since then there has been a gradual decline, falling back to about 0.32 per cent of GDP and the 1993 budget is proposing to lop off a further L1,500bn (Pounds 691m). Such a rapid rise, after a relatively late start, was closely linked to expanding Italian trade. Essentially, aid has been been used as a tool to obtain overseas contracts for Italian companies rather than assist the development of countries. A study just completed by IRI, the state holding company, shows that of all the industrialised countries, Italian aid is the most tied - mainly in the form of soft credits to assist import finance for Italian goods and services. Although the short-term returns have been often high for individual companies, there has been insufficient impact on either the development process or in terms of a positive spill-over effect on the rest of Italian industry. Such heavy emphasis on tied aid is becoming out of tune with the accelerating internationalisation of world trade and the IRI study suggests future policy should be oriented less towards aiding projects and more to helping programmes. In this way the aid process would link both donor and receiver into a longer term relationship, especially helping developing countries to become more familiar with Italian know-how and technology. According to the study, Italian aid should focus more on programmes which stimulate financial flows into receiver countries. It also says more attention should be devoted to technical co-operation, one of the hardest but ultimately most productive aspects of aid. Aid should be less exclusively bilateral and much more multilateral - both within the context of EC initiatives and international financial institutions. In the past bilateral aid has been as high as 73 per cent of the total; but is now below 60 per cent. The IRI study argues too much of Italian aid has been 'concentrated geographically, in sub-Saharan Africa'. This applies especially to grant aid in foodstuffs which covers more than a third of all assistance. In the five-year period, 1986-90, an average of 69 per cent of all grant aid went to African countries. The sub-Saharan emphasis reflects former colonial links with Ethiopia and Somalia; and the IRI study points out the latter countries have not only received the greatest single quantities but have been the biggest failures. After the case of Albania, magistrates have also hinted they may turn their attention to alleged abuses in Somalia.</p>

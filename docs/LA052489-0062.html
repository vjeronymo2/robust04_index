			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA OKS BRIDGE PLAN  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council, confronting the toughest political issue in the  young city's history, voted unanimously late Tuesday night to build a  controversial bridge which had been vigorously supported and bitterly opposed  by two warring neighborhoods for weeks.  </P> <P> The bridge would span railroad tracks, San Fernando Road and the Santa Clara  River to link Wiley Canyon Road in Valencia with Via Princessa in the Circle J  development.  </P> <P> Circle J residents said the bridge would provide their secluded community a  badly needed second access, for safety purposes. Currently the only route into  the community is Circle J Ranch Road, which can be blocked by rail traffic.  </P> <P> Keith McNally, who headed the pro-bridge effort, argued that the council had to  support the bridge for the good of the entire city, and to prove that selfish  interests could not control city policy.  </P> <P> Valencia residents complained that the bridge would dump unwanted traffic into  their peaceful community. "It makes little sense to siphon traffic through a  residential neighborhood," said Tamsie Irvan.  </P> <P> More than 250 people filled the council chambers Tuesday night. An overflow  audience listened to the proceedings over speakers set up outside the building.  </P> <P> "This is the first really big issue that the city has had to face," Mayor Jan  Heidt said.  </P></p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Property: Coy sellers frustrate eager buyers - Cadogan's Place Confidence is the key to greater movement in the housing market. Agents report plenty of buying interest since the year began but potential sellers remain reluctant. Many are mindful of all the bruises and dashed expectations since 1988/89. But they know, too, that prices could rise if they are prepared to wait. The government has not helped. Tax increases in two months may well sap confidence, along with the local elections in May and the Euro-elections in June. As a result, the 1994 market might not climb as predicted (although few agents expect more than a 5 to 10 per cent rise, in any case). The moral is that it could be wise to sell now to take advantage of all those applicants while they are still eager. Vendors and agents in Brittany, France, hope the British will return. They are popular. 'They leave the gate open. Parisians shut the gate and put up fences,' says Gilles l'Hermitte, an agent in Dinan. But Mercredi Noir in September 1992 was a heavy blow. British buying peaked in 1989-90, according to recent figures from the Cellule Economique de Bretagne. Now, the Germans are buying, although they are still far fewer than the British. But they go for the more expensive properties, with an average price in 1992 of FFr330,000 compared with FFr160,000 for British purchasers. Most British (84 per cent over 1988-91) have chosen inland places. In 1992, the Germans began to follow the trend. The most popular department for foreigners is Cotes d'Armor (capital, St-Brieuc) which accounted for 35 per cent of foreign purchases in Brittany in 1992. It was followed by Morbihan (Vannes, 28 per cent), Finistere (Quimper, 22 per cent) and Ille-et-Vilaine (Rennes, 15 per cent). Cotes d'Armor is the new, more Breton name for what used to be Cotes-du-Nord. In Dinan - an attractive, old, granite-built town which is the gateway to the Breton megalith country - I saw places 'to renovate' for FFr10-30,000. Even after rebuilding, such prices should allow plenty of cash for oysters and Muscadet. But, as l'Hermitte cautioned: 'It does not work if you bring your problems with you.' An unstressed way to reach Dinan is by Jersey European Airways from Birmingham, Exeter, Gatwick (starting at Pounds 115 return), or Manchester - all flights via Jersey - to Dinard, which is near Dinan and across the mouth of the river Rance from St-Malo. The US housing market is picking up fast. Starts in December rose by 6.2 per cent to an annual rate of 1.54m, and building permits rose by 7.4 per cent. In November, 'home re-sales' rose by 2.9 per cent, making a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.21m. With mortgage rates (of around 7-7.5 per cent) at a 20-year low, and an improving economy, Americans feel steadily more confident about taking on loans. And, unlike the UK, many homes are on the market. From London, meanwhile, Cluttons Residential Agency reports the first increase in property prices in New York since 1987 - all of 1 per cent. The Byre, near Dittisham, Dartmouth, illustrated in last week's article, is for sale from Stags, Totnes (0803-865 454). Tolpuddle, Dorset, is renowned for the 1834 Martyrs, the pioneers of the trades union movement who were transported to Australia. The squire must have known them all. Now, his manor house is for sale from Jackson-Stops in Dorchester (0305-262 123). It is a handsome, mid-17th century building and a packhorse bridge crosses the river Piddle, which flows through the garden. Price: Pounds 370,000. Publicly quoted agents Savills and John D. Wood have reported good business for April-October 1993. Savills' profit before tax rose to Pounds 1.19m from Pounds 163,000 and Wood's to Pounds 369,000 from a loss of Pounds 77,000. Both firms did notably well in London and are optimistic for the second half-year. A real Cadogan's place is for sale at Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire. Horn Hill House is 1880s' Queen Anne-style red brick with 20 acres. Owned by a former Lord Cadogan at the beginning of the century. Hamptons in Beaconsfield (0494-677 744) is asking Pounds 750,000.</p>

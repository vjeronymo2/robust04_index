			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SALDANA ATTACKER ORDERED TO TRIAL ON LETTER  THREATS  </P> <P> The Scottish drifter who nearly killed actress Theresa Saldana in a 1982 knife  attack was ordered Wednesday to stand trial on five felony counts of sending  her threatening letters from prison.  </P> <P> "There is sufficient evidence to hold (the) defendant," Los Angeles Municipal  Court Judge Alma Soper said after dismissing three of the charges against  Arthur Jackson, 54.  </P> <P> Soper scheduled arraignment for June 19 and ordered Jackson held without bail.  </P> <P> Jackson, shackled and wearing blue jail overalls, said nothing during the  30-minute hearing. Saldana said in a statement released by her security chief  Gavin de Becker that she was "very grateful." The actress stayed home.  </P> <P> Tuesday's hearing was the first time since sentencing in 1982 that Saldana was  face-to-face with Jackson, originally charged with 16 felony counts of menacing  the actress, and the man who rescued her during the attack on March 15, 1982.  </P></p>

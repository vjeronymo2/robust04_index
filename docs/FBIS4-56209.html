			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>   [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro said here in Havana  that the country will have to win its economic battle with  intelligence, perseverance, and courage, adding that experts and  politicians alike will have to assume the responsibility that  this entails by implementing a package of measures to put the  country's internal finances on a sound basis.    During the first day of special sessions at the National  Assembly of the People's Government, the Cuban leader said that  the current situation of excess currency was created by a human  policy adopted by the revolution to leave no one destitute  during the special period. This, he added, has created an  excess of money in circulation that is no longer tolerable. It  must be solved by doing things correctly so the problem does not  occur again.    Fidel Castro said: We have gained the workers' understanding  after the issue was discussed at the parliaments in the  workplace, nevertheless, some people do not understand. They  will only understand when measures follow one another and when  they are able to fully realize that it is necessary to implement  them.    Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and prices minister, had  previously said that the measures must be adopted in an orderly,  disciplined, gradual manner, adding that it will take up to 18  months to link one measure with the next. The outlined measures  include a reduction in the budget deficit, a possible exchange  [canje] of currency, the freezing of bank accounts for a  specific time -- offering guarantees to account holders and  hitting those who have illegally amassed fortunes. Rodriguez  also expressed the need to strengthen the Cuban peso, to review  incentives given to priority groups, to increase prices of  nonessential products and of electricity and telephone rates,  and to implement a tax policy.    Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of the economic commission at the  National Assembly of the People's Government, agreed with the  Cuban finance minister but added that, in his opinion, the  exchange of currency must not be considered only when it is  appropriate, not as the first and only solution.    The special session is being attended by 551 deputies and  will resume work on Tuesday.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: PIANIST AND SINGER MCCANN STICKS WITH  SIGNATURE TUNE  </P> <P> Singer-keyboard man Les McCann likes to make every set different, but one song  slips in almost every time: "Compared to What," a duet with Eddie Harris from  the 1969 album "Swiss Movement."  </P> <P> McCann, who opened five nights at Elario's last night, may be growing weary of  the tune, but that doesn't keep him from playing it. "I do it every night, no  matter who I'm with," he said.  </P> <P> The late '60s song by Gene McDaniels has become McCann's anthem, but his sets  at Elario's are bound to hold many surprises. McCann was an electric keyboard  pioneer in the early 1970s -- he owned one of the first Fender Rhodes electric  pianos -- and he continues to nurture a love of assorted exotic keyboards and  synthesizers, which he uses to color his music.  </P> <P> McCann's favorites among his more than a dozen albums as a leader don't include  "Swiss Movement." One is the early 1970s "Layers," on which he played all of  the instruments, with some electronic help.  </P> <P> "I was one of the first to make an electronic album by myself," he said.  </P> <P> Another personal favorite was "Invitation to Openness," which included a  27-minute meditation titled "The Lovers."  </P> <P> Last year's album "Butterfly" was a departure for McCann. He sang lighter tunes  to lush orchestral backgrounds at the suggestion of his producer, Richard  Egizi. He pronounced the album an artistic success, although he probably won't  repeat the format. He'll stay closer to jazz.  </P> <P> Besides his jazz work, McCann has been moonlighting as an actor. He has  non-speaking parts in two commercials for U.S. Sprint, the long distance  company. "I'm just sitting backstage, waiting for the big call," he said.  Earlier this week, he recorded music for the "Matlock" television program and  was invited to play a cameo role. He hasn't decided whether to accept.  </P> <P> McCann is a hard man to pin down.  </P> <P> "I rarely play standards. I never talk about what we play either. I never  travel with charts." McCann's quartet includes trumpeter Jeff Elliott, bassist  Del Atkins and drummer Tony St. James.  </P> <P> There are San Diego angles to the Los Angeles Classic Jazz Festival taking  place Friday through Monday at the Los Angeles airport Hilton and Marriott  hotels. Included in the Saturday and Sunday lineup is The Chicago Six, the San  Diego group that includes clarinetist Bobby Gordon. Gordon will also appear  daily with the Condon Gang, which will re-create the 1940s and 1950s music of  bands led by the late guitarist Eddie Condon, who owned several popular New  York jazz clubs that bear his name. Original Condon trumpeter Ed Polcer will  lead the Gang.  </P> <P> Festival Director and trumpeter Wally Holmes learned his jazz at San Diego High  School under history and jazz teacher Russell Warren in the mid-1940s. Holmes  was also a member of Dick Harvey's Men of Note, the local band which won the  regional semi-final of Look magazine's Swing Band Contest in 1946, and went on  to place third in a national competition at Carnegie Hall. Chicago Six leader  and bassist Bob Finch also cut his jazz chops at San Diego High during the  '40s. Tickets for the festival are $60 for all events, $20 for Friday only, $30  for Saturday or Sunday, and $15 for Monday.  </P> <P> Saxophonist Mark Lessman's career is picking up steam. His self-produced "More  or Less" album is getting more radio play; KIFM upgraded the title track from  "light" to "medium" rotation a month ago. WNUA-FM, the contemporary lites  out-type station in Chicago, and The Wave (KTWV-FM) in Los Angeles are also  playing it regularly, Lessman reports. He's working with Fattburger drummer  Kevin Koch on a demo tape of songs for an album he hopes to record later this  year.  </P> <P> Last Sunday night, the Mark Lessman Band made its Los Angeles debut at the Bon  Appetit in Westwood. Lessman will spend October in Chicago, where his son  lives, and where he hopes to establish music industry contacts so that he can  spend part of each year there.  </P> <P> It's been a summer full of surprises. Singer/pianist Harry Connick and his  rhythm section joined Lessman on stage at Humphrey's, the restaurant and jazz  club, for a version of "Superstitious" following Connick's July 8 shows at  Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay. Later in July, singer Michael Franks' rhythm  section took the club's stage for a short set of standards with Lessman.  Lessman and his band play the B St. Cafe &amp; Bar downtown tonight through  Saturday night, and they'll be at Humphrey's Sunday and Monday nights through  September.  </P> <P> Since the beginning of her career, singer Etta James has belted out salty,  no-holds-barred blues and soul. Her first single, "Roll With Me Henry," was  banned in several parts of the country in 1954 because of its thinly veiled  sexual innuendos. She hasn't lost any spunk: Her new album is fittingly titled  "Stickin' to My Guns." James opens a September tour of the West Coast with a  7:30 show next Wednesday night at Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay, backed by her  nine-piece Roots Band.  </P> <P> RIFFS: The Beach House restaurant in Mission Beach presents its last three  nights of jazz with guitarists Dan Papaila and Art Johnson tonight and Friday  night and pianist Al Daniels Saturday night. "Almost always, the musicians were  playing to an empty room. We didn't expect to make money from the music, but we  could only subsidize if for so long," said Linda Jenkins, who owns the  restaurant with her husband Clyde. The restaurant opened in June of last year,  and Denver-based jazz singer Ellyn Rucker inaugurated jazz in the tiny bar the  following month. She returned for several weeks this summer. Jenkins said  Rucker may return next summer.  </P> <P> Pianist Jimmy Corsaro teams up with longtime musical partner, singer Sharon  Andrews, for this afternoon's "Jazz After Work" concert on the steps of the San  Diego Museum of Art in Balboa Park from 4:30 to 6:30.  </P> <P> Friday night at the Horton Grand Hotel downtown, flutist Holly Hofmann plays  her last local date before leaving Saturday for an East Coast tour. She'll play  clubs and festivals in Florida, North Carolina, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.  Locals Bob Magnusson and Mike Wofford and Los Angeles drummer Sherman Ferguson  will join her for the Jazz Charlotte festival in Charlotte, NC. Tomorrow night,  she'll work with pianist Randy Porter, bassist Bob Magnusson and drummer Tim  McMahon.  </P> <P> Guitarist Joe Pass is the main attraction on this Saturday night's "Club Date"  program on KPBS-TV at 11:30, airing again Monday night at 11:30.  </P> <P> Guitarist and songwriter Richard Glick plays jazz, ragtime and blues Friday  night at 8 at Words &amp; Music bookstore in Hillcrest. Owner Dorothy Griska  has the store up for sale. It's losing money. Asking price: $77,000.  </P></p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Arts: Lit from within by Tortelier - Promenade Concerts At the Proms last week, the BBC Philharmonic's programme might have been designed to show off its newly dazzling prowess - and why not? From 1934, it used to be the 'BBC Northern Symphony' (though the Proms programme-book preferred not to mention that: too reminiscent, no doubt, of routine Radio 3 broadcasts at unfavoured hours). More recently, up to last summer, Sir Edward Downes - a great orchestral trainer - re-made the band entirely; and on Thursday, Yan Pascal Tortelier found himself conducting a brilliantly capable orchestra. Tortelier's father was the great French cellist, Paul. Among conductors in Britain today, only Yan Pascal (and on good nights, the American Andrew Litton) can boast so stylish a command of the 'impressionist' repertoire. That label is a loose one, covering disparate post-Saint-Saens endeavours - but distinctively French - from old Faure (a Saint-Saens pupil) through Debussy, Ravel and Roussel to 'Les Six', Poulenc among them, and even to Dutilleux. Tortelier has the clue to all that: light-handed poise, precision in rhythms and colours, transparency, a minimum of 'expressive' rubato. In Debussy's Iberia those virtues triumphed, in a performance where scrupulous preparation was no less evident than the individual subtleties of the BBC Philharmonic's strong team. Tortelier made his effects, or rather Debussy's, with super-honed tact and grace; they arrived naturally, but always with ping. The music seemed lit from within; one heard some of the inner-voice parts and punctuations as if for the first time. That was intermittently true of Ravel's two-hand piano concerto too. If not every sly joke came off, more than enough of them did (well beyond par for this tricky score). The orchestra fairly sizzled, and the soloist Jean-Bernard Pommier tried out any number of pithy, personal ideas. In both those works, however, I kept missing the first violins. From the FT's regular Albert Hall seats, and probably from any seats in Stalls Left since the echo-killing 'acoustic mushrooms' on the ceiling were trimmed back last summer, what one sees of the violins is chiefly their right shoulder-blades - and what one hears of them, turned almost 90 degrees away, is faint and elusive. In Lutoslawski's flashy, exhilarating Concerto for Orchestra (1954: the composer has no great opinion of it now), the only fault to find with this Prom performance was that the high strings' silken passages - from where I sat - carried so little weight amid the wind onslaughts. That left the music with a hard, brassy edge, rawly exciting (it got a fervent reception) but chilly nonetheless. As for Leo Brouwer's guitar-and-orchestra arrangements for Julian Bream, of three numbers from Albeniz's wildly pianistic Iberia Suites, I wished I had heard them on Radio 3 at home. The piano originals are chock-a-block with notes; Brouwer's orchestral translations are apt and sympathetic in principle, but in the Albert Hall they swamped Bream's guitar again and again. They should work far better on CDs.</p>

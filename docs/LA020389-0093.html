			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'AGAINST NATURE': PROFILE OF A MODERN PLAGUE  </P> <P> Sex and death both have juicy histories in art. Even plague, the Black Death of  the 14th Century, found its way into paintings of the early Renaissance. But  AIDS, sometimes perceived with a mixture of horror, distaste and denial, is a  subject seldom seen in the confines of a gallery.  </P> <P> "Against Nature: A Group Show of Work by Homosexual Men," a brave and  remarkably strong show at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (to Feb. 12), is  by turns salacious, factual, ironic, shallow and sorrowful. The passion behind  the work is, of course, never in doubt; even the most debauched imagery is  undercut by a sense of doom. But the level of aesthetic control is also  surprisingly high.  </P> <P> To be sure, there are scenes of copulating bodies cut from magazines on the  borders of the frames Arch Connelly covers with campy gold-dotted veiling and  faux pearl clusters. There are scatalogical ceramic sculptures by John de Fazio  that cannot be described in this newspaper.  </P> <P> But there are also more complex kinds of shock effects.  </P> <P> Nayland Blake titles a pair of framed linen handkerchiefs spotted with dried  blood "After Veronica," drawing a poignant parallel between an AIDS patient's  vital fluids and those of the female plague-sufferer healed by Christ's touch.  </P> <P> As if producing window displays for a chi-chi jewelry store, Bruno Cuomo seals  pretty little red or white shapes -- actually drops of HIV-positive blood and  semen -- within paperweights arranged among decorative rocks in hollowed-out  tree limbs.  </P> <P> Michael Tidmus' "Health and Morality: A Desultory Discourse," is a computer  program that spits out a terse, coolly discursive condemnation of the  Reagan-Bush Administration and the religious right for their evasions and  spurious allegations in the face of the epidemic.  </P> <P> Even Mike Glass' trio of modishly moody photographs of a young man -- the  remnants of an afternoon of dashed expectations, a would-be seduction the  accompanying text describes in voluptuous detail -- viscerally convey the fatal  attraction of risky sex.  </P> <P> But of the 14 visual artists (the exhibit also includes a booklet of writings  and a group of videos), Doug Ischar's massive wall installation, "Household  Misappropriation: Camouflage So Good One Is Shot at by Other Hunters," has  perhaps the most subversive program.  </P> <P> In large Type-C color photographs, we watch a man going about his life: washing  dishes, taking a bath, packing copies of True Men magazine in a box. (Is he  moving? Might these be the belongings of a dead lover?) Below, "found" images  massed like post cards on a bulletin board offer scenes of Boy Scouts and  members of the armed forces engaged in comradely activities in close proximity  to each other, sometimes semi-nude.  </P> <P> Considered along with accompanying fragments from gay novels and other sources  -- a book on adolescent development, a description of heterosexual conquest  from Flaubert's "L'Education Sentimentale" -- the point of this piece is  disturbingly clear. The meanings assigned to images of men or of lust have  everything to do with the contexts in which we find them and our own states of  mind.  </P> <P> For this viewer, at least, it was something of a revelation to see how valuable  the contemporary-art legerdemain with texts and images can be in trying to deal  in an honest but disciplined way with issues of sexual preference and the  enormity of a highly selective modern plague.  </P></p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Anglo-Irish plan offers hope for peace in Ulster: Hardline unionists condemn initiative as Sinn Fein expresses disappointment The boldest Anglo-Irish political initiative during 25 years of violence in Northern Ireland was launched yesterday with a plea to the IRA to grasp the opportunity for peace. But praise for the Downing Street Declaration from across the political spectrum was matched by initial 'disappointment' from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, and condemnation from hardline unionists. In a joint statement establishing the framework for a permanent political settlement, Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds heralded an historic opportunity for 'a new beginning' in the province. The prime ministers pledged to accelerate all-party talks designed to restore devolved government to Northern Ireland province and to intensify co-operation between Belfast and Dublin. Mr Major invited Sinn Fein to join the talks process within three months of an end to violence. Speaking at a joint press conference with Mr Reynolds, he said the declaration 'closes no doors except the door to violence and illegality. And crucially it opens the door to those who abandon violence'. Speaking directly to the IRA, Mr Reynolds added: 'This offers you an historic opportunity to come into the political process.' He said Dublin would establish an all-Ireland Forum to which Sinn Fein would be invited after a cessation of terrorism. In a television broadcast across the UK last night, Mr Major said: 'We cannot go on spilling blood in the name of the past . . . the time to choose peace is long overdue.' Aides of both leaders were privately voicing hopes that the IRA's traditional Christmas ceasefire, due to start shortly, could turn into a permanent cessation of violence. But Mr Major and Mr Reynolds admitted that while they hoped for peace, the initiative now lay with the IRA. The declaration, entrenching the unionist veto over constitutional change in Northern Ireland but balancing it with explicit recognition of the possibility of a united Ireland, won grudging acquiescence from the Ulster Unionists. Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist leader, asked a series of pointed questions about the statement but refrained from open criticism. Later, he said there were parts of the declaration the UUP did not accept. But the party had set its reservations aside 'for the time being' to see what effect the document had on the IRA. The initiative was praised by Mr John Hume, the leader of the mainly Catholic SDLP. Mr Hume said that he intended to resume his talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, in an attempt to encourage a total cessation of violence. But Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionists, condemned the agreement as a 'sell-out' to the IRA and an 'act of treachery' by Mr Major. In Sinn Fein's first reaction, a leading member said there was general 'disappointment' among nationalists, but Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, the party chairman, said it would be studying the joint declaration in depth. In the House of Commons, Mr Major won plaudits from opposition leaders and Conservative MPs alike for what was variously described as a 'brave' and 'imaginative' initiative. In an attempt to maintain the support of the Ulster Unionists, the prime minister insisted repeatedly that the province's status would be changed only with the consent of a majority of its citizens. He said the declaration 'guarantees that for so long as a majority of the people of Northern Ireland wish to remain a part of the UK, the government will uphold their right to do so. That pledge remains 'rock-solid'. But in the hope of coaxing Sinn Fein to the negotiating table, Mr Major ceded significant ground to Mr Reynolds in agreeing language designed to appeal to Irish nationalists. The declaration makes clear that the British government will do nothing to stand in the way of Irish unity and will consider the establishment of cross-border institutions to strengthen cross-border links. Adapting nationalist rhetoric, it said that the people of Ireland alone should map out their own future through 'self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, north and south'. Mr Reynolds moved further than previous Irish leaders in offering explicit recognition that the status of Northern Ireland could only be changed with the consent of its people. He told journalists in Downing Street: 'We cannot have winners and losers if we want peace.' Mr Reynolds, who won a standing ovation in the Dail after returning to Dublin last night, also gave a commitment that the Irish government would drop its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland as part of an overall political settlement.

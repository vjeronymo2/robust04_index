			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Xh. Rexhepi: "Serbian Nostalgia for the </F> (Non)Exploitation of Kosova"]    [Text] Despair over the failure to achieve a "Serbian  paradise" and the rapid fall from fashion of the "Vozd" brand of  perfume are now very evident not only among the Serbian  leadership but in its forcibly installed regime in Kosova. The  euphoria of the mass dismissals of Albanian workers, hailed as a  great victory for united Serbia, was accompanied by the  similarly large-scale incorporation of Kosova collectives into  Serbian firms. It was realized at the time that these mergers  were to the detriment of the Kosovar economy and were carried  out not only out of political interests but because of narrow  personal interests of certain Serbian individuals and circles.  The fact that even officials of the Serbian-installed regime in  Kosova have begun to talk about such damage best indicates the  alarming situation.    This is why certain officials of the Serbian regime in  Kosova  are talking with nostalgia and are here and there even  criticizing the Serbian Government, blaming it, for instance,  for the massive losses suffered by Trepca in one year. Their  nostalgia waxes even greater when they hark back to days of  yore, when Trepca alone earned almost $100 million a year from  exports of its minerals and products, when Feronikel similarly  earned $100 million a year, when the Tube Factory in Ferizaj  [Urosevac] earned $50-60 million on foreign markets, followed by  the shock absorber factory, the wallpaper factory, and the  textile and timber industries, and so on.    The tears of these Serbian officials over such hard currency  sums, which under bankrupt Serbia's current circumstances are  breathtaking, not only testify to the failure of their violence  against the Kosovar economy, but also indicate a certain regret  for the time when Albanian workers, especially in Trepca,  labored for miserable wages that were much lower than in other  areas of the former Yugoslavia. The sweat of Kosovar workers  was soaked up by the funds of exporting and re-exporting firms  in Belgrade, while the Trepca miners and metalworkers took their  pensions without roofs over their heads and with empty pockets.    However, this does not worry this regime, which is  subjecting  Albanian workers, like all the Albanian population in occupied  Kosova, to continuous violence; what worries the regime a great  deal is the lack of interest among the invited Serbian colonists  to work in the mines, foundries, and factories of Trepca, in the  furnaces of the power stations, in Feronikel, or elsewhere. The  fact that the few experts that were brought with such a fanfare  from Belgrade and other Serbian cities are now starting to run  away from the "Serbian paradise" in Kosova adds to their  anxiety. These experts did indeed live and earn well for a time  at the expense of the reserves and funds created by the Albanian  workforce, but, now that these are exhausted, they have started  to go back to where they came from.    Thus the Serbian officials installed in Kosova moan and  groan  that the resources of Kosova are not being exploited, expecting  that they can thereby explain themselves to their "patrons" and  to workers whom they do not even allow to enter the factory  yards, let alone the factories themselves. It seems that  Avram's magic dinars, which Serbian officials swear by, will not  be able to open factory gates in Kosova. As consolidation for  this, the Serbian parliament this year earmarked the sum of  3,600,000 dinars for the budget of the Serbian-installed regime  in Kosova (or Kosovo-Metohija, as the Kosovo-Polje-types like to  call it), approving this without a single comment or amendment,  not even from the delegates from Kosova. This was not because  they thought the sum was enough, but apparently because they  reasoned, "Why should we wear ourselves out and waste time in  front of the television cameras over such a sum, which we can  gain in a single day of police operations inspecting (and  plundering) Albanian firms in Kosova?"    On the other hand, the Serbian Government predicts for the  "Kosmet-ites" a Nis-Prishtina-Peje highway, which will be  connected with Podgorica and the Adriatic coast by a tunnel  underneath Cakor. The fortune-tellers say that this will rescue  the Dukagjin plain from Albanization. Meanwhile, while the plum  brandy glasses clink over this magnificent project, Serbian  television has inaugurated another plan with a distinctive  Serbian "Kasikara" perfume, which is expected to be noisily  welcomed in international business circles. At least, this is  what its designers claim. In order not to leave our respected  readers in bewilderment, we remind them that a "kasikara" is a  hand grenade, a product of the Serbian arms industry, which  Serbian soldiers have used extensively in their appalling  aggression against the Croats and Bosnians.    It is with this sort of marketing and logic that they want  to  conquer the world market, thus securing hard currency for the  "Serbian paradise" in Kosova, which for the "Kosovo-Polje-types"  of "Postojbina" now sleeps deep under Cakor.</p>

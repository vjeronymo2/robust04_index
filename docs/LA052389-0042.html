			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> Whatever is causing the current market to go up -- be it program trading or a  melt-up (the opposite of a meltdown) -- Wall Streeters are in any case enjoying  the runaway movement in stock prices, according to Irving Katz, director of  research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 61 points, or 2.5%, this past week, for  a total gain of 15.3% since the first of the year. Other averages have moved up  comparably, with Standard &amp; Poor's 500 up 15.7% and NASDAQ over-the-counter  average up 15.9%.  </P> <P> Ten San Diego stocks reached new highs during the week, Katz said.  </P> <P> Monitor Labs gained $.50 to a new high of $6.50. Monitor, which makes  air-quality measurement devices, recently announced good prospects for the rest  of 1989.  </P> <P> TCS Enterprises reported excellent six-month earnings of $.15 a share and  initiated a stock buy-back program. Its stock moved up $1, to $4.25. But TCS  has one question to be answered, according to Katz: What will the government do  with the 20% stake held by Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, which recently was taken  over as insolvent.  </P> <P> Additional new highs were made by Beeba's Creations, $12.375; PSICOR, $13.50;  Mail Boxes Etc., $20.50; HomeFed Corp., $39.875; Price Co., $47.75, Maxwell  Labs, $14.50; DH Technology, $10.875, and Medical Imaging Centers of America,  $10.125.  </P> <P> Cubic Corp. gained $1, to $17.50, in continued reaction to good second-quarter  earnings of $.75 a share and good prospects for higher second-half earnings.  </P></p>

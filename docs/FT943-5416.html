			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Travel: Air-conditioned Outback - Kate Bevan travels to Ayers Rock by coach and watches sunrise with flash-bulbs The spectacular beauty of Ayers Rock today holds no reminders of the tragedy of Azaria Chamberlain, the nine-week-old daughter of Lindy and Michael Chamberlain who was taken by a dingo at the Rock. Azaria's death and the ensuing legal actions convulsed Australia, culminating in Lindy Chamberlain's belated release from jail. Today the Rock is haunted more by the spectre of mass tourism than by the ghost of Azaria. The campsite and jumble of motels and buildings at the eastern base of the Rock where the Chamberlains stayed have been largely done away with; what is left was turned over to the local Aboriginal community. The site might as well not exist: tourist buses rumble along the sealed road and arrive via the western side of the Rock to disgorge their mainly foreign passengers. Most Australians, facing outrageously high domestic airfares, find it too expensive to visit the area. Visitors now stay at Yulara, the depressingly soulless resort 18km away from the Rock which was built to contain the growing number of tourists visiting this inhospitable but breathtakingly beautiful region of central Australia. And there, perhaps, lies the rub: the region is becoming easier to visit as Yulara neutralises the brutal climate. No longer do tourists have to brave campsites and dirt roads to see Ayers Rock - now known by its Aboriginal name, Uluru - rising starkly from pancake-flat desert. Visitors flocking to the Rock arrive by air-conditioned coach or by jet to Connellan airport, minutes away from Yulara. Visitors are catered to with cool efficiency, from those able to pay the prices for the five-star Sails in the Desert hotel, complete with Rock views, to the back-packers staying at the campsite. And organised tours ferry the tourists out to experience sunrise and sunset en masse. The problem is that you have to stay at Yulara to get the most out of a visit. It is the only place to stay for 500km in each direction. And with the cost of taking a hire car to the area so high, it is almost inevitable that just about every visitor will end up going out to the Rock in a coach. This is good news for the coach companies based at Yulara, but bad news for the tourist hoping to capture some of the magic of the desert. It is magical. The intense colours of the red earth, green trees and endless blue skies take the breath away before fading to delicate purples and then inky black as the day ends. The immense emptiness overwhelms, even in the company of a full coachload. But to share the sunrise with five other coachloads is depressing. The astonishing sight of the dark rock flaming orange and then red as the sun appears over the horizon is dulled by flash-guns. There is an uncomfortable sense of being herded through the experience as coaches draw up to the parking lot, leaving their engines running to maintain the air-conditioning. Even in low season - the heat of December - the sheer volume of coachloads of predominantly Japanese tourists deadens the effect. I dread to think what it is like in the cooler Australian winter months. I wanted to be about 10kms further back, too, as the parking area is at the base of the Rock, making it impossible to appreciate the isolation and beauty of the monolith. I took my best photographs from 20kms away, on the road out to the Olgas, or Kata Tjuta, as the Aboriginals call this formation of red, softly-rounded domes that rear up out of the desert 32km west of Uluru. Even on a coach it is possible to capture a sense of the emptiness and intense heat of the Outback as many visitors, on a two-day package, miss out the Olgas altogether. That is their loss, but a bonus for those who go. The Olgas are so completely unexpected that they cannot fail to impress. Ayers Rock, by contrast, is exactly what you do expect - large and red. There is a sense of mystery about the Olgas with their winding trails, undulating humps and startling colours. My group watched the sun go down in silence, awed by the flamboyant light show played out on the domes. The 6km walk through the Valley of the Winds is far more rewarding than the haul up Uluru, and you sidestep the heavy-breathing queue determined to conquer the Rock. Starting from the car park, the Valley of the Winds trail winds through a spectacular gorge punctuated by unexpectedly green trees and vegetation before culminating in a scramble up to the lookout, from where the rest of the range stretches out to meet the desert. The evening light is mellow and gold, and takes the startling desert colours to their most intense before fading delicately. Then all the stars come out. The skies over central Australia are some of the darkest in the world and make the northern hemisphere's pallid night sky, bleached by city lights, sad by comparison. In the desert you can see shooting stars flaring in the heavens while satellites appear as falling points of light and the Milky Way winds overhead like a giant ribbon. Most people want to climb Ayers Rock, but it is sobering to see the plaques at the bottom commemorating some of the climbers who have lost their lives. The practice of placing plaques on the Rock was stopped some time ago, but the death toll continues to rise. The only surprise is that the toll is not higher, given the motley crew of fat and ill-prepared tourists that starts the climb. A sign at the bottom points out that it is not for the unfit, and that the local aboriginal tribe would rather you did not climb the Rock, but it is blithely disregarded by the hordes determined to sign the visitors' book at the top. In the ultimate sanitisation of the Rock, the Japanese parties are issued with white gloves to protect their hands from the chain with which you haul yourself up the steepest part of the climb. It is a real climb, not a steep walk. There are parts where you dare not stand up straight, while the gentle breeze that took the edge off the the bottom swiftly becomes a gale, threatening your balance as well as hats and lens-caps. No doubt the view from the top is tremendous - I decided that I was not there to kill myself and came back down - but you can see it from a light aircraft. There are several operators who will fly you around both the Rock and the Olgas at sunset for a few dollars more.</p>

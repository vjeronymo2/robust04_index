			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chen Yaobang, vice minister of the State Planning </F> Commission: "Fully Implement the Agricultural Program, Achieve  the Goal of Agricultural Development"]    [Text] The State Council has recently formulated and  published "China's Program for Agricultural Development for the  1990's." This program bears two distinct characteristics:  First, it gives full expression to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as its  guidance and to the principles and policies set by the Central  Committee and the State Council for deepening rural reform and  attaching importance to and supporting agricultural development.  Second, it makes an overall plan for national agricultural  development with stress on developing productive forces. In  light of the demand for setting up a socialist market economy at  a greater pace, it clearly defines the ideological guidance,  objectives, and specific tasks of developing agricultural  production, so it will serve as an important guide in our  efforts to improve our capacity in comprehensive agricultural  production and to elevate our agricultural production to a new  level and will prove highly operational. Agricultural and rural  economic development involves many quarters and requires great  attention by the whole party, and powerful and coordinated  support by all departments concerned. In carrying out the  program, it is necessary to focus on and make a success of the  following six tasks:    1. Under the new situation of setting up a socialist  market economy, to meet the party Central Committee and the  State Council's demands, it is necessary to firmly carry out the  principle of taking agriculture as the foundation of our  economy, putting agriculture in the first place of our economic  work. This is the prerequisite for ensuring overall  implementation of the program. Agriculture serves as the  foundation of economic development, social stability, and  national independence. This is the scientific summation of our  experience in economic construction over the last several  decades and a fundamental principle we must always uphold in  economic work. As compared with the 1980's, our present tasks of  developing agricultural production are more arduous.  Agricultural production will need not only to meet the demands  of the people's relatively comfortable life and of accelerated  economic development in terms of quantity, quality, and variety,  but also to create favorable conditions for economic development  in the next century. In light of these requirements, the  program sets principal targets to be attained in rural economic  development by 2000. These targets were based on the results of  overall balance and repeated calculations. They are fundamental  targets which must be hit and also serve as conditions for  attaining the strategic objectives for national and social  development in 2000. It is possible for us to attain these  targets as scheduled but it also involves considerable  difficulties. Therefore, we must not be content with issuing  general calls for action, instead, we must truly putting  agriculture in the first place of our economic work in line with  the Central Committee and the State Council's demands.    We must not be satisfied with putting down on paper the  principle of giving top priority to agriculture or with agreeing  with it in words, but must really carry it out in our economic  work. Just as General Secretary Jiang Zemin said at the  national rural work conference held last year: "It is necessary  to strengthen agriculture, which serves as the foundation of our  economy, truly rather than superficially, in deeds rather than  in words, and whole- heartedly rather than half-heartedly."    2. While enabling the market mechanism to play a  leading role in allocation of agricultural resources, we must  attach great importance to macro guidance for agricultural  development and accelerate adjustment of agricultural structure  and layout in an appropriate way so that agricultural  development will meet the demands of national economic  development.    Grain and cotton are necessities for the people's life.  Whether there is a steady development of grain and cotton  production has a great bearing on the overall situation. As  compared with production in other fields, grain and cotton  production, grain production in particular, have greater social  effect but lower economic efficiency. Over the last few years  some regions excessively reduced the area sown to grain and  cotton during economic restructuring. The Central Committee and  the State Council have accorded considerable attention to this  problem and have formulated a series of policies to promote  grain and cotton production. To ensure a steady development of  grain and cotton production, it is essential to pay attention to  the following points: 1) If the yield per-unit area is not  raised by a big margin, the area sown to grain and cotton should  basically remain unchanged. Given our present capacity in  comprehensive agricultural production, at least 1.65 million mu  of land should be planted with grain and 900 million mu with  cotton nationwide, and these two figures should be treated as  security lines. If the total areas under grain and cotton are  smaller than these figures, timely measures against the tendency  must be taken. 2) National grain production and marketing  should follow the principle that each province (autonomous  region) should be more than self-sufficient or basically  self-sufficient in grain and should transfer grain to or from  nearby areas. By the end of this century, most provinces  (autonomous regions) must be basically self-sufficient in grain.  A few provinces (municipalities and autonomous regions) which  have to transfer grain from other areas must establish long-term  relationships with nearby provinces with superfluous grain, in  terms of grain production and sales. 3) Continued efforts  should be made to set up marketable grain and cotton bases in  areas with great production potential to stabilize the overall  situation. 4) The greatest possible number of grain- and  cotton-producing areas should be helped to develop a diversified  economy to put an end to the situation in which "some counties  are big ones in terms of grain and cotton production, small ones  in terms of industrial production, and poor ones in terms of  financial status." The central government has decided to make  concentrated efforts to support 500 select counties producing a  great amount of marketable grain and 150 select counties  producing a great amount of quality cotton by providing special  loans and appropriately increasing investment in infrastructure.  From now on, governments in all localities should try their  best to support grain- and cotton-producing areas in their  efforts to increase production and develop the economy.    3. While persisting in developing agricultural  production, we should ensure a constant increase in peasants'  income so as to arouse their enthusiasm for production.  The peasants play a decisive role in agricultural production so  we must arouse their enthusiasm for production to stabilize  agricultural production. To enable the majority of the peasants  to live a relatively comfortable life by the year 2000, we must  ensure that the peasants' per-capita net income will increase by  at least 5.8 percent annually. What merits our attention is:  Despite rapid growth in agricultural production and the rural  economy over the last few years, the peasants' actual income has  gone up slowly, resulting in a greater income gap between  residents in rural and urban areas. If things go on like this,  the peasants' enthusiasm and rural stability will be affected.  Therefore, we must guarantee a steady increase in peasants'  income, regarding this as an important measure to stabilize  agricultural production and the rural situation and to attain  the objectives for agricultural development set for 2000. One,  while stabilizing principal agricultural products including  grain and cotton, vigorous efforts should be made to develop a  diversified economy, including the breeding industry, and  enterprises engaged in processing mainly agricultural and  sideline products, in a bid to extend agricultural production  links and to add value to farm produce. Two, the peasants  should be encouraged to develop a highly efficient agriculture  that provides greater and better yields in accordance with  market needs.    To develop a highly efficient type of farming that provides  greater and better yields, the central government has decided to  set up a number of relevant demonstration zones with different  characteristics in different areas in a planned way, supplying  them with technology, funds, materials, and other essential  factors of production. The project is also designed for  in-depth development of agricultural products in terms of  variety and quality. Various localities can follow this example  by setting up their own demonstration zones. Three, it is  essential to continue developing township enterprises and the  tertiary industry in rural areas to increase employment  opportunities for surplus rural labor. At present, there is a  total of 100 million unemployed peasants throughout the country  and this figure will increase to 200 million by the year 2000,  so the situation with employment in rural areas is desperate.  If we can create new outlets for surplus labor on the land, we  will greatly increase the productivity of agricultural labor and  peasants' income. It is essential to attach importance to  economic development in central and western regions. After  making an additional special loan of 5 billion yuan to support  the development of township enterprises in central and western  regions in 1993, the state has decided to increase the same loan  every year from 1994 on to support the development of township  enterprises across the country. All localities should try their  best to provide technology, funds, and materials to support the  development of township enterprises. Four, further effective  measures should be taken to lighten the peasants' burden and to  protect agricultural production. The price increase of farming  means should be controlled and the prices of farm produce  adjusted in line with the gap between the prices of industrial  and agricultural products. A grain relief fund for natural  disasters should be set up, prices set for major farm products  to protect the interests of the farmers, and measures taken to  ensure the peasants will benefit from state policies to the  full. Again, laws and regulations and a mechanism for  protecting the peasants' interests should be set up. Five, poor  areas should be further helped to shake off poverty and to boost  economic development. The state has set about making a plan,  under which 80 million poor people will shake off poverty within  seven years beginning 1994.    4. We must make concentrated efforts to promote  agricultural education and scientific and technological progress  so as to elevate the overall quality of agriculture and rural  economic development to a new level. We must mainly rely  upon increasing per-unit output to hit the target for  agricultural growth for the 1990's, raising the per-mu yields of  grain and cotton by 50 and 12 km respectively within 10 years,  which nears the growth rate in the 1980's. To achieve this, we  must promote scientific and technological progress and improve  conditions for agricultural production. In the next few years,  while continuing to promote basic agricultural scientific  research, we must vigorously spread the use of scientific  research achievements which have proved remarkably effective in  raising per- unit yield and quality of agricultural products.  First, we should select, cultivate, and spread improved strains  of crops, timber, animals, poultry, and aquatic products. The  plan for using strains related to grain and cotton production  nationwide should be updated once or twice in the 1990's and the  good strains of animals, poultry, aquatic products,  sugar-yielding bearing crops, timber, and fruits should be  spread to a wider area than they are now.    Second, appropriate agricultural technology should be  vigorously popularized. The growing industry should focus on  spreading such technologies as extensive model cultivation  [guang mo shi hua zhai pei 1639 2875 1709 0553 2707 1014], dry  agriculture [han zhuo nong ye 2487 0155 6593 2814], plastic film  sheeting, soil conservation cultivation [bao hu di zhai pei 0202  6233 0966 2707 1014], and forecast and comprehensive prevention  and elimination of damage done by plant diseases, pests, rats,  and weeds. The breeding industry should focus on popularizing  such technologies as optimized rearing of animals and poultry;  mixed feed; plant stem ammonification; efficient breeding in  fresh and sea water; resources proliferation [zi yuan zeng zhi  6327 3293 1073 2994]; and prevention, control, and elimination  of epidemic diseases. Efforts should also be made to spread the  advanced technologies of keeping fresh, processing, preserving,  and shipping agricultural products. By the year 2000, 50  percent of agricultural scientific research achievements should  be transformed into actual productive forces. Third, such  water-efficient irrigation technologies as piped water supply  [guan dao shu shui 4619 6670 6551 3055], irrigation canal lining  [qu dao chen qi 3255 6670 6000 4265], antiseepage [fang shen  7089 3334], spray irrigation, and drip irrigation should be  spread in line with actual conditions to gradually raise the  utilization ratio of irrigation water to 50 percent from the  present 40 percent. Fourth, scientific methods of applying  fertilizers and pesticides should be popularized to raise the  utilization ratio of fertilizers and to bring about better  results in preventing, controlling, and eliminating plant  diseases and pests. And fifth, farming technique should be  improved in line with local conditions to raise the multiple  crop index. By the year 2000, the national multiple crop index  should reach 160 percent, 10 percent over that in the late  1980's.    5. It is necessary to further promote comprehensive  agricultural development to tap agricultural production  potential. The government has decided to further  nationwide comprehensive agricultural development in a planned  way and clearly set the tasks for nationwide comprehensive  agricultural development through the year 2000. All development  zones have decided on their own focal points of work. The  central government has continued to stabilize and improve the  policies for comprehensive agricultural development as follows:  The additional grain output brought about by upgrading farmland  that formerly provided only low and medium yields and grain  produced on newly reclaimed land are not subject to state  purchase within five years. Newly reclaimed land is exempt from  taxes within five years, the state will provide loans with  discount interest to agricultural development zones, the state  will build more major water conservancy projects, and the state  will grant preferential treatment to agricultural development  zones in distributing farming means including diesel oil,  chemical fertilizers, and insecticides. All localities must  conscientiously implement these policies to speed up  comprehensive agricultural development.    6. Vigorous efforts should be made to build more  projects supporting agricultural production so that fundamental  conditions for agricultural production will be improved and  greater power for sustained agricultural development will be  built up. Projects supporting agricultural production  provide guarantees for steady agricultural development. To hit  the target for agricultural expansion, we must build more  supportive projects. The supportive projects comprise three  major parts: One, fundamental facilities for agricultural  production including mainly water conservancy projects and  projects guaranteeing stable and high yields. Two, industries  supporting agricultural production which mainly include  enterprises producing chemical fertilizers, farming machines,  farm- oriented plastic film, feed, pesticides, and vaccines and  medicines for animals and poultry against diseases. Three, a  socialized service system providing weather forecasts, technical  advisory service, and information about rural finance; farming  materials; purchasing and marketing of agricultural products;  storage, transportation, and processing of agricultural  products; and others.    To attain the fundamental targets for the development of  agricultural production and the rural economy set by the  program, governments at all levels must strengthen leadership  over agricultural production and rural work. They should also  formulate and carry out their own plans for implementing the  program in line with the spirit of the "Decision of the CPC  Central Committee on Issues Concerning the Establishment of a  Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted by the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress, with the  guidelines laid down by the national rural work conference held  by the central authorities not long ago, and with actual local  conditions. Various departments under the State Council must  make concerted efforts to ensure that the targets for  agricultural development for the 1990's will be attained.</p>

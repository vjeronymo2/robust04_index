			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURNING AWAY THE HOMELESS  </P> <P> I cannot believe that suffering needs proper English or Spanish to be  understood or attended to. Such response on the part of charitable services is  unconscionable.  </P> <P> Further, I cannot understand why we continue to pretend that a working  knowledge of Spanish isn't necessary for life in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Perhaps, if some status points were applied to the speaking of Spanish, being  bilingual would be as popular among the upwardly mobile as driving a BMW.  </P> <P> LOIS DRAKE  </P> <P> Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

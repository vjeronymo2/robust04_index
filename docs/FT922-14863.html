			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Hugo Boss headhunts Adidas chief MR Rene Jaggi, the Swiss-born judo expert who intends to step down as head of the Adidas sports shoe and clothing group at the end of this year, has been approached by Hugo Boss, the mens' fashion company, about becoming its chief executive. A decision by the supervisory board of Boss, of which the Marzotto group of Italy acquired majority control from the privately-owned Leyton House company of Japan late last year, is expected in a few weeks. Other candidates have also been approached. When announcing his decision to leave German-based Adidas - controlled by Mr Bernard Tapie, the French financier - the extrovert Mr Jaggi, 43, whose background is in marketing, cited personal reasons. Adidas is now making increased profits after several years of difficulty caused mainly by tougher competition in the US from Nike and Reebok. Mr Jaggi, who is Swiss, has held talks with Mr Joachim Semmler, who chairs the supervisory board of Boss. The company is run by brothers Uwe and Jochen Holy, who have contracts until 1994 but have said they would leave earlier if necessary. Since no successor has yet been found at Adidas, Mr Jaggi is unlikely to take up any job at Boss until the year is out. Although a much smaller company than Adidas, which has turnover of nearly DM5bn (Dollars 3bn), including licence revenues, Boss has an international reputation for its stylish clothes and has developed a powerful marketing image. Its annual sales are around DM900m.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. PROPOSES 3-STORY LIMIT ON VALLEY VILLAGE APARTMENT BUILDINGS  </P> <P> Los Angeles city planners Thursday offered a compromise limit of three stories  on new apartment buildings in a predominantly single-family North Hollywood  neighborhood, following an outpouring of objections from residents against a  city proposal to allow five-story buildings.  </P> <P> The offer of a lower height limit came as the Planning Commission met Thursday  to consider a special land use plan for the Valley Village area that would  restrict commercial and multifamily residential development. A final review of  the plan before the commission is set for Nov. 9, after planners discuss the  new recommendations with the area's citizens advisory committee.  </P> <P> Valley Village is a one-by-1 1/2 mile area bounded by the Hollywood Freeway on  the east, the Tujunga Wash next to Coldwater Canyon Avenue on the west, the  Ventura Freeway on the south and Burbank Boulevard on the north. Homeowners in  Valley Village, in Van Nuys and elsewhere in the San Fernando Valley have  become concerned that the growing number of apartment houses is destroying the  character of their neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The new height recommendation would allow developers to build one story higher  than the two-story limit recommended by the citizens advisory committee, which  met for nearly two years. But it is lower than the five-story limit recommended  by planners in a report released earlier this month.  </P> <P> "We're going to fight to keep it to two stories," said Tom Paterson, president  of the Valley Village Homeowners Assn., which represents about 500 households.  </P> <P> But Bob Sutton, the city planner in charge of neighborhood planning, called the  three-story limit a compromise between the desperate need to provide housing  and the need to protect single-family neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "If we did everything residents wanted, we wouldn't have the housing we need to  support the population," Sutton said. The height limit was dropped after he  realized that the five-story limit was a mistake, he said.  </P> <P> But Renee Weitzer, a spokeswoman for City Councilman John Ferraro, said "City  Hall is like Peyton Place, and word just filtered down that the council members  in the area weren't happy." Councilmen Joel Wachs and Zev Yaroslavsky also  represent the area.  </P> <P> Arline DeSanctis, a spokeswoman for Wachs, said residents have a right to be  frustrated and angry that the recommendation of the citizens advisory committee  for a two-story limit was not followed.  </P> <P> Sutton told homeowners after the meeting that he had been wrong not to inform  them of the changes in the plan before the meeting. But he said planners are  responsible for drawing up plans that balance competing interests.  </P> <P> If the Planning Commission approves the proposal, it will be sent to the  Planning and Land Use Management Committee for a public hearing. The City  Council has the final say over whether its adopted.  </P> <P> In the meantime, building in the area is restricted by a temporary ordinance to  two stories. The moratorium established by the ordinance, which was approved in  November, 1986, expires later this year, but the City Council can extend it for  one year.  </P></p>

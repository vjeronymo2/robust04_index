			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> AUDIENCE GETS TOO INVOLVED IN 'CUCKOO'S NEST' STAGING  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach Playhouse tries, almost literally, to pull us into "One  Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." The small theater has been turned into a mental  hospital ward; audience seats mingle with those of patients, who wander about  and are apt to take a breather by sitting down beside you.  </P> <P> The program comes disguised as an "admittance folder" for Oregon State  Hospital; the cast box shares billing with a list of rules telling everybody  how to behave. Please avoid "teasing or exciting to violence any of the  patients" and don't stray far from the burly staff escorts.  </P> <P> Director Gregory Cohen's approach (based on David C. Roster's concept) is  interesting, and the crowd at a recent performance seemed intrigued, at least  initially. But the idea is a mistake -- not a fatal one, but still a mistake.  </P> <P> Dale Wasserman's adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel is not so much about  environment or atmosphere as it is about personalities and ideas, as embodied  in the psychological battle between repressive Nurse Ratched and the  anti-establishment loser, Randle P. McMurphy.  </P> <P> By nearly making us an accessory to the action, Cohen dilutes that struggle  instead of steeping it. The confrontation should be seen from a distance, with  the audience as outside observers able to develop judgments without feeling too  involved. That's why "Cuckoo" worked as a play and, especially, as a movie.  Cohen lets the atmosphere of the ward press too close; it's overwhelming at  times.  </P> <P> On a more practical level, the seating's organization presents a gamble for any  ticket holder. It's a challenge to see all that's going on, particularly if you  end up with a bad vantage point. Many people were craning (a few in the back  even stood a couple of times) to take it all in.  </P> <P> The characterizations of Mitchell J. Mills as McMurphy and Patti Patronite as  Nurse Ratched also weren't as revealing as they could have been. Mills did have  the requisite earthiness and an I-can-wrestle-the-devil! kind of street  bravado, but there wasn't enough leaderly charisma glaring through. He wins the  other inmates over very quickly, and with this McMurphy, it seems too quickly.  </P> <P> Patronite resorted to mean stares and a few short, cutting declarations to  communicate Nurse Ratched's egomania, but what we needed was more information  on why she's so nasty and controlling at heart. To be sure, it's the play's  most difficult role -- how do you illuminate a character intent on remaining a  cipher to everybody she comes in contact with? -- but the actor must find ways  to connect us to it.  </P> <P> The production's best performances came from the cadre of inmates that Ratched  systematically ruins and McMurphy influences. Ken Meyers gave an intelligent  reading of the complicated, preening Harding, and Michael Gaffney's Billy  Bibbit was the lost sufferer he's supposed to be.  </P> <P> 'ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST'  </P> <P> A Huntington Beach Playhouse production of Dale Wasserman's drama based on Ken  Kesey's novel.

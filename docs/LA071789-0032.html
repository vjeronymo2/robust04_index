			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A group of American Jews staged new protests against the presence of a Roman  Catholic convent at the former Nazi death camp of Auschwitz in Poland. Five of  the group, dressed in striped concentration camp uniforms, climbed over the  fence of the convent, two days after they were assaulted by Polish workers on  the same spot. Witnesses said that Rabbi Avraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute  of New York and four of his disciples were undisturbed after they entered the  convent yard.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ENTREPRENEUR FACES 2 LAWSUITS OVER COMPUTER SALES TO SOVIETS;  </P> <P> TRADE: CAMARILLO BUSINESSMAN ED MALIK ALSO INTENDS TO BUY AN ARIZONA BANK SO  THAT HE CAN OPEN A BRANCH IN MOSCOW.  </P> <P> Ed Malik has big plans. An entrepreneur who's already selling computers to the  Soviet Union through his Camarillo company Americomp USA, Malik is now close to  buying a tiny Arizona bank for $3 million. Why? So he can open a branch office  in Moscow that could help expand his Soviet trade, he says.  </P> <P> But along with his expansion plans, Malik has some legal problems to deal with.  Two U.S. companies have filed suits this summer in Superior Court in Los  Angeles and Ventura, alleging that Malik owes them a total of more than $1  million and refuses to pay.  </P> <P> Imperial Global Trading Co., a division of Imperial Bank in Los Angeles, is  suing him for fraud and breach of contract and is seeking $1 million. That's  the amount Imperial Global claims Malik owes it for arranging a computer sale  to the Soviets in December, 1989.  </P> <P> Malik also is being sued by Craftsman Electronics Inc., an Atlanta company that  made Soviet-bound computers for him in both the Imperial deal and a separate  transaction this past March. Craftsman claims Malik owes it $165,000.  </P> <P> Malik not only denies any wrongdoing in both cases, he has countersued  Craftsman in Ventura and is seeking $7 million in damages. His lawyer, Jacob J.  Stettin, said he has not yet filed a formal response to Imperial Global's suit.  </P> <P> Regardless, Malik blames the Imperial Global dispute on Imperial Global,  contending that it did not live up to the terms of their contract and cost  Malik an additional $12.6-million contract with the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Malik's Americomp is part of Perestroika USA, a company that the India-born  Malik co-founded in 1985. Malik plans to assemble 16,500 personal computers in  Camarillo for sale to the Soviet Union under two new contracts valued at a  combined $45 million, he said last month in a Times story.  </P> <P> Malik said he had been selling various goods in the Soviet Union for several  years, as Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika economic reforms  took hold. He said he set up his own manufacturing plant in Camarillo because  he was unhappy with the quality of computers he was buying from the Far East  for shipment to Moscow.  </P> <P> Now Malik wants to get into banking. He has signed a letter of intent to  purchase Republic National Bank in Phoenix, a small, single-office bank with  $28 million in assets, Republic President Thomas J. Euen confirmed.  </P> <P> He said Malik approached the bank a month ago, and the parties are negotiating  a definitive takeover agreement. The bank is privately held, but the research  firm Sheshunoff &amp; Co. in Austin, Tex., said Republic National lost $1.5  million in 1989 before earning a $79,000 profit in this year's first quarter.  </P> <P> According to Imperial's suit, in late 1989 Malik agreed to arrange the sale of  525 computers to a Soviet agency for $1.4 million. To pay for the machines,  Malik got a letter of credit -- a type of payment guarantee -- from a Soviet  bank and took it to Imperial, which agreed to buy the computers on his behalf  and ship them to the Soviet Union. Imperial was to be repaid by the Soviet bank  that issued the letter of credit, the suit contends.  </P> <P> Imperial said that on Malik's instructions, it bought the first 200 computers  from Craftsman and shipped them. (Craftsman is not a big name in computers; it  buys components from other manufacturers and assembles them into finished  computers.) Imperial said the Soviets were supposed to pay Imperial $320,000  for those machines, but Malik "got paid instead of us," said Anthony Shen,  Imperial Global's president.  </P> <P> Shen said he expected Malik to forward the cash. "Instead, he refused to give  us the money," Shen said.  </P> <P> Imperial, meanwhile, had bought the other 325 computers from Craftsman but  refused to ship them until it got paid for the first shipment, Shen said. But  it never got paid in either case, so now Imperial is trying to sell the  remaining computers elsewhere, he said.  </P> <P> Malik said that Imperial, by failing to ship all 525 computers within time  limits, invalidated the letter of credit, and that Imperial is "not entitled to  the money." He said the Craftsman computers were "junk" and most failed to  work. That prompted the Soviets to cancel the $12.6-million contract, he said.  "Imperial is totally responsible for us losing that contract," he said.  </P> <P> Shen said Imperial "bought the computers as he ordered. We don't guarantee if  they work or not."  </P> <P> Nicholas Tzavaras, Craftsman chief operating officer, defended his company's  computers and said it tried to send technicians to Moscow to look at the  machines. Tzavaras said Craftsman needed an invitation from Malik to get into  the country, but Malik did not provide one.  </P> <P> Imperial's suit also alleged that Malik hyped his personal background when he  approached Imperial about doing business. (The suit listed Malik's full name as  Akhter Malik Mokhamed.) The financial statement that he gave Imperial  "significantly overstated" Malik's credentials, net worth and credit  worthiness, the suit alleged without elaborating.  </P> <P> "It was such a rush we did not check it out," Shen said. But he said Malik's  financial situation mattered little. What counted was the letter of credit he  had from the Soviet bank, and on that basis Imperial accepted the deal, he  said.  </P> <P> Some facts Malik gave in interviews with The Times also proved slippery.  </P> <P> Among other things, Malik said he had a doctorate in physics from the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology -- a claim he also made to Imperial --  but MIT has no record of him attending. Told of this, Malik later elaborated to  say his degree was from the University of Bombay in India "under the auspices"  of MIT, but that could not be immediately confirmed.  </P> <P> He also told The Times that he had countersued Imperial and was seeking $27  million in damages. But later Malik's lawyer, Stettin, said no such action had  been taken.  </P> <P> Beyond the courts, Malik is waiting to see if regulators give him the green  light to buy the Phoenix bank. A Moscow office would "facilitate our Soviet  customers and trading customers" by offering letters of credit and other  financing, he said.  </P> <P> Chase Manhattan Bank, the giant New York City bank, is one of the few U.S.  banks that has an office in Moscow. Such Moscow branches provide mainly trade  financing. Peter Bakstansky, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York, said U.S. banks are free to try to set up shop there, but it's still not  easy to get Moscow's approval despite perestroika.  </P></p>

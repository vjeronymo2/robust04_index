			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television Lynda La Plante has turned to the sea for her next drama. The creator of Prime Suspect and Civvies has landed on the lifeboatmen of a fictional Pembrokeshire seaside town for The Lifeboat, nine stories in which the private lives of the volunteers will doubtless mesh with their brave forays out to sea. It is a cross between 999 and a soap opera, and opens with a tale of illicit drug dealing (BBC 1, 8pm). After all those films about how American vets returned from Vietnam all screwed up, we now get Russians scarred by Afghanistan. Screen Two (BBC 2, 10pm) has a short Russian movie (with English sub-titles) Continental Drift  -Zinky Boys Go Underground, which follows the lives of disabled former soldiers trying to make ends meet by dodgy dealing in St Petersburg. It is shot on the city's Metro. Another of the old and lost Steptoe and Son films, which writer Ray Galton unearthed, is smartened up and shown on BBC 2 at 8.30 tonight. It is by-election time in 1970 and Ted Heath plans a photo opportunity at the Steptoes' rag and bone yard. Father Albert is a fan, but son Harold supports Labour.</p>

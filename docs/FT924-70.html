			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Bank of England signals fraud crackdown THE BANK of England is likely to be more aggressive in closing down or limiting the activities of banks suspected of fraud or ineptitude, according to Mr Ian Watt, who was recently appointed to head the Bank's new special investigations unit. His unit was set up after criticism of the Bank's role as supervisor of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was closed last year. Mr Watt, a former partner at accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick, said: 'The shift (in the Bank's supervision policy) may be from 'well, one can't act (against a bank) unless it's absolutely certain that one's fears are justified' to being prepared to act quickly in the interests of depositors when the evidence suggests that there is something seriously wrong. 'We want to detect the fraudsters at an early stage and strangle those, string them up as quickly as possible, but in the course of detecting them we must not provide such a blanket approach as to hang any innocents.' Mr Watt made his remarks in an article in the Old Lady, the Bank's staff magazine, which also contained an interview with Mr Peter Peddie, a former partner of the solicitors Freshfields. Mr Peddie, who heads the Bank's new legal unit, said bank supervisors across the EC must employ agreed standards in their approach to banks suspected of corruption.</p>

			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Forte's review likely to include board reshuffle FORTE, the hotels and restaurant group whose shares have recently been under pressure in the stock market, is reviewing the make-up of its board, including the position of its octogenarian chairman Lord Forte. Although the City has been concerned about the poor performance of the hotel business during the recession and the failure to sell the contract catering arm, it is understood that the review stems from the group's efforts to refocus its activities and the age profile of the directors. Options include the possible elevation of Lord Forte to the position of president, a post now held by former chairman Lord Thorneycroft. Lord Forte's son Rocco, who runs the business as chief executive, would then either become chairman or the role would be made non-executive. If he complies with the trend towards separating the roles of chairman and chief executive, a new number two position of chief operating officer may be created. Mr Alan Hearn, managing director of the hotels division, is one of the potential internal candidates. The management review, which also penetrates below board level to tackle such questions as whether each division needs its own headquarters, coincides with Forte's effort to focus on hotels, restaurants and continental expansion. It also fits in with measures to reduce gearing and cut costs. The downgrading of profit forecasts and the diminishing of the group's previously high stock market rating have sent the share price to less than 140p, compared with a 12-month high of 262p. One of the themes of the review would be to replace the old guard with new blood, particularly at the non-executive level. The current four include Mr Eric Hartwell and Mr Donald Durban, both of whom are retired executives of the group whose careers with Forte go back to the late 1930s. Sir Charles Hardie, deputy chairman, has been a director since 1970, and the latest addition on the non-executive side is Sir David McNee, who has served nine years. Among the 10 executive directors, a couple of approaching retirements and the proposed sale of the Gardner Merchant contract catering business will offer scope for streamlining the structure under Rocco. One possible new appointment might be Mr Tony Monnickendam, head of the restaurant division.</p>

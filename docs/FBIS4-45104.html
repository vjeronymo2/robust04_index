			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan-U.S. Relations--Vain Delusion"] </F>   [Text] No two countries in the world maintain similar  relations all the time; these change as the result of different  situations and events. Pakistan-U.S. relations are no exception  to this rule. The relations between the United States and  Pakistan have seen many ups and downs during the last 45 years.  There have been periods of close and warm relations as well as  of coolness. Various conditions are affecting the  Pakistan-United States relations at present and we see changes.  We have commented on President Clinton's report sent to the U.S.  Congress the other day. He had made two surprising statements in  that report: (1) Pakistan is blackmailing India over the Kashmir  issue and is saying that if the Kashmir issue is not resolved a  nuclear war will break out between the two countries. In Mr.  Clinton's opinion this is equivalent to Pakistan trying to  blackmail India. (2) The U.S. President also has said that the  situation will remain dangerous and peace cannot be established  in South Asia until the Kashmir issue is resolved.    President Clinton's sentiments have not only surprised but  also worried the people of Pakistan. They have been forced to  wonder why did this change in the U.S. stand occur so suddenly.  Only yesterday, a ranked U.S. official, Robin Raphel, had said  emphatically that the United States considered Jammu-Kashmir a  disputed region and a decision needed to be made about its  future. In addition to Robin Raphel, other U.S. spokespersons  had expressed the same opinion. It appears that when India  reacted strongly to this statement and used various tactics to  pressure Ms. Robin [Raphel] and the United States, the United  States was forced to change its stand. Recently, India and the  United States held secret talks in London to discuss India's  nuclear program. These talks were unsuccessful and India refused  to make any agreement with the United States about its nuclear  program. Its important officials have announced that India will  continue with its missiles program as scheduled and will  complete all tests by this coming July. These events indicate  that India is not willing to listen to the United States. The  Indian prime minister is visiting the United States these days.  The Indian government and news media have used various tactics  to pressure the U.S. government. They are trying to achieve all  Indian goals during Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit to the United  States and not to accept U.S. advice or pressure on any issue.  Against this background, it is not easy to believe the  statements made by two important Pakistani leaders today. One is  forced to ask if these expressions are the result of some  misconception or were made to make Pakistani people optimistic  without any basis. The Pakistani ambassador to the United States  said, "The relations between Pakistan and the United States have  improved amazingly. The United States that was ready to declare  Pakistan a terrorist nation until yesterday has adopted a very  amiable attitude toward us. The United States says that if  Pakistan assures it of freezing its nuclear program, it is ready  to nullify the Pressler amendment." Similarly, Foreign Minister  Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali said that Pakistan and the United States  have agreed to make South Asia a nuclear-free zone. The United  States will treat India and Pakistan equally on this issue. Mr.  Asif Ali also claimed that the United States has admitted to the  Pressler amendment being "a bad law and a very bad policy." We  are entering a new era in which both Pakistan and the United  states have agreed to improve and strengthen their mutual  relations. He also said that the Pakistani stand over Kashmir  and the nuclear program is better understood in the United  States now after the recent diplomatic efforts by the government  of Pakistan. Mr. Asif Ali also claimed that the United States  has begun to feel that the Kashmir issue is a permanent danger  to peace in South Asia. These opinions expressed by Dr. Maliha  Lodhi and Sardar Asif Ali are very encouraging provided they  represent the situation accurately. This, however, is not easy  to understand in the light of President Clinton's report  mentioned earlier. The foreign minister said that the United  States has declared the Pressler amendment a bad law and a very  bad policy. It could be really true, but we have not seen any  proof of it. If the U.S. viewpoint has really changed, why did  not it reinstate its aid to us? Why did not it decide to supply  the 38 F-16s we have already paid for? Similarly, if the United  States has decided not to require us to roll back our nuclear  program unilaterally and also understands our positions, then  what reason does it have to keep the Pressler amendment? The  United States knows that India has refused to compromise its  nuclear program. Therefore, if it wants to treat both countries  equally, it should refrain from punishing Pakistan for keeping  its nuclear program. However, we notice that this did not  happen. The United States, in order to temporarily suspend the  Pressler amendment, is asking us to open up our nuclear  installations for inspection as a price for it. Does it show  that it is treating India and Pakistan equally? There is no  doubt that Ms. Bhutto's government is trying to make the United  states understand its position and has succeeded in it to an  extent. However, it is not appropriate to make the situation  look so positive that it does not represent the facts. We hope  and pray that all blocks in the path of Pakistan-United States  relations are removed. At the same time, we should not express  extraordinary optimism and should wait for the results of  Narasimha Rao and President Leghari's visits to the United  States. Only then will a clear picture will emerge.</p>

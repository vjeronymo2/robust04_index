			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daniel Kwan in Guangzhou] </F>   [Text] Guangdong will invest 15 billion yuan (HK$13.3  billion) this year to upgrade its highways, but Beijing has  already indicated it will only make a token contribution, a  provincial official said yesterday. Li Peiwu, director of the  province's Communications and Traffic Bureau, said Beijing would  only promise to provide 300 million to 400 million yuan. He  said the provincial Government would offer 3.1 billion yuan,  while at least 10 billion yuan would have to be shared by county  and municipal governments. The remaining money would come from  foreign investors.    Facing another deficit this year, analysts said the Central  Government had already demanded provinces such as Guangdong to  make a greater contribution to the central coffers. The sharing  of tax revenue and the annual financial contribution to the  state coffers by the provinces were two major issues in the tug  of war between regions and the central authorities under the new  tax reform programme introduced by Executive Vice-Premier Zhu  Rongji. Under the tax policy Beijing regained control over much  of the revenue that had been monopolised by localities in the  past.    Speaking to reporters while attending the continuing  Guangdong People's Congress, Mr Li said the province would be  able to meet its financial needs despite the lack of financial  support from Beijing. He said much of the investment would come  from bank credit and he did not expect the financing would lead  to more taxes and levies.    There were reports that many local chiefs raised taxes and  imposed new fees on villagers to finance road construction. The  added financial burden has been a source of confrontation in the  country side. According to Mr Li, an other channel for  financing came from the floating of new bonds and stocks. For  example, the Guangdong Highway Company is considering issuing  new stocks to the public to raise part of the investment money.    Meanwhile, Mr Li admitted the traffic problem in Guangdong  had been worsened by the influx of millions of migrant worker  after the Spring Festival. However, the total volume attributed  to the arrival of job-seekers was about eight percent down so  far this year. He attributed the drop to an increasing number  of migrant workers taking special coaches chartered by their  employers.</p>

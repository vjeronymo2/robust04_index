			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / The Markets: Derivatives attract some hostile attention - Economics Notebook These are tough times for the whizz-kids who make their fortunes at the innovative frontiers of financial markets. Recent bond market gyrations and corporate calamities, such as the Dollars 102m after-tax charge at Procter &amp; Gamble arising from swap transactions and the near bankruptcy of Metallgesellschaft of Germany after oil futures speculation, have brought derivatives and other sophisticated financial products to the hostile attention of politicians and regulators. Mr Eugene Ludwig, the US comptroller of the currency, has hinted at tougher controls over US banks' derivatives trading. A week ago, finance ministers from the Group of 10 leading industrial countries agreed on the need to strengthen co-operation in gathering statistics and assessing the implications for the world financial system of 'the innovative segments of financial markets'. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, and Mr Andrew Crockett, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, called in separate speeches last Tuesday for improved disclosure requirements and sufficient capital adequacy standards among financial institutions to underpin their risky activities. Although Mr Tietmeyer said there was no need for specific new regulation 'for the time being', tighter regulation of derivatives seems highly likely. Yet just as markets overshoot and become indiscriminating, regulators and legislators must beware of becoming excessively worried about financial innovation. But derivatives, such as options and futures, are not just speculators' toys. Derivatives and swaps, which are agreements to exchange specified cash flows such as interest rate or currency liabilities, can yield broader economic benefits. Although Mr Crockett focused mainly on the risks posed by financial innovation, he acknowledged that derivatives, by allowing sophisticated risk management, can improve the productivity of an investment. They also could contribute to the integration of global capital markets, so improving the global allocation of savings and fostering higher investment levels. In a recent study*, the World Bank has emphasised how market-based instruments such as futures, options and swaps are being used with increasing success to combat the adverse effects of volatile commodity prices on the economies of developing nations. Commodity exporting countries can suffer large scale shocks through big and sudden changes in the prices of their main products. The World Bank cites the case of the Ivory Coast, an exporter of cocoa and coffee and an oil importer. In the 1970s and 1980s, it suffered six terms-of-trade shocks (two favourable and four unfavourable), each of which moved its gross domestic product by more than 10 per cent. Such shifts would make economic management difficult enough in an advanced industrial country. In certain poor developing nations they have encouraged policy errors, including big budget deficits and soaring external debts that act even today as a brake on growth. Traditional means of smoothing the effects of commodity price volatility have yielded scant success. The 1980s saw the failure of several international commodity arrangements that sought to stabilise prices. Domestic stabilisation schemes have a similar poor record and have tended to put a strain on already hard-pressed budgets. Little wonder, therefore, that interest has focused in recent years on market-based techniques such as hedging in commercial futures markets to manage risk. Commodity futures markets have been around for a long time and are spread across the globe. Only in recent decades have they developed great depth and liquidity, however. The top chart gives one example of how dealing on crude oil futures has grown over the past decade. According to the World Bank, the volume of crude oil futures and options traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange now amounts to roughly 200m barrels a day or almost four times world production of crude. Forward prices tend to be less volatile than spot prices, giving commodity producers an opportunity to reduce the volatility of the price of their output through hedging. The middle chart, based on a study of the oil futures market in the late 1980s, suggests that a producer, routinely hedging 15 months in advance, could cut price volatility by a half. Governments and corporations in developing countries have taken advantage of exchanges to hedge their commodity exposure. For many years, Ghana and the Ivory Coast have sold part of their cocoa crop ahead of the harvest while Indonesia's rubber and coffee exporters routinely hedge. Codelco, Chile's state owned copper company, has used financial derivatives linked to the copper price and interest rate hedging instruments. But news earlier this year that it had incurred a Dollars 206m loss in trading on the London Metal Exchange shows that futures trading is not risk free. However, when finance and development ministers from the world's industrialised and developing nations met in the joint World Bank - International Monetary Fund development committee last week, they gave their backing to the use of hedging instruments in futures markets by commodity producers. They also supported efforts of the World Bank and other agencies to provide know-how to smaller producer countries so that they could use such markets. Although the official mood has swung against the young 'rocket scientists' who construct and deal in derivatives on Wall Street, governments are still prepared to back sophisticated market practices when they are seen to do some good. *Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries, 1994.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] AL-BA'TH discusses the meeting between Presidents  al-Asad and Clinton, scheduled for mid-January in Geneva. The  projected summit has already caught the attention of Middle East  watchers and Arab and world media. The consensus is that the  fate of the entire Middle East peace process hangs on the  outcome of the Geneva summit. AL-BA'TH notes the importance  that the United States attaches to the Geneva summit and cites a  statement to that effect by Warren Christopher. The paper also  quotes U.S. Administration officials as expressing the hope the  session will propel the peace process forward and Washington's  assertion that it will continue to work for a comprehensive  peace.    Arab and world media are agreed that Syria's posture on the  peace process is the right one. They point out that Middle East  security and stability are inconceivable while a chunk of Arab  territory remains under Israeli occupation. AL-BA'TH stresses  that the world, and the United States in particular, realizes  that, without the involvement of Syria and Lebanon, peace in the  Middle East stands no chance. It counsels wariness of Israel's  procrastination and insistence on separate and partial deals.  Syria, the paper emphasizes, will have absolutely nothing to do  with partial and separate deals, as such a course will heighten  tension in the region. Syria wants a comprehensive peace founded  on UN resolutions and the Madrid formula, AL-BA'TH concludes.    AL-THAWRAH comments on escalating Israeli attacks on south  Lebanon, seeing the action within the context of a strategy to  use the volatile situation as a bargaining chip and lever to  apply pressure on Lebanon. The Rabin government, using an iron  fist to blackmail Lebanon, deal with it in isolation from other  Arab states, and force it into signing a separate agreement, is  out to undermine coordination among Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.  The idea is to weaken the Arab position and pave the way for  Israel to deal with each of the three tracks separately and  subsequently dictate its terms and own solutions. Coming two  weeks before the the summit between al-Asad and Clinton, the  attacks are seen by the paper as a bid to whip up tension and  deflect the session from its declared objective of giving an  impetus to the peace process and promoting a just and  comprehensive settlement along the lines of the Madrid formula  and pertinent UN resolutions.    The responsibility of the international community and the  American sponsors cannot be overstated. Both must use their  clout, be firm, and rein in Israel lest it get carried away by  its aggressive bent. They must bring about enough pressure to  force an Israeli pullout of south Lebanon, the Golan Heights,  and other occupied Arab territory as envisaged by UN resolutions  -- the underpinnings of a fair and comprehensive peace,  AL-THAWRAH concludes.</p>

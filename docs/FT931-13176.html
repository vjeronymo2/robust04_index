			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Stronger D-Mark sector rises from the Ecu market OUT of the ashes of the Ecu market, a stronger and larger D-Mark Eurobond market has risen. Given the importance of the D-Mark as a currency, the slow development of the D-Mark sector of the Eurobond market had been an anomaly, resulting in part from antiquated market practices. The liberalisation of Bundesbank rules last August helped to modernise the market, leaving it well positioned for an autumn windfall. The turmoil in the foreign exchange market in September left many European countries, already facing problems funding their budget deficits, with depleted foreign currency reserves. The D-Mark sector proved 'the best watering hole for sovereign borrowers to refill their tanks', according to Dresdner Bank. Sweden's DM2.5bn financing in October helped to jump-start the market by proving that large, liquid D-Mark issues can attract international institutional investors. Since then, the pace of growth has increased. The volume of D-Mark Eurobonds in the first three weeks of this year has reached DM14.5bn, representing 27 per cent of supply last year. Although this level of activity is not likely to be maintained, volume is expected to run at record levels this year. The heavy supply so far has been easily absorbed by the market, which has not suffered from a widening of Eurobond spreads relative to bunds. In part, the market has benefited from the availability of strong credits in large size, which helped attract new institutional investors. The liquidity of the market has improved a lot but it still lags the dollar market. Many banks and securities houses have shifted idle Ecu bond dealers on to D-Mark Eurobond trading, while some German banks, such as Dresdner, have stepped up trading activity. Consequently,the investor base has broadened sufficiently to keep pace with the market's growth. As well as attracting international institutions, the market has succeeded in attracting a new layer of domestic investors. 'Both the Finland and Italy deals (launched earlier this year) offered yield spreads over bunds, and also over Schuldscheine (domestic bonds) and mortgage bonds,' said one German banker. As a result, domestic institutions, such as insurance companies, have started to buy large Eurobond issues as a more liquid alternative to domestic paper. More business is likely to be channelled through the growing D-Mark medium-term note market. At the same time, the turmoil in the financial markets last September sent international investors rushing towards the safe haven of D-Marks. 'The dynamics of the market are totally different now,' said Mr Charles Berman, director of capital markets at Salomon Brothers. Investors face a reduced choice of markets since there is no longer a sizeable Ecu market and the convergence play on higher-yielding European markets has largely disappeared. In fact, the development of the market is likely to be halted by the supply side, rather than lack of demand. The swaps market affords little opportunity for borrowers without a need for D-Marks to swap into other currencies. With interest rates widely believed to be set to fall, there is a lack of counterparties willing to pay fixed-rate D-Marks. While many sovereign and supranational borrowers hold some funds in D-Marks, relatively few companies need to borrow D-Marks. But sovereign and state borrowers are expected to return to the market soon.</p>

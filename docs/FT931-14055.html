			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minneapolis exchange sees big future for shrimps THE MINNEAPOLIS Grain Exchange, best known for spring wheat futures, is planning to cast its net wider by introducing a shrimp contract, reports Reuter from Minneapolis. 'It's highly unusual. . . but there are some very good reasons to trade shrimp,' said exchange president Mr James Landau yesterday. 'Our contract is going to be based principally on white shrimp which is grown mainly in Ecuador.' Chinese shrimp will also be allowed. 'Research indicates that the timing is right for a shrimp futures market. Extremely volatile prices, which used to be much more predictable, dramatic increases in US shrimp consumption and momentous changes in production have meant high risk for importers, end users and producers,' he said. The exchange will also seek approval for a shrimp options contract. Mr Landau said the MGE's board of directors approved the proposal and had submitted it to its members. Member approval is expected by January 29 and the exchange will then submit the plan to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US commodities watchdog, the following week. Assuming CFTC approval, the contract could begin trading by the end of the summer, Mr Landau said. Ecuador produces about 73 per cent of the farm-raised shrimp in the western hemisphere.</p>

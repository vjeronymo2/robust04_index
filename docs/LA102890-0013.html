			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART WORLD: CONNECTING SPIRIT AND MATTER;  </P> <P> L.A.'S SABINA OTT, OPENING A GALLERY SHOW IN SANTA MONICA, FINDS A METAPHOR IN  ROSES THAT AREN'T ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL  </P> <P> In a 1989 show at New York's Charles Cowles Gallery, Sabina Ott began her  series of encaustic (wax) paintings on the theme "Disappearance and Return"  with a body of works examining narcissism and the absence of self. Now,  returning to her hometown of Los Angeles with a show of the same title at Santa  Monica's Pence Gallery, Ott fills that absence by using the metaphor of the  rose as "the synthesis between the spiritual and material worlds."  </P> <P> In her paintings, Ott says, the rose acts as a metaphor for the human body. But  unlike the traditional image, Ott's layered roses are not always beautiful. One  work, for instance, features blue roses on a flesh-toned background to  represent bruises on skin.  </P> <P> "Each painting focuses on using the rose as a different aspect of the body,"  says Ott, 35, who has been working with wax since 1987. Conceptual art, she  says, has had a heavy influence on her work.  </P> <P> "So much of art is about ideas; I set up a conceptual skeleton and then use the  paint and materials to flesh it out. Through these paintings I set up a  vocabulary, almost like a code with an alphabet -- I want the work to pose that  question of 'How do these works relate to each other?' It's very much about  multiple readings, and one painting really should not be taken on its own  without looking at the rest of the work."  </P> <P> As an example of how her pieces interrelate, Ott pointed out a four-panel work  in which each of the small scenes depicted shows up later in a larger work.  </P> <P> "The piece operates as a kind of legend or map . . . giving you the beginnings  of the alphabet" for the rest of the works, says Ott, an active member of the  L.A. Coalition for Freedom of Expression who was featured this summer in a  two-person show at Washington's Corcoran Gallery.  </P> <P> As for the wax, Ott says she likes the "mutability" of the medium and the fact  that it "complicates" her work.  </P> <P> "I started with strictly paint, but gradually I outgrew that way of looking at  things. I needed a new and more complex way of setting up questions in the  work," she says.  </P> <P> THE SCENE  </P> <P> After more than a year of work, Kent Twitchell has completed his  4,000-square-foot L.A. Marathon Mural along the wall of the northbound San  Diego Freeway, between Century and Manchester boulevards.  </P> <P> The mural depicts 26 runners, ranging from four-time Olympian Rod Dixon of New  Zealand to novice runner John Dolan of Sierra Madre. It "extracts the essence  of the marathon" by picking out a handful of runners from the "sea of  thousands," Twitchell says.  </P> <P> Plans for Twitchell's second L.A. Marathon Mural, which will take up 7,700  square feet along the westbound Santa Monica Freeway between National and  Overland boulevards, are already in progress.  </P> <P> More than $1 million has been raised to date for Harvey Gantt's North Carolina  U.S. Senate campaign by the sale of lithographs by nine noted artists,  including Jasper Johns, Robert Motherwell and Ed Ruscha. The prints are on view  at Santa Monica's James Corcoran and Dorothy Goldeen galleries and at Melrose  Avenue's Gemini G.E.L.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles-based service organization Arts Inc. is updating and expanding  its directory of nonprofit arts organizations in Los Angeles County and has  sent census forms out to about 400 organizations.  </P> <P> The deadline for organizations to return the questionnaire is Nov. 9, and  copies of the new directory will be available in early 1991.  </P> <P> OVERHEARD  </P> <P>  "Where did all these young, new artists come from? I can remember when Jill  Geigerich was the only 'new' artist who got any attention. Now it seems half  the galleries are filled with 'new' artists." -- A middle-aged man, during a  Saturday afternoon trek around Santa Monica galleries.  </P> <P> CURRENTS  </P> <P> The Art Dealers Assn. of America and its member galleries have raised $51,150  for the legal defense fund of the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, and  the association is urging other arts groups to mount their own fund-raising  campaigns for the center.  </P> <P> The center and its director, Dennis Barrie, were acquitted on obscenity charges  connected with the center's showing of "Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect  Moment," but accrued more than $300,000 in legal defense fees.  </P> <P> "We have won the battle and reaffirmed our First Amendment rights, but the  drain on our finances jeopardizes the future of the arts center," said director  Barrie, who noted that the ADDA's gift and challenge to other groups would help  ensure the future of the center.  </P> <P> DEBUTS  </P> <P> West German-born figurative painter Sara Rossberg has her first U.S. gallery  show at Beverly Hills' Louis Newman Galleries through Nov. 8. Based in London,  Rossberg has shown extensively in European galleries and has been featured in  international art fairs in Basel, Cologne, Los Angeles, Dusseldorf and Madrid.  </P> <P> Sculptor Vincent Shine has his first exhibition in Los Angeles at Santa  Monica's Michael Kohn Gallery through Dec. 1. Shine, whose plastic sculptures  depict various forms of plant life, has previously had solo shows in Chicago,  New York and Vienna.  </P> <P> HAPPENING  </P> <P> The Craft &amp; Folk Art Museum's 1990 International Festival of Masks will be  held today in Hancock County Park (southwest corner of Wilshire Boulevard and  Curson Avenue).

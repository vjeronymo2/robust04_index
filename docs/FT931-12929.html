			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (1): Facing harsh realities - If it succeeds, Ukraine's programme of reforms will set an important example for other former Soviet republics and also elicit a sigh of relief from its eastern European neighbours FOR the rest of the world, Ukraine's emergence as a fully independent state has come as a not entirely welcome surprise. Just a few months before Ukraine's referendum on independence on December 1 1991, US President George Bush solemnly lectured Ukrainian leaders on the need to remain within the Soviet Union. The day after an overwhelming 90 per cent of Ukrainians voted for sovereignty, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev appeared on television to tell them that their ballots did not reflect a popular desire to leave the Soviet Union. In defiance of this advice, Ukraine has quietly but firmly prevented the Commonwealth of Independent States from growing into anything more than a talking shop. At the same time, the government of President Leonid Kravchuk put muscle behind its diplomacy by winning the allegiance of former Soviet soldiers serving on Ukrainian territory, giving Ukraine the largest army in Europe to the west of Russia. At home, Mr Kravchuk has developed a national vision sufficiently tough to secure the loyalty of fiercely patriotic western Ukraine, yet mild enough not to alienate the Russified east. By initially putting together an ideologically diverse coalition of nationalists and former communists in the capital city, he has earned for his country a reputation as one of the most stable, if least progressive, former Soviet republics. But independent Ukraine, with a population nearly as large as Britain's and a territory the size of France, has not met with the warm western embrace many nationalist politicians anticipated in the first heady days of sovereignty. The US has been concerned chiefly with trying to bully Ukraine into giving up its nuclear missiles while western Europe remains largely indifferent. Russia, meanwhile, has yet to come to terms with having an independent, and not necessarily co-operative, Ukraine on its western border. Negotiations over the division of military and financial assets have been tense, while Moscow became so exasperated with the Ukrainian government's refusal, under the leadership of Mr Vitold Fokin, former prime minister, to stop creating rouble bank credits that it effectively forced Ukraine to leave the rouble zone last November. Only Ukraine's eastern European neighbours, happy at last to have a strong state separating them from Russia, have greeted Ukraine with enthusiasm. For the most part, Ukrainian leaders have been forced to draw the conclusion expressed in a recent interview by Mr Leonid Kuchma, the new and economically progressive prime minister. 'We know that independent Ukraine is a bone in the throats of many countries,' he said. 'Many nations would prefer that Ukraine did not exist.' A year ago, when Ukraine was preoccupied with establishing its place in the world, no one in Kiev would have dared to speak so bluntly. Ukraine today is at the same time more self-confident and more coldly realistic. As the country's economic problems have mounted, Mr Kravchuk and his romantic nationalism have faded into the background, and a team of economists and industrialists, led by the hard-headed Mr Kuchma, has taken centre stage. The shift in power has been dictated by a shift in political focus. The concern with the attributes of independence - flags and anthems - and its guarantor - the army - has given way to dismay at the collapse in the value of Ukraine's fledgling currency against both the dollar and the rouble. The World Bank estimates that Ukraine's economy contracted by 20 per cent last year while inflation was 2,500 per cent. After less than three months in office, Mr Kuchma - previously director of the world's largest rocket factory - has concluded that the only solution is a radical move to the market. His government tripled state food prices in December and abolished most agricultural subsidies. It is now pressing ahead with plans to commercialise state enterprises and privatise retail and agriculture sectors. 'I cannot imagine doing anything other than maintaining the reform programme and I will continue with the steps I have taken,' Mr Kuchma says. 'There is no other path. If someone could show me another path and say it were possible not to raise prices I would take it, but I do not think it exists.' Mr Kuchma's government has the authority to rule the economy by decree until May and has already used its expanded power to produce a stream of market-oriented decrees. Yet, few of the really tough decisions have been taken. The real test will be whether the government can act to stop the extension of credits to struggling state enterprises; the first steps in this direction have already provoked fierce opposition from factory directors, and from workers who will lose their jobs, particularly in the eastern regions which are heavily dependent on coal-mining, and least loyal to the new Ukraine. In the short term, Mr Kuchma has the political strength to push through unpopular measures. Parliament, under pressure from its reformist chairman, Mr Ivan Pliushch, agreed in November to restrict its own right to pass economic legislation. In theory, parliament can reject any decree within 10 days after the cabinet has issued it. However, given the legislature's sluggish reaction time and Mr Pliushch's skill at riding rough-shod over dissenting voices, Mr Kuchma has considerable authority in in Kiev. Whether the reforms will succeed depends, in large part, on whether they are implemented locally. The network of presidential representatives, created last year by Mr Kravchuk to extend his authority to the regions, is now responsible to the prime minister as well. But the reforms risk being blocked by the state bureaucrats and factory and farm directors who are profiting from the chaos in the Ukrainian economy. The government wants to use economic reform to reduce the power of the bureaucrats and Mr Kuchma has launched a high-profile anti-corruption drive. But these vested interests will put up a formidable fight against market measures. While Ukrainian reformers face powerful enemies at home in their efforts to find solutions to the economic problems which are at the top of this year's political agenda, the external issues which preoccupied Ukraine last year will continue to influence the government's course. Ukraine's most important foreign relationship remains that with Russia. Last year, Ukraine's chief worry was that Russia would stand in the way of its independence drive and pursue unresolved territorial claims over the Crimean peninsula; this year Ukrainians are concerned that Russia's insistence on world prices for its oil will, in Mr Kuchma's words, result in 'a complete paralysis of Ukrainian industry.' Ukraine, like eastern Europe two years ago, will be required to pay a stiff price for its independence. One solution to Ukraine's balance of trade crisis with Russia might be a western financial aid package to support Ukrainian reforms and help wean the Ukrainian economy away from its dependency on Russian oil. Yet, western aid could hinge on the outcome of the escalating dispute between Ukraine and the US over the 176 Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles located on Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainian parliament is hesitating over ratification of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start 1), which provides for the dismantling of all the Ukrainian missiles, in an attempt to extract security guarantees and economic aid. America has been slow to listen to Ukraine's demands, expecting Kiev to cave in to strong diplomatic pressure. But Ukrainian leaders have yet again taken the State Department by surprise. Mr Kuchma's reaction has been to accuse America of 'treating Ukraine like a puppet' and to point out that, having given Ukraine little aid, America has little leverage. Over the next few months, America and the other G7 countries may find themselves compelled to take Ukraine more seriously, and not just because of the nuclear missiles. If it succeeds, Ukraine's reform programme will set an important example for other former Soviet republics and elicit a sigh of relief from its eastern European neighbours. If it fails, the existence of an economically collapsing Ukraine alongside a troubled Russia could imperil the security of the entire region.</p>

General Secretary Do Muoi gave a report to sum up the work  over the past two and a half years and set down the tasks for  the next two and a half years.    The report said the achievements have been made mainly in  three areas, including a very important initial step in  overcoming the socio-economic crisis, continued political  stability and expanded foreign ties with other countries.    Vietnam began a reform program in 1989, switching from a  planned economy to a socialist market system.    Do Muoi noted that although numerous weakness remained, the  achievements have created pre-conditions for the  industrialization and modernization of the country's economy.    The report ascribed the achievements to the leadership of  the  Communist Party, rejecting the multi-party political system.    It also stressed that economic development must be linked  with social justice, reflecting the reasonable distribution of  goods and the means of production and fully developing the  capability of every citizen.    The conference is mid-way between the Seventh National  Conference of the Vietnamese Communist Party held in 1991 and  the Eighth National Conference in two and a half years time.</p>

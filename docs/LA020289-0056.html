			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> 31 VICTIMS AIRLIFTED ABROAD;  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S WOUNDS SHOW AGONY OF AFGHAN CONFLICT  </P> <P> Her face was filled with the horror of war, her body torn apart by its weapons.  </P> <P> But even with her leg bone exposed by the shell that ripped through her as she  played on a Kabul street more than seven months ago, 6-year-old Aquila sat in  stoic silence Wednesday at the Kabul International Airport.  </P> <P> So did 14-year-old Abdul Farid, who sat beside her. Farid lost his right eye  and arm when a land mine blew up in his neighborhood. And there wasn't so much  as a wince out of Abdul Munir, 12, as he recalled the day four months ago that  a magnesium flare exploded and burned off his face and hands.  </P> <P> The 31 Afghan children assembled at the airport Wednesday afternoon had a great  deal in common. They are all war wounded, innocent victims of one of the  world's longest and most intractable wars. They are all scarred for life  because Afghanistan's medical care, like so much in this impoverished nation,  simply cannot cope with the level of human devastation that a nine-year  guerrilla war has wrought.  </P> <P> Most of their wounds are old -- mistreated or untreated -- and more than a  third are infected to the very marrow of the bones, just as the Afghan war has  eaten into the core of this nation's next generation.  </P> <P> The 31 children were the fortunate few selected for a medical airlift to West  Germany by an apolitical, nonpartisan international aid foundation called Peace  Village International.  </P> <P> "We don't care about the politics -- whoever is going to rule this country, we  don't care," said Dr. Eberhard Thoma, the German physician who had spent 10  days in Kabul examining and selecting the children most in need of treatment  abroad. "We believe only that these children are wounded. We don't care by whom  they were wounded or why."  </P> <P> The individual tragedies assembled on Afghan Airlines Flight 314 Wednesday  offered only a glimpse of this war, but they represent the stark human side of  the conflict that has raged relentlessly since even before Soviet troops were  sent into Afghanistan in the winter of 1979. It is a perspective that has been  all but lost in the recent weeks of political maneuvering as the Soviets  approach their final week of a U.N.-mediated troop withdrawal that began last  May.  </P> <P> Until recently, most of the horror stories of the war have come out of the  Pakistani border city of Peshawar, the headquarters for 3.2 million Afghan  refugees who have fled the fighting.  </P> <P> The families of Aquila, Abdul Farid and Abdul Munir did not flee. They remained  in this beleaguered capital throughout the rocket and artillery barrages, the  mining operations and the urban guerrilla attacks of the U.S.-backed  moujahedeen, the Afghans fighting the Soviet troops and the Moscow-backed  Afghan government. In fact, war is all that most of these children have ever  known -- war and the shortages that it has produced in a nation that already  ranked among the world's three poorest.  </P> <P> "For each child, the story is basically the same," Thoma said. "They were on  their way to school or out playing. They were in the street. They were in the  house. They were in a bus, and that was it. Something exploded, and they were  injured by coincidence."  </P> <P> The stories are always compounded by Afghanistan's crushing poverty.  </P> <P> "I've seen things in the past 10 days in Afghanistan that I have never in my  life seen -- and hope I never see again," Thoma said in an interview on the  flight out of Kabul. "There simply isn't enough of anything here.  </P> <P> "I've seen compound fractures that couldn't be set because there is no plaster  of Paris. I've seen raw bones left exposed for months because there was nothing  to wrap them with. I've seen the small feet and arms of children grown deformed  because there was nothing to set them with. And almost always, the neglect has  resulted in bone marrow infections. It is just such a poor country, you cannot  imagine."  </P> <P> Thoma added, however, that the lifelong poverty has hardened the children now  under his care.  </P> <P> "Maybe it is because they have so little that they expect so little and are so  calm about what this war has done to them," he said.  </P> <P> Still, it is against this backdrop of poverty that, after the last Soviet  soldier leaves Kabul, the embattled Afghan government will wage war against the  Islamic guerrillas, who have received $2 billion in arms, ammunition and  supplies from the United States.  </P> <P> And it is because of this poverty that the parents of the 31 war-wounded  children agreed to entrust them to the German aid mission for long-term care  and repair.  </P> <P> Thoma said that most of the children will remain at hospitals or at the peace  village complex in Oberhausen, West Germany, for six months to a year to undo  the damage. Bones will be reset, marrow infections will be treated with  antibiotics, a rare commodity in Kabul, and plastic surgeons and prosthetic  experts will attempt to repair or replace the scarred, incinerated skin and  amputated limbs.  </P> <P> "In every case, though, these children will be returned to Afghanistan when  they are well, no matter what group is in power," Thoma said. "These are not  refugees. These are innocent children. How can innocent children have an  ideology? And yet it's always the innocent, the children and the civilians, who  suffer most from war."  </P> <P> Mark Fineman reported this story while trying to enter Afghanistan but was  forced by Afghan authorities to return to New Delhi.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Orel Hershiser picked up his National League Cy Young and World Series MVP  awards in New York, saying a few words bound to get the Dodgers' attention.  </P> <P> "I hope this city is easy on me," Hershiser said only half-jokingly, "because  I'm a free agent in 1 year and you never know." Hershiser quickly added, "I  hope Mr. (Peter) O'Malley (Dodger owner) doesn't hear this."  </P> <P> Hershiser and the Dodgers probably will go to arbitration over this season's  contract. He has said he may explore free agency next year if the Dodgers don't  offer him a satisfactory multi-year deal.  </P></p>

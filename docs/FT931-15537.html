			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The London GOLD price moved to a fresh 7-year low in late trading, following the trend in New York, where the tone was undermined by Middle East selling. Earlier steadiness in European markets had been attributed to central bank activity. 'No-one wants to buy gold,' commented one New York analyst; 'there's no inflation to speak of.' At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices reversed the uptrend of late last week with cash metal ending Pounds 46.50 down at Pounds 1,492.50 a tonne. Dealers said this reflected the presence of China, which last week had been a persistent buyer, as a net seller. ALUMINIUM prices rose in late trading on widespread talk of US production or smelter power problems. The three months price closed at Dollars 1,242.50 a tonne, up Dollars 35.75 from Friday, and moved on to Dollars 1,248 in kerb (after hours) trading. Earlier news that International Primary Aluminium Institute producer stocks fell by 28,000 tonnes in November was only marginally supportive as some dealers had expected a much larger fall. Other metals were mostly lower. Compiled from Reuters</p>

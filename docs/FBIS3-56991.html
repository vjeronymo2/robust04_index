			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by diplomatic </F> correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy  Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] The Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Foreign  Affairs, Vladimir Lukin, has addressed to the Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev a formal request for the package of international  treaties and other acts, subject to parliamentary ratification.    He told INTERFAX on Friday [21 January] that he had asked  the  minister to set priorities on the documents' review.    In line with the federal Constitution, the Duma endorses the  appointment and the calling of Russia's ambassadors. For this  reason, Lukin also asked Kozyrev to spell out his suggestions on  this score, too.    Russia's ambassador to the U.S. before his election to the  Duma, Lukin explained that formally he was still ambassador,  even though he had sent a letter of resignation to President  Yeltsin.    He reported that his committee had held its first session on  Thursday. "We know what to do, but we don't know where to do it  since up until now we've had no premises to house the  committee," Lukin said.    He said that he had initiated parliamentary debates on the  situation in the former Yugoslavia and had drafted an  appropriate statement.    An alternative draft on the Yugoslav crisis, according to  Lukin, had been prepared by three factions -- the Communists,  Agrarians, and Liberal-Democrats.    Lukin voiced "grave concern" over NATO's persistent  discussions on the possibility of hitting targets in the former  Yugoslavia.    The document notes that force will hardly end the war there  but will only aggravate the conflict.    In Lukin's opinion, the Duma should urge the president and  government "to spare no effort to avoid the escalation of  fighting in the former Yugoslavia."    In the alternative draft, the Communists, Agrarians, and  Liberal- Democrats describe as "inadmissible any coercive  measure against the former Yugoslav republics, including the  establishment of no-fly zones."    The Russian side is requested to adopt "appropriate  measures"  within the framework of the UN Security Council "for getting  these recommendations implemented."</p>

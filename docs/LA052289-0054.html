			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALFONSIN OKS EARLY EXIT AS ARGENTINE PRESIDENT  </P> <P> In the face of a devastating economic crisis, President Raul Alfonsin agreed  Sunday to move up the inauguration of his Peronist successor rather than  stagger through a seven-month transition.  </P> <P> Leaders of Alfonsin's incumbent Radical Civic Union and advisers to  President-elect Carlos Saul Menem are negotiating legal changes so that  Alfonsin's term would conclude early, probably July 9 -- Argentina's  independence day -- instead of Dec. 10 as scheduled, officials from the two  parties said.  </P> <P> In a statement Sunday, Alfonsin did not mention a date, saying merely that  negotiators from the two parties were working out a formal accord to allow  Menem to assume office "in the near future."  </P> <P> Early today, Radical party leaders said that the talks with the Peronists had  not yet produced a date for the transfer of power. In a statement, they  stressed that the party had not asked for the early transition, but wanted to  show "maturity and patriotism" in coping with the crisis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bitter End  </P> <P> Handing over power prematurely would be a bitter end to Alfonsin's term, which  brought a consolidation of civil liberties in Argentina but also saw the onset  of an economic nightmare that ensured Menem's landslide victory May 14 over the  Radicals' candidate, Eduardo Cesar Angeloz.  </P> <P> The Radicals have seemed incapable of providing direction to the economy in  recent weeks. Workers' buying power has vanished in a cloud of inflation, and  some consumer goods and medicines are scarce because suppliers cannot set  realistic prices. Foreign lenders won't provide fresh loans because the  government is $3 billion in arrears on its $60-billion debt.  </P> <P> The crisis led the parties to agree to shorten the transition to calm the  current chaos in financial markets stemming from uncertainty over the long  interregnum. The dollar shot up by nearly 70% in the week since Menem's  victory, further fueling inflation expected to reach 50% for May alone.  </P> <P> The plan would require the provincial electoral colleges to meet quickly and  designate Menem as president -- a formality since he won a majority of  electoral college votes -- and to have Congress adopt a law changing the  inauguration date. The electoral college had been scheduled to meet Aug. 10.  Alfonsin thus would not formally be resigning but merely concluding a shortened  term.  </P> <P> Alfonsin, 62, took office in 1983 after his own landslide victory following a  seven-year military dictatorship. The constitutional transition from one  elected president to another will be the first in Argentina in 61 years, and  all parties are determined to maintain the constitutional order.  </P> <P> As recently as Friday, both Menem and Alfonsin insisted that the inauguration  take place as scheduled Dec. 10.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 20 Jan (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin said here today that China and the United States should  have more contacts and exchanges at different levels, build up  mutual trust and make joint efforts to push bilateral relations  gradually onto the normal track.    Jiang made the remark during a meeting with U.S. Secretary  of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen this afternoon in Zhongnanhai.    Bentsen is the first U.S. cabinet member to visit China  since  the presidents of the two countries met in Seattle last November.    Jiang, welcoming Bentsen, said that he hoped that the  treasury secretary's visit would increase bilateral  mutual-understanding.    Bentsen noted that both the United States and China are big  countries and they share a huge trade volume.    The United States hopes to promote its economic and trade  cooperation with China, said Bentsen.    He told Jiang that President Clinton was much impressed with  his meeting with Jiang in Seattle and the U.S. President  "appreciated the wise counsel you offered during the meeting."    Jiang said that he had a very successful talk with U.S.  President Bill Clinton during the Seattle meeting and they had  reached a common understanding, which is that the relationship  between China and the United States is very important.    He said that the Seattle meeting created a new start for the  development of bilateral relations and he hoped that such a  momentum would be maintained.    The Chinese president said that both China and the United  States should seize the current opportunity and create more  contacts and exchanges at different levels, build up mutual  trust, and make joint efforts to push Sino-U.S. relations  gradually onto the normal track of development.    Sino-U.S. trade and economic ties are a very important part  of bilateral relations, Jiang said, and China is focusing on the  construction of modernization while the United States is also  facing a task of vitalizing its economy, and the two economies  are strongly complementary.    Therefore, he said, expanding exchanges and cooperation  between the two sides in the fields of economy, trade, science  and technology are in line with the practical interests of the  two peoples.    China will quicken its pace in reform, opening-up and the  establishment of the socialist market economy in 1994, Jiang  said, and this has created new opportunities for further  development of trade and economic ties between China and the  United States.    Jiang expressed the hope that the treasury secretary would  gain a better knowledge of China's economic development and its  potential through the current visit.    Earlier this afternoon, Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji met  with Bentsen and his party and hosted a luncheon in their honor  in the Great Hall of the People. In a candid and friendly [tan  shuai you hao 0982 3764 0646 1170] atmosphere, they exchanged  views on development of bilateral economic relations and trade.</p>

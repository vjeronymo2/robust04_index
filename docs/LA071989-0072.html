			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S VISIT TO POLAND  </P> <P> I didn't vote for President Bush, but as a third generation Polish-American, I  can't help but love him! First we get a Polish Pope, now we get a President who  likes us. Maybe praying does work, after all.  </P> <P> Did anyone notice the photo on Page 8, Part I, July 12? Overseeing the dinner  with the President and Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was Our Lady of  Czestchowa, the black Madonna who performs miracles in Poland. We should give  her a visa to perform some miracles here.  </P> <P> MARY JACOBS  </P> <P> Westlake Village  </P></p>

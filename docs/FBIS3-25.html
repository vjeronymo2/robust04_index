			<p>In     the wake of the Hebron massacre, both Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres have hinted that the  Israeli Government is laying the groundwork for dismantling a few  controversial Jewish settlements.  Both leaders appear concerned  to present any such action as a unilateral Israeli decision to  head off criticism that they are bowing to Palestinian demands on  the settlements, an issue which was to have been deferred to  final status negotiations under the Israel-PLO Declaration of  Principles (DOP).  Rabin seemed deliberately vague in a recent  interview when asked if he favored moving settlers from the town  of Hebron, where several small settler enclaves have become a  focus of attention following the massacre.  He first said "I will  not answer" the question, then went on to point out that the DOP  did not call for moving settlements during the current phase of  negotiations.  Therefore, he continued, there is no requirement  to move any settlers "on the basis of the negotiations with the  PLO" and the matter is "currently not on the agenda" of the  negotiations, a position that seemed to leave open the  possibility of action taken outside the framework of Israel-  Palestinian talks.  Rabin also hinted that he is willing to  negotiate with Yasir 'Arafat over the PLO leader's demand for an  armed international observer force in the occupied territories,  twice telling his interviewer "I do not conduct negotiations with  ['Arafat] through you" when pressed on the matter (IDF radio, 8  March).      Peres, who prior to the massacre had openly questioned the  justification for preserving a small settlement in the Gaza  Strip, (Qol Yisra'el radio, 12 February) reportedly echoed  Rabin's remarks on settlements in speaking with journalists on 8  March.  As reported by The Jerusalem Post the next day, he said  that "public opinion must be prepared for the possible  dismantling of some settlements," but that the question of  settlements "is an internal Israeli affair" and "completely  divorced from the current negotiations with the PLO."  He  explained that the Israeli Government had insisted on deferring  the settlement issue to final status negotiations while  negotiating the DOP in order to minimize public opposition to the  DOP.  The government, he said, would "seek to convince the  public" that evacuating some settlements "needs to be done," but  "it cannot come as a result of PLO demands."   (AUTHOR: MORTON.

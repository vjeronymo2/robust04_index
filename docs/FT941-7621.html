			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Labour leaders resist shops bill policy switch A Labour policy switch on Sunday trading aimed at securing the defeat of the bill providing for limited de-regulation in England and Wales was ruled out by Ms Joan Ruddock, a junior shadow home office minister, in the Commons last night. She made clear that Labour MPs would not be whipped to vote against the third reading in spite of the government's refusal to include improved employment protection provisions in the bill. Ms Ruddock said Labour MPs would have a free vote - as they did for the second reading of the bill. Mr Ray Powell, a Labour whip who is sponsored by the Usdaw shopworkers' union, bitterly attacked the free vote decision. He recalled that Labour MPs were subjected to a three-line whip during the committee stage on the employment protection issue. Mr David Alton, Liberal Democrat MP for Liverpool Mossley Hill, protested that the second reading majority, to which he contributed, had been obtained on the basis of a 'false prospectus'. Mr Alton looked to the House of Lords to remedy the situation should it prove impossible to defeat the bill in the Commons.</p>

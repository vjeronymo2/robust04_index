			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Campbell Soup in the red after Dollars 300m write-off CAMPBELL SOUP, the US foods group, yesterday disclosed a net loss of Dollars 115.9m, or 46 cents per share, in its second quarter ended January 31. The quarterly deficit was caused by a previously anticipated Dollars 300m write-off taken in connection with an international restructuring and divestiture programme that included plant closures. Campbell achieved Dollars 160.6m net profits, or 64 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. The New Jersey-based company said its sales reached record levels during the quarter, having risen by 2 per cent year-on-year to Dollars 1.79bn. Sales for the first six months of the fiscal year were 6 per cent improved at Dollars 3.48bn, while net earnings for the six months were Dollars 40.7m, or 16 cents per share, down from Dollars 289.8m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, in the first half of the 1992 fiscal year. Mr David Johnson, president and chief executive of Campbell, said that before restructuring charges the company's net earnings were actually 18 per cent higher in the first six months. 'In the teeth of a tough competitive environment worldwide, we have delivered strong results for the second quarter,' Mr Johnson said. He noted that Campbell Soup had launched more than 70 new products and said the group's new strategy would further focus on strong brand names. Campbell's North and South American division, the single largest business, reported a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter operating earnings before restructuring charges. Sales for the division were 4 per cent better at Dollars 1.29bn. The biscuit and bakery division had a 2 per cent decrease in operating earnings before charges with sales 1 per cent lower at Dollars 214.2m in the quarter. Operating earnings in the second quarter for Campbell Europe/Asia increased by 10 per cent before restructuring charges. Sales were 1 per cent lower at Dollars 290.2m.

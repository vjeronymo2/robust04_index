			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 79TH CALIFORNIA AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> PLENTY OF LUCK -- ALL BAD -- COSTS STEINBERG IN QUARTERFINALS FOR THIRD YEAR IN  A ROW  </P> <P> Craig Steinberg will be back at work today, back to the business of making  eyeglasses. You can safely bet, however, that he won't be making any with  rose-colored lenses.  </P> <P> Steinberg, you see, won't be in the most cheerful of moods after spending  several hours Thursday looking at the dark side of golf.  </P> <P> Playing the Pebble Beach Golf Links, one of the most stunningly beautiful  courses in the world, Steinberg saw the stinking stockyards of Chicago.  </P> <P> When others looked out on a heart-warming scene of fluffy sea otters cavorting  in the water, Steinberg saw oversized rats.  </P> <P> Steinberg returned to the quarterfinals of the 79th California Amateur golf  championship for the third year in a row, something no other golfer has ever  done. But Steinberg, of Van Nuys, also was trounced in the quarterfinals for  the third year in a row. Another record.  </P> <P> This time it was 18-year-old Charlie Wi's turn to bring the sky crashing down  on Steinberg's head, ousting him from the tournament by a score of 3 and 1 in  match play. Wi, who won later in the semifinals, plays in today's championship  match.  </P> <P> Steinberg drove home last night.  </P> <P> "The good news is that this saves me the $150 for a hotel room," Steinberg  said.  </P> <P> It was his only attempt at humor.  </P> <P> "It's frustrating," he said. "Very frustrating. This is three years in a row  now and making it to the quarterfinals is not overly satisfying anymore.  There's only one guy who leaves here happy. And once again, it's not me."  </P> <P> Steinberg is an accomplished amateur golfer. He is the 1988 Southern California  Golf Assn. amateur champion and has made 11 appearances in the tournament,  which accepts a field of 102 golfers from the several hundred who attempt to  qualify for it each year.  </P> <P> But none of that matters to Steinberg each year when he makes the trip to the  Monterey Peninsula, only to be sent home early.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Steinberg was the victim of some fine play by Wi as well as his  own misfortune. Several times he sent iron shots screaming at the pins only to  have the ball bounce oddly away from the target.  </P> <P> "People who win this tournament get good bounces, at least a few of them," he  said. "I didn't get any. I can't recall a single real good break I got all  day."  </P> <P> The ugliest may have come on the 17th hole, a par-3 that is 209 yards of pure  beauty stretching toward the sea.  </P> <P> It's beautiful, of course, until you have to play it. Steinberg's tee shot hit  the middle of the green and hopped weirdly to the right, onto the fringe of the  green.  </P> <P> He then had a delicate chip shot that he appeared to hit well. But the ball  came down on the last blades of rough ringing the green and, despite being on a  steep hillside, stopped dead.  </P> <P> "Incredible!" Steinberg shouted to no one in particular as he watched the ball  -- and his chances of catching Wi -- die.  </P> <P> An hour later, he was still discussing it. With no one.  </P> <P> "I just can't believe what happened," he said. "I could spit on that grass in  the same place and it would get to the green. That ball stuck like a magnet."  </P> <P> And being so close to the final and a chance at winning the tournament doesn't  soothe Steinberg.  </P> <P> "It's always an empty feeling when you lose," he said. "It might even be worse  when you get this close and then lose."  </P></p>

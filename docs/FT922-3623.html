			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Companies warned on accounting COMPANIES must state clearly in their annual reports any divergence from UK accounting standards, the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the accounting watchdog, warned yesterday. Mr Edwin Glasgow QC, panel chairman, said the law required a clear, unambiguous statement of compliance with the standards or any reasons for departures from them. He said some companies had used unacceptable phrases, such as compliance 'except where the directors consider a departure necessary', or 'except where indicated below'. Mr Glasgow's public statement - the first he has made since becoming chairman in February - follows letters to 240 companies that have failed to comply with the requirement in the 1985 Companies Act. The number of companies warned by the panel has declined in the past few months as increasing numbers have heeded its previous warnings on the subject.</p>

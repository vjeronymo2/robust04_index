			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe, of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], the German armed  forces now have to be geared toward future tasks as far as their  abilities and structures are concerned. After the Federal  Cabinet adopted the "1994 white paper" on Tuesday [15 March],  Ruehe told the press that the compulsory military service system  would remain a "constituent element of the Bundeswehr."    The army is underfinanced, and its duties and funds must now  be harmonized, Ruehe said. The important thing is to carry out  consistent streamlining schemes now. He had ordered the  necessary studies, the minister said. The ratio between  investments and operational spending must be improved to the  advantage of investments. The Bundeswehr must remain efficient  and modern.    By reducing the strength of the armed forces to a maximum of  370,000 men, as agreed in a treaty concluded between Federal  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in  the Caucasus in 1990, this process will be largely concluded.  Ruehe emphasized that precedence has to be given to the  establishment of readily available crisis reaction forces.    Germany must be able to participate in all UN tasks without  any reservations. The Federal Government is ready to assume  this responsibility. Clarifying the constitutional basis for  all Bundeswehr missions is thus in the interest of the  predictability of Germany's foreign and security policy and in  the interest of the Bundeswehr. NATO's, the European Union's,  the CSCE's, and the United Nations's ability for  crisis-management must improve.    The army needs light, air mobile, and air mechanized units  for the crisis reaction forces. In addition, air transport  capacities must be extended. The navy must also provide forces  for crisis reaction. According to Ruehe, the Bundeswehr's  "control and strategic surveillance capability" are of vital  importance in this connection. It must be possible to transfer  armed forces contingents over large distances by sea and air.  In this connection it is also important to secure the supply  for these forces.    Ruehe pointed out that, since 1990, the Bundeswehr has been  engaged in the greatest transformation process in its history.  The white paper, due to appear on 5 April, shows that Germany's  security is now higher than ever before, Ruehe said. Never  before has Germany's strategic situation been as favorable as it  is now. "Today we are surrounded only by friends and  democracies, all of Germany is enjoying the protection of NATO  and the European Union."    The current document is the ninth white paper. The last  report was issued in 1985 by Manfred Woerner, who was the CDU  defense minister at the time. The first white paper on security  policy was published in 1969 during the era of the Grand  Coalition.</p>

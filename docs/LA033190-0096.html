			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> 14 ARRESTED IN CRACKDOWN ON BAD CHECKS  </P> <P> Fourteen people suspected of writing bad checks were arrested Friday during the  first day of a two-day roundup by the Ventura County District Attorney's Bureau  of Investigation.  </P> <P> Another nine suspects agreed to appear in court Monday on misdemeanor charges  of writing checks without sufficient funds, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Vinse  Gilliam.  </P> <P> Of those arrested, only James Reyes, 28, of Oxnard was charged with a felony.  He allegedly wrote bad checks totaling $7,588, then refused to provide  restitution to numerous victims, Gilliam said.  </P> <P> Other suspects had allegedly written bad checks in amounts of $178 to $1,430.  The writing of any such check for more than $400 can be prosecuted as a felony.  </P> <P> Fifteen teams of investigators began serving more than 300 arrest warrants  early Friday in cases in which $200,000 in restitution had been ordered but was  never collected.  </P> <P> Those to be arrested all had been contacted by the district attorney's office,  by mail and by telephone, Gilliam said.  </P> <P> "We only use the arrest warrants as a last resort," he said.  </P> <P> Friday's effort brings to 53 the number of people arrested for writing bad  checks in a 2 1/2-month push capped by this weekend's crackdown, prosecutors  said.  </P> <P> Those arrested can no longer be cleared of the criminal charges simply by  paying the money they owe for the bad checks, Gilliam said. "Once a case goes  to warrant, we will not accept restitution" in lieu of prosecution, he said.  </P> <P> The two-day effort is aimed at reducing a backlog of 671 bad-check arrest  warrants that had never been served, according to the district attorney's  office.  </P> <P> The bad-check unit was created in 1986 by Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury.  Since then, it has collected and returned about $1.65 million to local  merchants and others.  </P> <P> Bradbury said the program operates at no cost to taxpayers or the victims. The  unit collects about $14,000 a month in fees from suspects, while program  expenses have averaged about $11,730.  </P> <P> More than 500 cases in which the loss was substantial or restitution was  withheld have been prosecuted, Bradbury said.

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (8): Overheated and under-insulated - Homes are often the biggest source of waste THE private home is one of the world's great energy wasters. But experience shows that people who can afford to make their homes more efficient cannot be bothered to, while those who most need to save energy lack the means to do it. In a report on energy efficiency and the environment published last year, the International Energy Agency pointed up another problem: people only tend to make major energy improvements when they build a new home or change houses. The report says: 'Though the technical potential for energy efficiency improvements in heating and cooling end-uses might be substantial, savings are limited by the slow turnover of the building stock.' A large proportion of energy efficiency campaigns are aimed at breaking this vicious circle. The British government launched its latest one at the end of last month. 'Helping the Earth begins at home' will run for three years with a budget of Pounds 10m to drive home the message from the Earth Summit about the dangers of energy waste and global warming. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said: 'By taking the right measures every home could save Pounds 100 a year and reduce its carbon dioxide contribution by one and a half tonnes, a cut of 20 per cent.' The campaign is aimed at encouraging people to insulate roofs, lag water tanks and turn off lights. House insulation is important because space heating accounts for 57 per cent of energy consumption. The department of the environment reports that between 1974 and 1989 the percentage of houses with loft insulation rose from 42 per cent to 89 per cent. It estimates that domestic energy efficiency measures have reduced the consumption of delivered energy by around 32 per cent between 1970 and 1990. But in spite of these signs of improvement, there is still a long way to go. The National Energy Foundation, based in Milton Keynes, Britain's energy efficiency 'capital', has developed an energy efficiency rating scheme for private homes. Though still in its infancy and so far applied only to fewer than 1m of the UK's 21m homes, the results have been revealing. The average British home rates only four on a scale where a score of 10 is ultra-efficient. Of the total stock, 11m are estimated to be below the national average. Although there has been substantial improvement in recent years, the IEA ranks the UK 10th out of the 11 top industrial countries in terms of the energy required to heat domestic dwellings (only Austria fares worse). The NEF estimates that if all homes were improved by only one rating point, the resulting energy savings would be Pounds 2.2bn a year, or 4.5 per cent of the national energy bill. The reduction in carbon dioxide emissions would be 24m tonnes, a cut of four per cent. So why are these savings not being achieved? Mr Richard Tinson, the NEF's director, blames an energy policy that is tilted too far towards the supply side. When the gas and electricity industries were privatised in the 1980s, the government did not want to do anything to hurt their markets. 'There is a lack of political will,' he says. He would like to see a proportion of energy spending - say one per cent of the Pounds 20bn spent to heat, power and light building in the UK each year  -redirected into efficiency work. One aspect of the problem is a tax system which places VAT on building supplies but exempts domestic fuels, making it cheaper for people to burn more fuel than buy loft insulation. Against this, however, investment in insulation should provide a return in terms of energy savings which is tax free. Any tax on domestic fuel would hit low income households disproportionately hard, which is why the government is unlikely to introduce one without parallel benefits. Another problem is a regulatory regime which has traditionally rewarded suppliers more on the basis of how much they sell than how much they conserve. While both Offer, the electricity regulator and Ofgas, its gas counterpart, are supposed to encourage energy efficiency, there are limits to their powers. However, Ofgas took a step forward earlier this year when it introduced an 'E factor' into the price formula regulating domestic gas. This will allow British Gas to pass on any costs which it incurs in the cause of improving energy efficiency, though these will have to be approved by Ofgas first. On the other hand, Prof. Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, concluded after recent consultations on energy efficiency not to create an E factor for electricity. Instead, he believes that promoting competition will encourage generators and distributors to go for the most efficient forms of energy. However, the consequence of this could be lower energy prices in the home, and therefore less incentive to save there. Much of the effort of British Gas and many of the electric utilities will be channelled through a newly-formed Energy Saving Trust, an independent entity chaired by Lord Moore, a former Cabinet minister, to promote energy efficiency in the home. This pooled effort of the energy supply industry will seek out the best ways of achieving these goals. Pilot schemes will be set up to help low income households make better use of their energy, and stimulate investment in fuel efficient technology, such as better boilers. However the reluctance of Prof. Littlechild to create an E factor could reduce the interest of the electricity companies in supporting the scheme since they will not be able to pass through the costs like British Gas.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: US economy The US index of leading indicators has occasionally proved so misleading that one should not set too much store by March's 1 per cent fall. Storms and blizzards had a generally depressing effect on economic indicators for that month. More worrying is Monday's fall in the purchasing managers' index which suggests that there was no rebound in April. If Friday's employment figures also turn out weak, it will be hard to escape the conclusion that the recovery has gone awry. More surprising is that the latest data has not put the dollar under greater pressure. Though the dollar has fallen nearly 10 pfennigs since early March, the currency market seems reluctant to abandon the positive view with which the year began. This had the dollar rallying sharply on the back of a strong US recovery, offset by recession and lower interest rates in Germany. So far, only part of this expectation has been fulfilled. Germany has moved deeper into recession and the Bundesbank is cutting rates, albeit cautiously. The D-Mark is no longer a haven for those disillusioned with the US recovery. The quest for an alternative may help explain the strength of gold. But that also means the dollar is being supported by D-Mark weakness, a phenomenon which cannot last indefinitely, especially now the Clinton honeymoon is fading.</p>

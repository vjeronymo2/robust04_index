			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Germans hear the Philips riot act - Grundig and PKI are dragging their feet The cost-cutting programme at Philips, the Dutch electronics company, has finally swung away from its home town of Eindhoven to focus on a new target, the southern German town of Nuremberg. After making severe cuts in jobs, mostly at Eindhoven, during nearly four years of drastic restructuring, Philips has clearly lost patience with the slow pace of change in Nuremberg, where its two main German companies are located. Mr Jan Timmer, Philips' president, seized the opportunity at yesterday's annual press conference to deliver a broadside against the sluggishness of reforms at Grundig, the German consumer electronics group, and Philips Kommunikations Industrie (PKI), a supplier to the telecommunications industry. He issued what he described as an 'urgent appeal' for 'the greatest possible realism'. German unions have been resisting Philips' efforts to prune its German operations. At Grundig alone, management wants to cut 4,000 out of 15,000 jobs. Mr Timmer said: 'We believe that the survival of a whole company is more important than short-term job losses.' He insisted that Philips intended to maintain Grundig's name and identity, but said this could not be done without a drastic reduction in costs. His frustration stems from the fact that the continued heavy losses in Germany were the only significant flaw in yesterday's much-improved 1993 results. The company's good news - including the return to a net profit of Fl 856m (Dollars 441m) on normal business operations from a net loss of Fl 900m the previous year - was capped by the announcement of a 1993 dividend of Fl 0.50, the first since the Fl 2.00 paid out of 1989 profits. The problem in Germany is most glaring at Grundig, which is expected to report net losses of DM350m (Dollars 205.9m) for its year ending March, 16 per cent worse than the previous year. The downturn comes when the Philips group, excluding Grundig, managed to reduce operating losses in consumer electronics to just Fl 73m from Fl 553m a year earlier. This is all the more irritating to Philips because it is bound by a long-standing agreement to pay DM50m a year in dividends to the Grundig family foundation, regardless of the German company's performance. Although Philips owns only 31.6 per cent of Grundig, it fully consolidates the company in its accounts, and has complete management control. PKI, by contrast, is blamed by Philips for the sharp decline in results in the group's professional products business, where operating profit slumped to Fl 177m from Fl 663m in 1992, reflecting reduced investment by the German telecommunications authorities. Mr Timmer contrasted the slow pace of change in Germany with the sacrifices made by the more than 60,000 people who have lost their jobs within the Philips group since 1990. 'Equally, it is not acceptable to Philips shareholders, who also end up paying for Grundig's losses, that the process of change at this company continues to take a long time,' he said. Germany's position behind the rest of the Philips world is partly blamed on the short-lived euphoria that accompanied German unification, which coincided with company's concerted shake-up of its internal culture in 1990. Events of that time tempted local workers to think they would be immune from changes sweeping the company worldwide. Despite the German problems, Philips had reached an important milestone in its 'Centurion' programme of restructuring, Mr Timmer said. The process, however, would continue. 'It will not end . . . the company must be in a permanent state of change,' he said. In the three years since the end of 1990, Philips has raised profits, excluding restructuring charges, to 5 per cent of sales, from 4.2 per cent previously. Its return on net operating capital has improved to 13.2 per cent from 8.5 per cent at the start of the operation. And, at the same time, group debt has fallen to Fl 8.6bn from Fl 14.8bn. Besides continuing to cut costs, Philips still needs to come up with ideas to generate new businesses and income, Mr Timmer said. Unfortunately, its restructuring of the early 1990s has coincided with deep malaise on most of its important markets and in many of its business sectors, including its biggest single business, consumer electronics. Although the company has made progress on slimming down and becoming more competitive, it continues to wait for an economic revival, particularly in Europe, that will allow it to reap the full benefits of its efforts.</p>

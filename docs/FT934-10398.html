			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Fresh fall in bond prices hits US shares US STOCK markets fell heavily for the second consecutive day yesterday as fresh declines in government bond prices and rising long-term interest rates rattled Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 36.89 points at 3,624.98, matching Wednesday's losses. The Dow has fallen more than 70 points in the last two days. The heavy selling of stocks was triggered by the fifth day of sharp declines on the US bond market. The fall in bond prices pushed long-term interest rates, as measured by the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, up to 6.2 per cent. Last week, before the latest selling bout, the 30-year bond was yielding 5.9 per cent. It is this sudden and sharp rise in long-term interest rates that has unnerved stock market investors, even though the bond market has been in a free fall primarily because of signs that US economic growth is improving. Evidence of renewed growth concerns bond investors, who worry that a stronger economy will eventually lead to higher inflation, which undermines the value of their fixed-rate investments. Yesterday's plunge in the bond market was sparked by news of a decline in the number of people claiming unemployment insurance last week, and steady growth in September factory orders and third-quarter industrial productivity. Investors also sold bonds because they feared the October employment report, due out today, would detail further improvements in job growth. Normally, good economic news would lift share prices. Stock market investors, however, have ignored signs of economic growth in the last few days and concentrated instead on the rise in long-term interest rates. Higher interest rates are unpopular with the stock market because they put up the cost of corporate borrowing, which can depress company spending on future expansion and lower corporate profits. Rising interest rates also make stocks look less attractive than other investments. The Nasdaq composite of secondary stocks fell 15.69, or two per cent, to end at 757.26. Yesterday's losses on stock and bond markets heighten the significance of the October monthly employment report. If it shows an increase in non-farm jobs greater than the 160,000 forecast by Wall Street, bond prices could fall further, prompting a fresh round of selling in stock markets.

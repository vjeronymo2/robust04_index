			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Israel ends ban on PLO contacts THE Israeli parliament last night voted to scrap a controversial ban on contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, removing what many supporters of Mr Yitzhak Rabin's Labour-led government regarded as an obstacle to Middle East peace negotiations. The Knesset passed by 39 votes to 20 a bill to annul a provision enacted in 1986 which made illegal any meetings between Israeli citizens and members of the PLO, which is designated an illegal terrorist organisation under Israeli law. Mr Abie Nathan, a prominent Israeli peace campaigner, was twice jailed under the ban for meeting Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman. However, Mr Rabin, who was not present for the vote, only reluctantly backed last night's move. There have been calls from within his centre-left coalition for Israel to take a further step and open direct talks with the PLO, particularly since the government threw the future of peace negotiations into doubt by expelling 415 alleged Palestinian Islamic militants to Lebanon last month. The prime minister has said he continues to oppose allowing the Tunis-based PLO an official role in negotiations. A special UN envoy arrived in Israel yesterday in his second attempt to win Israeli concessions on the Palest-inians deported to southern Lebanon.</p>

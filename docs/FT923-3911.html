			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Russia, Ukraine in reactor pledge RUSSIA and the Ukraine are determined to press on with nuclear power and to make their reactors safe, with or without western help, the heads of the two countries' nuclear programmes said yesterday. Speaking on the eve of the Uranium Institute's annual conference in London, Mr Erik Pozdyshev, president of the Russian nuclear utility Rosatomenergo, and Mr Vladimir Fuks, his Ukrainian counterpart, expressed exasperation that no western financial aid had reached them yet, after three years of discussion. 'If western governments will stop just talking and will give real assistance, then we will not reject that help, because it will enable us to solve the safety matters more quickly,' Mr Pozdyshev said. 'But if the help is always delayed, we have the capacity to provide the necessary level of safety for our nuclear stations ourselves.' Russia plans to keep its Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors running well into the next century, after making the necessary safety changes, he said. The Sosnovy Bor plant near St Petersburg - where a radiation leak caused wide-spread alarm last March - will operate at least until 2003. At the same time Russia will open new PWR-type VVER reactors, starting with a 1,000MW unit at Balakova which 'we plan to commission within the next six months'. Mr Fuks said the Ukrainian utility Ukratomenergoprom wanted to complete and commission three new VVER reactors - at Zaporozhe, Rovno and Khmelnits. These would provide new generating capacity after the final closure of Chernobyl, which is planned for next year. The Ukraine currently has a moratorium on new nuclear plants but Mr Fuks forecast that parliament would vote next year to commission the three reactors 'if energy prices continue to rise and if this winter is cold enough'. Mr Armen Abagyan, director-general of the All-Union Research Institute for Nuclear Power Plants, said the Russian nuclear industry was spending precious hard currency on computers and safety monitoring equipment from the west - in particular from the US and Germany. 'They talk about Germany paying money to us - but in fact we're paying money to Germany,' he said.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Fashion: Grunge to grab the grown-up glamour girls - The shock value has been tamed, but faded and floppy is still the in thing ARE YOU frightened of flares? Does grunge fail to grab you? If that is how you feel about this spring's much-hyped floppy, faded look, think what it is like for the stores which have to try and sell the clothes. The young, who will embrace this 1970s-inspired style with open arms, will go for a mix of chain store, DIY and second-hand. But real spending power lies with a more sceptical, conservative market. Many will remember a similar look from last time round and will take some convincing that they want to wear it again. So the problem presently exercising minds among buying and display departments is 'grunge for grown-ups - how to make it wearable.' Buyers for leading stores all believe that there is a market and that by summer the customer will forsake power tailoring for a softer, layered, more muted style - provided it is presented in a way which she finds believable. Quite why British women of a certain age should wish to express solidarity with a look that originated in young street musicians from Seattle and avant-garde designers from Paris venting their anger at the consumerist values of the late 1980s may look like one of fashion's mysteries. But it is a classic example of the way in which trends evolve. An idea with shock value, often politically-motivated and created by improvisation, catches the imagination of designers with street credibility, who use it in their collections to attract media attention. The consumer thus becomes aware of it and, by the time it is filtered through the modifying hands of mass-market manufacturers, she is used to seeing it and happy to wear it. The consumer probably knows little and cares less about its philosophical origins but according to Ruth Chapman of Matches in Wimbledon, south west London, an experienced filterer of trends: 'She knows something new is happening and she wants to be in there'. Besides which, seeming unalert to current trends could imply that you are out of date in other areas of your life including - horrors] - your profession, hence the pressure to adapt to the new. The shops are under another pressure - the simple one of meeting sales targets. It is up to them to make a radical idea irresistible to the shopper. Geraldine James, designer separates buyer at Harrods in London, has found this easier than expected. Initially somewhat suspicious of the grunge look, she has found herself 're-ordering flares and flower-sprigged frocks each week since the sale ended. People are delighted to find a really fresh look after years of the short-skirted suit.' The outfit she put together for us - black flares, a ruffled shirt and patchwork sleeveless jacket - may look quite extreme but, as she points out, it is open to many interpretations. 'You can take each element separately,' she says. 'Flares are a basic component but try them in a soft fabric like crepe or jersey, which won't grip your upper thigh or jut out abruptly, with a long, fitted jacket already in your wardrobe. Look critically to check the proportions are right. The soft shirt can go under the same jacket. Patchwork is a strong 1970s theme but a lot of people already own a plain sleeveless jacket or waistcoat which can go with that soft shirt.' It is, she says, a question of rethinking an existing wardrobe rather than investing heavily in new pieces. 'Find something with a soft, lacy or transparent effect to go under your jacket, rather than a crisp shirt. And most people already have a flowery frock, so now think about layering it - putting a skinny T-shirt under and a little waistcoat or cardigan over.' For Ruth Chapman, softness is the crucial point. 'My customers will see grunge as ease and fluidity rather than that scruffy waif-like look. The one essential buy is a floppy cardigan or waistcoat to replace the jacket. Wear it over soft layers, preferably chiffon, and you have a new, very feminine look which men far prefer to power dressing. I think a smart silk cardigan looks just as good for work as a tailored jacket. Mixed print is also a strong look which is fine as long as you stick to two neutral colours like black and beige or navy and white.' At Fenwick, 'accessories make the look', according to Cathy Harris, buying manager. 'You can go as little or as far into the 1970s thing as you want just by adding accessories to a few basic pieces such as a print frock or wide, soft trousers. That way you update without spending a lot. 'The basics are hats - floppy-brimmed straws or crochet berets, a long scarf tied round head or neck, long ropes of glass beads, wire-framed or small-lensed sunglasses and espadrilles or clogs. But whether you allude to the style with one item or load the lot on is a matter for the individual.' Joseph Ettedgui, of Joseph, in London's Brompton Cross, believes that the aesthetics of proportion will win women over to the softer look. 'You only have to try on shoes with a small platform to realise they look better with wide, soft, maybe even flared, trousers,' he says. 'The easiest way to get the look is with knitwear because it is so soft. We have done knitted flares with a skimpy waistcoat top to give the right proportions. But we have also put the same unreconstructed details, like seams on the outside, on more conventional shapes.' Even chain stores are on the soft and floppy bandwagon. Marks and Spencer is doing brisk business with flares, while Principles set the tone well with a spring brochure full of ruffle-collared jackets and soft fluted dresses. But, as the so-called supermodels are discovering, it is not just the clothes that set the look. 'Big hair' is definitely out, but if the prospect of lank, centre-parted locks is just too dreary, a smooth bob to the collar or shoulder-length looks good, as does a short feathered cut if you have the requisite gamine bone structure. Make-up is as soft as chiffon, with pale or brown-tinted lipstick and plummy, Biba-esque eyeshadow colours applied with the lightest of touches. But painted-on lower lashes and false eyelashes should remain the preserve of those for whom the 1970s are a new trip.</p>

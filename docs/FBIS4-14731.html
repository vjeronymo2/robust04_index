			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, [no date as received] -- In an interview with  a UNIAN correspondent on 1 April, Volodymyr Hrynyov, candidate  for people's deputies at the Radyanskiy Constituency in Kharkov,  chairman of the association "Nova Ukrayina" [New Ukraine],  refuted the accusations by his contenders at the election --  Henrikh Altunyan and Valeriy Meshcheryakov -- of violating the  election law of Ukraine. "The preponderance in the number of  electors' votes in my favor and confident actions by my  colleagues at the Interregional Bloc of Reforms irritated the  contenders so much that they resorted to downright falsehoods,"  believes Volodymyr Hrynyov. He reported that on the [election]  eve, foreseeing such actions, he submitted an appeal to the  District Electoral Commission with a clear explanation of his  actions in the election campaign within the framework of the  law. "Now, when the Central Electoral Commission received an  official telegram from Henrikh Altunyan with fictitious  accusations, when Valeriy Meshcheryakov ostentatiously withdrew  his candidacy `as a sign of protest,' I will be compelled to  turn to the Central Electoral Commission with a request to  protect me against the slander on the part of the former  candidates."    As a UNIAN correspondent learned, Volodymyr Hrynyov was  planning to visit the Central Electoral Commission on 1 April.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / The Lex Column: European telecoms Judging by yesterday's statement, the EC Commission has taken a look at the slowly thawing European telecoms market and decided to stick it back in the freezer for five years. While there were many fine words about openness and competition, the defensive tone told the real story. The result may be a compromise between foot-draggers like Deutsche Telekom and the hyperactive BT, but it is evidently one which still embarrasses the Brussels bureaucrats. Even when nominal competition is allowed in 1998, freer markets may not develop unless charges for connection to national systems are priced correctly. National companies in Spain, Italy and Germany are still absorbing cash updating their networks and will want to hold off financially stronger competitors like BT as long as possible. Most probably, early skirmishes will involve companies leasing lines from each other and reselling the capacity to corporate customers; BT digging up the streets of Frankfurt is much further off. Since margins are high there is plenty of room for prices to fall. Continental companies will then have to press for higher domestic charges because an effective cross-subsidy has been removed. Meanwhile BT's restlessness will probably compel it to keep searching in the US - hence the recent interest in acquiring EDS. If transatlantic deregulation makes progress, BT's nascent cash pile seems likely to end up in American hands. Whether it can find the right partner, however, remains to be seen.</p>

The Latvian delegation participated in the CEPA Strasbourg  session Jan. 24-28.    During the session, Latvian delegates received CEPA experts'  recommendations on the citizenship issue together with  Secretary-General Catherine Lallumiere's letter.    Latvia will consider the recommendations at the top-level,  Endzins said.    Saeima (parliament) Foreign Affairs Committee head Alexander  Kirsteins addressed the assembly's Migration and Refugees  Committee on the social integration problems of Latvia's  Russian-speakers.    During lobby conversations, French, British and German  delegates worried Latvians by attaching a priority to interstate  pacts with Russia over Russian troops' withdrawal from Latvia  and Estonia, Endzins said.    The all-European transportation problems was another topic  for consideration at the session, Endzins said. Estonian and  Lithuanian delegates said they hoped to get a financial help by  the CE to build the Via Baltica highway.    The Baltic delegations closely cooperated during the  session,  said Latvian delegation secretary Rolands Blezurs. Blezurs also  spoke highly of Estonia's Tune Helam's election as CEPA's vice  president.    Latvia was also represented to the session by MP's [member  of  parliament] Andrejs Pantelejevs and Alexander Kirsteins.</p>

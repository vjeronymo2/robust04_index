			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- By its resolution of 26 January 1994 the  Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine introduced partial changes to  the resolution of 15 January 1991 "On the procedure of issuing  special permissions (licences) to carry out certain kinds of  activity and on the amount of payments for the state  registration of the subjects of entrepreneurship." New payment  amounts have been set for citizens and legal entities --  subjects of entrepreneurial activity -- for the issue of  licences by the Ministry of Transport to carry out agency  services for the merchant marine port [as received] in the sea  and river ports of Ukraine. In Odessa, Ilyichevsk, Kherson,  Yuzhnoye, and Mariupol ports this is $800,000 per port; in the  ports of Berdyansk, Nikolayev, Kherson, Izmail, and Reni this is  $400,000; in Belgorod-Dunayskiy, Kiliya, Yalta, and in all river  ports this is $200,000 per port.    The resolution stipulates that these payments are to be made  in foreign currency (with the availability of the National Bank  licence) or in Ukraine's currency converted according to the  National Bank exchange rate at the time of issue. Besides, the  principal marine agencies of the Ukrainian Ministry of Transport  are exempt for five years from any payments for the issue of  licenses to carry out agency services for the merchant marine  fleet. The resolution also stipulates that 90 percent of the  monies received for the issue of licenses are transferred to the  currency account of the Ministry of Finance, if paid in foreign  currency, and to the state budget, if paid in Ukraine's  currency. The rest of the sum remains at the disposal of the  Ministry of Transport.</p>

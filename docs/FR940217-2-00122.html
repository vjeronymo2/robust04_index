Blanch (Petitioner) dated August 2, 1993, regarding the Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (licensee) and the Millstone Facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Petitioner requested that the NRC reconsider the May 4, 1993 enforcement action issued to the licensee for discrimination against the Petitioner in violation of 10 CFR 50.7. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Petitioner requested reconsideration based on his view that additional enforcement action is warranted. Specifically, Petitioner requests: (1) An enforcement action against a licensee Vice President for alleged willful violation of 10 CFR 50.7 and alleged deliberate misconduct under 10 CFR 50.5 in the discriminatory actions against Petitioner; (2) a Severity Level I violation against the licensee corporate officer allegedly responsible for directing action against two of Petitioner's former subordinates; (3) Severity Level I violations against three licensee corporate officers allegedly resonsible for harassment, intimidation and discrimination against the Petitioner; (4) a Severity Level I violation and a Severity Level II violation against a licensee attorney and a licensee manager respectively for threatening individuals with letters of reprimand if they did not communicate with licensee attorneys prior to being interviewed by the NRC's Office of Investigations on the discrimination matter; and (5) a minimum of a Severity Level II violation against a licensee manager for a retaliatory audit of the Petitioner's group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director of the Office of Enforcement has reviewed the bases for the Petitioner's request and has found that the Petitoner has not presented information that would warrant reconsideration of the May 4, 1993 enforcement action. Therefore, the Petitoner's request has been denied. The reasons for the denial are explained in the ``Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206'' (DD&hyph;94&hyph;01) which is available for public inspection at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room for the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, unit 3, Learning Resources Center, Thames Valley State Technical College, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of this Decision will be filed with the Secretary of the Commission for the Commission's review in accordance with 10 CFR 2.206(c) of the Commission's regulations. As provided by that regulation, the Decision will constitute the final action of the Commission 25 days after the date of issuance of the Decision unless the Commission, on its own motion, institutes a review of the decision within that time. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 9th day of February 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James Lieberman,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Director, Office of Enforcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;3590 Filed 2&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 7590&hyph;01&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

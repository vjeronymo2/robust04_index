			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Where federalism isn't a dirty word: Whether a sea change is likely when Belgium assumes the EC presidency in July The latest bogeyman of British Euro-sceptics is likely to be a portly, bespectacled 52-year-old Fleming with a passion for soccer and federalism. He is Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, which takes over the presidency of the European Community in six weeks. Mr Dehaene's arrival at the helm of the Community could mark a sea change in the management of the EC. It will follow 12 months of cautious EC captaincy, first by Britain, then Denmark, both of which had to navigate through tortured domestic debates about the content of the Maastricht treaty on European union. Mr Dehaene believes the Danish vote in favour of Maastricht last week provides a firm foundation for a more positive presidency. As he said in a speech on Thursday, the best response to the EC's political and economic problems is 'not less, but more Europe'. With that in mind, Belgium has made implementation of the treaty its main objective in the presidency, whether or not the British parliament has approved the text by the time Belgium takes over on July 1. On paper, Belgium's credentials for leading a renewed drive for closer union are impressive. But recently, economic problems and separatist pressures - notably in the Dutch-speaking north - have taken their toll on the country's longstanding reputation as a laboratory for practical European federalism. One of the six founder members of the Community, Belgium has been part of a formal economic union (with Luxembourg and the Netherlands) since 1944 and of a full currency union (with Luxembourg) since 1921. What is more, two weeks ago, the country's parliament approved reforms which transform Belgium into 'a federal state'. This is the sort of record which has British opponents of closer integration reaching for their invective. But, in constrast with British Euro-sceptics, ordinary Belgians' principal fear is not that federalism will increase the power of the central state, but that it might abolish it. A month ago, thousands of Belgians marched in Brussels against separatism. They worry that the reforms will provoke a split between Dutch-speaking Flanders in the north, and French-speaking Wallonia in the south, with the bilingual capital - a region in its own right - torn between the two. The chances of this happening are easily exaggerated by outsiders. The reforms are part of an evolution, the latest phase of which began in the 1960s with calls for more autonomy for Flanders and Wallonia and for the Dutch- and French-speaking communities. Legislative changes, including the latest, have introduced direct elections for regional parliaments and left the central government with responsibility only for the main lines of foreign and defence policy, internal security, the budget and social security. It is true that a number of prominent politicians - most notably Mr Luc Van den Brande, the head of the Flemish government - see this latest reform as part of a wider process which could lead to even greater fiscal and financial autonomy for the regions. But this is unlikely to happen soon. For Belgium, the development of European political union is essential to the success of its own constitutional reforms. 'There is no contradiction between the reform of the Belgian state and the European integration process,' says Mr Dehaene. 'In my view, they are complementary.' He explains that both Belgian federalism and closer European political union should involve a decision-making hierarchy which responds to the needs of citizens - in other words, subsidiarity. In contrast with their counterparts in some other member states, Belgian politicians are trying to delegate appropriate responsibilities both to Europe and the regions. But although Belgium sees no contradiction between its own brand of federalism and the EC's objectives, its experience may illustrate in miniature some of the potential problems of closer European union, based on subsidiarity. In Belgium, the process has been slow, and compromises have resulted in a very complicated political structure. For Mr Dehaene, this spirit of compromise is an asset and the complexity of the solutions a necessary evil, because it avoids damaging confrontation. But the bickering between Belgian politicians on the often incomprehensible detail of the latest constitutional reforms has alienated the Belgian people. That was part of the reason why centrist parties lost support in the November 1991 general election, and extremist and maverick politicians cashed in. Some senior Belgian politicians fear the latest reforms will merely aggravate that. As Mr Pierre Harmel, a former Belgian prime minister and elder statesman, pointed out this month: 'Some of these reforms are going to make the healthy management (of the country), and co-operation between the federal state and its components very difficult.' Belgium is already suffering early symptoms of such a malaise. The three regional governments have just managed to arrange a meeting to discuss their different responsibilities, after two months of argument about who should invite whom. At the same time, as Mr Dehaene admits, arguments about the economic balance of the federal state threaten to upset the political consensus. Flanders, economically more powerful than Wallonia, argues it should not have to 'subsidise' social security payments in the south. Mr Dehaene insists social security rules will continue to apply uniformly throughout the country. The debate echoes the EC's often-acrimonious discussions about 'cohesion' funding for poorer member states. In Belgium, the imbalance means national decision-making, notably on budget measures, is blighted by the need to keep both sides happy: raising taxes punishes the north, while cutting welfare penalises the south. Just such an impasse nearly derailed the government itself in March during a cabinet debate on how to cut Belgium's large budget deficit in line with tough Maastricht economic criteria. Mr Dehaene had to offer the resignation of his centre-left government to persuade the coalition partners to agree an austerity package. Such structural difficulties - and the complexity of the Belgian federal solution - are bound to have an impact on the six-month presidency. Mr Dehaene has already made clear that, in areas where Belgium's regions now have responsibility for international relations, they will be represented at EC councils, further prolonging and complicating the lengthy round-table discussions at meetings of, say, culture ministers. Britain and, to a lesser extent, Denmark - both criticised for putting self-interest above the spirit of compromise - will be watching carefully to see how the Community's most enthusiastic member manages the next six months. There are already some indications that Belgium's aspirations to run a neutral presidency, free of self-interest, may be only skin-deep. Although preparations for the next phase of European monetary union (Emu) are a top priority for the Belgian presidency, it is Belgium which has suggested in the past week that those criteria limiting debt, budget deficits and inflation may have to be amended if recession continues. Mr Dehaene says Belgium will not propose a debate on the subject. But the fact that Belgian ministers have already indicated their concerns about the Emu conditions shows that even the most enthusiastic EC members cannot always subordinate their domestic problems to federal ambitions.</p>

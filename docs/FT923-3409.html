			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / International Company News: Hitachi cuts audio-visual workforce by about 20% THE steep decline in Japan's consumer electronics market is forcing Hitachi, Japan's largest electrical machinery company, to cut its workforce in the audio-visual division by 20 per cent this year, or by about 800. The move by one of Japan's most prominent companies is a sign of the depth of the recession in the industry. Cutting employment is the last resort for a company like Hitachi, and a clear sign that the market is not expected to recover. The 800 employees do not face redundancy but will be transferred to other divisions or affiliated companies, of which Hitachi has a vast network. The company has already ordered 2,200 workers who were making video recorders to take extra holidays in September and October to reduce production and bring down bulging inventories. These short-term measures, however, now appear to be insufficient. The company is also considering plans to chop back on headquarters management staff by retraining personnel and sending them to work in sales or maintenance. Hitachi has yet to issue a formal revision of its profits forecast, but a company spokesman said pre-tax profits would likely fall below Y100bn (Dollars 813m) in the year to March 1993, from Y128.9bn last year. Hitachi faces slow sales across a wide range of product areas, including semiconductors and computers. But its electrical power division is performing well because of projects in Japan.</p>

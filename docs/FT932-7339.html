			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Hoover confirms closure of cleaner factory at Dijon HOOVER said yesterday it had decided to go ahead with its controversial plan to close its vacuum cleaner factory at Dijon, France, and move production to Scotland. The decision, announced in Paris by Mr Gerald Kamman, president of Hoover Europe, follows a sweeping management review of the company's operations designed to cut costs and restore profit. The production transfer, which will create about 400 jobs at Hoover's plant at Cambuslang, near Glasgow, was first disclosed in January. It enraged the French government and Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, who accused Britain of poaching jobs. Mr Kamman said last month he was reconsidering the move and would be prepared to cancel it if he judged that it did not enhance the viability of the company. He said then that the Dijon plant was close to a profit on manufacturing, but that Hoover's sales in France had fallen sharply this year. Mr Kamman was appointed head of Hoover's European operations and its UK business two months ago after Mr Bill Foust, his predecessor, was dismissed over the company's free flights promotion fiasco. The planned closure, to be staged over the rest of this year, will mean the loss of about 600 of the 705 jobs at the Dijon plant. Mr Kamman said yesterday Hoover had drawn up a 'social plan' costing FFr185m (Pounds 21.9m) to cover the redundancies. Hoover said yesterday that the terms of the move to Cambuslang, for which the British government has offered Pounds 2.5m in regional aid, had not been changed. The company was still considering further cost-cutting measures. Hoover Europe lost Dollars 67.1m last year, including a Dollars 55m restructuring charge, on sales of Dollars 501.9m. Maytag, the company's US parent, lost Dollars 315m last year and a further Dollars 10.5m in the first quarter of this year.</p>

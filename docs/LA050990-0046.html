			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH DIARIES HINT OF BUSH AID TO CONTRAS  </P> <P> Oliver L. North met with then-Vice President George Bush a few hours after  lying to the House Intelligence Committee about assisting the Nicaraguan  Contras, an entry in North's White House diaries suggests.  </P> <P> Portions of the diaries, released Tuesday, renew questions about whether Bush  was more deeply involved in assisting the Contras than he has acknowledged.  </P> <P> The 1,400 pages of notebook entries were obtained by a private group, the  National Security Archive, as the result of a lawsuit filed against the  government. U.S. intelligence agencies still are reviewing the remaining 1,200  pages of North's diaries.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: "The vice president's role  in the Iran-Contra affair was completely examined in the congressional inquiry,  and we have nothing to add."  </P> <P> Among disclosures in the newly released material:  </P> <P>  -- On Dec. 20, 1985, North laid out a "3rd Country Solicitation Plan" in  support of the Contras that included trips by Bush to Honduras for an  inauguration there. The plan also called for then-President Ronald Reagan to  meet with Ecuador's president.  </P> <P> Bush went to Honduras in January, 1986, for the inauguration of President Jose  Azcona Hoyo and Reagan met in Washington that month with Ecuadoran President  Leon Febres Cordero.  </P> <P> There was an elaborate plan in the Reagan Administration to induce third  countries to support the Contras, according to evidence introduced at North's  trial last year. Bush has denied being involved in any quid pro quo  arrangements providing additional economic and military aid to Honduras in  exchange for allowing the Contras to use base camps there.  </P> <P>  -- North's notes refer to a noon "meeting w/ V.P." on Aug. 6, 1986. That would  have been 3 1/2 hours after North lied to the committee by denying he was  supplying military advice to the Contras. North admitted he had lied when he  took the witness stand at his own trial last year.  </P></p>

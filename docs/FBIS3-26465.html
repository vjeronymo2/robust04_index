			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China Editor] </F>   [Text] China is set to target decreases in both economic  growth and inflation this year in a bid to rein in the  overheated economy.    The decision was made by the ruling Communist Party  leadership since amending its radical development strategy for  1994 by putting greater emphasis on social stability.    Chinese sources yesterday said concerned government  departments under the cabinet were ordered to make all-out  efforts to achieve the targets, which set both the annual  economic growth and inflation rates under 10 percent.    Following a crucial decision made by the Politburo to give  social stability priority, the State Council amended its overall  development plan to adhere to the strategic change made by the  party's top policymaking body.    China's senior party leaders, including party chief Jiang  Zemin, Premier Li Peng, vice-premiers Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua  have--in their recent inspections to regions--urged local  officials to follow Beijing's line.    "Both the central ministries and regional governments were  urged to pay close attention to the leadership's newly set  strategy and to take the overall social and economic situation  into consideration when working out their own strategies," an  informed source said.    "The overall target for economic growth and price increases  should be reined in under one digit and should not go higher  than 10 percent," the source said.    The strategy rethink by the Politburo, first reported by The  Hongkong Standard and confirmed by Jiang Zemin in a speech to  non-Communist Party leaders over the weekend, decided to play  down the emphasis on pace of economic growth and reform.    Jiang, who is also Chinese president, said the Politburo had  decided on a four-point principle for economic development this  year, which said "to seize opportunities, deepen reforms, boost  development and guarantee stability".    The Politburo had late last year formulated a three-point  strategy that read "to seize opportunities, deepen reforms and  speed up development".    The inclusion of guaranteeing social stability and the  substitution of "speeding up development" by "boosting  development" underlines a significant change of mind by the  leadership.    "It is not appropriate at this time to bring up the slogan  of  `speeding up the pace of reform and hastening economic  development'," the source quoted a report as saying.    The government has tried over the past year to strengthen  macrocontrol over the national economy in order to address  problems arising from the economic overheating.    The report said Beijing had urged localities to implement  the  government policy to deepen reforms, while combating price  increases under the call for "a continuous, faster and healthier  economic development."</p>

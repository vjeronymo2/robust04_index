			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Germans hold back on abortion pill Hoechst, the German chemical group, said yesterday it would not apply for a permit to sell the RU-486 abortion pill because it believed a German legal ruling last week was unclear, Reuter reports from Bonn. A spokeswoman for Hoechst, which is linked with the French company Roussel Uclaf which developed the controversial pill, told German radio that last week's Constitutional Court ruling on abortion had not made the legal position in Germany clear. The court in Karlsruhe said a 1992 compromise between restrictive West German rules and East Germany's abortion on demand violated constitutional guarantees respecting life. But it added that abortion should not be treated as an illegal act to be punished, a fine legal distinction which in practice allows abortions in the first three months of pregnancy if a woman first consults a doctor. Roussel-Uclaf and Hoechst have never applied for German or US sales licences because of concern that anti-abortion activists would organise a boycott of the groups' products.</p>

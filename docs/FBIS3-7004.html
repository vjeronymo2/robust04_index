The prime minister also said that he did not see a need to  maintain the military presence of the United States as a  protector in the region, describing it as "a sheer waste of  money". "I cannot speak for specific countries, but for the  whole region I do not think we need the U.S. fleet patrolling  the seas in this area. So much money is wasted," he told  reporters after opening the 10th meeting of the Pacific Economic  Co-operation Council (PECC).    "We do not believe in security agreements or security  set-ups  like the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ..."    Responding to questions about the possibility of Japan and  China dominating the region, Dr. Mahathir said that they would  "cancel each other, as there is mutual distrust".    "This is good, as one will balance the other. So there is no  necessity for any special security arrangement or any  arrangement to prevent the dominance of any economy over the  rest of the region," he added.    Dr. Mahathir said that countries in East Asia could get  along  with each other and had no fear of Japan or China.    On the possibility that the two giants might be competing  with each other by seeking allies, he said that the ASEAN  countries rejected any such moves.    The regional grouping was also against getting involved in  any such alliances.    Referring to the United States, he said that it could  provide  the "check and balance", without a need for its Seventh Fleet to  patrol this area.    "The United States should stay in the United States, as much  as Japan in Japan and China in China. We know they are strong  ... We do not want to disturb them and they should not want to  disturb each other."    He added that the era of conquest and colonisation was over  and countries should and would not go around conquering others  any more.    Asked whether he was suggesting a total withdrawal of the  U.S. military presence from the region, Dr. Mahathir said: "I  would not be too upset if they withdraw. But some of the  neighbours who feel unhappy about their neighbours may feel  insecure and I cannot determine for them."</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UN and Iraq talks make no headway NEITHER Iraqi nor United Nations officials reported progress yesterday after two rounds of talks in Baghdad aimed at resolving a confrontation over Iraq's refusal to permit UN monitoring of two missile testing sites, writes Mark Nicholson in Amman. The UN delegation, headed by Mr Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the UN special commission into Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said he would hold more talks late yesterday with an Iraqi team led by Mr Tarek Aziz, the deputy prime minister. An earlier session between the UN team and Mr Aziz made little headway. Mr Ekeus also met Mr Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, Iraq's foreign minister, on Thursday.</p>

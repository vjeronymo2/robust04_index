			<p>BFN     [Text] It is very likely that on 21 June St. Petersburg  will be left without water and light. On that date the  Lentransgaz Association will halt gas deliveries to all the  city's power stations. The reason is the usual one--debts.  This year the Lentransgaz joint-stock company has not received  60 billion rubles. With sums like that, the system of mutual  accounts is no longer working, the Lenpromgaz [as heard] chief  engineer said today in an interview to the Sankt-Peterburgskiye  Vedemosti Agency. A cardinal solution has to be found. Simply  patching up the budget will just lead to the water and light  problem returning closer to winter.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / IoD calls for firm action on inflation THE Institute of Directors has renewed its call for the Bank of England to be made independent as a signal that the government is committed to low inflation 'whatever happens to European monetary union', Daniel Green writes. In a letter to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, also called on the government to 'explain and sell its strategy of long-term price stability to a society which has only known inflated prices and unreal values'. A list of recommendations to be included on 'an agenda for zero inflation' include the scrapping of remaining controls on private housing rentals and abandoning indexation in more areas of public spending. The IoD said it regretted that nominal interest rates had not fallen with inflation over the past year.</p>

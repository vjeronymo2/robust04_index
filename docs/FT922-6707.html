			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Deeper loss at Westbury WESTBURY, the Cheltenham-based housebuilder, continued to suffer from the slump in the housing market and yesterday announced its second successive year of losses. The pre-tax deficit of Pounds 15.1m was up from last time's Pounds 8.12m. The losses followed exceptional charges of Pounds 15.8m, mainly to cover write-downs on land values. Exceptional charges of Pounds 13.5m last year had proved to be too low. Mr Richard Fraser, chairman and chief executive, said he was cautious about the outlook and that house prices were unlikely to pick up this year. Turnover fell to Pounds 131.8m (Pounds 171.1m). A total of 2,277 homes were sold at an average price of Pounds 56,300, compared to 2,576 houses at Pounds 61,900 previously. The lower average price achieved partly reflected the company's concentration on smaller houses. Losses per share were 17.4p (14p), but the directors have recommended a maintained final dividend of 5.75p for an unchanged total of 9p, uncovered for the second year running. Net borrowings reduced sharply to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 55.8m) helped by last year's Pounds 20.7m rights issue and a fall in stocks. Gearing fell from 59 to 13 per cent and interest costs almost halved to Pounds 3.96m.</p>

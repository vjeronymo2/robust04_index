			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Shares suspended SHARES in Hasle Bank, a small bank serving the Danish Baltic island of Bornholm, were suspended yesterday after the Finance Supervisors examined its accounts, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The bank has asked Bikuben, Denmark's third largest bank, to take it over. On Monday, the supervisors forced another of the island's banks, Bornholmerbanken, into bankruptcy.

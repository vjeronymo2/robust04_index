			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Technology: The magic way to keep in touch - The latest personal communicators promise a wide range of new functions It is 'take two' for personal communicators, as a new set of players takes the stage with the launch in the US this week of Sony's 'Magic Link', a second-generation of hand-held devices combining communications and personal computer functions. Unlike the first 'personal digital assistants', such as Apple Computer's Newton, which failed to live up to the expectations of their makers, Magic Link owes much of its wizardry to an advanced data communications network called PersonaLink, provided by AT&amp;T. While Apple's Newton is primarily a personal organiser, with some communications functions, the Magic Link is, first and foremost, a communicator. Weighing 20 oz, and measuring 7 1/2 ' by 5 1/4 ', the device automates many of the chores of communicating by electronic mail, pager, telephone or fax. The Sony product, and others from Motorola, Matsushita of Japan and Philips of the Netherlands which are expected to follow, are access devices for this new network. PersonaLink, which began operating in the US this week, is 'a foundation, or platform for an electronic community,' AT&amp;T says. Similar to established computer on-line services such as Prodigy and Compuserve, PersonaLink allows users to send and receive electronic mail, access news services and go 'electronic shopping'. PersonaLink is the first commercial network to support the use of 'intelligent agents'. These are mobile programs that can be instructed to travel the network performing tasks such as searching for a particular product or data. 'Agent' technology is the creation of General Magic, a Silicon Valley company backed by Apple Computer, Matsushita and Philips as well as Sony and AT&amp;T. Magic Link uses General Magic's 'Magic Cap' graphical interface, which presents functions in familiar scenes: the desktop, complete with telephone, notepad, Rolodex cardfile, and postcards that can be used to send brief messages; a hallway with doors to rooms such as the library, for reference materials; and 'downtown', with buildings that represent services such as a travel agent for booking airline flights. Initially, PersonaLink will primarily be a messaging service - with a difference. The service will offer users the ability to order incoming messages according to priority. PersonaLink also addresses another drawback of electronic mail - the need to know electronic mail 'addresses', for which there is no central directory. PersonaLink subscribers can send messages to each other simply by name. An agent will automatically search the directory of subscribers, deliver the message and bring back complete addressing information to the originator. Later this year subscribers will also have access to the PersonaLink Market Square, an electronic shopping mall. Through gateways to other electronic mail services, including the Internet, PersonaLink subscribers will be able to reach and be reached by millions of people. They will also be able to send (but not receive) facsimile messages. For now, Sony's personal communicator offers only limited wireless communications via the SkyTel satellite paging network. An optional plug-in card adds paging. In January, Motorola announced the 'Envoy' personal wireless communicator, also based on General Magic software, with a planned sale price of Dollars 1,500, (Pounds 950) but it has yet to come to market. Sony's less ambitious approach, using conventional telephone lines rather than wireless services has helped keep the list price below Dollars 1,000. It is expected to sell at about Dollars 700. Aimed initially at 'technologically optimistic mobile professionals', Magic Link and PersonaLink could lighten the load of business travellers who carry a notebook computer, cellular telephone and pager around in their bulging briefcases.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Hague (DPA) [dateline as received] -- The  Netherlands want to improve its relations with Germany. In a  joint letter to the Parliament in The Hague on Tuesday [28  June], Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans and Defense Minister  Relus ter Beek wrote "that in its foreign policy the Government  must orient itself more strongly toward the position of the FRG  in Europe and the developments in German domestic policy."    The letter continues: "In view of the fact that the  Netherlands and Germany have many common interests and that many  of their foreign policy goals are identical, there is certainly  reason to strive for even more intensive cooperation. Because  of the differences in the status of the two countries -- the  Netherlands is no big power and only one of Germany's nine  neighbors -- a German-Dutch relationship comparable to the  German-French axis is not realistic."    Over the past weeks the relationship between Bonn and The  Hague has cooled down considerably because Chancellor Helmut  Kohl did not support Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers' candidacy for  the succession of European Union Commission President Jacques  Delors. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Wim Kok  noted during the European Union summit in Corfu over the  weekend: "Relations are tense." Obviously a lot of anger about  the Netherlands has accumulated in Bonn over the past years.  "We have to talk about this," Kok said.</p>

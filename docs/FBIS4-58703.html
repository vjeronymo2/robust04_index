			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Palestinian Chief of Security and </F> Police Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Our Forces Will Enter Gaza and  Jericho Not Later Than 20 May"]    [Text] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Palestinian chief of  security and police has confirmed that the Palestinian police  forces will enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho by 20 May at the  latest. He said that the entry will be completed within two  weeks after the signing of the final agreement on the  implementation of autonomy.    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Major General Mudar  Yusuf (Abu-Yusuf) revealed that the forces will be transported  to al-'Arish airport in Sinai by military transport planes.    He denied recent rumors that Israel will hand over to the  PLO  five important police posts in the occupied Gaza Strip next  Tuesday.    Maj. Gen. Yusuf said: "These reports are unfounded." He  added that in the first stage, the Palestinian police will enter  Gaza and Jericho at the same time but the main effort will be  concentrated on Gaza, which is densely populated, to provide  security and stability there. He stressed that preparations  have been made in all areas where Palestinian police and  security forces are present and that they are awaiting orders to  move.    Abu-Yusuf said that, in the first phase, some 6,000  policemen  will arrive in Gaza-Jericho, 4,500 of them going to Gaza and  1,500 going to Jericho, and these forces will enter as units in  their present formations. Some of these formations may later be  changed depending on circumstances on the ground and need. He  added that the PLO recently received special military uniforms  for the Palestinian police from Norway, and the first  consignment of U.S. aid, consisting of police vehicles, has  already arrived.    In reply to a question about the structure of the police  forces and whether they mainly consist of Fatah elements, Maj.  Gen. Yusuf emphasized that the forces which will be responsible  for security and stability in the Gaza Strip and Jericho "are  not factional forces. They are national forces belonging to all  the Palestinian people." He confirmed that "the Palestine  Liberation Army [PLA], which includes elements from all the  factions as well as elements not affiliated with any factions,  has now become a security and police force."    Maj. Gen. Yusuf revealed that "a large number [of people]  from the factions opposed to the Oslo agreement have sent us  applications to join these forces." He added that in the coming  phase, the Palestinian police forces will not operate on a  factional basis but on the basis of the Palestinian authority  which will consist of various sectors of the Palestinian people  regardless of their political affiliations.    Maj. Gen. Yusuf ruled out the possibility of any major  problems when the Palestinian police forces arrive. He also  ruled out the possibility of friction between them and Hamas  "because the brothers in Hamas have repeatedly stated their  opposition to Palestinian infighting, and we will make every  effort to promote understanding and agreement with them."    Maj. Gen. Yusuf urged all sectors and factions of the  Palestinian people "to extend a helping hand to the Palestinian  police and security forces for the sake of building our future  authority, easing our people's suffering, and providing security  and stability for them."    On the spread of arms possession in the city of Gaza and  whether that will be a security problem for the Palestinian  police forces, he said: "Arms do not scare us."</p>

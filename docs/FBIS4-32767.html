			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 27/06/1994 -- "Mr. Nicolae  Vacaroiu, the prime minister of the Romanian Government, for  which the opposition has prepared a censure motion due for  debate today, enjoys our party's confidence, support and  backing," said Marius Eugen Opran, vice-president of the  Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania (PDAR), which previously  was on the government's side but now has associated with the  opposition on the motion in question. The statement was made in  an interview for the daily VOCEA ROMANIEI.    The PDAR official made a point of saying that, contrary to  information carried by ADEVARUL and EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, at the  talks the PDAR delegation had late last week with President  Iliescu the agrarians defended their own censure motion, which  partly coincides with that of the opposition, but, agreeing that  the objective difficulties of the transition period left their  mark on the general economic standard of this country, insisted  that the society needed moral and professional purification, not  only at the top, but also among the next lower ranks. And as a  possible solution to take this country out of the crisis PDAR  suggested that Premier Vacaroiu extended in parliament the  resignation of the present cabinet and then be commissioned to  form a new government.    While stressing that in PDAR's view "Mr. Nicolae Vacaroiu  represents the best choice for the office of prime minister,"  the agrarian vice-president demands that the premier be allowed  to select his team by himself, starting of course, from a  "political grid", and further, each minister have the liberty to  choose his own second echelon.    While in agreement with the opposition on economic matters,  agriculture mainly, the PDAR does not share the latter's  determination to impeach the president of the republic, and  finds "their motivation inconclusive and ungrounded."</p>

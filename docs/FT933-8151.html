			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Money Markets: DM call money down GERMAN call money fell below the Bundesbank's official discount rate level again yesterday, although there was little expectation that the German central bank would announce a lower fixed rate repo this week, writes James Blitz. The fall in the cost of overnight lending in Germany, to 6.65-6.70 per cent yesterday from 6.70-6.80 per cent on Friday, was the result of easier conditions in the German money market. Some dealers said that only a modest amount of August's tax payments had come into the banks yesterday morning. The last repo rate was set at 6.80 per cent for 14-day funds. But many dealers expected the Bundesbank to set a similar price for funds today. Euromark futures continued to reflect a pessimistic outlook for German rate cuts, with the September contract losing 4 basis points to close at 93.49. The French domestic interest rate market was shut yester-day because of the mid-August holiday. But one dealer in London pointed out that there had been a marked rise in Euro interest rates over the last three trading days, putting them well above the level of France's domestic rates. These rates reflect the cost of borrowing and depositing French francs offshore. Three-month French Eurofrancs were quoted yesterday at 8.50 per cent, well above their Thursday level of 7.87 per cent. By contrast, three-month domestic French francs were quoted between 8.06 per cent and 8.31 per cent on Friday. The dealer wondered whether the rise in Euro rates had been the result of concern that France might introduce some form of exchange control in the wake of the crisis in the exchange rate mechanism. On Sunday, President Francois Mitterrand of France issued a particularly strong attack on the way in which currency market speculation had foundered the ERM. However, others pointed out that the differential might have been the result of distortions created by the holiday, and that the domestic market would come into line today. Sterling markets were comparatively quiet. The September short sterling contract declined 4 basis points to finish at 94.25. Three-month sterling cash was more or less unchanged at around 5 7/8 per cent. There was a daily shortage of Pounds 1.7bn.</p>

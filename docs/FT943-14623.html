			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Index futures selling reverses early advance - Market Report The uncertainty caused by persistent weakness in the US dollar, emphasised following the announcement of unchanged US producer price statistics for June caught up with London share prices yesterday. An early run towards the FT-SE 3,000 mark was abruptly reversed by heavy selling of stock index futures and the stock market fell away, unable to follow the strong lead from British government bonds. The second half of the session was somewhat erratic, with the London market suffering most of its fall before Wall Street came in with a loss of 20 Dow points in UK hours. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,963.9, for a net loss on the day of 19.9. Analysts sounded at a loss to explain why UK equities should have reversed the gains achieved on Monday when the dollar was also weak. But equities were easier across Europe yesterday, in contrast with bond markets which remained firm - with UK gilts particularly well supported. Some strategists saw this as an indication of significant switching by international investors towards European bonds. Shares started the day in good form and the Footsie gained 12.8 to reach 2,996.6 before activating the sellers in the futures market. The abruptness of the turnround, which took the Footsie down to 2,957.4 at the day's low, suggested technical selling from investors unwilling to trust the stock market above Footsie 3,000 just yet. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index fell only 8 points to 3,465.9, reflecting the closer focus on the futures-related shares which make up to the Footsie 100 Index. Trading volume increased to 594.6m from 542.5m in the previous session; on Monday, retail or customer business in equities returned worth of Pounds 1.17bn, still an improvement on last week's average daily figure. Non-Footsie share trading made up around 57 per cent of total business yesterday. The US producer prices were considerably better than the markets had expected and indicated slack inflationary pressure and, therefore, reduced pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. An improvement in US bonds was not fully held, however, and the dollar continued to soften, reinforcing worries over the implications for the profits of dollar-earning UK companies. Weakness in sterling also began to upset equity market strategists. Among the currency-related stocks, most of the dollar stocks were easier as the implications for profit repatriation of the slide in the US currency took hold. Pharmaceuticals gave ground although without suffering heavy selling pressure. The exception to the trend among blue chip multinationals was the oil sector which strengthened behind a strong crude price. However, the firmness in the German mark continued to help some building and construction issues. There were signs of profit-taking elsewhere, with many stocks falling away for little reason other than that they had performed well over the past week. The retail sector looked nervous while awaiting publication of the June Retail price index soon after the stock market opens for business this morning; analysts expect little change in the year-on-year rate of 2.6 per cent. However, today also brings statistics on average earnings in the UK which will be scanned carefully for any signs that wage pressure is building up.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Wembley disposals likely as deficit widens to Pounds 9.7m Wembley, the debt-burdened stadium and greyhound track operator, yesterday hinted at further disposals following a sharp increase in first-half losses. The group, which announced a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 9.73m for the half year to June 30, against restated profits of Pounds 2.58m, may sell its US greyhound track operations to help meet a Pounds 38.4m debt repayment due by the year-end. Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman, is thought to have held talks with possible bidders for UTR, the North American greyhound business, but no formal agreement has been signed. UTR contributed Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 600,000) to group operating profits of Pounds 6.82m (Pounds 11.3m). Of the group's other divisions, the Wembley Complex made profits of Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 5m); GRA, the UK greyhound business, saw profits rise to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.2m) while Leisure Services reported gains of Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 300,000). Sir Brian played down the pre-tax losses, saying they were almost entirely because of a restatement of goodwill on Pacer Cats, the computer ticketing business. Earlier this year Wembley sold a 50 per cent stake in Pacer Cats to meet a Pounds 40m debt repayment, but had to write back Pounds 18.7m of goodwill previously written off to reserves. Following the bank repayment, interest costs fell from Pounds 8.01m to Pounds 7.08m. Sir Brian, however, pointed to increased turnover on continuing operations of Pounds 63.2m - up 8.2 per cent from a restated Pounds 58.4m - and said full-year prospects were encouraging. Wembley is considering refinancing proposals from three rival groups: Apollo Advisers, the US investment house led by Mr Leon Black; Allied Entertainments, the promotions business run by Mr Harvey Goldsmith; and City entrepreneurs Mr Luke Johnson and Mr Hugh Osmond. 'It is hoped that the board will be able to present a proposal to shareholders during the second half,' Sir Brian said. Restated losses per share came out at 4.35p, against earnings of 0.39p; the company said it was unable to declare interim dividends on ordinary or preferred shares.</p>

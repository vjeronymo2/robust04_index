			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Property: Independent Property Databank monthly index The return on the Independent Property Databank monthly index continues to decelerate, recording 0.6 per cent in August. Both rental and capital value growth have shown signs of changes in direction over the month, with the rental value index displaying a negligible increase from 136.44 in July to 136.45 in August. Capital values fell by 0.02 per cent, the first decline in values since May 1993. Yields remain firm with the initial and equivalent yields holding at 7.8 per cent and 8.1 per cent respectively for the third consecutive month. For the calender year to date, the all-property rate of return stands at 13.5 per cent, just over half the 24.8 per cent recorded for the year to August. Due to the recent stability of valuation yields, longer-term rates of capital growth continue to slow, recording 14.9 per cent for the year to August compared with 15.3 per cent for the year to July. Industrials and retails continue to switch positions as best-performing sector; industrials regained the lead with a return of 0.8 per cent in August, followed by retails at 0.7 per cent. Offices returned 0.4 per cent and continued to lag behind. In the longer term, the sectors' relative positions remain unchanged with retails returning 26.1 per cent for the year to August, followed by industrials with 25.5 per cent and offices with 22.3 per cent.</p>

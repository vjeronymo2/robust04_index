			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / This Week: Television Plays by G F Newman usually create quite a stir - Law and Order, for example, led to allegations of bias and a ban on the BBC filming in jails for a year - so there is some anticipation about his latest, The Healer (Tonight, 9.30-10.45pm, BBC1). Paul Rhys plays the new boy on the hospital ward who discovers he has miraculous powers, with a laying on of hands proving far more effective than anything he can prescribe. He faces hostility from within the medical establishment and accusations of quackery from the press. Geraldine James plays his only white-coated ally. Although the script is unevenly paced, Newman's polemical thrust drives the drama along. This after all is the man who banned meat from the catering vans during filming. The concluding part will be shown tomorrow (9.30-10.25pm). An astonishing 60 per cent of the world's money is now held in off-shore accounts according to the Panorama team whose three-parter on the subject, Dirty Money (Tuesday, September 20, 10.25-11.05pm, BBC1) ends with a look at Grand Cayman. This Caribbean island is said to be the fifth largest financial centre in the world, with over Dollars 600bn passing through its 500 banks every year. Gavin Hewitt talks to Jack Blum, a US investigator into the BCCI affair, who argues that offshore centres provide a safe haven for money launderers by putting a stop to any serious scrutiny. We also get to hear from a man who claims to have laundered hundreds of millions of dollars through British dependent territories in the West Indies. 'I regarded it as easier than brushing your teeth,' he boasts. After a seven-year sabbatical, University Challenge returns to television (Wednesday, September 21, 8.30-9.00pm, BBC2) but on a new channel and with a new presenter. Jeremy Paxman, having honed his interrogating skills on politicians, will be showing his nicer nature by throwing questions at undergraduates, beginning with the University of Birmingham and Aberdeen University. The revival is due as much to nostalgia as it is to the intrinsic worth of the programme. So expect to hear the phrase 'your starter for ten'. Whether Paxman, however, will feel comfortable about saying 'well remembered, Queens', as Bamber Gascoigne was wont to, is a moot point. The spoof chat show, Knowing Me, Knowing You With Alan Partridge (Friday, 10.00-10.30pm, BBC2) gathers strength with its second episode. This spin-off from the Radio Four series is coarser in its approach than its progenitor but there are some exquisite moments. Tonight our man in the bad wig interviews Daniella Forest, the new agony aunt for a girlie magazine, who is described as 'a quality guest from top to bottom and back again' and a thespian couple - Tany Beaumont and Gary Barker, the bad boy of Beverly Hills. The team behind this - Steve Coogan, Patrick Marber, Rebecca Front and Doon Mackichan - represents the latest wave of ex-Oxbridge comics, following on from John Cleese et al in the 1960s, the Not The Nine O'Clock News team in the late 1970s and Stephen Fry and his coterie in the 1980s.</p>

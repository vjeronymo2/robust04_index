			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA believes that after consideration of its grandfathering policy for SIP requirements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  it is permissible to grandfather these cases from this policy clarification. The EPA's general grandfathering guidance provides that SIP revisions will remain subject to the requirements in effect on the date that the State adopts the SIP revision, provided a complete, fully adopted SIP revision is submitted promptly, generally within 60 days of the adoption. Since the policy clarification is effective by this action and all of the SIP submittals in question were adopted more than 60 days prior to September 6, 1994, under this general grandfathering, these cases are grandfathered. However, the guidance includes several exceptions to the general guidance which must be addressed before an action is considered by EPA to be grandfathered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See ``'Grandfathering' of Requirements for Pending SIP Revisions,'' memorandum from Gerald A. Emison to Air Division Director, Regions I&hyph;X, June 27, 1988. This memorandum has been entered in the docket for this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first exception concerns the intent of the policy not to grandfather SIP's submitted hurriedly to avoid new requirements. In the cases at issue, such action has not occurred on the part of the State since the States have received no early, formal notification that the sanction clock policy is being clarified in the manner it is today.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second exception to general guidance on grandfathering concerns situations where a court ruling has explicitly changed a current Federal requirement or has convinced EPA that a previous requirement is no longer supportable. Here no such court ruling is at issue so no exception should be made in this case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third exception is that the Administrator may determine that grandfathering is not appropriate under a new policy. In this case, the Administrator is determining that grandfathering is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth exception indicates that grandfathering is not appropriate if it would have an imminent and substantial adverse environmental effect or could permanently foreclose use of part D provisions such as sanctions. The EPA does not believe that grandfathering these areas from this policy clarification will have an imminent and substantial environmental impact given the limited number of areas and given that the States' submittals must be adequate to attain and maintain the relevant NAAQS before EPA can approve them. In addition, this grandfathering does not permanently foreclose the application of sanctions in these areas should EPA, through rulemaking, find the SIP submittals inadequate to attain and maintain the NAAQS and disapprove them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fifth exception provides that action on a SIP revision which comports with the revised requirements but not the original requirements may be based on the revised requirements. In this instance, this is indeed the case; conceivably, one or more of those SIP's deemed complete by operation of law may have lacked one or more of the elements needed for EPA to find a plan affirmatively complete. Nonetheless, EPA cannot fully approve a plan if any of the required completeness elements are lacking. For example, if a SIP submittal lacks compliance/enforcement strategies, one of technical elements required for completeness, then EPA could not fully approve the plan. Therefore, while EPA is grandfathering these SIP submittals from completeness, EPA is not grandfathering these areas from having adequate SIP's to attain and maintain the standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sixth exception raises a concern as to whether grandfathering the SIP from the requirements in question would render the SIP as a whole substantially inadequate. Grandfathering these SIP submittals from this policy does not raise direct concern that doing so might render the SIP's substantially inadequate since the completeness review is not a review intended to pass judgement on the adequacy of SIP's. Rather, it is intended as a straightforward exercise to determine whether the SIP's contain all the technical and administrative elements to warrant further review. As discussed above, if any of these SIP submittals deemed complete by operation of law lack any such elements, then such deficiency will be reflected in EPA's determination as to the SIP's adequacy to attain and maintain the air quality standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The seventh exception concerns certain classes of changes which are only indirectly related to attainment and maintenance of the air quality standards. Completeness reviews are only indirectly related to attainment and maintenance of the standards in that the completeness review is not intended to be review of the SIP's adequacy to meet the standards. Therefore, the grandfathering of these SIP submittals from the policy clarification satisfies this exception as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two, the phrase ``affected area'' has been substituted for ``area.'' This is to clarify that the sanction only applies in affected areas, and not necessarily all areas for which EPA makes a section 179(a) finding. (See the discussion of ``affected area'' under the definitions section above.) Three, the second sentence regarding highway sanctions has been clarified to provide that correction of the deficiency ``forming the basis of the finding'' is needed to stop the clock. This language is consistent with the language included in the proposal section 52.31(d)(1) for the offset sanction in sentence 1 and consistent with the interpretation established in the preamble to the proposed rule at pages 51272&hyph;51273. This revision merely clarifies what deficiency needs to be corrected in order to stop the sanctions clock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

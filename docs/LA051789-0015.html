			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAL THOMAS ON ABORTION  </P> <P> I cannot believe what I have just read. The article by Thomas was very  upsetting.  </P> <P> Is there no law requiring proper disposal of all tissue removed from humans? I  had miscarriages followed by D&amp;Cs, and I was assured all material was  disposed of properly and respectfully. The material was supplied to the young  girl by her uncle who was a pathologist. Is that proper and respectful  disposal?  </P> <P> DORTHA KAUFMAN  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

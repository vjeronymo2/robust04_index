			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Serbs delay EC's plan for Bosnian state TWO OF Bosnia's main ethnic groups, the Moslems and Croats, yesterday agreed to the outline of a federation for their trouble-torn republic. However, Bosnian Serb negotiators reserved their position, prompting Lord Carrington, chairman of the European Community-sponsored peace conference, to declare that it would be 'a very great pity if the Serbs in Bosnia pass up this opportunity for an agreement'. Despite separate talks between the three Bosnian groups starting on Sunday and lasting until 6am yesterday - before the three-hour plenary session with other Yugoslav republics - leaders of Bosnia's Serbs said they had to consult their community back home before pronouncing on the draft plan. After chairing the first plenary session of the EC's peace conference on Yugoslavia for two months, Lord Carrington described the plan as an opportunity which 'if missed is going to lead to considerable trouble'. But he said the Bosnian Serb leaders showed themselves 'perfectly prepared to recognise the independence of Bosnia', despite the widespread Serb boycott of the recent referendum. The plan for Bosnia would create a bicameral system, with a Chamber of Citizens elected proportionally and a Chamber of Constituent Units giving Moslems, Serbs and Croats equal representation. A four-fifths majority in the latter chamber would be required for any decisions on the republic's flag, education, religion, and macro-economic policy. The EC conference officials hope a deal on Bosnia is now within their reach, and that this could pave the way to progress on wider problems such as the future economic relationship between the four republics - Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Macedonia - seeking independence and the Serbian-Montengrin rump of Yugoslavia, and their status in international bodies. With the fate of Bosnia so delicately balanced, foreign ministers of the EC may seek to dissuade the US from immediately recognising the four independence-seeking republics, when they meet Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, in Brussels later today. In a sharp shift of US policy, which has so far been not to give any formal recognition to seceding republics, Mr Baker sent the EC a letter, arguing that if Bosnia is recognised as an independent unit, it may avoid a dangerous fragmentation. The violence following the Bosnia referendum appears to have changed Washington's mind. Mr Baker urged 'the collective recognition of Bosnia and its territorial integrity'.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: ECI soars 77% to Dollars 27.4m on overseas demand for equipment ECI TELECOM, one of Israel's fastest-growing companies, posted a 77 per cent increase in net profits in 1991 to Dollars 27.4m as demand for its capacity-enhancing voice and data circuit multiplying equipment rose sharply in its main North American and European markets, in spite of recession. ECI, which like a growing number of successful Israeli high-technology companies is quoted on Nasdaq in the US, has managed spectacular growth since the late 1980s when it rebounded from a period of losses by shifting away from defence to civilian products, which account for the majority of sales. Sales last year, most overseas, were a shade under Dollars 114m, up 53 per cent over 1990 and more than twice the Dollars 53m reached in 1989. Mr David Rubner, the chief executive, said a feature of 1991 had been ECI's penetration of eastern European markets. Sales to state telecommunications concerns in eastern Germany, Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria accounted for about 15 per cent of the total, he said. The company, whose main shareholders are Israel's Clal group and Mr Charles Bronfman, the Canadian investor, is offering a two-for-one share split as dividend to increase share liquidity. Koor Industries, the conglomerate rescued last year by its creditors from a crippling debt burden, is planning to follow the example of ECI and similar companies by floating roughly one-third of its telecommunications and electronics subsidiary Tadiran on New York markets, spurning the narrow-based Tel Aviv stock exchange. Tadiran, signalling a Dollars 30m net profit in 1991 after a period of heavy losses, was recently valued by Israeli consultant banks at between Dollars 280m and Dollars 330m. Koor is shortly to pick the main underwriting bank from a shortlist of Merrill Lynch, Shearson Leaman, First Boston and Kidder Peabody. Mr Benjamin Gaon, Koor chief executive, remarked that times had changed since Koor's US creditors had threatened it with liquidation. 'It is amazing. This time they are chasing us to do business with us, not the other way around.'</p>

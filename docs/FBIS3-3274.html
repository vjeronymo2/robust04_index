Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan's unemployment  rate stood at 1.44 percent last year, the lowest level since  1982, the Council for Economic Planning and Development reported  Thursday [17 March].    Council statistics show that out of an average labor force  of  8.87 million in 1993, only 128,000 were unemployed.    The labor force includes civilians 15 years of age and over  who are available for work.    Officials said that the relocation abroad of labor-intensive  industries, an increase in public investment projects, and a  strong job demand by the service sector were among major factors  pushing down the joblessness rate.    The number of employees in the manufacturing sector shrank  by  4 percent to 2.48 million last year mainly due to the relocation  of labor-intensive industries and the acceleration of production  automation, while service sector employees increased 4.2 percent  to 4.32 million, the officials elaborated.    In addition, they said, the labor force participation rate  fell to a 10-year low of 58.82 percent in 1993, indicating that  Taiwan residents have yet to increase their willingness to work.    The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the  labor force compared to all civilians 15 years of age and over,  including those who are unavailable for work. Those unavailable  for work are people such as housewives, students, and senior  citizens who are not working and are not seeking jobs.    Meanwhile, the average monthly salary in Taiwan was  NT$32,009  [New Taiwan dollars] (US$1,207.88) last year, up 7.7 percent  from the previous year.    The pay raise rate was the lowest level since 1986,  indicating lackluster domestic business in 1993, the officials  noted.</p>

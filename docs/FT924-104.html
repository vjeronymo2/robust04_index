			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Yeltsin urges Russians to rely on their own wits PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday praised his countrymen for resisting calls to rebel against painful economic reforms and urged them to rely on their own wits to survive more hardship to come. 'I express my deep gratitude, respected citizens of Russia, for showing such surprising endurance. . . and for not following those who called you to the barricades, urged you to strike. You did not follow those who once called on Russia to take up the axe,' Mr Yeltsin said in a televised New Year's address in which he referred to bloody popular uprisings which have been a feature of past Russian history. But urging Russians to play a more active role in the reforms, he said the appearance of 17m private entrepreneurs, farmers and providers of services showed that 'success. . . is accessible to anyone who does not wait for a gift from heaven but works for himself'. He also jeered at his political opponents, who had in vain predicted 'hunger, cold, full destruction, and millions of unemployed' when radical reforms started off with price liberalisation a year ago. Although he failed to promise - as he has in the past - that things would improve quickly, he claimed the first signs of stabilisation had already appeared. Industrial production, for instance, had stopped falling. He said nobody would be able to knock Russia off its reform course. Earlier he revealed that he and his family would invest their privatisation vouchers in one of the new investment funds now being set up as part of Russia's mass sell-off of state-owned enterprises. Mr Yeltsin, whose personal authority has been necessary to protect reformers in the past, said that he now wanted to leave economic matters to the recently-reshuffled reformist cabinet. He said he planned to focus on protecting the poorest members of society and would launch a campaign against the corruption and crime which plague everyday life in addition to the high inflation and chaos wrought by the economic reforms. 'The painful period of destroying the old order is coming to an end: we now have to clear the wreckage and build a new home,' said Mr Yeltsin, himself a former construction engineer. Finally, the president publicly thanked Mr Yegor Gaidar, the prime minister whom he failed to save from the Congress of People's Deputies's wrath, for 'teaching market economics' to the government and the people, and for courageously taking most of the blame for the reforms.</p>

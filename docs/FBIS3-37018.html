DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil Assesses the  Military Adventure That Is Being Prepared"]    [Text] In recent days a propaganda campaign directed  against North Korea has been surging ahead strongly in the West  and on the other side of the ocean. In terms of its scale and  tone it is commensurate with what happened on the eve of the  ill-starred Desert Storm. Numerous voices are to be heard  saying that it is necessary to "punish" the DPRK and "crush" it  by military might. The reasoning is the traditional pharisaical  reasoning: shouts about some threat to peace in Northeast Asia  supposedly stemming from this small socialist state. Our  correspondent met with Comrade Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to  Russia, and asked him to answer questions connected with these  extremely alarming circumstances.    [Turchenko] Comrade Son Song-pil, there can be few people  now who would doubt that when the world policeman shouts "Stop  thief!" this is nothing but a propaganda smoke screen to conceal  from public opinion the machinations going on behind the scenes.  Where is the dog buried in this instance?    [Son] In Japan. A powerful nuclear reactor was started up  in that country a few days ago. Japan has become capable of  producing nuclear weapons. Capacities for the production of 800  tonnes [figure as published] of plutonium a year have been  commissioned. In terms of this indicator the Japanese have  emerged into third place in the world after the United States  and France. On Japanese territory now there is 1.6 tonnes of  plutonium, plus it has 2.9 tonnes abroad. Up to 50 tonnes is  being forecast by the start of the next millennium. That would  be enough to provide 6,200 nuclear weapons. In addition, Japan  possesses ICBM's capable of carrying them.    In the past North and South Korea signed a declaration on  turning the Korean Peninsula into a nuclear-free zone. We are  working to extend this status to the whole of Northeast Asia.  But if Japan becomes a nuclear power, that will pose a  tremendous threat to the Korean Peninsula, and the said  declaration will lose all meaning. Such a militarist step will  encourage other countries in the region, including ours, to take  appropriate measures. We are convinced that the world community  must show vigilance and halt this process in a timely manner.  Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on this 4  February. But, instead of exerting appropriate influence over  Japan, the United States raised a propaganda ballyhoo over our  country, accusing it of what the Japanese ought to have been  accused of. The DPRK, however, has neither the intention nor  the material potential to produce nuclear weapons.    [Turchenko] This propaganda ballyhoo does not seem to have  been raised just to cover Japan's militarist aspirations. Are  there any other aims?    [Son] There are several. When the Soviet Union existed, the  Americans had military bases in South Korea on the pretext of a  supposed threat from the USSR. Now that pretext has fallen  away. Now they make a bugaboo out of North Korea so as to  provide at least some reason for a military presence in  Northeast Asia.    Another aim is connected with the long-standing U.S. desire  to destroy our socialist state. In order to create a propaganda  base for the use of military force, they accuse us of allegedly  not only having long-range missiles ourselves but also selling  them to Near East countries, thereby destabilizing the  situation. Basing themselves on these propaganda fabrications,  U.S. militarist circles insist on military sanctions against the  DPRK. I wish to emphasize: Our armed forces are built on the  principle of self-defense and threaten no one. On the contrary,  proceeding from the essence of the socialist system, the DPRK  strives to strengthen peace by all means. It is, however, the  firm will of the people and the Army to uphold the country's  sovereignty. We are ready for any surprise attack and are  always true to our position: to respond to dialogue with  dialogue, and to war with war.    [Turchenko] How real is the threat of an attack on the DPRK,  and what do you see as the time frame of this sinister prospect?    [Son] The United States is already taking specific steps to  this end. In recent days, for example, intensive work has been  under way to site U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea.  Unfortunately, I have to state that an attack might be made at  any moment.    [Turchenko] Of course, the entire world community is obliged  to prevent such a development of events, but the primary duty  lies with the countries with which you have treaties of mutual  assistance. Please name them.    [Son] We have such treaties, including treaties in military  spheres, with China and the USSR. Russia is the successor to  the USSR, and our treaty has not lost its force.    [Turchenko] How did the Russian authorities react to the  DPRK Foreign Ministry's 4 February statement?    [Son] The Russian Federation Foreign Ministry told us that  it would study it, but there has not yet been an official  reaction. In this connection I must emphasize the following.  The maintenance of peace is undoubtedly the common concern of  all countries. The more people who are found to help us at a  difficult moment, the better. But it is not always possible to  count on anyone in the business of upholding sovereignty. Our  people and our Army are ready for very determined actions. If  we are attacked, the whole people will be mobilized and together  with the Army will rise to the motherland's defense. Let those  who are planning aggression in North Korea ponder that.</p>

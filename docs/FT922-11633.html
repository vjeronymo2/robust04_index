			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Sun Micro edges ahead SUN Microsystems, the leading US manufacturer of computer workstations, unveiled a 5 per cent improvement in third-quarter net income to Dollars 61.4m, or 60 cents a share, on revenues that rose 12 per cent to a record Dollars 952.2m. In the quarter a year earlier, the company, based in Mountain View, California, had net income of Dollars 58.7m, or 56 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 848.3m. On Wall Street, Sun Microsystems' shares have been volatile recently amid concern that it would not be able to live up to expectations of tremendous growth. The company has been one of the fastest-growing in the computer industry. For the first nine months, Sun had net income of Dollars 135.6m, or Dollars 1.34, up 9 per cent from Dollars 123.9m, or Dollars 1.21, in the same period last year. Revenues advanced 15 per cent to Dollars 1.62bn. Mr Kevin Melia, chief financial officer, said demand in the third quarter had been particularly strong in the Pacific Rim, especially in Japan. Growth was more modest in the US and Europe.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Slovenia and Croatia in pact Slovenia and Croatia, the ex-Yugoslav neighbours at loggerheads over issues ranging from borders to banking, look set to establish normal ties, Reuter reports from Davos. Slovenia's prime minister, Mr Janez Drnovsek, said yesterday: 'We will sign a trade agreement next week with Croatia. It seems we will normalise relations.' Mr Drnovsek, in Davos for the World Economic Forum of business and political leaders, had talks last week with his Croatian counterpart, Mr Nikica Valentic, in Ljubljana, the Slovenian capital. These covered a jointly-owned nuclear power station in Slovenian Krsko, a dispute about the operations of Slovenia's biggest bank in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, and disagreements about the common border. Mr Drnovsek said the border disputes had not been settled and would have to be examined by an inter-state commission. But there were signs of a resolution to the other issues.</p>

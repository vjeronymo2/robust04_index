			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Michel Leclercq] </F>   [Excerpts] Paris, May 25 (AFP) -- A two-day summit of 57  countries will be held here from Thursday [26 May] with the aim  of defusing possible new wars in Europe by settling potential  border disputes and solving the problems of minorities.    The brainchild of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur,  the  conference will aim to frame a Stability Pact which would be  signed by the end of the year for potential new candidates to  the European Union (EU).    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said the summit aimed to  settle border and minority problems between "countries with the  vocation of entering the EU," following the collapse of the  Soviet bloc. [passage omitted]    Juppe said the conference, sponsored by the EU as a whole  and  to be held at UNESCO headquarters here, would be an "exercise in  preventive diplomacy" for future EU members.    European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure said the union,  while prepared to accept new members, was unwilling to take on  board "new sources of conflict."    The aim was to "provide a political impetus" to handle  good-neighbour problems "better and quicker," Juppe said.    On the agenda will be the big Hungarian minorities in  Romania  (1.6 million) and Slovakia (600,000). [passage omitted]    Juppe said he hoped an interim conference would be held by  the end of the year, to be followed by a summit in the first  since months of 1995 to sign the Stability Pact.

Our correspondent Gid'on Kouts  reports that the Israeli-Palestinian formulations committee  completed its work and has reached a written document. Israeli  sources in Davos say that if the document is approved by Yitzhaq  Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat an agreement will be reached. Sources  in the Palestinian delegation say, on the other hand, that some  problems remain and the Israelis are retreating from promises  they have made.    The document includes mutually agreed-upon positions as well  as the positions of each of the two sides. It was reported that  agreement has been reached on the sterile room at the border  crossings, as well as on the issues of security roads and zones  in the Gaza Strip. On the other hand there is only a basic  understanding regarding the size of the Jericho area; a  gentleman's agreement has been reached that Israel will increase  this size as a goodwill gesture.    The Israeli sources assessed that the agreement will not be  initialed tonight.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told our correspondent that  if  everything is concluded this will constitute a major step toward  implementing the agreement of principles. Peres would not  commit himself to deadlines and dates for the implementation of  the agreement of principles, but said that if an agreement is  reached the road will be greatly shortened. He added that every  side has remained faithful to its principles: Israel made no  concessions on security issues, whereas the Palestinians  insisted on issues relating to their self-respect and sentiments.</p>

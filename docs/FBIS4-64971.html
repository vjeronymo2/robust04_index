			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Luxembourg correspondent Baudouin Bollaert: </F> "Western European Union Opens Up to East"]    [Excerpts] Europe discreetly took its first steps toward  East European integration yesterday in Luxembourg. The member  states of the WEU [Western European Union], i.e., the European  Union [EU] minus Denmark and Ireland, concluded an association  agreement with six countries of Central and East Europe (Poland,  Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania) and  the three Baltic countries. According to [French Foreign  Minister] Alain Juppe, this agreement "signals a decisive phase  in the organization's development."    Since the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, the WEU,  which is the only European body competent in defense matters,  has become, if not the "armed wing" of the European Union, then  at least the embryo of a future common defense and the "European  pillar" of NATO. With the reinforcement of these nine new  "associate partners," it will become the only forum for  discussing the concept of security in Europe without the  Russians or the Americans.    "We emphasized the parallelism of the East European  countries' membership in the EU and in the WEU," clarified the  French foreign minister. In other words, their associate  membership should be seen in the light of their future EU  membership. [passage omitted]    Alain Juppe feels that one must not see either "competition  "  or "contradiction" between the Partnership for Peace and the  agreement signed yesterday in Luxembourg, but rather  "complementarity." In this respect, [French Defense Minister]  Francois Leotard emphasized that exercises by the French-German  brigade together with Polish units this fall in France would be  placed under the double sponsorship of the Partnership for Peace  and the WEU. He also recalled that the Groups of Multinational  Interarmy Forces, which are currently being looked into by NATO,  may be placed under WEU command, with possible reinforcements  being provided by troops from the East European countries. This  did not stop him from recommending that the WEU should develop  its own capabilities in the areas of "satellite observation,  intelligence, and strategic mobility." He also revived the idea  of a French-German armaments agency.    So, little by little, the WEU is shedding its anonymity and  the design of a "Greater Europe" is seeing the light of day  through enhanced cooperation in security matters. "Saint  Schuman day [reference to French statesman Robert Schuman] is  definitely a symbol!," commented one diplomat yesterday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by this journal's special correspondent: "China Will </F> See the Emergence of a New Industry--The Property Rights Trading  Industry"]    [Excerpt] On 18-20 September 1993 the Symposium  on Enterprise Merger and Bankruptcy was held in Beijing. This  symposium was jointly sponsored by the Enterprise Department of  the State Bureau of State-Asset Management, the Research  Department of the Chinese Industrial Economics Association, the  Wage Institute under the Labor Ministry, the journal JINGJI  GUANLI, and the Siyuan Merger and Bankruptcy Consulting Agency  of Beijing, and was organized by the Siyuan Agency. One hundred  and thirty-six people, including representatives of the relevant  agencies of the central and local governments, the Supreme  People's Court and some superior and intermediate people's  courts, enterprises, institutions of high learning, institutions  of scientific and technological research, news organizations,  and the International Bankruptcy Association and renowned  bankruptcy judges and accountants from Poland and Hong Kong,  participated in the symposium. The symposium carried out  extensive and in-depth discussions of policy issues which had  emerged in the process of handling enterprise mergers and  bankruptcies after the going into effect of the Enterprise  Bankruptcy Law of our country, and which needed to be resolved.  Combining discussion and study, combining theory with practice,  combining the government and private individuals, and having  entrepreneurs, scholars, and government officials "perform on  the same stage" were prominent features of this symposium.    Cao Siyuan, president of the Siyuan Agency, thoroughly  expounded the proposed draft of the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law  (Tentative) of the People's Republic of China that he had put  forward. According to him, in revising the bankruptcy law, it is  necessary to follow three principles: First, move further toward  international practices; second, be conducive to improving  case-handling efficiency during the process of implementation;  and, third, pay attention to maintaining continuity. Therefore,  he favored moderate revision rather than radical revision. The  nine revision proposals put forward by him were as follows: 1)  Extend the scope of application from all people-owned  enterprises to all enterprise legal persons. 2) The statement of  the legislative purpose should be simplified, and should not  have ideological colors. 3) Bankruptcy should be defined in a  uniform way and it should be clearly stipulated that bankruptcy  mean "being unable to pay debts as they are due." 4) As for the  issue of placement of employees of bankrupt enterprises, since  the State Council has already issued rules, there are no  additional rules in the text. 5) It is necessary to abolish some  rules such as the rule that a petition in bankruptcy or for  amicable settlement and consolidation has to be approved by the  enterprise's supervisory agency and endorsed by the workers'  congress after discussion. 6. Introduce the concept of the  bankrupt's creditor. 7) Shorten bankruptcy cases' handling time,  and one measure in this regard will be to change the time limit  on filing creditor claims from three months to two months. 8) Do  not directly cite criminal law provisions in the bankruptcy law;  it would be adequate to just have the explicit wording in  accordance with the relevant criminal law provisions. 9. The  work of establishing liquidation teams should be regulated by  the market. The main current obstacle, he also said, to the  implementation of the bankruptcy law is that in the course of  implementing the bankruptcy system, creditors, especially the  banks, lack the enthusiasm for using the bankruptcy law to  protect their own economic interests; the second is the issue of  placement of employees of bankrupt enterprises. China will see  the emergence of a new industry--the property rights trading  industry and the emergence of the new occupation of the "merger  producers," he predicted very confidently. Their business is to  "trade" in enterprises, and "trading" in enterprises is not a  bad thing. They buy enterprises, have the enterprises  consolidated, transformed, and packaged, and then sell the  enterprises. After going through this process, enterprises would  emerge with entirely new looks, and would have levels of  efficiency totally different from those in the past. Turning  from "money eating" enterprises into "money spitting"  enterprises. Producers of enterprise mergers would make a great  deal of money through first devouring and then throwing up  enterprises. But such money is not made through exploiting  national calamities but made through benefiting from competition  and prosperity.    Professor Xiao Zhuoji of Beijing University made five points  with regard to the issue of merger and bankruptcy. First, merger  and bankruptcy represent the objective demands of a market  economy. Under a market economy, the law of survival of the  fittest is effective, and it is inevitable that some enterprises  will face bankruptcy; at the same time some enterprises need to  develop and grow and the main way to develop is to have mergers.  Second, merger and bankruptcy constitute an important way to  have resources allocated in an optimum manner and can result in  limited resources being transferred to sectors and industries  equipped with advantageous conditions, thereby producing  economies of scale which are conducive to the development of the  social productive forces. Third, merger and development  themselves would improve the overall quality of enterprises. To  enterprises, merger represents a driving force, and bankruptcy  represents a pressure. Because of such a driving force and  pressure, every enterprise must strive to improve the standards  of its business operation and management; otherwise, it would  face the danger of elimination. Fourth, merger and bankruptcy  constitute an effective way to safeguard state properties. A  loss making enterprise is subsidized by the state, and the  state's losses are unlimited; however, if the bankruptcy method  is used, there will be some losses of state property, but the  losses will be limited. Furthermore, it is possible to utilize  the original assets for making up the losses through  transferring properties. Fifth, merger and bankruptcy also  constitute an important way to maintain social stability. If  some enterprises which should be liquidated are kept alive with  difficulty, it would seem on the surface that workers are not  unemployed and society would seem stable; but society's  resources would be wasted or remain idle, and such a situation  would mean the greatest instability. Only by adopting the merger  and bankruptcy method so as to achieve the optimum allocation of  resources, develop the economy, and improve efficiency, would it  be possible to fundamentally ensure social stability.    Guan Weili, director of the Enterprise Department of the  Bureau of State-Asset Management, put forward ten ideas on the  issue of enterprise merger and bankruptcy. 1) Enterprise  bankruptcy and merger are an indispensable link in the market  economy, and merger and bankruptcy constitute the main way of  adjusting the allocation of factors of production. 2) Bankruptcy  and merger can both be positive means, and constitute  metabolism. Letting bankrupt enterprises control resources means  wasting resources, and it would be better to have bankrupt  enterprises absorbed by enterprises equipped with advantageous  conditions. At the present stage, it is proper to take larger  steps with respect to merger and bankruptcy. 3) The current  situation of state-owned enterprises has two major  characteristics: First, the level of efficiency is low while the  problem of asset washout is serious. Some enterprises cannot be  saved, while some others are not suited to remaining in their  respective industries; to them, merger and bankruptcy are good  things. Second, the speed is high but the figures are inflated;  the situation is governed by plans but also unbalanced.  Enterprises face a heavy task of carrying out structural  readjustment. 4) To have mergers and bankruptcies, it is first  of all necessary to clearly define property right relationships  and to make clear who have ownership; we must have agencies  which exercise ownership rights over enterprises. In the  transition period, enterprises' supervisory agencies must  continue to exercise supervisory and management rights. 5) It is  proper not to take away an enterprise's legal person status  after it has been absorbed, and this practice can serve as a  nonstandardized method, and be reflected in some way in the  future enterprise merger law. 6) To have enterprise mergers as  well as bankruptcies, it is necessary to transform the function  of financial institutions. 7) Amidst enterprise bankruptcies and  mergers, it is necessary to resolve the issue of placement of  employees. 8) To have enterprise bankruptcies as well as  mergers, we must establish a system of asset evaluation. 9)  Change views, clarify understanding, and have a new  understanding of the property right structure of state assets.  10) Enterprise bankruptcy and merger are dependent on the  establishment, development, and perfecting of a property rights  trading market. Enterprise bankruptcy itself needs a market; the  existing state-asset management agencies and structural reform  agencies are doing the relevant work in this respect. The  Enterprise Merger Society established by the symposium should  play its due role in this respect.    Dr. Li Shuguang, vice president of the Siyuan Agency,  submitted to the symposium the proposed text of the Enterprise  Merger Law (Draft) prepared by the research group led by him,  and delivered a speech entitled "The Development of the Market  Economy Needs an Enterprise Merger Law," expounding the proposed  text.    The main breakthroughs and additions contained in "The  Proposed Text" with regard to the existing economic laws and  regulations were: Clarifying the legislative purpose and  application scope of the Enterprise Merger Law as well as the  concept of enterprise merger; containing specific rules on the  modes and categories of enterprise merger and on merger  agreements; containing clear rules on dividing enterprise assets  in merger asset evaluation under the new accounting system and  on sources of funds for mergers; containing more detailed rules  on the placement of employees of absorbed enterprises than "The  Tentative Provisions"; containing a chapter dealing exclusively  with "legal responsibilities." The purpose was to raise the  merger law's statutes and authority in an effort to impose norms  on the conduct of all parties.    "The Proposed Text" aroused strong reactions from the  participants of the symposium. According to the participating  foreign scholars and experts, China should, as other countries,  have a merger law which, while in line with international  practices, is also appropriate to China's realities. People from  government agencies and the business community argued that both  carrying out practical work and invigorating the merger market  would keenly need the Enterprise Merger Law, and expressed the  hope that this law would come into being as soon as possible.

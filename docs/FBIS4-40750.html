			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Open letter to the president, the prime minister, the </F> chairman of the Federation Council, and the chairman of the  State Duma," signed by ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's chief editor and  general director; date not given: "How Will ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA  Implement the Law?"]    [Text] We are addressing you in connection with the  adoption and publication of the federal Law "On the Procedure  for the Promulgation and Entry Into Force of Federal  Constitutional Laws, Federal Laws, and Enactments of the  Chambers of the Federal Assembly." Article 4 contains a  specific instruction -- that the official promulgation of laws  and acts is deemed to consist in the first publication of the  complete text in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA.    We had been expecting this law. And we recognize that it not  only does the newspaper an honor, but also imposes a great  responsibility on it. It is necessary promptly and accurately  to convey to the mass reader (whether he lives centrally, in a  remote area, or abroad) the documents by which Russians are to  live.    The technological process for the publication of these  documents has been developed. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's printing and  distribution network, though not perfect, is effective and has  good prerequisites for development and improvement. And that is  the main thing. Many people print documents, but to do it like  this -- with a large print run, on a specific day, reaching  every corner of the country, reaching the precise destination --  probably only ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA can do this now.    Our awareness of the importance of this task is what makes  the editorial collective perform real miracles, despite  extremely meager budget financing. Having taken over the  newspaper with huge debts in October 1993, in order not to stop  producing the paper we were forced to put the editorial staff on  starvation rations, cut the number of employees, make economies  literally everywhere, and constantly reallocate money and paper.  But the main thing is that the editorial office started to make  money. Although the government finances only just over  one-third of the cost of producing the newspaper, ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA is still coming out. Primarily because the editorial  office itself covers a further one-third of the newspaper's  budget.    So it transpires that today we and the government are equal  partners. It was not easy: Just you try to make money starting  not from zero (Khasbulatov's ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA was 100-percent  state subsidized), but from a large minus number (debts). And  without selling out to commercial structures, from which there  were tempting offers.    All the same, with an editorial budget deficit of one-third,  it has not been possible to avoid production stoppages. Readers  in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Saratov, Rostov, Krasnodar,  Irkutsk, and other cities failed to receive copies of  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA containing edicts, laws, decrees, and  directives. In some of those cities production of the newspaper  stopped for a month or more.    We are reaping the fruits now. Although even preliminary  subscription figures for the second half-year are not yet  available, a marked reduction in the number of subscribers can  be confidently predicted.    Frankly speaking, this is advantageous to the editorial  office in economic terms -- it means fewer losses. But in terms  of building a rule-of-law state, Russia loses a great deal.  These losses cannot be measured against economic benefits.    And now we have this law. Of course, we will implement it.  But we are not yet capable of taking this burden on our own  shoulders alone.    [Signed] Chief editor, General director</p>

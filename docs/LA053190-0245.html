			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> AUSSIE ROCKERS ON N.Y. STREETS  </P> <P> Australian rock band Midnight Oil took their music and environment theme to the  streets, performing amid the skyscrapers of midtown Manhattan for a lunchtime  crowd.  </P> <P> "We've got a mega-crisis on our hands that we all have to approach," lead  singer Peter Garrett said after Wednesday's performance.  </P> <P> "We've got a crisis that our leaders, corporations and governments have a prime  responsibility to address seriously."  </P> <P> The band is on a U.S. tour to promote their new album, "Blue Sky Mining."  </P> <P> Although they have been performing for 10 years, their U.S. breakthrough wasn't  until 1987 with their hit song "Beds Are Burning" from their album "Diesel and  Dust."  </P> <P> Their songs concentrate on the ecosystem, world peace and corporate greed. At  the invitation of Midnight Oil, the environmental group Greenpeace sets up  information tables at each concert.  </P> <P> Garrett is also an attorney and president of the Australian Conservation  Foundation, the country's leading advisory board on problems of national  heritage and environment.  </P> <P> "We can't just do a one-day Earth Day," Garrett said.  </P></p>

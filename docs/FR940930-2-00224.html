(``CSWS''), both located at 1616 Woodall Rogers Freeway, Dallas, Texas 75202, have filed a declaration under Section 6(a), 7 and 12(b) of the Act and Rule 45 thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSWS proposes, through December 31, 1996, to refinance certain of its long-term assets (``Assets''), including the CSW headquarters building located in Dallas, Texas (``Headquarters Building'') by borrowing up to $60 million from one or more commercial banks and/or institutional lenders. The Assets, including the Headquarters Building, are currently financed primarily through the CSW Money Pool (``Money Pool''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSWS and CSW propose to refinance the Assets either through a floating rate loan from a commercial bank or through a fixed rate private placement of securities to institutional lenders. Bank borrowings will be evidenced by secured or unsecured notes with maturities not exceeding 15 years and bear interest at not more than 100 basis points above the LIBOR or similar rate. In connection with such floating rate borrowing, CSWS requests authority to enter into interest rate swap agreements to obtain the benefits of fixed rate financing. Any swap agreements would provide that the prepayment of the notes would terminate CSWS' obligations to its counterparty under the swap agreement. Institutional borrowings will be evidenced by notes with maturities not exceeding 15 years and bear interest at a rate not expected to exceed the effective cost of money from unsecured prime commercial rate loans prevailing on the date of such borrowings. The choice between the financing alternatives will depend principally on market conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proceeds from the proposed borrowings will not be used to finance the acquisition of an exempt wholesale generator or a foreign utility company as defined in Section 32 and 33 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the sole holder of the outstanding common stock of CSWS and as an inducement to commercial banks or institutional lenders to make loans to CSWS, it is contemplated that CSW may be required to guarantee the obligations of CSWS to the lenders. Accordingly, CSW proposed to guarantee the payments due to lenders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alabama Power Company, et al.

In the event that any Operating Company organizes its Special Purpose Subsidiary as either an LLC or an LP, it may also organize a second special purpose subsidiary under the General Corporation Law of any state in which they respectively are organized to do business or are incorporated, or of the State of Delaware or other jurisdiction, as the case may be (``Investment Sub''), for the respective purpose of: (1) Acquiring and holding Special Purpose Subsidiary common stock so as to comply with the requirement under the applicable LLC Act that a limited liability company have at least two members; and (2) acting as the general partner of such Special Purpose Subsidiary and acquiring, either directly or indirectly through such Investment Sub, a limited partnership interest in such Special Purpose Subsidiary to ensure that such Special Purpose Subsidiary will at all times have a limited partner to the extent required by the applicable LP Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

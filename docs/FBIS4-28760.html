			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 14 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Now that Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa has  discussed the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected development of  nuclear arms with the ROK and China, the government intends to  make a final decision on how to deal with the issue after the UN  Security Council discusses sanctions against North Korea.    With regard to the announcement by North Korea on the  evening  of 13 June that it would withdraw from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA]  said: "We are not sure about its real intention."    However, since North Korea has not indicated it would also  withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), MOFA is  unable to determine whether the DPRK has now adopted a  completely confrontational line.    MOFA is watching North Korean reaction when former U.S.  President Jimmy Carter pays a visit this week. According to a  senior MOFA official some people in the ministry believe that  "North Korea is still groping for a solution through dialogue."  They see the behavior of the DPRK during Carter's visit as one  indicator by which to judge the intention behind the  announcement to withdraw from the IAEA.    Meanwhile, Kakizawa called ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu  on 13 June to inform Han of the substance of his discussions on  12 June with PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen concerning the  North Korean nuclear issue. Han expressed the hope that Japan  would continue to exert efforts to persuade China to play a  constructive role. The two foreign ministers confirmed that  Japan and the ROK will keep in close contact.</p>

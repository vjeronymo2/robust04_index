			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / CSCE adopts greater role in resolving conflicts EUROPE'S main security forum, the 48-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, yesterday agreed to give itself a more active and effective role in preventing and resolving conflicts between member states. After two days of talks here, CSCE foreign ministers, including 10 newcomers from the independent states of the former Soviet Union, approved a document providing for the despatch of more fact-finding, monitoring and conciliation missions to flashpoint areas. The CSCE's first action under this heading will be to send a fact-finding mission to the disputed Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, claimed both by Azerbaijan and Armenia. The ministers also agreed to send fact-finding and monitoring missions to newly democratised members in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to ensure that these states were respecting human rights commitments. A proposal by Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, to create CSCE peace-keeping units was backed by Italy and Czechoslovakia. But it was opposed by the US, Britain and France, who expressed strong reservations about any move to duplicate tasks which they considered were the preserve of the United Nations. However, the German proposal, together with another idea to create special environmental defence forces - so-called 'green helmets' - will be given another airing at the CSCE's Helsinki follow-up conference in March. One of the most significant decisions was to amend the organisation's consensus rule, which has been the biggest obstacle to effective action in cases such as the Yugoslav conflict. In case of 'clear, gross and uncorrected violations of CSCE commitments', a majority of member states could take 'appropriate action ...if necessary in the absence of the state concerned.' The ministers also agreed to bolster its Vienna-based Conflict Prevention Centre by increasing its rapporteur missions to flashpoints. At a closing news conference, Mr Jiri Dienstbier, Czechoslovak foreign minister, said the CSCE, to be effective, must move towards legally binding mechanisms. 'Interference is essential if we wish to enhance human rights.' For Mr Douglas Hogg, Britain's junior foreign minister, the ministers had achieved 'some modest improvement' in the CSCE's effectiveness. But Mr Genscher painted a much brighter picture: 'We will extend the CSCE process. We will give it greater possibilities.' The Serb-dominated Yugoslav state presidency yesterday summoned Serb leaders from Croatia to Belgrade to try to get them to accept a United Nations plan to deploy 10,000 peacekeepers, Laura Silber writes from Belgrade. At the same time, Mr Borisav Jovic, Serbia's representative to the state presidency, accused Croatia of blocking the UN initiative.</p>

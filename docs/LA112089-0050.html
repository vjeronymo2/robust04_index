			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> POT-BELLIED SMOKERS  </P> <P> Smokers appear to be prone to pot bellies. A new study shows that while men and  women who smoke tend to weigh less than nonsmokers, they are more likely to  carry their weight in unsightly places -- around their abdomens.  </P> <P> "Many people, especially women, smoke, in part, to stay thin. This suggests  that smokers may be thin, yes, but gorgeous? Maybe not," said Dr. Elizabeth  Barrett-Connor of the UC San Diego School of Medicine, who led the study.  </P> <P> "It's just one more piece of information about the notion that smoking is bad  for you," Barrett-Connor said. "Most people don't want pot bellies."  </P> <P> Previous studies showed smokers tend to be thinner than nonsmokers and that  smokers tend to gain weight when they quit. Surveys show that many smokers  avoid quitting for fear of gaining weight.  </P> <P> The study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found smokers are more  likely than nonsmokers to accumulate fat as "abdominal paunchiness" and the  tendency appeared to increase with the number of cigarettes smoked for both  sexes, Barrett-Conner said.  </P> <P> Although researchers are not sure why smoking would influence body fat  distribution, studies suggest smoking may affect hormones that can influence  body shape, she said.  </P></p>

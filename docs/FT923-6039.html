			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Congressional panel accepts Collor corruption report BRAZIL'S first presidential impeachment process seems set to go ahead, after the approval yesterday by a special congressional commission of a report accusing President Fernando Collor of large-scale corruption. Amid loud cheers, 16 of the 21-member commission voted to accept the report, including four who had been expected to support Mr Collor. Mr Marcelo Barbieri of the Democratic Movement (PMDB), the main opposition party, said: 'To vote against the report is to vote against morality'. Mr Marcelo Levenere, the head of the Brazilian Lawyers' Association, announced after the vote that he and the head of the national journalists' association would file next Wednesday a formal request for Mr Collor's impeachment. As street protests increase, those parties supporting the government are wavering, fearing their candidates might suffer in municipal elections in October. One minister told the Financial Times that Mr Collor no longer had the 168 votes needed in Congress to stave off an impeachment initiative. The two main pro-government parties are split internally. Mr Paulo Maluf, head of the Social Democratic party (PDS), estimated that 30 of his 44 members would vote for impeachment. Members of the Liberal Front party (PFL) from Minas Gerais state said they were withdrawing their support for Mr Collor. The minister said the president would not quit and seemed to be 'living in the clouds'. He added, however, that the country was being governed by the cabinet under Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, economy minister. 'We are staying on, not out of support for Collor but to make sure that at least the administration continues to function,' he said. On Tuesday night, political parties used their television time for the election campaign almost exclusively to attack the president. A two-thirds vote in Congress is required for the process to begin, at which point Mr Collor would be suspended from office.</p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL EDUCATION GETS YEAR EXTENSION ON LOANS;  </P> <P> RECOVERY: BELEAGUERED IRVINE FIRM BUYS TIME IN REPAYING $62 MILLION. IT SEEKS  TO BATTLE BACK FROM LOSSES TOTALING $8 MILLION IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS.  </P> <P> National Education Corp. said Thursday it has obtained a one-year extension on  some $62 million in loans, giving the beleaguered company added time to try to  recover from a series of costly blunders.  </P> <P> Five different banks agreed to the extension, provided NEC put up stock in some  of its subsidiaries as collateral.  </P> <P> The new loans, which will mature Dec. 31, 1990, will bear interest at 1.75%  above the prime rate.  </P> <P> The agreement also requires NEC to raise a minimum of $10 million in additional  capital by April 30.  </P> <P> The company said it will actually try to raise an additional $15 million to pay  back part of the loans, as well as establish something akin to an emergency  fund.  </P> <P> NEC, the nation's largest provider of vocational and educational training  services, said it would raise the money through a private debt or stock  offering, or by having its subsidiaries take out loans.  </P> <P> The company's stock -- which has plunged more than 50% in the last six months  -- closed down 25 cents to $6.25, very near its 52-week low of $5.75.  </P> <P> The company has lost $8 million dollars in the last six months largely because  of problems at its Applied Learning division, which sells educational materials  and services to corporations.  </P> <P> Early this month, Chairman David C. Jones and President Jerome Cwiertnia told  stockholders they intend to reduce costs at Applied Learning by at least $20  million over the next year.  </P> <P> About 140 employees at Applied Learning have been laid off, along with 18  middle managers and support personnel at corporate headquarters in Irvine.  </P> <P> NEC now says it has problems at Applied Learning under control.  </P> <P> Customers of the Naperville, Ill.-based subsidiary were being overbilled,  undercharged or given services completely free, company officials said.  </P> <P> Those snags developed after three separate companies were merged to create  Applied Learning.  </P> <P> Former chairman and chief executive H. David Bright was ousted from NEC in  July, partly because of the snafus at Applied Learning.  </P> <P> But there are other problems, including declining enrollments at the company's  vocational schools, where a 10% drop in attendance has been partially offset by  a hike in tuition.  </P> <P> Three months after Bright's departure, a New York investor filed a class-action  lawsuit against NEC and its top executives charging they misled investors  during the summer as to the company's financial condition.  </P> <P> The suit alleges that NEC tried to hide the problems at Applied Learning and  made falsely optimistic statements about the company's condition in order to  inflate its stock price.  </P> <P> It is the second time this year NEC has been hit with such a lawsuit.  </P> <P> The company has said it will vigorously defend itself against the investor's  allegations.  </P></p>

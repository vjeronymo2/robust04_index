			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HISTORY IS PEOPLE, NOT BRICKS;  </P> <P> OLVERA STREET: MEXICANS WERE HERE LONG BEFORE THE GRINGO. A MULTI-ETHNIC MUSEUM  WOULD TRAMPLE THAT HERITAGE.  </P> <P> News that a small group of preservationists seeks to transform Olvera Street  from a Mexican marketplace into a multi-ethnic museum should outrage Latinos.  After all, the plaza area has been inhabited by Mexicans since 1781, when a  dozen or so peasants, mostly from the Mexican states of Sinaloa and Sonora,  founded the Pueblo of Los Angeles. Spending time on Olvera Street is thus a  trip through tradition.  </P> <P> From 1900-1930, bulldozers virtually cleared the civic center of all else that  was Mexican, mostly family homes. Then, Christine Sterling and members of the  city's social and economic elite moved, in the late '20s, to save and preserve  Olvera as a symbol of Los Angeles' Mexican heritage. The street was little more  than an alley. Like the Avila adobe, which had been condemned, its days were  numbered.  </P> <P> At first, Olvera was part of California's "Fantasy Heritage" -- a tourist trap.  But over the years, its people reintegrated it with the plaza and Our Lady  Queen of the Angels, the city's oldest church. Mexicans and other Latinos began  returning to Los Angeles' Bethlehem. Today, Olvera Street is where many of us  go to celebrate our holidays or to enjoy the oldest remnant of the Mexican  heritage in the center of the city.  </P> <P> Certainly, a tradition worth preserving. Right?  </P> <P> Jeane Poole, curator of El Pueblo Historic Park, has embraced Olvera Street's  dilapidated buildings -- mostly stucco and red brick -- rather than its  traditions and people. It's no secret that she believes the Mexican presence on  Olvera Street so overwhelming that the contributions of the Chinese, the  Italians and other neighborhood ethnic groups to the city's development have  been eclipsed. To dilute the Mexican presence, she has advocated that  restoration of Olvera Street spotlight the architecture of its buildings.  Toward this end, she has enlisted the support of architectural historians.  </P> <P> For 12 years, Poole and her gaggle of Anglo historians have been plotting to  impose their Mexican-less vision of Olvera Street. Their opportunity for  success came when administration of El Pueblo Park passed from state to the  city Recreation and Parks Commission. Eager to renovate, the commissioners put  together a proposal. Since they and the Recreation and Parks Dept. lack the  expertise to make historical recommendations, Peter Snell, an architectural  historian, was paid to make some. Snell is a close friend of Poole and has  acted as a consultant for El Pueblo Park.  </P> <P> The commission's proposal calls for Olvera Street to be renovated and its  history interpreted in conformity with the architecture of the "Prime Historic  Period" of 1920-1932. Why 1920-1932? Why not 1880-1910? For one thing, the  latter would involve tearing down what constitutes today's Chinatown to make  way for reconstruction of Sonora Town.  </P> <P> In any case, historians will tell you that "Prime Historic Periods" are  convenient covers for diluting the influence of unwanted groups. In the case of  Olvera Street: No Mexicans Wanted.  </P> <P> What the commissioners and the building-oriented historians are forgetting is  that, like it or not, if it had not been for the Mexican marketplace, there  would be no preservation debate, since there would be no buildings to preserve.  Before Mexican merchants moved in, many of Poole's "Prime Historic" buildings  were slated for demolition -- the preferred people-remover technique in the  '30s. But when the alley became a thriving marketplace, those dilapidated  stucco and red-brick buildings that Poole now waxes poetic over were saved.  </P> <P> History is made by people, not by buildings. The Latino hegemony in the plaza  area is a reminder that Mexicans, here long before the Gringo, are not aliens.  Put a plaque on those buildings to indicate that they are proud examples of the  Poole's "Prime Historic Period." As for Olvera Street, the plaza area and its  people, they are too alive to be turned into a musty museum built by Poole and  Associates.  </P></p>

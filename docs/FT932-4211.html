			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Student fees MR TIM Boswell, the higher education minister, has distanced the government from the decision by the London School of Economics to charge students an extra tuition fee of up to Pounds 1,000. The move had not been initiated by him or the education department, he said, and there were no plans to encourage other universities to follow suit. The minister doth protest too much, for it is only a few weeks since the government cut the tuition fees it pays for classroom-based courses from Pounds 1,850 to Pounds 1,300. Other universities may soon follow the LSE's lead to recoup the cut in income. If they do, it will be only the first step in an irresistible move to compel students to pay a greater share of the bill for higher education. The government target is for one in three school-leavers to enter university by the year 2000, two-thirds more than in 1990. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals recently said that investment of well over Pounds 3bn would be needed to achieve this. The extra student grants and fees could add up to another Pounds 1bn. Such sums are unlikely to be available from a Treasury already struggling to contain public sector borrowing. There may be scope to save money by ending subsidies for students who wish to study away from home. Since there are now more than 80 universities, most could find a suitable course close to home. Universities might be able to raise more from appeals, sponsorship and other sources. They could make more productive use of their facilities by adopting a semester system. And they could be given greater freedom to borrow against their assets, as recommended by the Pearce report. But there will remain a funding gap which it is unreasonable to expect the taxpayer to bridge. The students who benefit from higher education should make a contribution to the fees, with appropriate help for those from low-income households. Such a system would allow the government to give additional support to national priority subjects such as science and technology through higher subsidies. It would also encourage students to make more rational decisions about their courses, since they would bear more of the costs as well as reaping the benefits. Moving towards a greater element of funding from students would require an overhaul of the student loan system, however. Students would need to be able to borrow larger sums over longer periods in this new world of higher education. Lending against human capital is a risky business for banks and institutions, since it can be hard to collect debts and trace debtors. The government could help by collecting repayments through a graduate surcharge on national insurance contributions. Rather than disowning the LSE's initiative, ministers should be looking at ways of extending it if the promised expansion in higher education is not to founder through lack of funds.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> MEYER, PERKINS HEADED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT?  </P> <P> This is the second time around for Ray Perkins and Ron Meyer. Perkins left the  New York Giants for Alabama in 1983. The New England Patriots fired Meyer in  1984.  </P> <P> Both wanted to return to the NFL in the worst way. So they took two of the  worst jobs. Perkins went with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers; Meyer joined the  Indianapolis Colts. With their personal blessings, Perkins and Meyer have let  their owners set up their potential firings this season. The Bucs and the Colts  once again are disasters waiting to happen.  </P> <P> The time bomb in Indianapolis exploded this month. General manager Jimmy Irsay  activated that bomb in April when he traded two Pro Bowl-caliber players --  tackle Chris Hinton and wide receiver Andre Rison -- to the Atlanta Falcons to  put him in position to draft quarterback Jeff George. George received $2  million a season. Disaster followed.  </P> <P> Quarterback Chris Chandler expressed his displeasure. Halfback Eric Dickerson  turned into a verbal terrorist. Center Ray Donaldson, the only remaining  high-quality blocker on the offensive line, told management he had too many  personal duties to handle to meet the Thursday reporting date. If he could,  Donaldson would try to make camp Sunday.  </P> <P> Suddenly, Irsay and Meyer found themselves with an offense that has a raw  quarterback, George, and an aging but versatile running back, Albert Bentley.  </P> <P> To make matters worse, Irsay totally mismanaged the Chandler affair and might  be forced by the courts to let him escape as a free agent. The Colts refused to  pay Chandler his $50,000 workout bonuses. Chandler attended the workouts, but  the Colts contend that he was there in body, not spirit. Chandler sued, but his  intent is to break his contract with the Colts.  </P> <P> In the free market, Chandler could be a hot commodity. The Bucs reportedly were  willing to give a second-round choice to the Colts to acquire Chandler as a  backup. If he played, the Bucs would surrender a No. 1 choice next year.  </P> <P> Chandler's agent, Mike Sullivan, said that former Oakland A's pitcher Catfish  Hunter became a free agent when owner Charlie Finley fudged on a postseason  workout payment.  </P> <P> "This was a willful breach of contract," Sullivan said.  </P> <P> Way to go, Jimmy. The young Colts general manager already has taken heat for  trading away the franchise's future to acquire Dickerson, linebacker Fredd  Young and George.  </P> <P> For those three players, Irsay sacrificed four first-round and two second-round  choices, linebacker Cornelius Bennett, Hinton and Rison.  </P> <P> Young hasn't been their best linebacker, Dickerson wants out and no one knows  whether George will be an instant star.  </P> <P> "If Jimmy Irsay's father wasn't the owner of that team, no way would he be  running it," Dickerson said. "He deserves to be a general manager about as much  as Daffy Duck does. It's a terrible football team. They couldn't beat some of  the worst Canadian League teams. That's how bad it is.  </P> <P> "Two years ago, I thought we had a team that could go to the playoffs every  year, but they've dismantled the team slowly but surely. With what they've got  left, there's probably not a chance they'll win five games. Without me, it  might be zero."  </P> <P> The Colts will have trouble winning more than five or six games this year.  Defensive end Jon Hand and linebacker Jef Herrod are expected to have long  holdouts.  </P> <P> Worst of all, if the Colts have the worst record in the NFL, the Falcons get  the first choice in the draft.  </P> <P> Look for Meyer to get fired.  </P> <P> Down in Tampa, usually cheap owner Hugh Culverhouse started spreading some  money to players this off-season. He traded for halfback Gary Anderson. He took  chances on top, expensive athletes in the draft who could produce big dividends  -- namely linebacker Keith McCants and halfback Reggie Cobb.  </P> <P> Maybe this is the Bucs' year?  </P> <P> "I'm about as excited as I've ever been about any team in Tampa," Culverhouse  said. "I predict we will go 11-5 or could go 12-4 with a few breaks. I can't  sit here and tell you we'll be as good as any team in the league, but I think  we will. I know we will be in the top six, seven or eight teams in the league."  </P> <P> But they aren't. So Perkins, who has never won more than five games in a season  with the Bucs, should be joining the unemployment lines. Meyer and Perkins  wanted to get back to the NFL in the worst way and they did.  </P> <P> The Green Bay Packers are puzzled by the Don Majkowski negotiations. They have  offered him a two-year, $2.4 million contract, but his agent, Randy Vataha,  won't come down at all in his demand for $2.8 million a season.  </P> <P> Majkowski, who became a one-year sensation last season, wants a $3 million  signing bonus included in the contract.  </P> <P> "He started out asking for the universe," Packers general manager Tom Braatz  said. "Now, he's at Mars. I hope he comes back to Earth."  </P> <P> The Denver Broncos have serious contract troubles with defensive end Ron  Holmes. The former University of Washington defender wants $1 million a season.  Speaking of Huskies lineman, tackle Dennis Brown, all 310 pounds of him, had a  weight clause included in the contract he signed with the San Fransisco 49ers  Friday.  </P> <P> Broncos receiver Ricky Nattiel is still troubled by the cracked right kneecap  that kept him ineffective last season.  </P> <P> The San Diego Chargers camp is off to a bad start. Guard Leo Goeas, a  third-round choice, suffered a foot injury that might keep him out for the  season.  </P> <P> Wide receiver Ron Walker, who caught 24 passes as a rookie, blew out a knee and  will miss the season. First-round choice Junior Seau won't come down from his  $1.5-million-a-year contract demand and is buckled in for a long holdout.  </P> <P> If Steve Beuerlein's holdout persists, the Raiders might sign Doug Williams for  help. That might not be too critical, though. Jay Schroeder is having a great  camp.  </P> <P> Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Albert Lewis is trying everything possible to  force a trade. Last week, he criticized president Carl Peterson for having an  Eastern, arrogant attitude.  </P> <P> Jeff George has been throwing well in the Colts camp. Some compare his throwing  style to former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw.  </P> <P> Like Bradshaw, George puts his right index finger at the back point of the  football.  </P> <P> The trade value of Houston Oilers halfback Mike Rozier has dropped so much that  the Eagles rejected a straight-up trade for quarterback Don McPherson.  </P> <P> Eagles coach Buddy Ryan never minces words. He told Philadelphia writers that  he wanted to steal a first-round choice from the Seahawks in a trade for  holdout middle linebacker Byron Evans.  </P> <P> Ryan said that Seahawks coach Chuck Knox was fighting for his job and needed a  solid middle linebacker for his new 4-3 defense. What he didn't tell the  writers was that the Seahawks weren't interested.  </P> <P> Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula is willing to take chances. In May, he signed  cornerback Reggie Sutton, who has had a history of drug problems. Sutton had to  be released when he failed to show up for a drug test. Last week, he added  halfback Tony Collins, another player with a drug history. Collins has been  impressive in camp.  </P> <P> The Cincinnati Bengals are expected to stay in Seattle for a week after they  play the Seahawks Oct. 1 because they visit the Los Angeles Rams the next week.  </P> <P> The Broncos washed their hands of halfback Lorenzo Hampton by trading him to  the Dallas Cowboys for a conditional sixth-round pick.  </P> <P> Hampton, a Plan B acquisition, practiced 11 days and collected $155,000 in  signing and reporting bonuses. The Broncos aren't impressed with another  expensive Plan B acquistion, tight end Chris Verhulst.  </P> <P> Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Derrick Thomas loves Bart Simpson. Each day in  practice, he's worn a different Simpson T-shirt. Among the early selections:  "Bart is my hero"; "Bart isn't an underachiever"; "Bart can achieve anything he  sets his mind to, good or bad"; and "Bart's a radical dude."  </P> <P> Philadelphia Eagles backup quarterback Jim McMahon is causing a stir. Each day,  the controversial quarterback has worn a different jersey. The Eagles refused  to give him his customary No. 9 because that belongs to holdout quarterback Don  McPherson. The first day, McMahon wore a question mark on the back of his  jersey. The second day he wore the No. 12 of starter Randall Cunningham. He  followed that with Jerome Brown's No. 99. On the fourth day, he wore a black  jersey with no number at all.  </P> <P> Washington Redskins quarterback Mark Rypien golfed this summer with Phoenix  Cardinals return specialist Vai Sikahema. During their round, the conversation  turned to Timm Rosenbach, another product of the Washington State quarterback  fraternity. "We started talking about Timm, and Mark said, 'If Timm ever gets  his head out of the bar and into the playbook, he'll be a good quarterback,' "  Sikahema told Phoenix reporters this week. When asked by reporters about  Rypien's comments, Rosenbach replied bitterly, "I'm a 23-year-old single male.  I have a life. I'm tired of it. I'm sick of the crap, everyone saying I can't  do this and I can't do that. That's a bunch of b.s. I know I can play in this  league. I know I can win. I'll show everybody." Rosenbach had nine completions  in his rookie season.  </P></p>

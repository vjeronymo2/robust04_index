			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oksana Boyko: "A Jacket of Aid for Ukraine Made </F> in the West. A Strait-Jacket?"]    [Text] The ambassadors of Belgium, Canada, Denmark,  Finland, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,  Spain, Great Britain, and the United States met on 14 February  with President Leonid Kravchuk to hand him a joint declaration  by their governments that cordially welcomed decisions made by  the Ukrainian Supreme Council regarding the tripartite  Declaration signed in Moscow by the Ukrainian, American, and  Russian presidents and the START I Treaty. The above states  expressed their intention to closely cooperate with Ukraine and  to assist in the dismantling of nuclear weapons, the conversion  program, environmental protection, retraining and alternative  employment for those engaged in manufacturing and servicing the  nuclear weapons, etc. Bilateral economic cooperation was also  promised.    However, no specific figures for the aid were given. As the  diplomats explained at the press conference, specific projects  are now in the works, though some governments have already  devised their programs. The Japanese ambassador mentioned $100  million that his country intends to give to Ukraine, Russia,  Belarus, and Kazakhstan for disarmament, while the German charge  d'affaires said his government earmarked 10 million Deutschmarks  for Ukraine, which were not paid because of conditions for START  I put forward by the Ukrainian legislature. We will soon learn  how much Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko will "bring" back from  Bonn, where he went on an official visit.    So, we will have a jacket of aid made by the whole world. A  thin jacket. The same applies to the security guarantees --  nothing specific was proposed here except for the bright  prospects opened by the "Partnership for Peace" program,  contacts with NATO and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council,  etc. In general, however, all those solemn declarations are  simply designed to give President Kravchuk moral support in his  relations with the parliament, because Ukraine is expected to  join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state.    But another press conference was held that same day, where  they talked about projects for Ukraine estimated at hundreds of  millions of dollars, and at their initial stage at that. The  multinational ABB, whose president Percy Barnevick visited  Ukraine on the invitation of Leonid Kravchuk, is one of the  leading corporations in power engineering. It offered us  projects directed at Ukraine's energy independence. They  involve energy-saving technologies in chemical and petrochemical  industries as well as modernization of our coal and atomic power  stations, which for Percy Barnevick are the future of Ukrainian  power engineering. They also provide for setting up a special  international investment fund for atomic engineering and  Ukrainian power engineering in general. ABB is planning soon to  start up five or six joint ventures in Ukraine to implement its  projects.</p>

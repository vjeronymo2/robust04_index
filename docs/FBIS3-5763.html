			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 10 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has  introduced a minimum wage system for foreign-invested  enterprises to prepare for possible foreign investment in the  future.    The system, however, appears to offer little incentive for  foreign companies seeking to invest in North Korea on the  strength of its cheap labor, as the minimum wage set for  foreign-invested firms is much higher than the country's general  wage level.    Late last year, North Korea's Administrative Council  established a labor regulation laying down standard labor  practices for foreign-invested firms, according to the Korea  Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA).    The regulation, consisting of 48 articles in eight chapters,  provides a minimum wage level and procedures for employing,  dismissing and punishing employees and for settling labor  disputes at foreign-invested firms.    In Article 26, the regulation stipulates that the minimum  monthly wage paid by foreign-invested firms shall not be less  than 220 won (about 100 U.S. dollars).    This minimum wage level for foreign-invested firms compares  with monthly pay of 30 to 50 dollars for ordinary North Korean  workers and the 73-dollar minimum monthly wage for workers in  the free trade zone.    KOTRA officials say the higher minimum wage for  foreign-invested firms will hinder the Stalinist country's  efforts to attract foreign investment.    The regulation also provides that joint-venture firms with  foreign equity investment shall give priority either to workers  of North Korean partner companies or to those recommended by the  relevant employment office when they hire workers -- another  stumbling block to active foreign investment -- according to the  officials.    Foreign firms operating in North Korea have previously set  working conditions for their employees through negotiations with  their North Korean partners or North Korean government  authorities.</p>

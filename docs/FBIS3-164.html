			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lagos, March 1 (AFP) -- The Nigerian government and  media have expressed suspicion at the arrival in Cameroon of  French troops and a high-ranking French diplomatic team to  discuss a bloody border dispute between the West African  neighbours.    "We are a bit suspicious of what really the French  intentions  are," a senior Nigerian official who asked not to be named told  AFP on Tuesday [1 March], a day after the French delegation held  talks with Cameroon's President Paul Biya in Yaounde. "Because  whatever the French interest in Nigeria may be, and of course,  there is a lot of interest here, the one in Cameroon and  certainly in the French-speaking West Africa for them is more  fundamental and critical," he said. "Certainly their  involvement could not be good news for Nigeria at all," he  added. I think we certainly have to play diplomacy. But at the  same time, we have to look at the security and military  implications of French intervention so as not to be caught  unawares."    France on Sunday despatched a contingent of 30 paratroops  and  two Puma helicopters to Cameroon, which disputes control of the  Bakassi peninsula on the border, believed to be rich in oil and  fish, with Nigeria. Each side blames the other for fighting  there last month. Cameroon alleges that Nigerian soldiers have  invaded the area and attacked Cameroonian gendarmes, but Lagos  charges that the Cameroonian paramilitary police have been  attacking and harassing ethnic Nigerian fishermen, forcing  several thousand to flee.    "French troops sent to repel Nigeria," the independent  VANGUARD newspaper reported Tuesday in a headline typical of the  general tone of the press, which expressed misgivings at the  move.    Cameroonian television said the French troops were  "essentially on an exploratory mission" and a French foreign  ministry spokeswoman promised an even-handed approach from the  team from Paris, led by General Christian Quesnot of the general  staff and Bruno Delaye, President Francois Mitterrand's African  affairs advisor.    Nigerian Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe planned  Wednesday  to hold a "very comprehensive" press briefing on the issue, a  foreign ministry spokesman told AFP here on Tuesday. Kingibe  warned Monday in the Nigerian capital Abuja that France "will  take full responsibility for internationalising" the conflict  and also shoulder the blame for the "attendant consequences" of  an escalation of the dispute.    The French foreign ministry spokeswoman said that the team  from Paris was expected to fly on from Yaounde to Abuja for  talks with Nigeria's military ruler, General Sani Abacha, after  its consultations with Biya, in a bid "to keep the peace" and  find ways "to resolve the dispute as soon as possible in  accordance with international law." But there was no indication  Tuesday as to when the French delegation might meet the Nigerian  leader.    In an editorial Tuesday, the DAILY TIMES said: "We stated in  the past that Nigeria is not an imperialist country and that we  seek the wellbeing of ourselves and fellow Africans. We still  stand by that declaration except that there comes a time when a  nation must stand up for its legitimate right. "That time is  here."    In another development, the European Union (EU) called  Tuesday for international arbitration into the dispute and  expressed "grave concern" at the "skirmishes" talking place in  the border region. "The EU urges the governments of Nigeria and  Cameroun to seek a solution to the dispute, through arbitration  or mediation of any regional or international organisation," a  statement issued by the Greek embassy here said. Greece  currently holds the presidency of the Union.    The Union also called for the immediate withdrawal of troops  concentrated on one side of the frontier line, the statement  added, without indicating which side.</p>

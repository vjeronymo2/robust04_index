			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATT PROJECT LINKED TO REPLACEMENT HOUSING;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE OFFICE PROJECT WILL BRING 80 SUBSIDIZED UNITS TO THE CENTRAL  CITY WEST PLANNING AREA, AS WELL AS 5,000 WORKERS AND A DAY-CARE FACILITY.  </P> <P> When the Watt City Center office/retail project is completed just across the  Harbor Freeway from downtown Los Angeles in about six years, it will be the  daytime home to about 5,000 workers.  </P> <P> Perhaps more important for the estimated 15,000 residents of the Central City  West planning area is thatthe controversial twin-tower project will bring 80  low-rent apartment units to the area at a cost of $6.5 million.  </P> <P> This will make it the first project in the area whose approval was linked to  replacement low-income housing.  </P> <P> Advocates for low- and moderate-income housing have viewed the $650-million  project as a model development for the 314-acre area west of downtown.  </P> <P> "Any developer who builds in Central City West will be strongly urged to do  replacement housing when his project is occupied," said the Rev. Philip Lance,  an Episcopal priest and organizer of the 250-member homeowners' group, United  Neighbors of Temple Beaudry &amp; City West.  </P> <P> The mostly Latino residents of the area have an average annual family income of  about $12,000, according to Michael Bodaken, a Legal Aid Foundation attorney  who represented the community group in negotiations that resulted in the  project's housing element.  </P> <P> "We look upon this commitment to build low-income housing as a model for future  projects in Central City West, to avoid the concentration on higher-cost  housing that has occurred in other downtown areas," Bodaken said.  </P> <P> Central City West is a mix of older low- and mid-rise commercial and  residential buildings, along with new high-rise office buildings such as the  33-story Arco Center at 1055 W. 7th St. Arco Center opened last spring and is  80% leased.  </P> <P> The boundaries of Central City West are the Hollywood and Harbor freeways,  Olympic Boulevard and Witmer and Union streets.  </P> <P> Watt City Center, a project of W&amp;M Partners Development Corp. -- composed  of Ray Watt and Kent Merselis -- will be built on the 6.48-acre site at 7th and  Bixel streets formerly occupied by the Thomas Cadillac and Vicky Thomas Pontiac  automobile dealerships. Construction start is scheduled in mid-February.  </P> <P> The two office buildings will be built over a six-year period, with the  29-story, 510,000-square-foot office tower at the southeast corner of 7th and  Bixel and a $1-million, 5,000-square-foot day-care center for 50 children on  the south side of 8th Street scheduled for completion in the fall of 1991.  </P> <P> A 62-story, 1.1-million-square-foot office tower at the southwestern corner of  7th and Bixel will follow.  </P> <P> The fees for 30% of the children in the day-care center will be subsidized by  the developer. The center will be open to the public and also serve workers in  the office towers.  </P> <P> Forty of the 80 housing units must be built in the 314-acre Central City West  specific plan area, to replace apartment buildings torn down by the Thomas  family in 1985, according to Ray Watt, chairman and chief executive officer of  Watt Industries.  </P> <P> The other 40 units can be constructed in the specific plan area or within a  3-mile radius of the project.  </P> <P> The housing must be completed by the time the 29-story office tower opens and  will be for very-low to low-income residents under guidelines established by  the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, Watt said.  </P> <P> Under HUD guidelines, the ceiling for very-low income is $23,000 a year for a  family of four, while low-income is a maximum of $34,000 annually for a family  of four, Bodaken said.  </P> <P> Rents are pegged at 25% to 30% of adjusted gross annual income, he said. This  means that a family of four earning $12,000 a year would pay $250 to $325 a  month rent for an apartment, he said.  </P> <P> "The housing will consist of two- or three-story apartment buildings," Watt  added. "We haven't decided if the housing will be built by Watt Industries or  by a joint venture."  </P> <P> Based in Santa Monica, Watt has been in the real estate business since 1947.  Through the years, Watt and his scores of joint-venture partners have built  more than 100,000 houses, resort communities, 8 million square feet of  industrial and office space, 50 shopping centers and three major hotels,  including the 750-room Stouffer Concourse Hotel at Los Angeles International  Airport.  </P> <P> Merselis, president of W&amp;M Partners Development Corp., was involved in the  construction of the Home Savings of America Tower at 7th and Figueroa streets  when he was with Ahmanson Commercial Development Co., and with the development  of Colorado Place in Santa Monica when he was with Becket Investment Corp.  </P> <P> Watt said he decided to develop his first downtown Los Angeles project when he  learned of the opportunity to acquire the Thomas site. Watt bought the land  from the Thomas interests in May, 1988, for $57 million.  </P> <P> "Downtown, east of the Harbor Freeway, is virtually all built up, so the  logical directions of growth are west and south," Watt said. "I see a time when  high-rise office buildings will line both sides of the Harbor Freeway  throughout the downtown area -- and Bixel Street will be a major corridor."  </P> <P> Under the approval agreement, W&amp;M will have to spend $3.5 million to widen  and realign Bixel Street, a hilly north-south street that leads into the  southbound on-ramp of the Harbor Freeway. Bixel will be widened from 46 to 86  feet, with a 100-foot-wide potential right of way -- and a jog at 7th Street  will be eliminated.  </P> <P> W&amp;M will also realign and widen the southbound Harbor Freeway on-ramp at  8th Street as well as widen 7th and 8th streets.  </P> <P> Designed by the Nadel Partnership, West Los Angeles, the two office towers will  be clad in a combination of white flamed (rough) and polished granite and  blue-gray glass.  </P> <P> Landscaped plazas designed by Todd Bennitt of Jardin International will cover  about 2 acres in front of the buildings along 7th and Bixel streets.  Landscaping will include shade trees, water features and sculpture gardens.  </P> <P> The buildings of Watt City Center will be linked by a combination of walks,  subterranean driveways and a pedestrian tunnel system.  </P> <P> Although Watt City Center was approved Dec. 15 by a 14-1 City Council vote --  with only Councilman Marvin Braude opposed -- the massive project has drawn  fire from those who claim that it will produce traffic jams on the adjacent  Harbor Freeway.  </P> <P> Before the approval vote, W&amp;M withdrew plans to build a 1,000-space garage  for vans and other high-occupancy vehicles to reduce the amount of new traffic.  </P> <P> As approved, the project will have about 3,200 above- and below-grade parking  spaces for the two towers, meeting the city code requirement of two parking  spaces for each 1,000 square feet of space, Merselis said.  </P></p>

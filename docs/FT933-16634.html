			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Governments may act on Channel tunnel date A SUGGESTION that the UK and French governments appoint an independent mediator to try to resolve the conflict between Eurotunnel and its contractors over the opening date of the Channel tunnel has been discussed by the two countries. The UK transport department confirmed that the suggestion had been raised by French officials, but said the UK government had no plans to appoint a mediator. Any such appointment would be a matter for the Bank of England to decide rather than government. Contractors are seeking substantial additional payments to cover the cost of building the tunnel which, including interest payments, has risen from Pounds 4.8bn in 1987 to approaching Pounds 10bn. The contractors' claims are already being considered by an independent disputes panel. The initiative proposed by the French would seek to get Eurotunnel and its contractors to agree an opening date rather than try to resolve the payments issue. Contractors have said that the project, which had been due to open in May this year, will not open until next summer unless agreement can be reached. Eurotunnel in Paris yesterday confirmed that it was in discussions with the French government over the appointment of a separate mediator to try to resolve the conflict over the opening date. The company said the idea of a mediator - or a Monsieur de Bons Offices - had come from the government. Eurotunnel said it supported the initiative.</p>

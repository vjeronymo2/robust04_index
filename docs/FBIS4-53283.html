			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] At the invitation of Comrade Lieutenant General  Chi Haotian, PRC national defense minister, and Comrade Marshal  O Chin-u, DPRK minister of the people's armed forces, a  high-level military delegation of the Lao People's Democratic  Republic [LPDR] headed by Comrade Lt. Gen. Choummali Sai-gnason,  paid visits to the two countries respectively beginning 5 May.    On 15 May, Comrade Lt. Gen. Choummali Sai-gnason and our  high-level military delegation returned to Vientiane. [passage  omitted]    During its 10-day official visits, the LPDR military  delegation visited many production establishments and military  garrisons.    During the visit to the PRC from 5 to 9 May, the comrade  LPDR  national defense minister and his entourage met with Comrade Lt.  Gen. Chi Haotian, PRC national defense minister, and his party.  They exchanged views and informed one another about certain  issues of mutual interest. The two sides also discussed the  further strengthening of solidarity, friendship, and relations  between the Armed Forces of the two countries in the interests  of the two peoples who have maintained traditional relations and  solidarity since ancient times. The LPDR military delegation  laid a wreath at the Mao Zedong mausoleum, visited the high  technology development area of Chengdu in Sichuan Province --  PRC's fourth-ranked high technology development region.  Everywhere the comrade LPDR national defense minister and the  party went, they were warmly and respectably welcomed by  officers and soldiers of the military installations concerned.  The visit to the PRC by the high-ranking LPDR military  delegation served to further strengthen the spirit of goodwill,  friendship, and solidarity between the Lao and Chinese Armed  Forces.    In the DPRK visit from 9 to 14 May, the high-level Lao  military delegation headed by Comrade Lt. Gen. Choummali  Sai-gnason met with the high-level DPRK military delegation  headed by Vice Marshal (Che Kuang), chief of staff and acting  minister of the people's armed forces of the DPRK. The two  sides informed each other on issues of mutual interest on the  basis of solidarity, friendship, and mutual understanding. The  Lao military delegation also visited the Museum of Three  Revolutionaries and the Museum of the National Liberation  Struggle, laid a wreath at the Monument of Unknown Soldiers, a  bouquet of flowers at the Monument of Victory, visited (Man  Yongbo) village -- the birthplace of Comrade President Kim  Il-song, great leader of the Korean people. They also attended  an acrobatics show performed by the DPRK Armed Forces, visited  the Pyongyang youth palace, toured the People's Great Library,  and visited the chuche monument symbolizing the chuche policy  outlined by President Kim Il-song, great leader of the Korean  people, which has been applied by the Korean people in the  building of the DPRK-style socialism. In addition, the  delegation also visited a number of military installations.  Everywhere Comrade Lt. Gen. Choummali Sai-gnason and the party  visited, they were warmly and honorably welcomed by the hosts.    The first visit to the DPRK by the high-level Lao military  delegation in the name of the Lao People's Army has enabled us  to understand the reality of the all-around growth and strength  of the DPRK built in accordance with the chuche policy outlined  by the Korean people's Great Leader Comrade President Kim  Il-song and Beloved Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. It also served  to further strengthen the relations of friendship and solidarity  between the Lao and Korean people's armed forces.</p>

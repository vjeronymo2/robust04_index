			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: JP Morgan wins tender for lottery JP Morgan, the US merchant bank, has won the competitive tender to provide finance for the UK Lottery Foundation, the lottery organisation set up by Mr Richard Branson and Lord Young, the former cabinet minister. The Foundation's bid for the national lottery licence will be underwritten by JP Morgan. The sums involved are likely to be in the Pounds 50m to Pounds 100m range. The UK Lottery Foundation plans to hand over all its profits to 'good causes' if it wins the licence. There are at least seven other bidders who argue that they will be able to raise more money for the five nominated causes - the arts, charities, the millenium fund, national heritage and sports. Final date for bids is February 14 with the winner likely to be announced by May.</p>

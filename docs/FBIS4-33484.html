			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Weekly Political Newsletter" by Dr. Mohammad Javad </F> Larijani, Tehran Majles deputy and member of the Supreme  National Security Council: "Occupied Palestine and the Middle  East Situation"]    [Text] 1. It is possible that the situation in occupied  Palestine may appear rather erratic: On the one hand, the  people in Gaza and Jericho celebrated the departure of the  Zionist soldiers and on the other hand one of the most intense  armed clashes took place between the Palestinian combatants and  the Israelis in al-Khalil [Hebron].    Is there a dichotomy among the Palestinians? Does this mean  that there is one group that is in favor of jihad against the  Zionist regime and another that is seeking a normal life--even  though vicarious--on the sidelines of this regime? We should  view the issue in a more comprehensive manner. What will the  changes in the Palestinian movement be, the political role of  the Middle East and even of the regions beyond it in light of  current political moves in the region in which the United  States, Israel and the West have used all their weight?    2. The motives behind the moves of the United States and  Israel with regard to the Palestinian movement and the intifadah  are quite clear. They obviously want them to be snuffed out as  soon as possible. Military pressure has not yielded any results  and efforts to sow political discord have also not been able to  drive a wedge in the ranks. The only hope that is left for them  is that the intifadah should be contained within narrow  geographical confines and should be pitted against 'Arafat's  forces. 'Arafat should be given serious support (military,  political, financial, and propagandistic) and what the Zionist  regime was unable to achieve, should be done by 'Arafat. What  should the Islamic movement do in such circumstances?    In my opinion, the current dual policy is the best one! In  Gaza and Jericho, the Islamic movement should not become  embroiled with pro-'Arafat forces who until yesterday were among  the ranks of the intifadah. They should be strongly inducted  into the management! Outside the confines of the autonomous  region, the intifadah should continue with all its strength.  There is no doubt that 'Arafat and Israel are apprehensive of  any kind of victory of the Islamic forces in all kinds of  elections and their effective participation in the management.  Some reports indicate that Israel prefers that 'Arafat  personally be in charge of administrative affairs for some time,  and that there be no elections.    In either case, the path will be opened for the victory of  the Muslims, that is, if there are elections and they win or if  there is a dictatorship and 'Arafat's supporters stand behind  him. 'Arafat will be forced to ask the Israelis for assistance  once again for his own perpetuation and the extent of the  intifadah will continue in its own sphere of action!    3. Worry with regard to the assessments that I have  mentioned above have motivated the United States and Israel to  pay attention to the role of the Islamic Republic of Iran as  regards the course of the intifadah and they are exceedingly  afraid of the spiritual and political effect of our stances.  The strong stance of the U.S. secretary of state during his  address to a gathering of Jews in New York is a clear indication  of this fear.    Thus, the fabrication of a new preoccupation with regard to  Iran has been placed on the agenda. Perhaps the most  appropriate pretext and in fact, one on which they would have  greater control would be some Arab countries in the Persian  Gulf. An important point that merits the attention of the  officials of Islamic Iran and the regional governments is: Our  friends in the littoral states of the southern Persian Gulf  should know that the United States does not have the ability to  bring about a change of regime in Baghdad! The United States  has extracted an exorbitant price for this promise so far.  Therefore, it is seeking to clear its ledger, in practice, by  its propaganda of a stronger threat, such as Iran. Right from  the outset, it was clear that the United States did not have the  ability to fulfill its promise, as Iraq is not a Panama or a  Grenada! Even if it were, it would not have been to the benefit  of the region that the door be opened to such intervention by  the United States. This means that the sole path that remains  for maintaining stability and peace in the Persian Gulf region  is collective cooperation among the regional countries and that  is all!    4. The Washington echelons have recently broken a world  record in tactlessness: Their policy from the PRC, Japan, all  the way to the Middle East and Iran is characterized by an  egocentricity and stupidity which is the best way to describe  their stances and behavior.    In such circumstances, our foreign policy should be based  entirely on the main axes of our national interests with extreme  poise and we should refrain from getting involved in  controversial and marginal issues, regardless of whether these  controversial issues pertain to any links with the IRA or are  provocations in the form of awarding literary prizes to Salman  Rushdie.    We have a momentous task ahead of us: To support the great  Islamic renaissance [preceding word in French] and to prove that  in today's world, we can transform our Islamic country into a  modern and advanced country. Every step that we take forward  toward the attainment of this objective is the biggest slap in  the face of the enemies of dear Iran, proud Islam, and the great  movement that our nation has brought about in the Islamic world.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In its session yesterday, the Council of Ministers  concluded discussing diplomatic appointments but did not  announce the names publicly. This is in line with international  norms, which stipulate informing the concerned countries first  of the ambassadors appointed to them. All ministers refused to  release any information on diplomatic appointments. They agreed  that the Council of Ministers decided in its session yesterday  to issue a decree that its decisions should be considered as  secret. They clarified that the Council decided to add a  paragraph to the fourth item of Decree Number 2552 issued on 1  August 1992 to make the text read:    While considering the clauses of Article 17 of the decree,  the Council of Ministers' agenda will be considered a secret  document. And the discussions and deliberations of the Council  of Ministers will also be considered secret. They cannot be  published or publicized.    The media referred to a turbulent start to the Council  session. Minister Fattush said he believed that the request to  make the discussions secret kills political life. When  President al-Hirawi put the issue of adopting secrecy to a vote,  the Council of Ministers approved it with a majority of 26.  Three ministers objected: Sulayman Franjiyah, Nicholas  Fattush, and Hasan 'Izz-al- Din.</p>

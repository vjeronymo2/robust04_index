			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / AT&amp;T unveils video phone AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph yesterday unveiled what it claims is the world's first mass-market video-telephone - a machine costing Dollars 1,499 (Pounds 824) that can be used in the home over existing phone lines and deliver full colour, moving images of a caller. Video communications are now virtually limited to the business market, employing systems which cost tens of thousands of dollars. Most rely on video-conferencing rooms and special digital telecommunications networks. Rival manufacturers in both the US and Japan have also been developing inexpensive models for the home market, but AT&amp;T is thought to be the first to bring a product to market and back it up with its immense marketing strength. The company is the leading US provider of long-distance telephone calls and a big global maker of telecommunications equipment. The AT&amp;T equipment, which requires no special installation, uses a standard sized telephone and a fold-up 3.3 inch liquid crystal display video screen and camera lens. Callers who want privacy can close a shutter over the lens. It will cost the same to use as a normal telephone call. The AT&amp;T telephone gives a slow motion picture of a caller which is out of synchronisation with the speaking voice - a big problem with delivering video services to the home using current technology. However, Mr Kenneth Bertaccini, president of AT&amp;T consumer products, said consumers involved in trials of the equipment found its variable picture motion, between two and 10 frames a second, adequate for their personal communications. The company will begin selling the equipment, called VideoPhone 2500, in the US in May and will also rent out the equipment for under Dollars 30 a day. It also intends to offer a service for public areas, such as airports and hotel lobbies, later this year. The company plans eventually to market the equipment internationally, and is discussing licensing agreements with a number of companies.</p>

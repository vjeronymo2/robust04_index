			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Premier Li Peng Delivers Important Speech in </F> Tashkent"]    [Text] Tashkent, 19 Apr (RENMIN RIBAO) -- At the Uzbek  Parliament today, Premier Li Peng delivered an important speech  to hundreds of parliament members, government officials, and  personalities from various circles. The following is the full  text of his speech:    In the past two years or so, President Karimov and leaders  of  other Central Asian nations have visited China. Now, at the  invitation of the leaders of Central Asian nations, and bringing  with me the friendship of the Chinese people, I have made the  first stop of my trip, in the beautiful and richly endowed land  of Uzbekistan, and embarked on a tour of China's good neighbors  of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan. Such  frequent exchanges of visits between the leaders of China and  the Central Asian nations is unprecedented, and is an important  signal that the relations between China and the Central Asian  nations have entered a new era.    The Republic of Uzbekistan is an important country in  Central  Asia. It has a long history, a splendid culture, rich  resources, and an industrious and ingenious people. Since it  became independent, Uzbekistan, under the leadership of  President Karimov, has been dedicated to maintaining stability  and developing the national economy at home, and expanding  friendly communication with its neighbors and other countries in  the world, which has yielded positive results. The Chinese  people heartily rejoice in this and sincerely hope the people of  Uzbekistan will make greater achievements in building their own  country.    China and Uzbekistan are friendly, close neighbors. The two  countries shared many similarities in the past, and continue to  do so today. In the past, the ancient Silk Road once closely  linked our two countries; today, we both concentrate on building  our own nations, both want an international environment that  enjoys long- term stability, and both are willing to develop  cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and  establish a long-term, stable, good-neighborly, and friendly  relationship. In the past two days, President Karimov and I  have exchanged views extensively and in depth on the  international situation, regional situation, and bilateral  relations. The meetings were pleasant, friendly, and fruitful.  The government officials in charge of foreign trade and  economic relations, as well as entrepreneurs, of both countries  seriously discussed ways to further strengthen economic  cooperation, and signed a series of agreements. Both sides took  a positive attitude to cooperation and were optimistic about the  prospects. I believe this visit is bound to improve our mutual  understanding and strengthen our cooperation. This will  undoubtedly bring further development to existing  Sino-Uzbekistan relations.    The friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of  the Central Asian nations goes back to ancient times. The  Central Asian nations, as the main corridor on the Silk Road,  once made important contributions to establishing commercial  enterprise and cultural exchange on the Eurasian continent.  Today, the ever-expanding exchange between the Central Asian  nations and the rest of the world is writing a new chapter of  common development and friendly exchange between Europe and  Asia. China sets great store by its relations with Central  Asian nations. We are willing to work with Central Asian  nations, have our eyes on the future and the next century, and  do our part to help build a new Silk Road. China's basic  policy for developing its relations with Central Asian nations  can be summarized into the following four brief points:    First, maintaining good-neighborly and friendly  relations and peaceful coexistence. China and the Central  Asian nations are either neighboring countries sharing common  borders, or are close to each other. It is the common wish of  the Chinese people and the Central Asian peoples to be friendly  neighbors, for this is entirely in line with our fundamental  interests. Now, as the Chinese people are concentrating on  building their own country, they need a peaceful international  environment of long-term stability, especially a good  surrounding environment. We have always cherished good will and  friendly sentiment toward the Central Asian peoples, and will  forever remain your good friends and neighbors. China never  seeks self-interest or sphere of influence in the world,  including this region. Even when China becomes more developed  economically and more powerful and prosperous in the future, it  will never seek hegemony or power politics. China will always  maintain equal and friendly relations with its neighbors. You  can fully trust that no matter what happens in the world, China  will not change this policy. We mean what we say.    Second, conducting mutually beneficial cooperation  and promoting common prosperity. Developing economic  cooperation and trade occupies an important position in our  relations. We have made a good start in this regard, but there  is still a lot that we should, and can, do. In developing  economic cooperation with Central Asian nations, China will  strictly abide by the principle of equality and mutual benefit,  and attach no political conditions to it. We would like to work  with all the Central Asian countries to constantly improve the  environment for cooperation, expand the scope of cooperation,  and upgrade the level of cooperation; and with mutual benefit,  march along the path of common development.    Third, respecting the choice of the Central Asian  peoples and refraining from interfering in other nations'  internal affairs. As the world is diversified, the  national conditions of the Central Asian nations differ from one  other. There has never been, and can never be, a uniform mode  of development that suits the realities of all countries. We  believe that the Central Asian nations, like China and other  countries in the world, are entitled to independently choose the  social system, values, and path of development compatible with  their national conditions. It is our conviction that the  Central Asian nations have all the capabilities and wisdom  necessary to handle their own affairs well.    Fourth, respecting independence and sovereignty and  contributing to regional stability. China sincerely hopes  that Central Asia will be able to maintain long-term peace and  stability. We appreciate and support all the efforts made by  Central Asian countries to safeguard their national independence  and sovereignty, promote regional peace and stability, and  enhance friendship and cooperation among nations. The  development of our relations with any Central Asian nation is  not directed against any third country. We are willing to see  the Central Asian countries living in harmony with each other.  Also, China is ready to develop friendly relations with all  countries in the world, including Russia and other CIS  countries. The development of Central Asian nations needs world  peace and stability, while the world needs a stable and  prosperous Central Asia.    Dear friends! Today's world is developing toward  multipolarization. The Chinese Government sees a positive  significance in this trend. Safeguarding peace, strengthening  cooperation, and promoting development is a common wish  cherished by all peoples. But we should also be able to see  that some problems left behind by the Cold War are not  thoroughly resolved, while many new conflicts and contradictions  have kept emerging. The world is far from being a peaceful  place. The pauperization of many developing countries is  aggravating. While the issue of world peace has yet to be  solved, the problem of development is more outstanding. On the  whole, today's world is still locked in complicated and profound  changes. Therefore, the establishment of a new international  political and economic order has become an urgent wish of  various peoples around the world. The new international  political and economic order we advocate is different in essence  from the old order characterized by hegemony and power politics.  We believe such a new order may contain many aspects, but the  most central aspects are as follows:    In handling international relations, the principles of  mutual  respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual  nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs,  equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence should be  strictly followed.    The right of the people of each nation to choose the social  system and mode of development in light of their national  conditions should be respected.    All nations, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are  entitled to participate in international affairs, which should  not be determined by one or several big countries.    Disputes among nations should be settled in a fair and  reasonable way through peaceful negotiations, in the spirit of  equal consultation, mutual understanding, and mutual  accommodation. When conditions are not ripe, disputes can be  shelved temporarily, in an effort to seek common ground while  reserving differences. Differences over some issues should not  hamper the development of normal nation-to-nation relations.    Trade and economic cooperation should be conducted in line  with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and exchange of  equal value. Developed nations face an unshirkable  responsibility for gradually reducing the gap between the North  and the South.    The establishment of a new political and economic order of  the world is a long-term, arduous task. We are ready to work  unremittingly toward that, along with all Central Asian nations  and the rest of the world.    Dear friends! Here, I would also like to give you a brief  account of China's domestic situation. Since the end of the  1970's, under the guidance of the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics established by Deng Xiaoping, the  chief architect of China's reform and opening up, China has made  marked achievements in reform, opening up, and modernization.  From 1979 to 1993, the average annual growth rate of China's  economy was over 9 percent. As the living standards of urban and  rural people significantly improved, our cause has won extensive  and wholehearted support from the people. China is now enjoying  economic growth, political stability, nationality solidarity,  and social progress. Under the leadership of the CPC Central  Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, the whole  nation, full of confidence, is marching further ahead along the  path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.    The objective of China's economic structural reform is to  establish the system of a socialist market economy. This system  of a socialist market economy which we are going to establish  will enable the market to play the role of a foundation for the  disposition of resources under state macroregulation and  control, and enable economic activities to follow the  requirements of the law of value and accommodate any changes in  the supply-demand pattern. To gradually realize the transition  from the planned economy to the market economy, we make a point  of giving play to the roles of both market and planning as two  different means to our end. In other words, we will bring into  full play the role of market mechanism on the one hand and, in  the meantime, actively change the functions of the government in  managing the economy and improve and strengthen the state  macroregulation and control over the economy. The chief method  is to use economic policies, economic legislation, planning  orientation, and necessary administrative control to guide the  national economy to develop in a healthy direction. The system  of a socialist market economy is also integrated with the basic  system of socialism. In terms of the structure of ownership, we  adhere to the principle of letting public ownership dominate and  allowing the common development of diversified economic sectors;  and in terms of a distribution system, we rely primarily on the  system of distribution according to work, encouraging some  people in some areas to get rich first and seeking to reach the  goal of common prosperity through a gradual process. Practice  has proved that developing socialist market economy was a  correct choice, compatible with China's realities.    The economic structural reform and the political structural  reform in China are conducted simultaneously and in conjunction  with each other. In the course of the gradual establishment of  the system of a socialist market economy, we set great store by  the need to strengthen the building of a socialist democracy and  legal system and strengthening the building of spiritual  civilization. While we attach importance to absorbing and  drawing upon other countries' advanced science and technology,  experience in management, and excellent cultural achievements,  we also pay close attention to rejecting decadent things. An  important sign of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is to attach importance to the building of  spiritual civilization while attaching importance to the  building of material civilization. In the course of building  spiritual civilization, we pay special attention to inheriting  our fine national traditions and culture.    In the process of reform in China, we pay special attention  to handling the relationship among reform, development, and  stability. Economic construction is the focal point of all our  work; reform and opening up are the motive powers of  development; and maintaining social stability is an  indispensable condition for developing the economy and  conducting reform smoothly. We regard the establishment of the  socialist market economy as a long process of development. If  counted from 1979, China's reform has been going on for over 15  years. According to our present plan, we will preliminarily set  up a new economic system in the 1990's and, on the basis of this  and making a further effort for about 20 years, move on to  forming a more mature and established system in various fields.  At present, we are moving toward this goal step by step on the  basis of continuously summing up our experience gained through  practice. We are full of confidence in China's future.    The essential aim of China developing its economy is to  upgrade the whole people's living standards in terms of material  and culture. China is still a developing country and its  people's livelihood is still below the level of affluence. It  will take decades of arduous work for China to catch up with the  living standards of medium-developed countries in the world.  China's construction requires not only a domestic environment  of long-term stability, but also a peaceful international  environment of long- term stability, in particular, a good  surrounding environment. Today, mankind is moving toward a new  century. For the bright future of China and the world at large,  China will make every effort to manage its own affairs well;  unswervingly pursue an independent foreign policy of peace;  develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries,  especially neighboring nations, on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence; and strive to make due  contributions to peace, stability, and development in Asia and  the world.    Thank you.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China is urging its  hundreds of millions of farmers to put fertilizer underground --  to reduce pollution and farm expenditure and improve yields.    By so doing, China could save at least 9.5 million tons of  carbamide each year, and reduce environmental pollution caused  by inefficient use of chemical fertilizers.    China imported about 18 million tons of chemical fertilizers  in 1993.    Song Shuyou, an official of the Ministry of Agriculture,  told  a national agricultural meeting today that the new method of  applying fertilizers can enable farmers to cut their expenditure  for fertilizers and raise yields and income by about 600 yuan  per hectare.    The official told agricultural officials from nine provinces  and municipalities that the traditional way of applying chemical  fertilizers is wasteful and causes large-scale pollution.    Traditionally, fertilizers were unevenly spread manually  over  the surface of the soil. Only some 30 percent is actually  absorbed by plants, while most of the useful elements were lost  by evaporation after exposure to sunlight or washed away by  water or rain, thus polluting the air, rivers and lakes, said  Song.    "If the efficiency is raised by 10 percentage points to 40  percent, it would mean an equivalent of 9.5 million tons of  carbamide will be saved," said the official at the meeting in  Hebei Province's Guan County, about three hours' drive from  Beijing.    In some developed countries, sixty percent of the chemical  fertilizers were absorbed by plants, Song said.    According to the method listed on the ministry's nationwide  technique extension program, farmers are advised to put chemical  fertilizers six to 10 cm under the soil by hand or machine.    The official said the new method helps the plants to absorb  more nutrients from the fertilizers and reduce pollution.    According to the results of the experiments in the provinces  of Shandong, Henan, Liaoning and Heilongjiang by the Chinese  Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the new method increased the  per unit yield of cotton, wheat, corn and soybean by six percent  to 15.2 percent in comparison with the traditional one.    The ministry plans to introduce the new technique to 66  million ha [hectares] of cultivated land over a five-year  period, starting this year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with St Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak by </F> Caroline Mascher; place and date not given: "Deliberate  Exaggeration"]    [Text] [Mascher] Mr. Sobchak, is the amnesty for the  putschists endangering Russia's stability?    [Sobchak] These men brought themselves so much into  discredit, at the latest with the putsch, that they will no  longer play a serious role in politics. If they are really  innocent, as they are claiming, they could have had that  confirmed before court. Amnesty can only be granted to people  who are guilty.    [Mascher] It is said that Rutskoy might be built up as an  identification figure for the humiliated masses....    [Sobchak] You know, I know Rutskoy personally. He is an  extremely narrow-minded man with great ambition, but little  intelligence. He is not a statesman, but always remains on the  level of a division commander. All the time, he only executes  orders.    [Mascher] In his speech before the Duma, President Yeltsin  made great concessions to the opposition and forces hostile to  reforms....    [Sobchak] Yes, that is true. But there is also a new  opposition. The previous one openly called for Yeltsin's  removal. Therefore, he behaved differently toward it, but he was  still not tough enough. In his place, I would have dissolved  the parliament as early as April after the successful  referendum. However, Yeltsin is unfortunately unable to use the  results of his victories. This was also the case in August  1991. Today we have a completely different situation. The  opposition is no longer intransigent, people like Gaydar or  Yavlinskiy are also in the opposition. Therefore, Yeltsin is  behaving differently.    [Mascher] But the amnesty was a provocation....    [Sobchak] Yes, of course, the Duma challenged the president.  However, I believe that an aggressive confrontation between the  president and the parliament no longer makes any sense today  because the new constitution is already effective.    [Mascher] That is to say, one is not afraid of politicians  like Zhirinovskiy?    [Sobchak] His importance is above all exaggerated in the  West. He has hardly any influence in the Duma, whereas people  such as the communist Zyuganov, Lapshin from the Peasant Party,  or Gaydar are influential.    I think that the West is not reacting like this by chance.  It wants to justify its inactivity -- the lack of real help and  cooperation. So far, Russia has received the promised loans  neither from the United States nor from the European Union, only  the time allowed for the repayment of debts has been extended  and tied loans for buying grain from the Americans have been  granted. That is to say, Washington is supporting its own  farmers, but not Russia. Then we have to repay these funds at a  high interest.    The West is not only interested in Zhirinovsky because of  his  scandalous appearances. It is not openly said, but some  politicians take the view that the weaker Russia is, the better  it is for the West, as it would no longer be a threat. This is  an incorrect assessment that could dangerously disturb the  balance of forces.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Clinton and Europe"] </F>   [Text] President Bill Clinton has taken a year to come to  Europe, a continent which has been essential to U.S. interests  for the past five decades. Clinton, concerned primarily about  domestic problems and lacking the international vision which  characterized his predecessors, has thus encouraged in his first  12 months in the White House the isolationist interpretations of  those who believed that they were seeing their fears confirmed  in the U.S. withdrawal in the main conflicts following the Cold  War. And in this panorama, Europe has not only been no  exception but seems to have been the clinching proof of U.S.  diplomacy's new mood.    The Administration's first steps in relations with Europe  have not been easy. For instance, in the conflict in the former  Yugoslavia, the Americans have moved from the initial  interventionist declarations to passivity, but in this case the  Europeans, handicapped by their own inaction, are not exactly in  a position to cast the first stone. The strain in relations  became clear in the interminable negotiations on the  liberalization of international trade. GATT became a trial of  strength between the Americans and Europeans, who in this way  confirmed how trade is destined to become a weapon as essential  as arms on the new international scene.    An agreement has been reached on the liberalization of  trade,  but the European leaders now receiving Clinton still have  buzzing in their ears the repeated statements made by State  Department officials citing Asia -- more specifically, the  Pacific Basin, with Japan and China -- as the area of greatest  importance for the United States in the 21st century; that is,  rather as if the center of the world, which in the 20th century  has lain between the United States, as the leading superpower,  and Europe -- i.e. in the Atlantic community -- could shift to  the Pacific, between Asia and America. And if to this view of  the world we add European fears about a continental scene in  which balance has given way to instability and conflicts, it is  easy to understand the interest with which the European leaders  awaited Bill Clinton.    The first consequence of the President's visit has served to  reassure the allies. "I am here to declare and demonstrate that  Europe is central to U.S. interests," asserted Clinton, who  reckoned the U.S. commitment in terms of a military presence of  100,000 servicemen and supported the European integration  process. On defense, the Democratic President seems more  prepared than his predecessors for the Europeans to have a more  prominent role. And this, although it is also to be explained  in terms of the United States' interest in cutting its military  expenditure, represents an opportunity to reconsider relations  between the allies on both sides of the Atlantic, because they  are both confronted in the post-Cold War period with the  challenge of renewing their bonds without weakening their ties.    Asia is emerging as a mainstay of trade in U.S. foreign  policy for the future, but Europe has been this and should  remain so, for the benefit of both the United States and Europe,  with which it shares not only economic and security interests  but also the defense of values based on respect for freedom,  democracy, and human rights.</p>

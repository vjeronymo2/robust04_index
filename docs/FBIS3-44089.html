DP PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] election spokesman  Lester Fuchs said Mr Mandela's weak endorsement of free and fair  elections was not shared by certain prominent ANC and South  African national civics organisation members on the ANC  election list.    "Khabisi Mosunkuthu, Dan Mofokeng and Moses Mayekiso have  all  indicated the DP will not be allowed to canvass in the  townships," he said in a statement. He said that if Mr Mandela  was serious about a free and fair election he should remove from  the ANC's election list the names of all those not committed to  allowing other parties to campaign in townships.</p>

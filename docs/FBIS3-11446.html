Miguel Ortiz Jonguitud, president of the National Union of  Sugar Cane Farmers under the CNPR [expansion unknown], demanded  the implementation of agricultural programs to "prevent the  destruction of sugar cane fields and to avoid frustrating the  achievements reached so far in this six-year period."    At the 15th National Congress of the aforementioned sugar  cane union, Artolozaga Noriega also said the current capacity of  the sector is around 5 million tons, even though the sugar cane  industry has been a net exporter of surpluses.    We initiated a recapitalization process, and, after noticing  our prices were out of date, we realized we had neglected the  area of tariffs, Artolozaga Noriega said. He said efforts are  currently under way to control the marketing of sugar by means  of the Sugar Commodities Market or the Trusteeship to Organize  the Sugar Market (Forma) to continue efforts "to preserve the  sugar cane industry."    Despite all of this, Artolozaga Noriega pointed to the fact  that "several sugar mills have shut down," saying they have  closed "in the wake of the economic collapses specific to the  regions in which they were located." He also noted that four  sugar mills are about "to go bankrupt," but this does not mean  they have to be shut down, because he still hopes they can be  reactivated in the mid- or short-term.    He added that the sugar mills that have already been closed  are La Purisima in Jalisco, Juchitan in Oaxaca, and Libertad in  Veracruz. Those that are about to go bankrupt are Independiente  in Veracruz, Santa Rosalia in Chiapas, and Hermenegildo Galeana  y Pujil in Tabasco.    Meanwhile, Ortiz Jonguitud said that despite the lack of  infrastructure to work the nation's sugar cane fields, Mexico  ranks fifth in the world in sugar production.    "As a result of a lack of new investments in various types  of  support programs and Mexico's transition toward a market  economy, the situation in the sugar industry still has not been  been rectified, and this is why we have to try to resolve this  situation as soon as possible," Ortiz Jonguitud said.</p>

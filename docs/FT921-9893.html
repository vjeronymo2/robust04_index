			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Apple Computer explores strategic link with Sharp APPLE COMPUTER is in talks with Sharp, the Japanese electronics manufacture, in connection with its recently announced plans to enter the consumer electronics market with a range of 'personal digital assistant' products, including electronic organisers. Sharp is a leading supplier of hand-held electronic organisers, devices that store phone numbers, an appointments diary and personal notes. Apple will say only that Sharp is one of several consumer electronics companies with which the personal computer manufacturer is exploring potential relationships. According to reports in the US, however, the companies are on the verge of concluding a broad strategic alliance. The talks between Apple and Sharp coincide with Sharp's manufacturing agreement with Intel, the leading US semiconductor company, covering the manufacture of memory chips by Sharp for sale by both Intel and Sharp. Sharp may also manufacture products on behalf of Apple Computer, industry analysts predict. According to US reports, Sharp will manufacture a personal organiser product designed by Apple. The relationship would be similar to that between Apple and Sony in which the Japanese company manufactures Apple's low-end notebook computer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Status report on the Withdrawal of Russian Troops From </F> Estonia" dated 1 June 1994, based on data provided by Estonian  Ministry of Defense and the Defense Forces Headquarters --  received via Internet E-LIST]    [Text] During May 1994, no significant changes occurred in  the infrastructure and composition of the Russian troops located  in Estonia. At the same time the situation of the withdrawal of  the troops has become very complicated and contradictory. On  one hand the Russian authorities are trying to do everything to  maintain their military presence in Estonia while on the other  hand a very slow withdrawal process is still going on  simultaneously.    In order to maintain its military presence, the Russian side  has further strengthened its attempts to relate the withdrawal  of the troops with other issues, for example the granting of  special rights to military pensioners and enhancing the  accusations against Estonia of the alleged violence of human  rights. While still avoiding the announcement of the deadline  and timetable of the withdrawal of its troops, the Russian side  is trying to accuse Estonia of the failure in Estonian-Russian  negotiations so far. Russia is still presenting claims which  can only be interpreted as interference into the internal  affairs of the Republic of Estonia (the Law on Citizenship, the  Language Law etc.). All this prevents the establishment of the  good-neighbourly relations between the two states and confirms  that in the political life of Russia, imperial ambitions to  restore the sphere of influence of the former Soviet Union still  play a very important role.    During May the Estonian side was able to take over only 3  objects: the depots in Arukuela in Harju county which formerly  belonged to the navy, the depot of the boatswain's equipment at  6 Lootsi Street and the supply depot at 14 Lootsi Street in  Tallinn.    According to available information, preparations for  transfer  are going on at 13 objects in all, the transfer of which is  planned for June. Among these, Naissaar where all the sea mines  are either destroyed or withdrawn, and the former garrison of  the radio intelligence station of the National Security  Committee in Harju county in Vana-Aaviku should be noted.    In the navy ammunition and explosives depot located next to  residential area of Rhoismaee in Tallinn, which was visited by  Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs representatives and the  special commission of the Tallinn Rescue Service, only 1,000  tons out of the former 5,500 tons of ammunition is left. 20-25  wagons would suffice for removing the remainder.    The Russian Army still holds 114 sites and single objects in  the territory of Estonia. 86 of these are in Tallinn and 28 in  Harju County. The largest of these are described below.    In land forces: The 144th motorized rifle division.  Personnel estimated at about 1,000 men of whom about 700 are  officers and ensigns. Besides that, the officers who have  remained behind from the troops already withdrawn as well as the  re-enlisted military men are also accounted to the personnel of  this division. The regular soldiers leaving the division are  being replaced by Russian citizens living in Estonia. In  addition, Russian citizens from both Estonia and Russia who have  already finished their service, as well as unemployed officers  and re-enlisted military men are serving in the division as  sergeants and soldiers on a contractual basis. The wives of  officers have been employed in offices and logistical jobs.    The main duty of the motorized rifle regiment of Klooga is  the defence of Aemari airport. Because of that, the armament --  the armoured personnel carriers -- has not yet been taken away.  The regiment may leave after the transfer of the airport to  Estonia.    In naval forces:    In the Russian naval units in Tallinn, Paldiski, Aemari and  elsewhere in Harju county there are about 1,400 - 1,500 military  men in all. At Tallinn naval base there still remain the  headquarters, the headquarters of the 94th mine sweepers'  brigade in the Mine Harbour, the 55th mine sweepers' unit (2  mine sweepers) and logistical units. On the whole, there are  still about 400 seamen in Tallinn. As most of the officers and  other military men are not in uniform while on the territory of  Russian military objects, it has become difficult to determine  their exact number.    At the 93rd naval training centre of Paldiski there are  currently about 890 and at Aemari airport 100 - 150 Russian  military men. About 100 men serve in several smaller service and  logistical units and depots.    On the whole, about 2,400-2,500 military men are serving in  the military units of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation  located on the territory of Estonia. In addition, it is  estimated that about 500-1,000 have been demobilized or left  behind in Estonia.    Work on the dismantlement of the Paldiski nuclear reactors,  which, during the negotiations was planned for the beginning of  April, has been practically stopped by the Russian side.  Apparently experts and medical workers have been given leave  until July. If this is true, the withdrawal of the fuel rods  will not be carried out before July.    There are only 92 days left before the final deadline of the  withdrawal of the Russian troops proposed by Russia -- August 31  this year. Considering the number of the remaining troops and  the lack of technical obstacles, complete withdrawal by this  date is still possible. In the present situation where the  ships, technology and equipment of the naval forces are being  withdrawn more or less constantly, but the withdrawal of the  144th motorized rifle division is being delayed, one could  suppose that the intent is to delay the withdrawal of these  units with their armament and equipment up to the last moment in  order to get more concessions from Estonia. It is also possible  that some military objects might not be transferred to Estonian  control by August 31 although the armament will be removed. A  positive conclusion still depends greatly on active support for  Estonia from other nations and international organizations.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'COUNTY PROBES ORANGEWOOD CHILD SHELTER'  </P> <P> Re "County Probes Orangewood Child Shelter," March 31: I write to trumpet  absolute support of the purpose and services that epitomize the love and  concern shown by staff for the 180-plus children who are sheltered at the  Orangewood Children's Home, children who have been victimized by abuse, neglect  and abandonment in their home environment. As one who is at Orangewood as a  parachaplain and who volunteers time teaching poetry within the classroom, I am  quick and firm to give voice to the truths of my observation that I have not  seen the slightest evidence to remotely support allegations that staff is given  to abusing the children.  </P> <P> Quite the contrary to any connotation of wrongdoing, I have found Orangewood's  administration and staff to be exceptionally sensitive in their support and  care of each and every child at Orangewood.  </P> <P> The one key word that justly depicts the truth behind the supportive care given  the children at Orangewood is sensitivity.  </P> <P> The complainants made much about a so-called paramilitary mentality and a stern  regimentation that is claimed to be a detriment to the children. Any logical  response to such a claim must be founded upon the rationale that in caring for  180-plus children, ages newborn to 18 years, safety and order calls for a  degree of regimentation, all to the benefit of the children individually and  collectively.  </P> <P> The behavioral structure is no less or no more than one would find in any  public or private school, or decently run household.  </P> <P> EDMUND P. WERNER  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

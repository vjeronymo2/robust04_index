			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / International Company News: BP puts Texas unit up for sale BP is seeking a buyer for Tex/Con Oil and Gas, a wholly-owned Texas-based subsidiary which holds all the British company's onshore natural gas interests in the US, excluding Alaska. BP Exploration yesterday declined to comment on its plans for Tex/Con. But sources in the energy industry said the sale would be in keeping with BP's shift of emphasis in its exploration activities from the lower 48 US states to 'frontier' areas, such as Alaska and central and south America. An analyst in London said Tex/Con is likely to fetch between Dollars 650 and Dollars 1bn. According to US reports, BP has appointed investment bank JP Morgan to handle the sale, and prospective buyers will soon be invited to inspect details of Tex/Con's financial and operating condition in New York and Houston. Tex/Con's business, which includes exploration, production and pipelines, is centred in Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. It has interests in 3,000 wells and operates 1,500 miles of gas-gathering pipelines. Tex/Con produces about 11,800 barrels of oil and 121m cu ft of gas a day. BP does not disclose revenue or profit figures for Tex/Con. But low natural gas prices, an inability to fully replace reserves and falling oil production appear to have contributed to BP's disillusion with Tex/Con, which was set up as an autonomous, entrepreneurial venture. Staff numbers have been sharply cut back in recent months as part of an effort to reduce overhead. The company's problems came into public view last week when BP announced that Tex/Con's chief executive Mr Bill Johnson was taking early retirement. Mr Johnson has been replaced by Mr Bill Sears, formerly vice-president for offshore exploration. While cutting back its exploration presence in the US, BP has been expanding in other parts of the western hemisphere. It recently opened an office in Caracas, Venezuela, and has become increasingly active in Colombia.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: FOR SALE: ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING  </P> <P> Nowhere in the world will you find people with the same creative work ethic as  Americans.  </P> <P> At the age of 4, one of my sons was going through the neighborhood dragging a  little red wagon with our canceled checks in it. He was selling them for a  penny a package.  </P> <P> In the years that followed, all three of our kids went from selling  watered-down lemonade to baby-sitting to delivering newspapers. As teen-agers,  they were paid an allowance to breathe and to put gas in our own car, which  they had driven to E in the first place.  </P> <P> I personally taught them how to drop money each week into a ceramic pig on  their nightstand. They taught me how to get the money out of the ceramic pig by  inserting a kitchen knife in the slot and sliding the coins out to pay the  paperboy. The message was set: You are never too young or too rich to make a  few bucks if you use your imagination.  </P> <P> We may have overdone it.  </P> <P> Everything in this country is for sale. (What am I saying? The country is for  sale.) You can rent out your bull for a stud fee. You can sell your seat at the  Super Bowl and take an early retirement. You can pay someone to send your  daughter cookies at college or write her a letter on her birthday. There's a  man in Syracuse who will scoop dog droppings from your yard for $5 a week. If  you have a need for $21,000, you could sell Napoleon I's toothbrush. A farmer  in Oklahoma has offered the Soviet Union $1 million worth of wheat in exchange  for a seat on a Soviet space flight. The name of the game is supply and demand.  </P> <P> I didn't realize how far we had drifted until I read about a letter that  appeared in the New York Times. A guy was standing in a line at the fish  counter holding number 997. Number 793 was being served. As he stood there, a  guy in a black leather jacket approached him and asked him what number he had.  "For 10 bucks, I'll give you 873," he said. When the writer refused, he said:  "How about 25 bucks for 840?"  </P> <P> "You're scalping tickets at the fish counter?" the shopper asked in shock.  </P> <P> "Hey, pal," Mr. Black Leather Jacket said, "time is money."  </P> <P> The story brought to mind a crusty old editor I used to work for in my early  reporting days in Ohio. He stormed into the women's department one day and  demanded to know why I had used a trade name for a soft drink in a story I had  written. The tirade lasted an eternity. As the entire newsroom strained to  listen, he ended by shouting, "Don't give it away when you can sell it."  </P> <P> I didn't realize so many people heard him.  </P></p>

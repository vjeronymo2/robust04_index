			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMODELING PAYMENTS REGULATED IN STATE  </P> <P> In California, home improvement payments -- including down payments paid to the  contractor by the owner -- are regulated by law, according to the National  Assn. of the Remodeling Industry.  </P> <P> Section 7159 of the California contractors' license law provides when the  payment schedule calls for a down payment that the down payment be no more than  $1,000 or 10% of the contract price, whichever is less. Exceptions are made for  deposits for one-of-a-kind or special-ordered products.  </P> <P> The Southern California chapter of the national remodeling trade association  cautions against consumers being "lured into giving large deposits in exchange  for big discounts" on their remodeling projects.  </P></p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Major will try to curb EFA costs THE PRIME minister will today begin government attempts to curb the costs of Britain's involvement in the European Fighter Aircraft amid signs that the project is one of many that the Treasury is targeting in its battle to curb public spending. The row over public spending could re-erupt on Thursday when the cabinet discusses substantial rises, recommended by the Top Salaries Review Body, in MPs' allowances. Tory backbenchers may rebel if the increases are trimmed. There is also the prospect of a dispute within the party over pay rises for senior civil servants, the military and judges. Labour yesterday joined in the spending row by seizing on reports that unemployment benefit might be cut. It argued that the government was attacking the jobless in its attempts to end the recession. The future of the EFA, following Germany's decision not to give the go-ahead for production, will be raised by Mr John Major when be meets Professor Giulano Amato, the Italian prime minister, in Munich today. Italy and Spain are also partners in the project. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, will consider possible alternatives when he meets Mr Volker Ruhe, his German counterpart, in London. Possible compromises include varying the specification of the fighter for each country - allowing Germany, for example, to have cheaper weapon and radar systems. The Treasury wants a full review of the EFA's costs but accepts that no decision can be made until Germany's position is clarified. It accepts that much of the spending will fall outside this year's public expenditure round. The MoD believes the EFA can be kept within its original budget. Mr Major said at the weekend that the government had still not received a formal communication from Germany. He is anxious Bonn should reconsider although Downing Street officials are not optimistic. Cabinet ministers sought to play down speculation of a rift but acknowledged that the project's future was uncertain. However, any Treasury attempt to stymie the project would be resisted furiously by Mr Rifkind and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Mr Major said that he was looking to cut the costs of the EFA but he hoped the project would go ahead. The UK had decided it needed an aircraft like the EFA for military reasons. He said the UK took 'the view that the alternatives to the European fighter would be more expensive, not less expensive, and would take longer to produce'.</p>

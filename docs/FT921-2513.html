			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: SEC filing prices GPA float at Dollars 25 THE PROPOSED maximum offering price for shares in the GPA flotation is Dollars 25 (Pounds 14.20p) according to its filing document with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, the US regulator. Guinness Peat Aviation, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, was quick to point out yesterday that it was not tied by a price that was simply used to calculate its SEC registration fee of Dollars 93,750. However, when GPA announces its price range in May, advisers to the group believe it is likely to be below the proposed maximum price of Dollars 25 contained on the front of its document. That is a view shared by some of GPA's shareholders, which could cause the group some problems as its advisers negotiate terms to prevent them from selling immediately after the secondary sale. GPA's advisers expect all of the group's existing shareholders to agree to a form of 'lock-up' that would allow them to sell some shares during the offer but not for six to 12 months after the sale. The Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, which according to its SEC Form F-1 statement is its largest shareholder with 12.8m shares, is known to be keen to reduce its holding. Air Canada, with 10.8m shares, and Aer Lingus, with 9.9m shares, would also like to sell 'at the right price'. But the problem is to determine the right price. Some of their shares were bought for Dollars 32, although the majority were purchased at considerably less. If shareholders do not come to an agreement with the company they forfeit their chance to sell in the secondary offer. One shareholder which has decided it is not worth waiting is Hanson, the international conglomerate. It yesterday confirmed the sale of its 2 per cent stake of 1.2m shares for Dollars 20.57 a share. As Hanson put it: 'Our banks were not exactly about to default on us'. The conglomerate may have thought that it was not worth negotiating a lock-up agreement before a sale which would only realise a little more than it received for all its shares. Directors and executive officers of GPA have options to purchase 595,000 ordinary shares at prices ranging from Dollars 5.10 to Dollars 32.50, with a weighted average price of Dollars 19 per share. The F-1 document also contains new information on GPA's results for the nine months to the end of December. Revenues from aircraft leasing increased by 46 per cent, from Dollars 416m to Dollars 606m, reflecting an increase in the number of GPA aircraft on lease from 216 to 281. Revenues from sales of aircraft and aircraft-related products fell by 20 per cent from Dollars 1.05bn to Dollars 841m, mainly because the number of aircraft sold fell from 40 to 22, reflecting the difficult trading conditions prevailing in the industry. The document warns: 'The duration and severity of these difficult trading conditions will depend in part on the duration and severity of the recession but management believes it is likely that they will continue through at least fiscal 1993 and lease rates may not recover during that period.' GPA made provisions of Dollars 11m against lease receivables in case airlines get into difficulty and are unable to pay their leases. Although they are required to pay an upfront deposit of three months, GPA expects some airlines to default on their payments. The group has also made provisions of millions of dollars against the falling price of some of its older narrow-body aircraft. The importance of the flotation is underlined by the fact that GPA's firm orders to buy aircraft from manufacturers until the year 2000 has risen to Dollars 12.1bn with options, costing Dollars 9.5bn, to purchase additional aircraft.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: HP invests Dollars 16.5m in new Dutch printer plant HEWLETT-PACKARD, the US computer group, is to invest Fl 30m (Dollars 16.5m) in building production lines for laser printers at its European distribution centre in Amersfoort, in the Netherlands. When completed in March, the expanded facility will have two production lines with a combined capacity of 80,000 printers per month. The site, which is set to double in size to 20,000 square metres, may eventually house up to five production lines, depending on demand. HP has two other European printer production plants in Spain and Italy. The printers assembled in the Netherlands are destined for customers and resellers in Europe, where the market for laser printing is less mature than in the US, opening up prospects of healthy growth in demand, HP said. The Amersfoort production site will create up to 200 jobs over the next few years. The production lines will be operated by a subsidiary of Van Ommeren, the Dutch shipping and storage group, which also runs HP's distribution centre.</p>

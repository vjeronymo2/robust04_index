			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Balkans leaders visit London Mr Zhelyu Zhelev, the Bulgarian president and Mr Sali Berisha, the president of Albania, today hold separate talks in London with Mr John Major, the British prime minister and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, writes Anthony Robinson. The Balkan situation, and ways of preventing the Yugoslav imbroglio spilling over into a wider Balkan war will be high on the agenda. Bulgaria has been particularly hard hit by the UN trade embargo on Serbia and the difficulty of ensuring transit rights needed for access to western markets. Both countries are concerned about the the fate of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and ethnic tensions in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, which in the past have led to conflicts involving both Greece and Turkey as well as Bulgaria. Both presidents will also seek to drum up the interest of UK investors at separate conferences organised by the Confederation of British industry and will give details of their economic reform and foreign policies in talks at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Last week Rover, recently taken over by BMW, announced a car and van assembly plant investment in Bulgaria, which is a growing exporter of wine to the UK.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / A risky farewell to the nanny state: Leyla Boulton assesses the progress of Russia's privatisation programme and its chances of success Russia's mass privatisation programme was recently described by Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais as the main reason for an alleged coup plot by conservatives to unseat the government when parliament meets in three weeks. The cabinet, fighting for its survival ahead of the Congress of People's Deputies on December 1, has promised to consult factory directors on privatisation and other economic reforms. President Boris Yeltsin has been negotiating a compromise to protect the thrust of his reforms from a conservative opposition which Mr Chubais, the programme's author, accuses of seeking to 'destroy privatisation'. Despite the political hyperbole embraced by both the government and its opponents, the question is not whether privatisation, an essential component of attempts to build a market economy in Russia, will proceed, but whether it can deliver the results expected of it. The process is under way around the country: from Murmansk in the far north, where the country's biggest trawler fleet is being advised by the US investment bank, Salomon Bros, to the Urals industrial heartland, where the 40-year-old director of one of the biggest heavy engineering plants, Uralmash, is planning how to run a private company. The government has set itself the ambitious target of privatising more than 5,000 medium and large-scale enterprises, or up to half the country's industrial potential, next year. It has three goals: to make the transition to a market economy irreversible by creating a class of property owners; to make enterprises more efficient and curb their demand for endless cheap credits from the state; and to stop factory directors appropriating the choicest bits of the state-owned economy. Far from opposing the reform, many enterprises hope privatisatsiya will bring liberation from a cumbersome state bureaucracy which demands a lot but gives little. At a meeting with the government last month in Togliatti, home to the Avtovaz plant which makes Lada cars, directors of the country's 60 biggest enterprises spelt out their grievances. Mr Viktor Korovin, the head of Uralmash, said he would be unable to sell shares to the public for another year and a half. First, the government had to free enterprises from a heavy burden of social spending on maintaining hospitals, housing, kindergartens and shops for workers. 'The government has yet to discuss what it is going to do about non-productive assets which are in fact a form of hidden taxation on my enterprise,' he said. Until he can transfer social facilities from his balance sheet to municipal authorities, which will need state subsidies to run them, he fears the burden they represent will scare off foreign investors. Many enterprise directors still hope, however, that privatisation will provide a quick fix of foreign investment, technology and know-how - without requiring sweeping changes to the way their enterprises operate, or ceding control to other managers. The Babayev chocolate factory in Moscow, nationalised by the Bolsheviks seven decades ago, sees privatisation as a way of attracting foreign investors so it can import cocoa beans and machinery which the cash-strapped state can no longer supply. The Murmansk Trawler Fleet wants the freedom to manage its own affairs, and a foreign partner to help renew its fleet and market its fish. 'Before, the state even ordered our ships for us without asking whether we wanted them,' complains Mr Yuri Prutkov, the fleet's manager. Babayev and the Murmansk fleet are among thousands of state-owned enterprises being registered as joint-stock companies, which are able to sell shares to the public. The danger facing many of them is that they might swap the domination of the state for that of the workforce. About two-thirds of enterprises, in elections strongly influenced by the managers' personal preference, have chosen an option which allows staff to buy 51 per cent of the stock. The benefit for the managers is that they are less likely to be voted out of office by their own workers than by an outside investor seeking to maximise profits regardless of the number of jobs this costs. Mr Prutkov denies this option will prevent restructuring, arguing that it will simply make the process less painful. 'Everybody will understand that if we don't conduct this painful operation ourselves, then the enterprise will collapse,' he says, eyeing a list of obsolete ships, accounting for a third of his fleet, which he would like to dispose of because they cost more to operate than the revenues they generate. He does not say how many jobs will have to go, but he claims that a hiring freeze will be enough to achieve his target. With two out of five votes on the board of the joint-stock company being created, he believes that he will secure the freedom to manage the enterprise as he sees fit. The other three votes will be held respectively by a representative of the workforce, the local privatisation committee and the local council - a line-up specified in a decree by President Yeltsin but one that can be altered to make way for outside investors. The success of the privatisation campaign, in which the government has been distributing vouchers enabling each citizen to obtain Rbs10,000 worth of shares, will also depend on the development of a market infrastructure - such as an efficient banking system and a bankruptcy mechanism. In these areas in particular, foreign advice is at least as important as foreign capital. The closest thing to a securities market in Murmansk is a sullen, undernourished teenager sitting in a supermarket, with a sign saying 'I buy vouchers' pinned to his chest. On the eve of the planned start in January of share sales, the country does not yet have a securities law to regulate its fledgling stock exchanges, let alone a system of enforcing existing regulations. In an attempt to protect small shareholders, the government is encouraging the establishment of some 2,000 investment funds, which will spread investment risk across a broad portfolio of shares for citizens who buy into the funds with their vouchers. Later this month, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development hopes to stage the first ever auction of shares. It has also teamed up with Credit Commercial de France to organise a model investment fund. But recognising the danger of relying on share sales alone to create property owners, the government has also decided to allow people to exchange their vouchers for more tangible assets such as hairdresser shops, trucks and cows. Given the formidable obstacles, the tight targets set by the government may seem unrealistic. The privatisation programme will deliver its goal of creating a market economy but not in the timespan allotted for it. This is because change happens slowly in bureaucratic Russia. The most effective way of getting anything done is to demand more than it is realistic to achieve. In that sense, privatisation has already started to be a success.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992 Nov 1:  Deadline for registration for joint-stock companies.

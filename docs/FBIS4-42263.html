			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "As Usual..."] </F>   [Text] While the U.S. State Department spokesman was  saying that the U.S. Government does not have any evidence  regarding the oppression of the Greek minority in Albania, the  [Albanian President Sali] Berisha regime was arranging to  provide the evidence.    Following the arrest and serious charges brought against six  members of Omonoia, yesterday the Tirana regime launched a new  wave of persecutions by arresting 30 North Ipirotans at  Gjirokaster and four at Delvine (they have been released for the  time being) and searching for another 10.    What other evidence does the State Department need to be  convinced that human rights in Albania are being systematically  violated with persecutions that aim at terrorizing the Greek  minority?    Tirana's goal is clear: It wants to drive the North  Ipirotans out of Albania and implement known methods that Turkey  had implemented for the extermination of the Greeks in Istanbul,  Imroz, and Tenedos.    The State Department does not have evidence. Didn't U.S.  President Bill Clinton have evidence a month ago, during the  Greek prime minister's visit, when he said that he was concerned  about the Greek minority in Albania? What has happened since  then?    This is not just double-talk by the United States, but  hypocrisy, which sometimes--according to the interests  served--shows super sensitivity for human rights whereas usually  it is indifferent.    Some 40 years ago, when the Hellenism of Istanbul, Imroz,  and  Tenedos was being expelled, the U.S. stance was similarly  hypocritical. At that time as well, the United States did not  have evidence.    As for Cyprus, at the time of the Attila invasion, the  United  States did not have evidence, as it still does not have any for  the continuing occupation of Cyprus. But for Kuwait, the United  States found the evidence in the value of oil.    It is hypocritical to put on the same scale, the interests  of  the superpower and human rights, for which every U.S. leader is  supposedly interested and issues a Sultan's order.    It is hypocritical to cut 25 percent of aid to Turkey for  the  genocide of the Kurds while at the same time cutting aid to  Greece as "punishment" for the embargo against Skopje [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. What scale  equals a systematic genocide with the measures of a state  against a provocative neighbor?    Perhaps the answer is found in the American expression:  Business as usual....

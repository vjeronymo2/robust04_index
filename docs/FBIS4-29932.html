			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 21 KYODO -- U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor said Tuesday [21 June] he plans to  discuss macroeconomic and sectoral issues when he meets Japanese  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa this weekend in Los Angeles.    Speaking to reporters Tuesday evening, Kantor said he  expects  his discussion with Kakizawa to cover all aspects of the  so-called framework trade talks with Japan.    But Kantor did not give a precise date for the planned  meeting, saying it depends on Kakizawa's schedule.    Under the framework negotiations designed to rectify the  chronic trade imbalance between the two countries, the U.S. is  pressing Japan to set "objective criteria" to measure progress  in market-opening.    But Tokyo rejects binding criteria, saying they could lead  to  managed trade.</p>

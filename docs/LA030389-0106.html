			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESPITE RIOTS, VENEZUELA WILL STRESS AUSTERITY  </P> <P> Shaken by four days of bloody price riots that left more than 200 dead and  thousands injured, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez vowed Thursday to  stick to the tough austerity measures that triggered the violence and called on  the industrial nations to work out "decent and rational" debt arrangements with  Latin America before more such social explosions occur.  </P> <P> Although calm prevailed throughout most of the nation, sporadic disturbances  continued in the shantytown slums of western Caracas where another 20 people  reportedly were killed in armed clashes with army troops and police during the  night.  </P> <P> In one daylight confrontation Thursday, a crowd of about 100 slum-dwellers  poured down a shantytown hillside, throwing rocks at waiting police who fired  back with undetermined results. Occasional shots could be heard elsewhere  throughout the day as police and army marksmen aimed fire at suspected snipers  on the tops of buildings.  </P> <P> As night fell and the 6 p.m. curfew began, there were prolonged bursts of  automatic weapons fire in the plush downtown district called Parque Central,  where the city's cultural center and major hotels are located.  </P> <P> But only a few hours earlier, as he boarded a helicopter to survey the  strife-torn slums, Perez said that except for the "pockets of disorder" in the  slums, the country "is returning to normal."  </P> <P> By implication he blamed "remnants" of extreme left revolutionaries for some of  the disorder. "These phantasmagoric remnants of subversives are still not  convinced that this is a democratic country," said Perez, who was inaugurated  only a month ago.  </P> <P> Although many social scientists and foreign diplomats here believe the rioting  and looting were leaderless and began spontaneously in response to sharp  government-announced price increases, Perez insisted that at least some acts  "were induced, and this has to be punished severely."  </P> <P> Emotionally, he described one incident in which army Maj. Felipe Acosta Caries,  36, was killed in an ambush on the Pan American Highway near the Caracas  working-class district of El Valle late Wednesday or early Thursday.  </P> <P> Perez said that he was "preoccupied with and ashamed of" the violence and  called the heavy loss of life "an absurdity" that happened "without any  understandable reason."  </P> <P> Economists here said that one of the major reasons for the rioting can be  traced to the fact that 40% to 50% of the people of Caracas live beneath the  poverty line of 5,000 bolivars ($143) a month and simply cannot survive the  price boosts.  </P> <P> Upon returning from his helicopter tour of the capital city, the beleaguered  president vowed to stand fast with his belt-tightening measures, which included  substantial increases in the prices of long-subsidized goods.  </P> <P> "We have to keep on with the measures that we have proposed in order to get  Venezuela out of this economic situation," Perez said.  </P> <P> Faced with a $33-billion foreign debt burden which his government is trying to  refinance, Perez called on the major lending countries "to find decent and  rational formulas in order that Latin America can respect its debt  commitments."  </P> <P> The alternative, he said, is to "face a grave social situation such as the one  which provoked the explosion here."  </P> <P> The rigid austerity measures were required as a condition of a new agreement  with the International Monetary Fund, which was signed in Washington while  rioters looted stores in Caracas on Tuesday. The agreement will give Venezuela  an immediate $453 million with another $4.3 billion on tap over the next three  years.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Venezuelan air force moved into its second day of an  around-the-clock airlift of food to the capital in what may be a futile attempt  to stave off severe shortages by the weekend. As many as 95% of the grocery  stores and food markets in some parts of the city were destroyed by looters  Monday and Tuesday, further exacerbating shortages that had been developing in  anticipation of price increases.  </P> <P> "This weekend there may be some hunger in the city," said an economist who has  been following the crisis. He said that even before the rioting, there had been  sporadic shortages of milk, rice, bread, salt, soap and toilet paper in the  stores as merchants withheld goods in anticipation of higher prices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BEHIND VENEZUELA'S UNREST -- RISING PRICES  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.44IN:2.88IN:2.22IN:2.22IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Old price  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> New price  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Percent  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Item  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Quantity  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> in dollars  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> in dollars  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Change  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bread  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.1 lbs.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.51  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.86  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 66.7%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pasta  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2.2 lbs.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.39  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.69  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 77.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Milk  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.05 quarts  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.23  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.43  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 87.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Soft Drinks  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8 ounces  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.11  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0.17  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 50.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Gasoline  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1 gal.

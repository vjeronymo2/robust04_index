			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 'FLYOVER BRIDGE' OPPOSED;  </P> <P> FOES PRESS FOR REDESIGN OF INTERCHANGE  </P> <P> Opponents of a controversial Woodland Hills freeway interchange plan said  Friday that they may file suit to force state and city traffic engineers to  redesign the project.  </P> <P> Leaders of the newly formed Concerned Citizens for Valley Circle/Mulholland  Interchange said there is unified community opposition to the unusual design  proposed for the $40-million Valley Circle Boulevard interchange.  </P> <P> Transportation officials want the long-planned interchange to include a widened  north-south bridge at Valley Circle Boulevard plus a secondary east-west bridge  over the Ventura Freeway that would link Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills  with Calabasas Road in Calabasas.  </P> <P> They say such a design is the only one of several alternatives they have  studied that will adequately handle future traffic at the southwestern edge of  the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> But some nearby property owners have objected to the secondary freeway "flyover  bridge." They maintain that it would funnel heavy Woodland Hills traffic into  the area of Old Calabasas and accelerate development in the area.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overly Expensive  </P> <P> About 175 residents attending a Thursday night meeting called by the Concerned  Citizens group were told that an independent traffic expert believes that a  flyover bridge would be overly expensive and will not remedy future traffic  problems.  </P> <P> In a straw poll after the presentation, those attending voted by a 2-to-1  margin to support construction of a conventional interchange without the  flyover bridge, said Bill Bridgers, an organizer of the group.  </P> <P> "We're debating our next step now," Bridgers said Friday. "We will turn over  the results of the poll to our elected representatives."  </P> <P> Bridgers said city and state officials have been promoting construction of a  Valley Circle interchange for 20 years and are unlikely to allow transportation  engineers to shelve the project now.  </P> <P> If the politicians do not intercede, "we're considering a class-action  lawsuit," Bridgers said.  </P> <P> "We don't want to do it if there's a way to avoid it. We don't want to stand in  the way of the project. We all want a new interchange. But we want to protect  Old Calabasas."  </P> <P> Foes of the flyover bridge have argued that it would cram four lanes of Ventura  Boulevard traffic onto two-lane Calabasas Road unless the road was widened. To  widen it, land in front of the 145-year-old Leonis Adobe museum and in front of  quaint Old Calabasas storefronts would be paved over.  </P> <P> The dispute prompted state Department of Transportation planners and engineers  from the Los Angeles City Department of Transportation to slightly modify the  design last month.  </P> <P> The revised plan would direct some of the potential flyover bridge traffic away  from the Old Calabasas area and eliminate the need to widen Calabasas Road,  according to the engineers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warning Issued  </P> <P> Earlier this week, city officials and state legislators warned that the  interchange project probably will not be built unless the flyover bridge is  included.  </P> <P> At a news conference Wednesday at the bridge site, City Councilwoman Joy Picus  said there is "strong, broad-based community support" for the flyover bridge.  She warned that funding for the project will be withdrawn unless the Ventura  Boulevard-Calabasas Road connection is built.  </P> <P> "Caltrans has stated that the preferred alternative is the only one it will  fund because it is the only plan that will handle the traffic," Picus said.  "The state won't build an interchange that won't work."  </P> <P> State traffic engineers in charge of the project were unavailable for comment  Friday. Officials have said they hope to build the new interchange -- which  would be partially paid for by the city -- in 1991.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, supporters of the flyover bridge concept were launching a campaign  to counter Bridgers' Concerned Citizens group.  </P> <P> People entering Thursday night's forum at El Camino Real High School were  handed "fact sheets" designed to refute the position of the anti-flyover bridge  organization.  </P> <P> "Why is a group representing itself as 'Concerned Citizens' advocating that  millions be spent on a freeway interchange design which the state and city  professional engineers know to be inadequate to handle the traffic?" the  handout asked.  </P></p>

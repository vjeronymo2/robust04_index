			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / French industry given Pounds 1.3bn VAT lifeline THE French government yesterday threw a FFr11bn (Pounds 1.33bn) lifeline to businesses, to help them through the high interest rates needed to defend the franc. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, announced that companies will be able to claim back a proportion of value added tax on their monthly purchases faster than before. Companies can in their February VAT returns deduct 10 per cent of the VAT due on their January purchases, on top of the deductions on December purchases that would normally figure in next month's returns. They will be able to make the same advance deductions in future months, said Mr Beregovoy. This would 'lighten company charges and limit the consequences of the temporary rise in interest rates,' said the Budget Ministry. The measure received a cool welcome from the Patronat employers' association, which called it 'partial and limited' despite the fact that employers lobbied unsuccessfully for just such assistance in last autumn's budget. It will further increase the current year's government deficit, already set at FFr165bn in the budget. French interest rates are among the highest in real terms in Europe. On Tuesday the central bank raised one of its official rates to fend off fresh speculation against the French franc. The government's hard franc policy obliges it to wait for a significant drop in German rates before it responds to demands from business and some members of the right wing opposition for lower French borrowing costs, seen as badly needed to stimulate the flagging economy and reverse the growth in unemployment. Industrial investment will show no real recovery this year after falling by 5 per cent in 1992, according to a study earlier this week by Banque Nationale de Paris. BNP expects French companies' operating profits to rise by 1 per cent this year, a marked slowdown from the 4 per cent rise of last year.</p>

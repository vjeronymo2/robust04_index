			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Air Canada posts CDollars 14m loss AIR CANADA, which has dropped its merger plan with rival Canadian Airlines International, reported a CDollars 14m (USDollars 11.6m) loss for the third quarter, its busiest period. The latest loss, equivalent to 19 cents a share, compares with a profit of CDollars 4m, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier. Operating revenues were up 4.6 per cent to just over CDollars 1bn. Revenue passenger miles flown totalled 4.6bn, up from 4.2bn and with three new Boeing 747s brought out of storage last spring, capacity was up 14 per cent. Mr Hollis Harris, president and chief executive, said that 'during the third quarter, strict cost control measures have helped us achieve a 14 per cent increase in available seat miles with only a 6 per cent increase in operating expense. 'However, the worldwide softness in passenger yields, particularly on transatlantic routes, has eroded much of the benefits produced by the aggressive management of costs.' Operating profit before financial charges for the latest quarter was CDollars 39m, against CDollars 47m, while asset sales increased cash by CDollars 407m to CDollars 511m. The main disposal was the En Route credit card operation. The nine-month loss came out at CDollars 307m, or CDollars 4.14 a share, against a deficit of CDollars 126m, or CDollars 1.70 a share, a year earlier, on revenues virtually static at CDollars 2.7bn. The period included a loss of CDollars 97m on operations, interest charges of CDollars 166m and severance costs of CDollars 52m. Air Canada announced this week it had failed to reach a merger deal with Canadian because it maintained the pre-merger terms would not have created a viable airline and was not in its shareholders' best interests. Industry sources say Air Canada may attempt a new merger deal or try to acquire some assets from Canadian. Canadian has begun new talks with American Airlines which are aimed at reviving American's offer to buy a 25 per cent equity stake in Canadian's parent company, PWA, for CDollars 250m. Canadian's employees would make pay concessions and find further equity - a package worth Dollars 300m. Air Canada is now one of three remaining bidders for Continental Airlines of the US. Lufthansa dropped out on Monday. Air Canada and a Texas group have offered USDollars 425m for a restructured Continental, and the winner is expected to be announced early next week.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Reed Elsevier Reed's merger with Elsevier certainly looks good on a pie chart. There is even a decent chance that it will work out in practice. Unlike many mergers, Reed Elsevier contains titles and groups which can more or less stand alone. So while common financial systems may be imposed from the centre and co-operation over product development may grow, there is relatively little risk that the Reed body will reject the Elsevier brain. The chemistry also seems to work at board level. Implementation of strategy will be all, but both sides have proved adept at acquisitions and the group's financial strength is a great asset. This year, the gathering recession in continental Europe is a worry. Yet at least the group's main cyclical businesses are in the UK and US. And there will be a nice kick to Reed's 1993 earnings since the pro-forma 1992 figures were converted at a higher sterling rate than looks likely this year. After five years of continuous revolution and flat earnings, Reed's shareholders must be looking forward to a little growth.</p>

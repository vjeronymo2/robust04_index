			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Creating a worldwide yen for Japanese beer - Emiko Terazono examines brewers' plans for expansion into foreign markets JAPANESE brewers are trying to cultivate overseas drinkers' taste for their beers by stressing they, rather than western brands, go best with sushi and sukiyaki. Although the high yen, expensive transport costs and low profit margins have curbed Japanese brewers' overseas expansion, stagnation in domestic sales due to market saturation is forcing the companies to turn to international expansion. Higher overseas demand for Japanese beer, due to the increasing popularity of Japanese cuisine and rising numbers of Japanese expatriates, has also motivated Japanese brewers to look abroad for markets. Kirin Brewery, the world's fourth biggest and Japan's largest brewer, recently announced a licensing agreement with Charles Wells brewery of Bedford, England. Wells will start producing Kirin's lager next year. Kirin has had a licensing deal with Molson, the Canadian brewer, since 1987, as well as a contract with the Hong Kong arm of Philippine brewer San Miguel. Kirin has opted for overseas production rather than exports. It believes that freshness is the most important factor for beers, adding that tariff barriers can be avoided through overseas production. Asahi Breweries, which bought 20 per cent of Foster's of Australia in 1990, says it is looking for further overseas expansion through the Foster's international network. It also wants a further brewing stake in Australia as soon as regulatory limits are lifted there. Sapporo Breweries was the first Japanese brewer to sell its beer overseas - in the 1940s. It does not think overseas production is warranted because of the small volume of sales abroad. For the big four brewers, Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo and Suntory, the US is their largest overseas market, consuming over 70 per cent of foreign sales. They add that Asian markets have the greatest potential, since beer is a relatively new drink and Japanese brands are popular. The brewers' expansion abroad comes as other Japanese companies are retreating from international markets. The brewers, like most Japanese corporations, are victims of the stock market crash, and face a squeeze in cash-flow owing to losses on stock holdings and redemptions for equity-linked financing from the late 1980s. The beer companies admit they are cautious about rapid overseas expansion, and their foreign sales are still only about 1 per cent of turnover. But the companies believe the industry, set up in the 1860s with the help of German, Dutch and American brewers, has become a world leader in brewing technology. They also say the taste of Japanese beer is gaining international acceptance as a compromise between overly light American beers and heavy European beers. Asahi's 'dry' beer, with its sharper taste and higher alcohol content, has been successful abroad, particularly in North America. Sapporo claims it has brought about a change in the way brewers market draft beer by packaging its unpasteurised brew using a ceramic filtration method. Since Sapporo's introduction of packaged draft beer in the US in 1979, US manufacturers have created their own versions. Kirin's overseas sales of Ichiban Shibori - meaning first pressing of the malt - is rising in tandem with domestic popularity. Kirin plans to start overseas production of the beer, marketed as Kirin Ichiban in the US and Europe, next year. Japanese brewers have competed in the domestic markets through a wider range of new brews, from dry beer to beer drunk on the rocks. Although overseas sales will be focused on a smaller number of brands, more innovative brands are likely to be launched on overseas markets. Mr Tetsuya Fujiwara, of Kirin, says: 'There is a high overseas demand for products which become popular in Japan.' Kirin plans to start licensed production of Kirin Ichiban in the US next year, and also hopes to do the same in Europe in the near future. The question is: will the Japanese brewers follow their counterparts in the electronic and automobile industries, and become the Toyotas and Matsushitas of the global beer market? 'That's probably unlikely,' says Kirin's Mr Fujiwara. 'The taste of beer is very cultural and personal, not like electronic goods or cars.'  -----------------------     JAPANESE BEER    EXPORTS IN 1991    ('000 litres)  ----------------------- Sapporo          14,432 Kirin            13,632 Asahi             7,596 Suntory           1,704  -----------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service  Sergei Stepashin voiced his support for the presidential decree  on urgent measures to combat organized crime.    Addressing the Collegium of the Prosecutor-General's Office  on Thursday, he said that without going into legal assessments  of the methods of implementing the presidential decree, he fully  supported the political decision to pass it.    He said that the problem lay in the fact that foreign  special  services are trying to penetrate into Russian criminal  structures, establish control over them and use them to the  detriment of Russian interests. He also pointed out that making  use of the undefined status of Russian state borders, the  national security services of the Baltic states and other  republics "have established contacts with Russian criminals for  intelligence purposes.    He said that a joint directive would be sent to the Russian  power ministries' territorial bodies in which the disputed  provisions of the decree will be brought into line with current  laws.    He announced that the Russian president was considering a  draft decree on the restoration of the investigation department  in the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service. According to his  sources, the decree will be signed soon.</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Revival of flexible work plan runs risk of Tube strikes LONDON UNDERGROUND is to revive an attempt to introduce more flexible working practices which it modified two years ago because of a one-day strike campaign. The move is expected later this year in spite of a current dispute over job cuts. London Underground proposals include allowing its 22,000 station staff to sell tickets as well as supervising platforms, and would include a new multi-skilled senior grade of station employee. The corporation wants to have the flexibility when rostered staff are absent for employees who operate as 'relief' workers to substitute for all grades of platform staff rather than only for their own grade. The plans are being considered amid a dispute over the corporation's attempt to cut 1,005 jobs because of financial difficulties. The RMT rail union is expected to announce today that members have voted for industrial action. Members of the TSSA white collar union have already voted for strikes by a 575 to 289 majority. London Underground has already drawn up plans to suspend any workers who take part in industrial action over the job cuts. Mr Roger Straker, London Underground personnel director, said it would negotiate further over job cuts, but if there were strikes the corporation would 'take a very hard line indeed'.

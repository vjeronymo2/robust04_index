			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / VW seeks Dollars 185m from sale of housing VOLKSWAGEN, the troubled German vehicle maker, is attempting to raise an estimated DM300m (Dollars 185.10m) by selling part of its housing stock in its home town of Wolfsburg to company tenants. VW accounts for three out of five jobs in the town and owns more than one in five houses and flats. It has offered 1,400 tenants the right to buy their homes. If they choose not to buy, the properties will be sold on the open market, the company says. Although security of tenure is guaranteed, the likelihood of demands for rent increases from conventional landlords and the high cost of home loans has caused a local outcry. The move, which has been greeted by a petition protesting at the company's 'attack on social harmony', demonstrates the company's wide-ranging search for savings. Its housing subsidiary has 12,700 homes on its books - worth an estimated DM2.5bn - and says the sell-off is well on the way to success. According to German media reports, the monthly cost of a mortgage on a typical, modest 70 sq m flat is about DM1,700 - double the present rent for such an apartment. Wolfsburg is a company town in the old style, with many of its cultural and social facilities provided by VW. Company flats are in orderly, compact blocks. Most were built in the post-second world war boom, when German workers aspired not only to a VW Beetle and foreign holidays but to a decent home as well. Those on sale at present, for example, are about 30 years old. The VW move is one of hundreds of savings and cost-cutting moves being applied throughout German industry's generous network of social benefits. Robert Bosch, a leading component supplier, has after eight months of talks negotiated a package cutting DM180m off its cost base. The measures include cancellation of company-paid cures in German spa towns and lower canteen subsidies. Daimler-Benz has told some of its workers it is no longer prepared to pay for their children's first-communion dresses.</p>

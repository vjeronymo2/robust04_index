			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / UK Company News: St Ives rises to Pounds 21m in weak markets ST IVES, the UK's largest independent printer, yesterday reported a 4.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 21.1m for the year ended July 31 despite difficult conditions in its core magazine and book printing divisions. The result was achieved on turnover lower at Pounds 208.1m (Pounds 217.7m), mainly reflecting the disposal of several small packaging companies. Earnings per share grew to 15.2p (14.6p) .The final dividend is 3.75p per share, making a total of 5.25p (5.0p). Mr Robert Gavron, chairman, said that most of the group's markets were 'very weak' but increases in market share, further cost reductions and the benefits from the group's five-year Pounds 130m investment programme in plant and machinery all helped underpin its performance. Gross margins grew from 23.3 per cent to 24.2 per cent while operating profits increased to Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 19.9m) buoyed by lower administration expenses. Pre-tax profits were also helped by higher net interest receipts which grew to Pounds 866,000 (Pounds 286,000). During the year the group financed Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 23.7m) of capital expenditure from its strong positive cash flow and ended the financial year with no gearing and net cash of Pounds 13.45m (Pounds 124,000). Having completed its large capital investment programme, expenditure is likely to average About Pounds 12m a year in future. The group's core market in the UK is magazine printing which represents about 40 per cent of turnover. During the past year reduced advertising revenues and lower circulation figures have resulted in a contraction of the market with fewer and slimmer titles. Mr Gavron said this had inevitably affected both volumes and prices, 'we have the newest factories and the most modern equipment to serve this market, yet in spite of this our margins are still well below the levels we achieved in the 1980s.' COMMENT Having completed its huge capital investment programme St Ives now has some of the most advanced printing plants in the world which are running at about 75 per cent capacity because of the recession. The group's management has an excellent reputation within the industry and has managed to gain market share without undermining margins. With no gearing, net cash of Pounds 13m and a significantly reduced capital expenditure budget the group's balance sheet is also in good shape. Like most printing companies St Ives has high operational gearing which would allow it to benefit very quickly from any volume increase - although there are no signs of this yet. But even without any economic upturn pre-tax profits should increase to around Pounds 23m this year and earnings to about 15.9p per share. At current prices the stock is trading on a premium prospective p/e of about 17, but still looks good for the longer term. and for its plastic bags.</p>

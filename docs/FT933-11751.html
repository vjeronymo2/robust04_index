			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Survey of Resource Management - Buying-in Services (6): Strong emphasis on partnership - The Private Sector notably the federal government - which got the contracting-out bandwagon rolling; the private sector's enthusiasm for 'outsourcing' largely followed on. In the UK it has been the other way around. The private sector has been outsourcing for years. Local government began doing so with most of its existing in-house services in the late 1980s, at the dictat of central government. But Whitehall has only just started taking the medicine itself. Contracting-out trends in the private sector can be summarised under two headings: 'widening' and 'deepening'. The last decade has seen an intensification of the trend towards hiving off or buying-in of services not integral to a company's own line of business, widening the range of activities contracted out. A decade ago, it was mostly functions like catering and cleaning which attracted the contractors. Now, increasingly, it extends to services previously considered 'strategic', like computing and information technology; and also to those like telecommunications which were previously thought simple to manage in-house, but have become anything but that with new technology and growing competition. With diversification has come the second trend: the desire not just to hive-off services, but to franchise the management of the contractors, and to seek to bring in companies with know-how and state-of-the-art products to improve overall performance through their services in a particular area. In stark contrast to the motivation for contracting-out in the public sector, increasingly in the private sector the drive for improvement and collaboration is a higher priority than simple cost-savings. Helen Anderson, marketing manager for Data Sciences, a leading UK facilities management supplier to both sectors, says: 'The public sector tends to be more cost-oriented, whereas for companies increasingly that is not the main thing: they are looking for a contractor that can demonstrate partnership and bring something genuinely new to the table.' It is almost impossible to find a service from the boardroom to the basement which is not contracted out somewhere. Telecommunications, a new entrant to the 'outsourcing' market, exemplifies the trend. Traditionally, most large companies had their own internal private phone networks, while smaller ones simply paid the BT bill. But the cost of replacing private network equipment is rising steadily, life-cycles are falling as the range of available services multiplies, and competition in the telecoms market is intensifying by the month. Both Mercury and BT now have managed servicing units which provide and manage private networks. The management aspect was critical to BT securing one of its largest orders to date - a Pounds 5m contract to run and upgrade Thorn EMI's internal UK network. However, BT is not content with UK networks alone. In partnership with MCI, the second largest US carrier, it has just launched an ambitious venture - competing against a similar one unveiled a month earlier by AT&amp;T, the US giant - to offer a one-stop telecoms global outsourcing service to the world's transnationals. 'This is the shape of telecoms to come,' boasts Iain Vallance, BT's chairman. Exit the company which just makes sure the phones work. On the 'deepening' front, the market is growing for facilities management companies able to oversee a range of contracts. MR FELIPPO SARTI, a director of Symonds, an 115-strong facilities management company which manages 600 locations across the UK, says: 'The pressure is on to co-ordinate - it's no longer a case of one department hiving-off the cleaning and another the catering, companies want to integrate their outsourcing operation.' Recent Symonds contracts include a consulting service to establish Cable and Wireless's new London headquarters, a similar contract for BT's new customer systems office in Fleet, and a total management contract for the College of St Mark and St John in Plymouth. In a typical move for the market, Symonds has just been bought by Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French company which already has a large stake in local government contracts, to give it an entry into the UK's facilities management (FM) business. However, Mr Sarti is anxious to dispel the 'misconception' that FM companies 'will provide everything.' He says: 'We take a management-led approach, sub-contracting services - in many cases the majority - which we have no competence to provide directly ourselves.' The other aspect of 'deepening' coming to the fore is the search for a more reciprocal relationship with contractors. 'Business re-engineering is important, making sure that companies receive from us the IT which best meets their business needs,' says Mr Jerry Scott, marketing manager at Computing Services Corporation, a leading independent computing consultancy which claims to have the world's largest outsourcing contract - Dollars 3bn over 10 years for General Dynamics' IT and related business in the US. CSC's biggest UK contract of late is with British Home Stores (BhS), the retail group, part of which is to help BhS develop improved business models for their IT function. 'BhS believe that to make themselves a more competitive retailer they need an efficient supply chain management system, giving their suppliers direct sales information from BhS stores so that they can rectify deficiencies quicker, and so on. Our just is get them such a system - as well ads managing it when it is up-and-running,' says Mr Scott. A key contrast between the public and private sectors is that in the first private contractors are often bidding for contracts against an in-house team desperate to hang on; in the second, the decision to outsource is generally a corporate one, with no intention of continuing the service in-house. 'This makes the bidding process very different,' says Mr Scott. 'It affects the whole nature of the relationship, and explains why it tends to be less flexible with the public sector.' As local government moves to a second generation of private-sector contracts, it may lead the public sector's outsourcing towards the British Home Stores model.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / BSkyB chief may win Pounds 2m bonus: Prospectus for satellite TV flotation reveals sharp increase in dish subscriptions Mr Sam Chisholm, the chief executive of British Sky Broad casting, could receive up to Pounds 3m this year in salary and bonuses, the pathfinder prospectus for the satellite television venture revealed yesterday. In addition to his salary this year of about Pounds 340,000, Mr Chisholm, who is regarded as a key figure in turning around BSkyB, has received Pounds 732,000 based on 0.5 per cent of pre-tax profits in the 1993-94 financial year. Since June 1992 BSkyB has moved from an operating loss of Pounds 47m to an operating profit in the year to June of Pounds 170.1m. The document reveals that when the BSkyB share price is quoted, Pounds 7.5m will be distributed among 11 present and former managers as a one-off payment. Of the total, Pounds 3.8m will be paid to three current and proposed directors. Mr Chisholm is expected to receive more than half this total, possibly as much as Pounds 2m. The prospectus for the company's London and New York flotation also showed continuing growth in subscriptions. During the three months to the end of September this year, normally a quiet period for subscription growth, BSkyB added more than 162,000 new subscriptions through dish and cable networks, lifting the total to 3.65m. Mr Richard Brooke, BSkyB chief financial officer, said 'the relentless growth' was continuing despite the October price increase of Pounds 3 a month to all programme packages, taking the top price for all channels to Pounds 22.99 a month and increasing the basic service from Pounds 6.99 a month to Pounds 9.99. BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial Times, now has a 17.5 per cent stake, claimed the company had experienced 'no material change' in the rate of disconnections since the price increases were announced last August. In the past three years the annual rate of disconnections had been cut by more than half to its present figure of around 13 per cent. This compares with a so-called 'churn rate' experienced by some cable companies of between 30 and 35 per cent. BSkyB confirmed that the 20 per cent of the enlarged share capital which is to be floated is likely to be priced at between 233p and 268p valuing the company at between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.6bn. Net proceeds from the global offering based on a mid-point pricing would be around Pounds 810m although a new external bank loan will bring new money to Pounds 1.21bn. Lex, Page 20</p>

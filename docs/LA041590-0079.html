			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HER WORLD: WILD IDEAS ABOUT ADVENTURE TRAVEL  </P> <P> When I first answered the call of the wild, I was sure it would be a wrong  number.  </P> <P> The idea of long-distance hikes, with hot and heavy breathing, seemed vaguely  obscene. Naturally, there would be dust and bugs. I was not keen to reach out  and touch anything.  </P> <P> That is why adventure travel has exceeded my expectations. I expected nothing  but misery.  </P> <P> My first exploration was sailing east of Bali to call at islands along the  Indonesian archipelago. An early stop was Komodo, a hilly, arid knob that is  home to the giant black lizard called the Komodo dragon.  </P> <P> The ship's doctor said the hike would be rigorous and the temperature high. He  asked passengers to check with him before going. I figured that he would listen  to my tales of asthma and sunburn, and insist that I stay on board.  </P> <P> "The exercise will be good for you," he said with a laugh. "Come back when  you're 90 and we'll talk."  </P> <P> I gasped a lot on that steep trail, but I did not stumble. For five hours I  kept my eyes focused on the backs of the knees of a retired Caltech professor.  When I slowed down in the rubble of a dry riverbed, he called over his  shoulder: "Don't stop. It makes it tougher to get started again."  </P> <P> When we finally reached a clearing at the top, I collapsed in the shade of a  banyan tree and opened a sack lunch. But the view killed my appetite. A goat  carcass had been skewered on a spit near the edge of the bush.  </P> <P> Two Komodo dragons, each almost 10 feet long, soon came lumbering out. Golden  tongues flashed from monstrous heads. They tore into their meal with relish.  </P> <P> My photographer friends loved the action, even when a dragon charged our  circle. A native pelted it with sticks and rocks until it veered away.  </P> <P> Still, Komodo was the beginning of a healthy, rejuvenating trip. Long walks and  coral swims were part of each day; lectures, laughs and sea turtles were part  of moonlit nights.  </P> <P> On island after island, as far as the Asmat of New Guinea, I met some of the  kindest people I've ever known, certainly the kindest headhunters.  </P> <P> Since that summer I have continued to find the outdoor world accommodating --  from the High Sierra trails of Yosemite to the sandy banks of the Colorado  River. It may be soft adventure, if compared to scaling K-2, but it's hard  enough for me.  </P> <P> Among the lessons I've learned:  </P> <P> Don't sit at the front of a rubber shore boat. In a choppy sea, that position  gets the most splash. The boatman doesn't stand in the rear for nothing.  </P> <P> Exception: On a hot day of rafting through white water, the cold spray can be  as welcome as a broken fire hydrant to kids in a sizzling city.  </P> <P> Pack a rattail comb for hikes through cactus country. Balls of cholla cactus  jump at the chance to ride on your desert boots. If you flick them off, they  stick to your hand. Any comb will lift them away; a rattail gives a margin of  safety.  </P> <P> Carry a small mirror in self-defense. The woods are full of motes. If one gets  in your eye, it is maddening not to be able to see to remove it. A stranger's  finger is not the same. Nor is a friend's.  </P> <P> A mirror can be glued inside the crown of a hat or into a camera case. Clip-on  mirrors can be attached to penlights or lip balms.  </P> <P> Hard mints or chewing gum can help fight thirst. An apple is a classic  quencher.  </P> <P> For an August muleback trip I carried a canteen that fit into a large pocket or  attached with Velcro to a belt. It had a built-in plastic straw that you could  pull up with your teeth, leaving one hand for the reins.  </P> <P> Unless you've tested the earth as a mattress and found it comfortable, take an  inch-thick pad of foam rubber to put under a sleeping bag. You'll still be  roughing it, but your case won't seem terminal. My week of camping out in the  Grand Canyon would have been less grand without that cushion.  </P> <P> Part of the joy in adventure travel is the hand-in-hand exuberance of summer  camp. Tensions fade as high-powered adults focus on birds or volcanoes. Members  of gourmet food societies get caught comparing creamy peanut butter with  chunky.  </P> <P> Once, on a Mexican island near San Martin, I watched a male elephant seal haul  his gleaming 7,000-pound body out of the sea and onto the beach. Round, firm  females, weighing a ton apiece, rolled aside.  </P> <P> I admired their grace as I finished another chocolate-chip cookie. Maybe, I  mused in the noonday sun, just maybe, Charles Darwin was wrong. Maybe he meant  survival of the fattest.  </P></p>

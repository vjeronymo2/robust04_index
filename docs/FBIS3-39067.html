He added:    [Begin Karayalcin recording] Those who are our friends,  those who are our allies, if they want to continue with their  friendship and alliance with Turkey, this is their chance. They  must take it. They must decide to intervene on the Serbian  artillery positions in the hills around Sarajevo. They must end  this massacre. Turkey will assess this. It might assess it  today or in the future. If Turkey's friendship, the Turkish  people's friendship, is important for the Western forces, they  have an opportunity to show it. Let them show their friendship.  In turn, we will show our friendship. From now on, we will  display this determined stand regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina.  [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

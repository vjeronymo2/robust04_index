			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> 680 Workers Volunteer to Leave Xerox: Xerox Corp. said 680 employees nationwide  have joined a voluntary job cut program announced in March. Xerox spokesman  John Rasor said the voluntary reductions won't guarantee against future layoffs  but the company had predicted that only 250 to 350 would take advantage of the  program. In January, Xerox announced a $275-million streamlining program that  would cut 2,000 jobs. Company officials it had not been decided if the rest of  the job cuts would come through layoffs or voluntary retirements and  resignations. The company said the market for cheaper and medium-priced  electronic typewriters has shrunk much faster than expected, leaving the  industry with excess capacity.  </P></p>

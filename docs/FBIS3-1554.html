			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese top  legislator Qiao Shi said here today the signing of the agreement  on the joint development of Suzhou Industrial Park marks the  further enhancement of economic cooperation between China and  Singapore.    It is also of great significance to the expansion of the  Sino-Singaporean ties, he said, adding that "China is ready to  cooperate with Singapore and make the project a success."    Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese  National People's Congress (NPC), made these remarks during a  meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and Senior  Minister Lee Kuan Yew here this morning.    China and Singapore have enjoyed long-term traditional  friendship and are linked with deep-rooted cultural origins,  Qiao said. This provides favorable conditions for the two  countries to increase their cooperation.    In recent years, the bilateral ties of friendship in every  field have gained smooth development, with trade increasing  steadily and mutual investments expanding.    Recalling his trip to Singapore last July, Qiao said, "the  visit was short, but we learned a lot."    The delegation was impressed by Singapore's successful  experience in rapidly developing its economy with capital and  technology imported from the West, while retaining its own  oriental cultural features, Qiao said.    During today's meeting, Qiao briefed the guests on China's  economic development and economic legislation.    Prime Minister Goh told Qiao that he came here to  participate  in the signing of the agreement on the joint development of  Suzhou Industrial Park and was very pleased to meet Qiao again.    Though Singapore is to jointly develop with China the Suzhou  Industrial Park, its investment is not limited to Suzhou alone,  Goh said.    Citing its fruitful economic cooperation with China's  Shandong Province, Goh said Singapore would also like to have  active cooperation with other parts of China. He also expressed  his appreciation of China's rapid economic growth.    Earlier, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing met with Goh.    Referring to it as a major event in Sino-Singaporean  relations, Li said that the agreement on the joint development  of Suzhou Industrial Park bears significance even to China's  cooperation with other countries.    The park is open to the world and welcomes investors from  other countries to join in the project, Li noted.    With the support from the governments and leaders of the two  countries, Singapore is confident in the project's success, Goh  said.    Goh is scheduled to leave here for home this afternoon.</p>

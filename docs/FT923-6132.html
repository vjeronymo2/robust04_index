			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Bridon recovers to Pounds 0.7m but cuts interim BRIDON, the maker of rope and other engineered products, restored pre-tax profits to Pounds 700,000 in the first half of the year, but followed up the omission of its final dividend by halving the interim. Turnover remained flat at Pounds 162.5m (Pounds 161.6m), but Mr David Allday, chief executive, said the underlying trend showed a 5 per cent fall. Weakness persisted in all the group's main markets: construction, mining, fishing and offshore oil and gas. The pre-tax figure was a sevenfold improvement on last year's Pounds 100,000 and followed reduced exceptional costs of Pounds 500,000, compared with Pounds 2.7m, and interest charges of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2.3m). Trading profit fell to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 4.8m) after the main wire and wire rope division saw a slide to Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 3m). However, cost-cutting, including reducing the workforce from 5,400 in December 1990 to about 4,700 by last December, helped to restore profits compared with the second half of last year. Last year's final dividend was cut to 1.5p (5.5p) after the group plunged into pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.6m. Mr Allday said the interim dividend of 1.25p (2.5p) had been adjusted in line with last year's total reduction from 8p to 4p. The plan was to maintain the total at that level. This was in spite of believing that market conditions were getting tougher and that turnover might be down by about Pounds 10m in the second half. Some 45 per cent of Bridon's sales lie overseas, with the US accounting for nearly half. Losses increased at the US manufacturing subsidiary and the oil and gas-related distribution companies also had a poor six months. In terms of exports, the group was selling Pounds 1m of goods a month to dollar-related areas, but the slide in the currency could cost Pounds 2m this year in trading profit. At Dollars 2 to the pound, he said, the group had to consider whether the business was worth doing. In Italy, judicial investigations of corruption had led the construction industry to 'grind to a halt'. This was the biggest worry for the second half as interim trading results from Italy had turned from Pounds 150,000 profit to Pounds 250,000 loss. The trading profit breakdown showed the rationalised fibre products division  -mooring ropes and baler twine - more than doubling its contribution to Pounds 900,000; industrial textiles cutting losses to Pounds 100,000 and engineering making Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.7m), an improvement on last year's second half. Earnings per share increased to 1.3p (0.2p).</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / US executives face pay squeeze: White House seeks 'shared sacrifices' from business leaders PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON intends to propose not only increasing taxes on US corporations but also penalising more extravagant executive salaries. He told business leaders summoned to the White House yesterday, in paraphrase of Thomas Jefferson, that Americans were best at 'answering alarm bells in the night'. It was time, he said, for 'you to do your part'. The president has frequently spoken of the need for shared sacrifice to cut the federal budget deficit. He pointed yesterday to 'the enormously increased rate of executive compensation in the last 12 years', far in excess of average pay rises. Without disclosing details, he went on: 'I want to make a proposal that deals with the fact that the tax code should no longer subsidise excessive pay for chief executive and other high executives, excessive defined as unrelated to the productivity of the enterprise.' In last year's election campaign Mr Clinton spoke disparagingly of executive salaries of more than Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) a year against a background of corporate job losses. Yesterday he said higher taxes on executive incomes would have 'relatively small dollar impact but great significance to the American working people'. At a later press briefing, Mr George Stephanopoulos, White House communications director, confirmed that Mr Clinton is considering reducing the amount of executive pay that corporations can deduct from their taxes. Mr Stephanopoulos said the president 'would look to restrict that in some way, tying it to performance of the company'. The president specifically linked the tax increases on corporations and individuals, which he will address in general terms in next Wednesday's state of the union message and specifically in the budget due on March 23. 'I have also been persuaded by my treasury secretary that it is unwise, indeed impossible, to raise the individual income tax rate unless there is a corresponding increase in the corporation tax rate to avoid tax shifting,' he said. It has been assumed for some time that Mr Clinton would probably propose increasing the corporate tax rate from 34 to 36 per cent and the top rate on the wealthiest individuals (defined as families with an income of more than Dollars 200,000 a year) from 31 per cent to 36 per cent. Whatever the president proposes, any final decision on tax rates rests with Congress. Mr Clinton was careful to repeat another element of his economic plan: that the corporate tax system should be reformed 'to ensure that it rewards and encourages those who invest in productivity, in plant, equipment, research and development, in people who will create jobs and in the markets of tomorrow'. The economic stimulus package being worked on by the administration will almost certainly include bigger investment tax credits - in the Dollars 10bn to Dollars 15bn range - as well as specific public works programmes. Mr Clinton also urged his audience not to look to Congress to frustrate his proposed reforms. 'If the business community leads the way, Congress will follow. I need your help. I hope you'll be there,' he said. US consumer spending growth rate slows, Page 6 Message to the people, Page 6</p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Redland agrees European deals of Pounds 59m REDLAND, the building materials group which paid Pounds 624m in shares for Steetley last year, has raised Pounds 100m through disposals. It is reinvesting Pounds 58.6m in its continental European tile and brick activities. Redland is forming a joint venture with Koramic, a private Belgian company, encompassing the two companies' brick making in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. The new company will be the largest facing brick maker in continental Europe. Profits of the combined activities in 1992 would have been Pounds 15.9m, of which Redland's share would have been Pounds 5.8m. The 50:50 joint venture will own 70 per cent of the combined activities, giving Redland a 35 per cent economic interest but joint control. Redland will also receive Pounds 17.3m in cash. Redland is increasing its stake in Coverland, the French roof tile producer, from 43 per cent to 67 per cent by acquiring part of St Gobain's shareholding. Options for Redland to purchase St Gobain's remaining 33 per cent for Pounds 24m have been agreed. Redland and St Gobain are each subscribing Pounds 36m of new equity in Coverland to redeem Pounds 72m of debt, and Redland is paying St Gobain Pounds 12m. Coverland made a small operating loss in 1992 but had made Pounds 10m in 1990. Braas, Redland's German roof tile subsidiary, is buying Dan Tegl, the leading Danish clay tile maker for Pounds 10.6m. It made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4m in 1992. Mr Robert Napier, Redland's chief executive, said the disposals had been made on good terms in spite of current difficult market conditions. They are: Steetley Clay Tiles for Pounds 19m, against net assets of Pounds 17m, to Eternit Group of Belgium; Steetley Refractories which made a Pounds 1.4m pre-tax profit in 1992 to JE Baker of the US, for Pounds 14.3m. As well as the cash Redland has an agreement to supply raw material to Baker; Redland's 20 per cent stake in Lafarge Platreurope, a plasterboard maker, to Lafarge Coppee, its joint venture partner, for Pounds 41.25m; Construction Jean Bernard, a loss-making French civil engineering group for a nominal sum; Redland's 50 per cent stake in Columbia River Carbonates to its joint venture partner for Pounds 3.8m; Its Waco quarry business in Texas for Pounds 4.6m.

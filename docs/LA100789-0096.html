			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEBANON'S LONG CIVIL WAR HAS ROBBED BEIRUT'S CHILDREN OF THEIR YOUTH  </P> <P> Rima Torbay is 24. She never was a teen-ager.  </P> <P> "I was 11 years old when the war began," Torbay explained, recalling the  fighting that severed Beirut at the outset of the Lebanese conflict in 1975-76.  "We lived on the demarcation line. There the shooting never stopped, never in  all these years."  </P> <P> Life on the Green Line, as the informal boundary between the predominantly  Muslim west side of the city and the Christian east is known, spared no time  for the awakenings of adolescence among Torbay and her Christian companions.  </P> <P> "My friends died because of this war," she said dryly. "It was not easy to even  think of fun."  </P> <P> A lithe brunette, Torbay said she never had a boyfriend in her teen-age years,  never wondered what to do with her summers.  </P> <P> "We were pushed to an early maturity."  </P> <P> Torbay channeled her energies into her studies and her commitment to the  Christian cause. She is studying psychology at a Beirut university and working  on the headquarters staff of the Lebanese Forces, the Christian militia, which  she joined when she was 20.  </P> <P> "Under this war situation you get more" -- the French-speaking young woman  searched for a word in English -- "more force, more spirit."  </P> <P> Her militia office has become a study hall. Often she goes home only to sleep.  </P> <P> "I'm here 12 hours a day," she said. "It's an extra benefit because we have a  generator."  </P> <P> At home she usually studies by candlelight. Beirut's power station is producing  only two hours of electricity a day, and the timing is irregular.  </P> <P> "I passed my last exams under shelling at the campus," Torbay remarked.  </P> <P> A pile of textbooks sits to one side on her desk at the militia headquarters  where, when time permits, she works on her thesis, the study of a schizophrenic  child. Beirut itself is an open book for research into the mental health  effects of war.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of depression, a lot of very nervous people," said Torbay, who  insisted she has surmounted her fears, though she was chain-smoking and  repeatedly flipped a lock of brown hair from her forehead.  </P> <P> "In the shelling," she said, "you couldn't go outside, you never see the light.  For me it's become a habit. I don't care about death anymore.  </P> <P> "But I have a friend who has these panic attacks. She begins trembling, and  then just breaks into tears."  </P> <P> Psychologists are just beginning to assess the damage of war, Torbay said, but  they have no yardstick. There were no prewar studies of depression in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, researchers have found that the children of Beirut "are very  badly damaged," she told a reporter. In the midst of war, their street game is  playing soldier. They have become more independent, resisting parental  direction.  </P> <P> "The parents try to help," she observed. "They'll take their children out of  the shelling, up to the mountains, and explain to them the reasons for the  fighting so they can understand it realistically."  </P> <P> Some of Torbay's own childhood friends have fled Lebanon for good. She left  once herself, to school in Paris in 1978.  </P> <P> "But I simply couldn't stay there when I read of the shelling in Beirut," she  said. "I came home."  </P> <P> But not since she was 11, when war descended, has she been to the western half  of her native city.  </P></p>

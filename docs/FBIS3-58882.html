First there was an accusation against draft dodgers. Then  talk of new measures. Next came television programs on how well  the families of the martyred were treated by the state. And,  surprise, surprise, Turkey had to welcome a decision to freeze  all army discharges for at least three months. The latest  chapter in the story seems to be a motion in Parliament  demanding that some control be exerted over a tax-exempt army  enterprise which has been spreading its influence after each and  every coup.    These days, Ankara's agenda is full of a lot of rumors --  and  warnings at that.    There is word of great people in great seats talking  privately within the family. Telling tales of how for four  decades they have served the country. Complaining of political  vacuums which need to be filled. How much the country and  nation is in need of them and how difficult it would be to leave  their crucial positions at a time of massive crisis and when  Turkey's risks and the threats to her position are on the  increase. The warning is that such people may do much to stay  put, and that any criticism of them could be taken as a reason  for judgment "when the time comes."    This is a message. One which has been delivered and heard.    According to Gures, who heads a constitutional body whose  existence is based solely on the sacrifices of the devoted tax  payers, there are circles using the argument that "the army is  not taboo," to undermine the armed forces.    According to Yekta Gungor Ozden, the chief judge of the  Constitutional Court, "the army is not taboo." The obvious  question is who would know better in Turkey, a country run by a  constitution, than the head of the Constitutional Court?    Days after Gures' hard-hitting speeches on how dearly the  army wanted to stay out of politics, how some circles were  harping on about the fact that the army was not a taboo subject,  and how there were plots against the command center of the armed  forces, Turkey decided to freeze discharges of military  personnel. Little could be said against such a decision, with  so much talk around town.    Two weeks ago, the Mehmetcik Vakfi, a foundation to care for  soldiers and their families broadcast a program in which it  showed families of the martyred. All businessmen and  individuals were invited to donate. After all, these children  are indeed dying for their country. Those wounded deserve more  care and better treatment. Those who have been martyred need  their families to be cared for. And so on.    The program showed a youngish woman in a headband,  explaining  the good treatment she was getting. As a widow of martyred  soldier, she was getting approximately 100 dollars every three  months (about 35 dollars a month) as compensation.    On Dec. 20, under pressure from the Chief of Staff, the  government faced the task of taking the "absolute decision" to  extend military service. It froze the discharge of conscripts.  Then the bureaucracy started to work. Orders were written and  distributed.    All the time, not a single government official wanted to  take  the responsibility. All the time the ministers remained silent.  No one wanted to take the burden of having to announce such a  decision which would suddenly affect the life of about 540,000  soldiers and their families. Some two to three million human  beings.    Recently there have been reports that there is an increase  in  desertion from the army. The left-wing press especially, such  as the daily AYDINLIK and the pro-Kurdish OZGUR GUNDEM, are  playing the issue up. AYDINLIK is a newspaper which claims to  be devoted to labor and human rights. OZGUR GUNDEM is known by  all. The TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN], on the other hand, is a  newspaper known for its objective and precise reporting. Thus,  claims penned by AYDINLIK and OZGUR GUNDEM have been included in  TDN reports as "claims." But, when questioned on the TDN,  AYDINLIK and OZGUR GUNDEM reports on Tuesday, Chief of Staff  spokesman Col. Dogu Silahcioglu makes a statement. "It means  that the sources of bogus news have been activated as part of a  concerted plan," he boldly says.    Turkey shall indeed see who has the real plan and who is  truly caring for the country. Turkey shall see these very soon  for those with their plans will not be able to wait too long.  The storm is brewing.    On Wednesday, the TDN checked with the proper authorities on  the conditions of those serving the Turkish Armed Forces. We  wanted to know how the recent extension of military service is  to affect their lives--what, for instance, the tens of thousands  of soldiers whose service period have been extended will get in  return.    And the results...    The monthly salary paid to a Turkish private--and this is  for  real--is still 37,000 Turkish Liras. In other words, a Turkish  private gets approximately 2 dollars and a quarter every month  for protecting his country, risking his life on an hourly basis.  The monthly salary for a Turkish corporal is 57,000 liras and  the salary for a sergeant is 75,000 liras.    A Three month extension per soldier costs Turkey only about  111,000 liras in all. This excludes the accommodation and food  which, naturally enough, are free.    For 111,000 liras in today's Turkey (three months wages for  a  soldier), one can make many choices. In the three months, one  could make two taxi trips in the city (and short ones at that),  or buy six packs of Marlboro cigarettes, or even get two bottles  of Raki.    But, obviously soldiers neither need taxi trips, nor to  smoke  Marlboro or drink Raki. But with the 111,000 for three months,  they can't buy a ticket for the Ankara-Istanbul bus.    On Jan. 3, 1961--only seven months after the 1960 military  intervention--the Turkish Armed Forces created a new  institution. Its name is OYAK, standing for Army Mutual  Assistance Establishment (or fund).    OYAK was founded according to law number 205 and has  flourished incredibly rapidly over the past three decades  expanding more and more after each coup. 1971 was another  turning point for OYAK as was 1980.    Today, OYAK employs a labor force of approximately 25,000  and  is listed among the largest 500 companies in Turkey. It is also  a shareholder in eight major companies.    OYAK's current annual turnover is reported at 5 billion  dollars or seventy-five trillion liras. It is active in the  automotive sector, the cement industry, Turkey's petrochemical  industry, the food sector, electronics, agricultural chemicals,  service industries and banking. In the last days of 1993, OYAK,  acting along with its smaller shareholding Turkish investors,  bought a huge share of the Turk-Boston Bank.    Some claim that with this move, the Turkish Army is the  second army in the world, after that of Guatemala, to own a  bank. All the time, OYAK's aims were clearly cited in its  articles of foundation, of which one is clearly important: "In  order for members of the armed forces, who constitute a great  mass, to be forced into mutual assistance and solidarity with  the aim of guaranteeing a better future for themselves..."    Turkish commissioned officers and petty-officers are members  of OYAK. But the non-commissioned officers, who every month pay  OYAK contribution money, are not. They join the army, get a  salary, pay their share, which is five percent of their whole  salary, and are discharged. In return, they get none of the  OYAK benefits enjoyed by their superiors.    Petty-officers, who also pay OYAK part of their salaries,  number around 18,000 members of this fund-turned-enterprise.  But there is not a single petty-officer in OYAK's management.  Soldiers are not members of OYAK which has clearly become a  substantial economic force in Turkey.    And, privates, who die every day for their country, only get  two dollars and a quarter every month for their services.  Talking to an ex-general who has had much say on post-coup  developments last week, the TDN found him complaining bitterly.  "In our time," he says, "people would see military service as a  step towards manhood. Youngsters would be sent off as conscripts  with parades and ceremonies."    "Now the situation is different."    One of the chief characteristics of OYAK is that its  membership is made up of officers from the Turkish Armed Forces,  and technically it is a mutual-assistance fund. Officers,  whether they like it or not, pay 10 percent of their salaries to  this institution.    But OYAK does not like to share. It does not share its  income with the soldiers which are the mainstay of the Turkish  armed forces. It does not share with the non-commissioned  officers and it does not share with the "state" either.    The annual turnover of this "corporation," some 75 trillion  liras in total, is tax-exempt. In other words, OYAK does not  pay tax on its commercial activities.    There are strong laws and regulations which protect the  interests and immunity of the armed forces in Turkey. Thus any  criticism of this "taboo area," is regarded only as a deliberate  plot to lower the morale of the armed forces. The Turkish armed  forces, however, is made up of Turkish youngsters. Youngsters  who are there not for the two dollars and a quarter they earn  every month but for the honor of it. They are not there as  "professionals," looking at the job as an opportunity to get a  good salary and other benefits. Nor are they there to become  shareholders in a great economic enterprise. They are there to  serve their country.    Defending their rights is thus to defend the principle  rights  of the Turkish army. Because these people are human beings,  with families to care for and jobs to keep. And these people  are owed an explanation if they are to be asked to risk their  lives for even longer periods. Some explanation must be given.    Once the decision on freezing military discharges was  revealed, there arrived a "leak" of information to the Turkish  press. A leak that, along with this order, all retirement and  resignations from the armed forces had been frozen as well.  Later, it was formally announced that this was not true. But  the word was out and the denial had little meaning. For it was  made public that something of that sort could happen. The  Turkish public is thus prepared.    For instance, with the clashes in southeast Turkey  intensifying, Ankara could decide to upgrade the legal dimension  of the problem and adopt decisions for national mobilization,  extending the Emergency Rule throughout Turkey and even  declaring Martial Law or wartime conditions.    If and when this happens, then all "retirement and  resignations" from the armed forces could be stopped "until a  second order." Or indefinitely.    Thus, expectations for retirement in August of some high  level commanders would also be shelved.    This would, in other words, be the result of an escalation  in  tension. And not if the tension is diffused.    And just some footnotes, again without comment:    1. Gen. Dogan Gures, the Chief of Staff commander, will hold  his office up to the end of August. In fact in August this year  there will be a major change in the top echelons of the Turkish  military.    2. The government last year extended Gen. Dogan Gures's term  of office for a whole year according to a decree issued with the  authority of the cabinet.    3. The Constitutional Court, entrusted with the duty of  making sure that everything works in harmony with the 1982  constitution, abolished the authority by which Gures' term had  been extended.    4. Because the necessary application with regard to Gures  was  not made on time, despite the court ruling that the  reappointment was unconstitutional, the chief of staff remained  in situ.    Turkey is on a head-on collision course with Kurdish  separatists in the southeast and there is an immense buildup of  troops and weaponry in the region these days.    Some 40,000 troops out of the current 160,000 in the region  will not be discharged. Additional forces will be sent there  and the manpower will increase dramatically.    A military official said this week that the reason for  freezing military discharges was because troops could not be  transferred to the region from other parts of the country and  because a professionally trained force was needed.    Newspapers reported on Wednesday that in a recent clash with  the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] in the remote province of  Sirnak, two soldiers attached to the Turkish navy were killed.  They were based in Izmir with the Naval Forces Command.    They were martyred in Sirnak. Again Sabah's Zulfu Livaneli  reported the same day the plight of 700 teachers who were  recruited by the army.    In November 1993, they were invited to join the army as  privates but in the "teaching class," to aid educational  schemes. Their service terms were two months only. Thus,  leaving behind installment payments and in their own words,  "houses in a sorry state," they joined.    They joined for two months and they have now been told that  they are to serve for 15 months. But this was not all. They  joined the army as teachers.    And all aged between 28 to 35 among the 700 were taken aside  and told they were going to become commandos.    They are now to serve 15 months and serve as commando  soldiers fighting in the southeast. This alone shows how  desperate the situation has become and how many lives it is  affecting.    The next stage is probably to be an escalation along with a  freezing of all resignations and retirements for officers. But  no one yet knows what will come after that...</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Polish miners delay strike decision UNION LEADERS at Poland's KGHM copper-producing combine in Lubin are to wait until July 8 before deciding on whether to proceed with a general strike by the 40,000 employees. The decision came yesterday after talks in Warsaw at the end of last week with senior officials from the PSL farmers' party whose leader Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister designate, is attempting to form a government. Last week nine out of ten of the 70 per cent or so of the workers who took part in a referendum voted in favour of an all-out stoppage. Union leaders have evidently decided to wait to give Mr Pawlak a chance to form a government before pressing on with their demand for a 30 per cent wage increase. The increase would require an easing of prohibitive taxes that control wages in state sector industries and Mr Pawel Ofman, the KGHM's managing director has been quoted as saying that the issue is solely in the government's hands. The unions are arguing that agreements signed in 1989 with the then communist government promising miners twice the average wage in manufacturing industry still apply and this accounts for the 30 per cent wage rise demand. Should they succeed they could be followed by miners in the loss-making coal industry, who would demand rises and put pressure on the government to renew subsidies for their sector, which ended this year. Mr Ofman has said a day's strike would cost the combine 1,000 tonnes of copper, which brings a profit of USDollars 400 to Dollars 500 a tonne. Last year the combine produced 345,000 tonnes of copper, of which 241,000 tonnes were exported. The International Copper Study Group has cleared the way for Japan to join the producer-consumer forum by modifying its terms of reference, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. However, last week's inaugural meeting in Geneva, held under the auspices of the United Nation Conference on Trade and Development, failed to decide on a headquarters site or a secretary-general. The next meeting is planned for November in Santiago. The study group already has 18 member countries accounting for 61 per cent of world trade. Apart from Japan, the world's largest copper importer, Indonesia plans to join shortly and Zambia, the third largest producer, will soon take a decision on membership. These three countries would bring the group's coverage of world trade in copper to nearly 80 per cent. Lisbon, Santiago and Montreal have offered to host the group's headquarters. The three declared candidates for post of secretary-general are Mr George Coakley of the US Bureau of Mines, Mr Gunther Behrendt, in charge of non-ferrous metals in Germany's Economics Ministry, and Mr Francis Walter of France, who heads the finance ministry's industrial commodities section.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> TRITE AND TEDIOUS, 'ALL'S FAIR . . .' ISN'T  </P> <P> "All's Fair . . ." (at selected theaters) is such a dismal comedy that not even  Sally Kellerman's style and panache can salvage it. Kellerman plays the elegant  estranged wife of an obnoxious, military-minded candy manufacturer (George  Segal) who insists that his corporate staffers, armed with paint guns, join him  in war games every weekend as a test of their mettle.  </P> <P> When Kellerman learns that a young executive (Jennifer Edwards) is blocked from  a vice presidency because she's a woman and therefore effectively barred from  participating in the games, Kellerman rallies to her cause. Edwards rounds up  some women friends, and Kellerman hires a mercenary (Lou Ferrigno) to get them  in shape to declare war on Segal and his guys, including Robert Carradine as  Edwards' competition for the vice president slot.  </P> <P> A quartet of writers and director Rocky Lang create only tedium with their  protracted battle of the sexes. In such dire circumstances, only Kellerman is  able to make an impression. "All's Fair . . ." (rated PG-13 for language),  which has terrible sound and lighting, is really wretched business.

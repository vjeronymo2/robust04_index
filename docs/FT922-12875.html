			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: French brokers incur losses of FFr600m in 1991 FRANCE'S stockbrokers experienced yet another year of heavy losses in 1991 because of low turnover and intense competition, according to the Association Francaise des Societes de la Bourse. The latest figures from the AFSB suggest that the 55 French stockbroking firms made collective losses of FFr600m (Dollars 107.14m) last year. This represents a slight improvement on the total losses of FFr666m in 1990. All but a handful of France's stockbrokers, most of which are owned by the big French banks or by foreign securities groups, are losing money. Even the few profitable firms faced a difficult year in 1991. Cholet Dupont, for instance, the subsidiary of the Credit Lyonnais banking group, generally seen as one of the most successful players on the Paris stock market, disclosed last week that its net profits had fallen to FFr34m in 1991, from FFr51m in 1990. One problem of the French stock markets is poor liquidity. The power of the state - which continues to control large chunks of French industry and also the pension and savings system - means there is not only a shortage of tradable equity, but also of private sector investment. The market is also weakened by the large number of broking firms chasing the limited pool of business. A number of heavily loss-making brokers are supported by powerful parent companies, notably the French banks, thereby weakening the whole industry. Last year, the French brokers were spared any debacles as serious as the collapse of Tuffier, one of the most prominent Paris brokers, in 1990. However, many firms were forced to cut costs and shed staff in an attempt to stem losses. There were 480 job losses in French broking, as the workforce fell from 5,340 to 4,860. The outlook seems a little brighter, given that the French government's plans to sell off minority stakes in some state companies and to reform the pension system should help to alleviate the liquidity problem. The AFSB also advocates the abolition of the tax on share dealings.</p>

Commercial enterprises used to engage only in commodity  sales. But this kind of resource distribution was often  inefficient and failed to meet the demand in an increasingly  competitive market.    Since 1992 such enterprises have been experimenting with  annexing loss-making manufacturers and found that combining  commerce with industry works to restore profitability.    Many commercial establishments with solid financial standing  have opened their own factories, mostly through annexing  inefficient industrial operations.    The assets flow in the commercial sector helps expansion of  their businesses, creates a larger market share and brings in  more business.</p>

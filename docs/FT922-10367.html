			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: Renault chairman says Volvo merger possible MR Raymond Levy, chairman of Renault, the French state-owned car maker, said yesterday he could not exclude the possibility of a merger with Volvo of Sweden, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Mr Levy told a financial analysts conference he has been continually discussing with Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo chairman, ways of improving co-operation between the two carmakers. Their far-reaching alliance includes significant minority cross-shareholdings. Renault holds an 8.2 per cent stake in the Volvo parent company. Volvo in turn had a 20 per cent holding in the Renault parent company which includes the Renault car operations. The two companies have 45 per cent cross-holdings in their respective commercial vehicle operations, while Renault has a 25 per cent stake in the Volvo car business. There has been speculation the two groups might merge, and Mr Levy said that they were moving strongly in the direction of tightening their alliance. 'There may be a merger in future; I don't exclude that,' Mr Levy said. However, 'there may be some other ways to organise us,' he added. 'Both companies are completely prepared for any move of that sort; both have understood their real life is at stake,' he said. Renault is 80 per cent owned by the French state, and Mr Levy repeated earlier comments that a privatisation was possible. 'I'm not saying we're going to be privatised in the near future, but that may come,' he said. The two groups co-operate in purchasing and share some components. 'Little by little that co-operation is being intensified. We are now building up common product planning,' said Mr Levy. He denied reports of differences between Renault and the French government over its links with Volvo.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shi Jia (2514 0163): "Weekly Commentary on Current </F> Events"]    [Text] New Hope for Solution to the Korea Nuclear  Issue    U.S. President Clinton on 20 June said he saw "indications  of  hope" to avoid a conflict from erupting due to the DPRK nuclear  program. The U.S. Department of State announced that the United  States would be ready to start a third round of talks with the  DPRK as soon as the DPRK froze its nuclear program. On 22 June,  Clinton made another announcement: the United States would hold  a new round of talks with the DPRK in Geneva. Meanwhile, DPRK  President Kim Il-song proposed a summit between North and South  Korea, and ROK President Kim Yong-sam immediately responded to  his offer. Now the two sides are discussing arrangements for  the summit. All these developments indicate that the DPRK  nuclear issue, which has dragged on for several months, has now  arrived at an important turning point.    The basic approach to the settlement of the DPRK nuclear  issue is by holding dialogue rather than by exerting pressure.  Whenever it faces a new crisis, the United States always  resorts to such coercive means as exerting political pressure  and imposing economic sanctions. Such measures will not bring a  solution to the problem but will further aggravate the crisis.    Nowadays, as the Cold War has already ended, power politics  has become still more unpopular in the world. People of insight  in the United States, those in opposition or in office alike,  have spoken unfavorably of this practice. Former U.S. President  Carter, who makes nothing of hardship, has shuttled between  Pyongyang and Seoul and mediated between the DPRK and the United  States. His efforts have helped enhance mutual understanding  between all of the parties, eased the hostile atmosphere, and  paved the way for a political solution to the DPRK nuclear  issue. It is hoped that all the parties involved will keep  working in this direction, on an equal footing, and in a  realistic and calm attitude.  <H5>  Setback in the Reconciliation Process in Cambodia </H5>   After the Cambodia roundtable conference for peace and  national reconciliation in Phnom Penh broke down on 16 June, the  government of the Kingdom of Cambodia asked Democratic Kampuchea  [Khmer Rouge] to close its representative office in Phnom Penh.  All the staff of the Democratic Kampuchean representative  office left Phnom Penh on 20 June and returned to zones  controlled by Democratic Kampuchea via Bangkok. Meanwhile, the  battle has burst out again between government troops and  Democratic Kampuchean troops. The United States has sent two  military delegations to Cambodia and has agreed to consider  extending military aid to the Cambodian Government.    The bloody conflict between the two sides has already caused  severe losses in lives and property over the past several  months. Furthermore, wars have caused price hikes as well as  decreasing trade. Consequently, foreign investors are planning  to pull out, and the country's economic reconstruction process  will hardly be able to carry on smoothly. The Cambodian people,  who have endured untold suffering, are very worried about the  deteriorating situation. Even some government ministers object  to giving up efforts for a political settlement. To be sure,  there are still great obstacles in the way of national  reconciliation in Cambodia, but, after all, this is the only way  out for peace and reconstruction in this country. All the  parties concerned should set store by national interests and  return to the negotiating table.  <H5>  Why Does France Send Troops to Rwanda </H5>   At France's request, the Security Council, after several  days' of discussion, adopted a resolution on 22 June by 10 votes  with five abstentions, which authorizes France to dispatch a  2,000-strong force to Rwanda to protect civilians and refugees  threatened by war. French Minister of Defense Francois Leotard  later announced that France would start its military  intervention in Rwanda in the early morning of 23 June, with  2,500 servicemen, 500 military vehicles, and 40 airplanes sent  to the country.    So far, the war in Rwanda has caused several hundred  thousand  people to die and has left millions homeless. However, in view  of the failure of the peace-keeping mission in Somali, the West  is now extremely cautious about military intervention. France  has maintained close economic and military ties with the Rwandan  Government in recent years. France's purpose in sending troops  to Rwanda at this moment is to show people that "France is  playing an important role in Africa." The Organization of  African Unity summit recently adopted a resolution on Rwanda,  but some African countries which agreed to send troops to Rwanda  do not have the means to carry out the mission. This being the  case, the timing of the French mission is a well though out  decision. As France has limited resources and to minimize the  risk, France has called this mission a limited "humanitarian  rescue operation."</p>

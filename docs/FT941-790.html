			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / California defiant in unitary tax case California has a perfect constitutional right to reimpose unitary taxation tomorrow, the state's lawyers told the US Supreme Court yesterday as they defended their use of the controversial tax assessment method against Barclays Bank of the UK. 'Politically, would that happen? Probably not, but what we are dealing with is a political question,' said Mr Timothy Laddish, California's assistant attorney general. Under pressure from the Clinton administration, California's legislature last year stopped imposing its unitary tax system, which calculated tax on a proportion of a group's worldwide income, rather than just on income earned in the state. The case revolves around a contested tax assessment of Dollars 154,000, but interest and associated cases have raised the stakes for California to a total of Dollars 800m. In the Supreme Court yesterday, Mr Drew Days, the Clinton administration's solicitor general, argued unitary taxation might have become unconstitutional after 1985, because it conflicted with administration policy and thus prevented the federal government from speaking with one voice. But Mr Days said that in 1977, the year at issue in the case brought by Barclays against California, the government had expressed 'a preference, and not a policy'. Although Mr Days's arguments were meant to support California, Mr Laddish said that he was wrong: the unitary method was not only a 'user-friendly system of reasonable apportionment', it remained constitutional, because Congress had quite clearly refused to outlaw it. Judging by their questions yesterday - an uncertain indication of voting intentions - two of the nine Supreme Court justices appeared to incline towards Barclays, while four seemed to favour California.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: NEWBURY PARK;  </P> <P> LIQUID FOUND INSIDE DRAIN IS EXAMINED  </P> <P> Ventura County officials are testing a dark, oily liquid found in a storm drain  in Newbury Park to determine whether it is hazardous.  </P> <P> The substance found in the 1200 block of Rancho Conejo Boulevard appears to  contain a mixture of water and oil products, said Terry Gilday, technical  services manager of the county's environmental health division.  </P> <P> Results from tests on the sample are expected next week, he said.  </P> <P> A construction crew grading a field behind warehouses and assembly plants on  Rancho Conejo Boulevard discovered a pool of murky water while trying to  install a storm drain, said Bryan Tapking, a project manager for the Shappell  development firm, which is building more than 1,200 residences in the area.  </P> <P> The crew stopped work on the drain while county officials inspected the area.  </P> <P> A county environmental health inspector traced the liquid to a high-pressure  air compressor at Republic Fasteners, a company that manufactures parts for the  aerospace industry. The company's building is a few hundred feet from the  contaminated soil.  </P> <P> Gilday said the soil contamination did not extend beyond the area near the  drain. The material did not enter the Thousand Oaks sewer system. PSYCHE  PASCUAL  </P></p>

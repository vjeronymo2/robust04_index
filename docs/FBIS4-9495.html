			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Lyuben Berov met with Aleksandur  Tomov, leader of the Civil Alliance for the Republic [GOR], on  26 April and discussed with him the upcoming structural changes  in the government.    Aleksandur Tomov described the meeting as a normal and  routine meeting. He said that he opposes the attempt by certain  political forces to utilize the grave economic situation in the  country to put pressure on the government. According to  Aleksandur Tomov, to prevent the emergence of a vacuum in the  government and economic stagnation, the political forces must  reach a consensus on the issue of what changes are needed by  Lyuben Berov's government. The GOR has serious opinions on the  cabinet's economic team, but it will not participate in  political haggling over ministerial posts or propose ministers,  Aleksandur Tomov said.</p>

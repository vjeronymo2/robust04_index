Listed as one of the key provincial capital projects for the  1991-1995 period, the 137.5-km railway line which was completed  on Wednesday [19 January] runs from Weihai to Taocun in Yantai  City to join the province's trunk railway running from Yantai to  Jinan, capital of Shandong.    The whole project has cost more than 400 million yuan.    Since 1987 when Weihai was designated a city at the  prefectural level, Weihai has invested over three billion yuan  in constructing its infrastructure facilities.    Projects that have gone into operation include two highways  running from Weihai respectively to Qingdao and Yantai, the  first construction phase of an airport and a port able to  accommodate ships of 10,000 (dwt).</p>

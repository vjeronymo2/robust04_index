			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The whole day today, the government and the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] discussed the  accommodation of UNITA and its senior officials. The UNITA  negotiating team had been in Huambo last week, where it  consulted its leadership. However, it has brought nothing new  to Lusaka, since it is still demanding 1,100 houses. UNITA  wants houses in good condition and does not want to repair them.  The government has already told UNITA that it will provide  houses only for UNITA high officials. It is said that UNITA  needs only 300 houses, including houses for high officials, who  number less than 100. The government already has a well defined  position: Either UNITA accepts what is offered to it within the  government's capabilities, or nothing will be achieved. Today's  talks were lengthy and the negotiating teams did not reach any  agreement. Tomorrow, the negotiating teams will continue  discussing this issue of housing, in the presence of the  mediators and observers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 19 (YONHAP) -- International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors are continuing their activities  at the North Korean nuclear complex in Yongbyon and nuclear fuel  rods removed from the 5-megawatt reactor are being kept in the  area, it was reported Thursday [19 May].    Press reports that North Korea was not attempting to  separate  the spent nuclear fuel rods and preserve them for later  inspection have not been confirmed, sources said.    The information received from Yongbyon thus far is that the  inspection team has not encountered any problems, they added.    The inspectors would surely have raised this issue had North  Korea moved the fuel rods elsewhere or handled them in any other  way, they said.    "It appears that the spent fuel rods removed from the  reactor  are being kept in the area for later preservation and checks,"  one source said.    Since they are only part of the roughly 8,000 rods, it is  difficult to say what can be done about the situation, they  said, indicating that follow-up measures by the United States  and South Korea depend largely on the North's attitude.    Even though Pyongyang has removed some fuel rods from the  reactor, the issue will not be referred to the UN Security  Council if it cooperates with the IAEA inspectors, they added.</p>

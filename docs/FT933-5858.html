			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Ferruzzi's radical plan wins shareholder approval SHAREHOLDERS in Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), Italy's second biggest private sector company after Fiat, last night approved a radical capital restructuring as a means of grappling with group borrowings of L28,838bn (Pounds 12bn). The proposals involve a reduction in the nominal value of the shares to L5 from L1,000 and their consolidation on the basis of one new share for every 200 held. The plan was the central point in a stormy seven-hour annual meeting which also appointed a new board of directors. The share write-down, required under Italian law because of the size of Ferfin's losses, is the first step to a big rights issue, in which Ferfin's creditor banks are expected to swap part of their debts for equity. However, details of the rights issue are only likely to emerge once Ferfin's main creditor banks unveil their long-awaited restructuring plan for the group later this month. Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin's new chairman, said details of the rights would be given when the rescue had been approved. The restructuring is expected to include disposals of non-core activities and the rationalisation of many remaining operations. Ferfin's new board was reduced to just five members, with Mr Rossi as chairman and Mr Enrico Bondi, also brought in by the banks, as managing director. The three other members will represent creditor banks, the Ferruzzi family and small shareholders. This boardroom structure reflects the growing divisions that have emerged between the Ferruzzi family, which controls about 48 per cent of Ferfin, and the creditor banks now guiding its affairs. Separately, Price Waterhouse, the international accounting group which last week was banned by the Consob stock market and companies watchdog from auditing Ferfin's accounts, said it would appeal against the decision. Consob revoked Price Waterhouse's contract to audit Ferfin's books on the grounds that it had failed to discover grave irregularities in the accounts.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Germany seeks to join enlarged Security Council GERMANY yesterday offered itself as a candidate for a permanent seat in an enlarged United Nations Security Council, but in lukewarm terms falling short of an outright demand, writes Ian Davidson in New York. Debate has gathered momentum within the UN membership on the question of reforming and expanding the Security Council, which is currently dominated by the five permanent members: the US, UK, Russia, France and China, who hold their seats as a result of their victorious role in the second world war. The US administration has recommended Germany and Japan should become permanent members of the Security Council, but neither country has campaigned openly for a seat. Yesterday, in his address to the UN General Assembly, Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said only that 'Germany is prepared to assume responsibility as a permanent member of the Security Council'. But he hinted that Germany supported growing demands from developing countries that they too should gain representation on the council. 'We will only be able to maintain and strengthen the credibility of the council,' he said, 'if we also take into our consideration the growing importance of the third world'. China also urged yesterday that any reform should include fairer representation for developing countries. Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, told the General Assembly that 'the reform of the Security Council should take account of the principle of equitable geographic distribution and should accommodate the interests of the developing countries'. Japan has taken an even more cautious line than Germany in the debate on the reform of the council. In his speech to the UN General Assembly on Monday, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, acknowledged there was a 'need to expand the membership of the Security Council,' adding only that 'Japan intends to participate constructively in the discussions'. One reason for German and Japanese reticence is that both countries are inhibited, by the legacy of their roles in the second world war, from the use of military force overseas. This is widely seen as a serious handicap in the new era of expanded UN peacekeeping, in which the Security Council plays a key role. France proposed last night that states in arrears to the UN be penalised by imposition of market-rate interest on all late payments, Michael Littlejohns adds. In what appeared to be an allusion to President Bill Clinton's remarks this week, Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said one could not simultaneously speak of UN reform and be exempt from the 'primary burden of meeting the bills. It is high time to measure the generosity of words against the yardstick of arrears due to our organisation'.</p>

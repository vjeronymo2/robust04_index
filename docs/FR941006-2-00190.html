			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> Concept Papers Requesting a Package Grant Covering More Than One Project <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A separate preliminary budget for each component project of the package, as well as a combined budget that reflects the costs of the entire package, must be attached to the narrative. Each project budget must be identified by the title that corresponds to the narrative description of the project in the program narrative and a letter of the alphabet (i.e. A, B, C). Each of these budgets must include the estimates and information specified on Form E included in Appendix IV of this Guideline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 --> c. Concept Papers Requesting Accelerated Award of a Grant of Less than $40,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Applicants requesting a waiver of the application requirement and approval of a grant based on a concept paper under section VI.C., must attach to Form E (see Appendix IV) a budget narrative explaining the basis for each of the items listed, and whether the costs would be paid from grant funds or through a matching contribution or other sources. The budget narrative is not counted against the eight-page limit for the program narrative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Institute encourages concept paper applicants to attach letters of cooperation and support from the courts and related agencies that will be involved in or directly affected by the proposed project. Letters of support also may be sent under separate cover. How-ever, in order to ensure that there is sufficient time to bring them to the Board's attention, support letters sent under separate cover must be received no later than January 13, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Institute will not accept concept papers with program narratives exceeding the limits set in sections VI.A.2.a. and b. The page limit does not include the cover page, budget form, the budget narrative if required under section VI.A.3.c., and any letters of cooperation or endorsements. Additional material should not be attached unless it is essential to impart a clear understanding of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants submitting more than one concept paper may include material that would be identical in each concept paper in a cover letter, and incorporate that material by reference in each paper. The incorporated material will be counted against the eight-page limit for each paper. A copy of the cover letter should be attached to each copy of each concept paper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Sample concept papers from previous funding cycles are available from the Institute upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> B. Selection Criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1. All concept papers will be evaluated by the staff on the basis of the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The demonstration of need for the project;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The soundness and innovativeness of the approach described;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. The benefits to be derived from the project;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. The reasonableness of the proposed budget;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. The proposed project's relationship to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. The degree to which the findings, procedures,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training, technology, or other results of the project can be transferred to other jurisdictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. ``Single jurisdiction'' concept papers submitted pursuant to section II.C. will be rated on the proposed project's relation to one of the ``Special Interest'' categories set forth in section II.B., and on the special requirements listed in section II.C.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. In determining which concept papers will be selected for development into full applications, the Institute will also consider the availability of financial assistance from other sources for the project; the amount and nature (cash or in-kind) of the applicant's anticipated match; whether the applicant is a State court, a national court support or education organi-zation, a non-court unit of government, or another type of entity eligible to receive grants under the Institute's enabling legislation (see 42 U.S.C. 10705(b) (as amended) and section IV above); the extent to which the proposed project would also benefit the Federal courts or help the State courts enforce Federal constitutional and legislative requirements, and the level of appropriations available to the Institute in the current year and the amount expected to be available in succeeding fiscal years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> C. Review Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Concept papers will be reviewed competitively by the Board of Directors. Institute staff will prepare a narrative summary and a rating sheet assigning points for each relevant selection criterion for those concept papers which fall within the scope of the Institute's funding program and merit serious consideration by the Board. Staff will also prepare a list of those papers that, in the judgment of the Executive Director, propose projects that lie outside the scope of the Institute's funding program or are not likely to merit serious consideration by the Board. The narrative summaries, rating sheets, and list of non-reviewed papers will be presented to the Board for their review. Committees of the Board will review concept paper summaries within assigned program areas and prepare recommendations for the full Board. The full Board of Directors will then decide which concept paper applicants should be invited to submit formal applications for funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decision to invite an application is solely that of the Board of Directors. With regard to concept papers requesting a package grant, the Board retains discretion to invite an application including all, none, or selected portions of the package for possible funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board may waive the application requirement and approve a grant based on a concept paper for a project requiring less than $40,000, when the need for and benefits of the project are clear, and the methodology and budget require little additional explanation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the National </F> Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces, by  DEMOKRATSIYA Chief Editor Panayot Denev; place and date not  given]    [Text] [Denev] Mr. Dimitrov, will the SDS [Union of  Democratic Forces] give up its boycott of parliament?    [Dimitrov] There are no reasons to do this.    [Denev] Mr. Stefan Savov, chairman of the SDS parliamentary  group, and other members of the group have stated that the  boycott is a great mistake and only makes things easier for the  Communists....    [Dimitrov] The problem is that the answers are given on  different planes. If one is referring to slowing down  proceedings, to parliament not working particularly well, it is  true that this was achieved to a large degree, even previously.  In and of itself, the boycott does not slow down proceedings.  Nevertheless, in one way or another (slowly and with  difficulty, thanks to our deputies' efforts), the proceedings  have made progress. Now only 10 clauses of the bill on the  judiciary remain to be examined. Meanwhile, over 200 clauses of  this bill gave gone through, including some aimed at  uncontrolled recommunization, like Article 113. The same is  true in many other cases. There is no need to mention that  certain dangerous deadlines are drawing near. In the final  analysis, we are losing most battles, although we are succeeding  in delaying them. I cannot be elated that we have postponed the  next tragedy by one day. This is also tormenting our supporters.  We are postponing things, but they do not know until when, and  they ask themselves whether this state of affairs will not  continue until the end of this parliament's term. In other  words, they are beginning to suspect that we like this situation  and have no inclination to alter things.    [Denev] Nevertheless, why did you decide on the boycott and  what will you gain from it?    [Dimitrov] First, I would like to make one thing clear: No  political action, especially in the present situation, carries a  100-percent guarantee of being successful. Politics includes  risks, and they are great, especially now. It is childish to  demand cast- iron guarantees from anyone. The National Assembly  deputies should not demand this either, they should have an  excellent understanding of the complexity of the situation.    Now, about the boycott. The crisis in Bulgaria is a fact.  The Constitution has been violated. Because of the actions of  the majority, the public regards parliament as a negation of  parliamentarianism. The government is discredited, it has  received a vote of no confidence, and its policies are rejected  on a mass scale. Public opinion wants elections. Most of the  institutions favor elections. Even the Communists [Socialists]  at their congress found themselves obliged to issue a call for  elections (albeit in rather vague terms). On the other hand,  everyone apart from the SDS has his own secret designs: to  saturate public opinion with stories about elections, while  gradually slowing the ball down and exploiting the summer  vacation and the seasonal easing of the economic drama, in the  final event, to retain the present government or one similar to  it to carry on with the same policies that are so disastrous for  Bulgaria. Such a false mitigation of the crisis will have  ominous consequences, and we must not allow this to happen.    [Denev] Will the boycott help to achieve this?    [Dimitrov] The boycott is one of the ways. Parliament is  managing to pass some laws, but tension within it is increasing.  The Constitution is being violated every day because of the lack  of a quorum in the plenary hall. The majority is confused, and  processes of disintegration are under way within it. Certain  positions are being reassessed. The crisis continues to be  evident, and this compels them to seek solutions instead of  "mitigating" the situation. In other words, by itself, the  boycott is an inadequate means for forcing elections, but it is  our most effective method of ensuring that the facts of the  political crisis remain evident, of preventing it from being  glossed over and consequently gradually sharpening public  opinion, all the more because in this manner the SDS clearly  dissociates itself from the absurd conduct of this parliament  and makes its contribution to future elections.    [Denev] Is it not true that some of the laws that are  being passed in the meantime may cause great harm?    [Dimitrov] This is also a matter of opinion. Most of the  laws that the present parliament is considering were drafted by  the SDS government of SDS deputies. Now the majority is making  them dangerous by amending a small number of specific clauses.  In this way, they change the law into its opposite. Unless  elections are held, this parliament, with the present majority,  will inevitably adopt these laws -- a month earlier or a month  later. If we win the elections (and I personally believe that  we will have the best chance of doing so precisely now), these  clauses will be amended immediately, especially if, when the new  parliament is formed, we make slight changes to the National  Assembly's rules of procedure so that parliament can operate  more quickly.    [Denev] Why then, precisely, did you assume the  responsibility of suspending the boycott while the clauses of  the bill on the judiciary are being considered?    [Dimitrov] I think you are asking me this question in the  wrong way. We are not stopping the boycott. We declared at the  outset, and the SDS National Coordinating Council approved it by  vote, that we will enter the plenary hall on all occasions when  votes are taken that are connected with the fate of the  government and when the electoral law is debated. (I should  also say that we will take part then other acts connected with  the electoral law are being debated, such as the resolution on  personal files.) However, I insisted also including in the  formula that we will also enter the hall in the event of a gross  violation of constitutional order. This is the case with the  restrictions on magistrates and members of the Supreme Judicial  Council, which in practice exclude noncommunists from these  institutions. Under the Constitution, judges cannot be removed.  This means that they are now aiming to gain control of the  judicial system for years in the future. This differentiates  this bill from every other law. Of course, I have no particular  illusions about the parliamentary majority, despite the outright  condemnation of this law that is contained in the report of the  Council of Europe rapporteurs. Nevertheless, I would not want  the Communists to be able to hide their intentions precisely on  this issue. Since we will deal with these clauses in the bill  later, I do not intend to discuss them now, but I repeat: For  me, violation of constitutional law is the dividing line.    [Denev] Is it not strange that you, who were in fact against  the adoption of this Constitution, are now defending it?    [Dimitrov] The Constitution indeed has many shortcomings,  and recent events prove it. Under this Constitution, we cannot  even get rid of a government that received an outright vote of  no confidence. I very much hope that the next parliament will  make changes in the Constitution, which includes amending it in  accordance with the principles of the Turnovo Constitution,  which provides for a sensible division of powers. These  principles will have to be further elucidated, and I am ready to  discuss them separately. Otherwise, arbitrary rule is being  established in the state, and this means that any human right  may be violated with impunity. This has nothing in common with  democracy. We must fight against arbitrary rule by all means.</p>

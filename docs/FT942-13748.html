			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Indonesian workers turn on Chinese businessmen: Anger over low wages has led to ethnic riots Indonesian soldiers with semi-automatic weapons stood guard over factories outside the north Sumatran town of Medan yesterday following a week of wage strikes and demonstrations which degenerated into rioting against the ethnic Chinese minority. The government has restored order to Indonesia's fourth largest industrial centre by sending in troops, and by yesterday many factories and shops were operating normally. But evidence of the violence that has disrupted industry and worried both Indonesian and foreign investors is visible on the busy road between Medan and the port of Belawan. The windows of dozens of Chinese-owned shops and factories have been smashed and boarded up. Government buildings were left unscathed. In the most serious incident, an ethnic Chinese factory-owner was killed by the rioters last week. The ethnic Chinese account for only about 3 per cent of Indonesia's 188m people - although they are particularly numerous in Medan - but they dominate industry and commerce and are often envied by their local employees. Among the many damaged buildings are a food factory, a bank and a small photographic shop. 'We are still worried but we hope it's all over,' said one ethnic Chinese woman at the counter of a motor-cycle repair shop. In the violence about 150 shops and factories were reported damaged and several cars were set on fire; lawyers say at least 47 people are being detained. The dispute began when workers in Medan demonstrated in support of their demands for steep pay rises. The legal minimum wage in the city is 3,100 rupiah (Dollars 1.45) a day but employers often pay below the minimum. Some of the workers say they want Rp7,000. A 25-year-old woman working as a cleaner in one of Medan's gleaming, Chinese-owned shopping malls - which sell everything from jewellery to golf clubs - said she was paid Rp2,400 per day, with no benefits and no paid holiday, and would be content with the legal minimum; she asked to remain anonymous. Indonesia's influential armed forces have accused the independent Indonesian Welfare Labour Union of fomenting violence and vandalism, linked it to the banned communist movement and threatened to arrest its leaders; the rival, government-backed All Indonesia Workers Union denounced the strikes. The gap between rich and poor in Indonesia's fast-growing economy is one of the most sensitive topics in the country's politics. Whereas many Medan labourers live in shacks near the factories, the wealthier Chinese have become more ostentatious in recent years, building large, neo-classical houses and buying expensive cars. Only days ago, a senior official of Indonesia's ruling Golkar party criticised Mr Liem Sioe Liong, the ethnic Chinese tycoon who is close to President Suharto, for spending Dollars 650,000 on a lavish party in Singapore to celebrate his 50th wedding anniversary. The money would have been better spent on the poor, he said. The hard-working ethnic Chinese face a dilemma in Indonesia: if they invest abroad - in China for example - they are accused of disloyalty to their adopted home; but if they invest too much in Indonesia, they are accused of seeking too large a share of domestic business at the expense of the locals. As in other south-east Asian countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, the ethnic Chinese businessmen of Indonesia have been vital contributors to economic growth. The Indonesian economy is growing at more than 6 per cent a year. Workers in Medan know there are plenty of unemployed and underemployed Indonesians who could take their jobs, but they have seen the new houses and shops springing up in their town in the last few years and they want their share of Indonesia's newfound wealth. 'The people above us have got richer,' said the shopping mall cleaner, clutching a cheap plastic handbag. 'But where's the progress for labourers?'</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar closer to all-time low The dollar dropped nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark in heavy trading yesterday, undermined by fears that the US economy remains weak and that German monetary tightening has not yet run its course, writes James Blitz. The dollar's fall to a low of DM1.4570 in the European afternoon was triggered by poor US trade figures, which showed a May deficit of Dollars 7.2bn when one of around Dollars 6.5bn had been expected. The currency's decline was also part of a spiral of uncertainty that hit world markets yesterday as fears grew that the Bundesbank might raise the emergency Lombard rate in a further attempt to curb the M3 money supply. 'When the dollar's collapsing, stocks are sliding and gold is in demand, you've got to wonder if things aren't unravelling,' said Mr Ian Amstad, an economist at Banker's Trust in London. The dollar finally closed at DM1.4610, down from a previous close of DM1.4745. In late American trading it was softer again at DM1.4590. Sterling also dropped back on fears over German rates, closing at DM2.847 from a previous close of DM2.855. It only managed to ward off further losses because of a firming of rates in the sterling money markets, and perhaps a decision by one of the biggest UK building societies to raise its mortgage lending rate. By contrast, there was heavy investment in the Swiss franc, a traditional safe haven at times of difficulty, which closed at SFr0.896 against the D-Mark from a previous close of SFr0.898. The potential scale of dollar/D-Mark weakness is now the fundamental issue in the market after a fall of nearly four pfennigs for the dollar in the last five days. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips and Drew in London, says: 'There is potential here for a dollar crisis.' He believes that if the dollar is allowed to drop through its all time low of DM1.4450 without any intervention by the US authorities, it could have a downside as dramatic as the upside was in early 1985. 'If we get to the all-time low and there is no sign of anyone stopping the decline, there will be significant dollar losses.' Dealers will also be looking for signs of German intervention next week, above all in the Bundesbank's weekly money market operation on Wednesday. Although the Bundesbank pumped additional liquidity into the market yesterday to allay fears of another rate rise, dollar holders will not want to see call money rise any closer to the Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent. Otherwise they will assume that an emergency rate rise is imminent. The second important indicator will be the M3 money supply figure, the pole star of German monetary policy.</p>

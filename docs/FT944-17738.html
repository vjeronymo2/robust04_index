			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Japanese groups incur tax penalty Three Japanese trading companies have been ordered to pay penalty taxes totalling Y2.3bn (Dollars 23m) for failure to declare their incomes properly for the last three years. The Osaka Regional Taxation Bureau said Marubeni Corporation, Nissho Iwai Corporation and Sumitomo Corporation between them misrepresented corporate expenditures of Y4.9bn. The companies reported that sum to the bureau as commissions for hiring business consultants related to transactions with oil-producing countries. The bureau noted, however, that the figures were not related to individual deals, and concluded that the companies fabricated the commissions to lower their total incomes and evade paying corporate taxes. The commissions were not regarded as costs, but as social expenses or payments for unknown purposes. Marubeni failed to declare Y2.1bn, Nissho Iwai Y1.6bn and Sumitomo Y1.2bn. Penalty taxes of Y980m, Y770m and Y590m were imposed.</p>

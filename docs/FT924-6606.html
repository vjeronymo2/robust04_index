			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Mirror shares continue climb THE SHARE price of Mirror Group Newspapers continued its rise yesterday  - up 5p on the day to 84p - amid growing City enthusiasm for the management changes that ushered Mr David Montgomery in as chief executive. It is believed that more than 4m shares changed hands. The main boost appears to have come from hopes that a cheaper way can be found to modernise printing operations at the Daily Record and Sunday Mail, MGN's Scottish titles. Earlier this year the board agreed to a Pounds 70m investment to install new colour printing presses, stored for some time in a disused bus garage in Glasgow due to lack of funds. Mr Montgomery said last night: 'Everything is being reviewed. We have got to look at absolutely everything. Clearly there have been some hard decisions about tidying up the business and people have never had to cope with that in this company before. I sense that they are looking forward to it.' Meanwhile, Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, the administrator of Robert Maxwell Holdings, which holds 54 per cent of shares in MGN, revealed that he  -rather than the banks - was the prime mover behind the management changes. Immediately following the death of Mr Maxwell, Mr Talbot decided to strengthen management. 'I gradually formed that view and the chairman (Sir Robert Clark) also formed that view,' said Mr Talbot, adding that it is his duty to maximise the value of shares not just for the banks but for all creditors. Mr Talbot and Sir Robert felt new management would more likely take radical measures to cut costs and increase profitability than the existing team. Talks have been held between Mr Montgomery and Lord Hollick, chief executive of MAI, about the possibility of a takeover. They continued after the administrator ruled out an early sale.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Saviour of Serbs forced to try to save himself: Beleaguered Milosevic is abandoning the militant nationalists he promoted SERBIA'S president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, is trying to stave off mounting opposition within his republic by turning his back on the militant nationalists who fought his war by proxy. In doing so, the politician who built his career as the saviour of all Serbs - wherever they lived - has turned inwards to Serbia itself. He now condemns as a warmonger Mr Milan Babic, the leader of Krajina, the self-proclaimed Serbian republic and enclave in Croatia. But no mention is made of the fact that the war was waged on the pretext of saving Croatia's Serbs in what was termed a hostile state. The dispute with Mr Babic highlights the change in Mr Milosevic's tactics, a change dictated partly by economic reasons. Faced with the expense of the war, and financing the federal army, Mr Milosevic last month dropped the idea of uniting all Serbs in one state. It appears to be only a question of time before he calls for an independent Serbia, abandoning the idea of salvaging a Yugoslav federation. In addition, Serbia's ruling Socialists, instead of co-opting the opposition, marginalised it during the seven-month war through their tight grip over the media. Any party or activists in the anti-war movement were denounced as traitors. However, resistance to forced mobilisation in Serbia, and western pressure, contributed to Mr Milosevic's shift in policy. Now promoting himself as the man of peace, he is trying to bring the militant nationalist elements to heel. But even if he succeeds in this, it will not lessen the price of the war borne by Serbia. On the home front, Mr Milosevic has to contend with rising dissatisfaction over the economy. The government has frozen the price of some staples but the average monthly wage equivalent to about Dollars 80 barely covers essentials. The official inflation rate of 3,000 per cent is believed by economists in Belgrade to be well below the actual figure. Industrial output has fallen by at least 30 per cent in relation to last year's already low output. These indications are important for Mr Milosevic's political base which is anchored in the economy, as many key factory directors were appointed after he came to power in 1987. The question now is whether he can maintain control of a republic confronting imminent economic collapse. His call for peace in January temporarily silenced the opposition. But now, this unpredictable leader faces an economically devastated and war-weary Serbia. More importantly, many people are asking what the war gained. Says Mr Dragoljub Micunovic, president of the opposition Democratic Party: 'Serbia could have been where it is now (on the verge of independence), without the victims of war'. Yesterday, in just three hours, more than 2,000 people signed a petition sponsored by the Democratic Party demanding Mr Milosevic's resignation. The Serbian Renewal Movement, under Mr Vuk Draskovic, has supported this initiative, and called a rally on March 9 - anniversary of the suppression of anti-government demonstrations - to press for the Serbian president to quit. The stakes are high for Mr Milosevic and March could be his most crucial month.</p>

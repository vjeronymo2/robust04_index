			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Big enough to deliver - small enough to care Sir, I read the editorial 'England's local shambles' (August 25) with great interest. It is sad that the British trait of resistance to change at all costs once again rears its head. As an employee of local government at county and district level for many years, I am all too aware of the shortcomings of the present two-tier system that breeds inefficiency, lack of accountability and duplication of service provision. This system does not best serve the needs of our customers - the council tax and business rate payers. The opportunity was missed in 1974 to dispatch this archaic system to the history books, primarily as a result of political desire to retain control through the shire counties. If the opportunity to introduce unitary authorities is again squandered, then the public who pay the cost cannot subsequently complain if these inefficiencies continue. Most of the businesses with which I deal are aware of the frustrations and inconsistencies that result from the need to negotiate their way around two authorities, whether they wish to seek financial support, achieve planning permission, require information on current legislation or avoid falling foul of conditions and constraints imposed differently at county and district level. They see the way local decisions and local accountability works in the US and Europe, and often seek to invest overseas rather than become trapped amid this confusion. In all situations the cost of change is easily quantifiable and the potential financial benefit can only be a projection. To use that as an argument not to make progress and introduce change would have resulted in the retention of mud huts, bows and arrows, and horses as a means of transport. Let us grasp the nettle and introduce a unitary system of local government that is efficient and serves the needs of the people who pay the bills.

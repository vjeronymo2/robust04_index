			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Books: Masters of the ham and knuckle sandwich WASTED YEARS by John Harvey Viking Pounds 14.99/Pounds 8.99, 274 pages A COUNTRY OF OLD MEN by Joseph Hansen No Exit Press Pounds 4.99, 177 pages THE DANGEROUS EDGE by Lesley Grant-Adamson Faber Pounds 14.95, 330 pages A SHRED OF HONOUR by J K MayoHarvill Pounds 14.99, 256 pages THE FIXED boundaries of detective fiction and espionage thrillers are secure and reassuring - hence both their mass-market popularity and their critical relegation. Even the better practitioners, from Hammett to Simenon to early Le Carre, are often discussed with respectful irony and damned with faint praise. John Harvey's hard-boiled police procedural Wasted Years is genre-busting crime fiction at its best. Harvey is either an important novelist who happens to use this form or, more likely, a very good genre novelist whose wider ambitions stretch this format. Harvey obeys the discrete rules of this generic type - for example, puzzle-setting - but also transcends them. His method is take a character - Charlie Resnick, a morose Nottingham detective inspector - and go along with him into situations that take him to the end of his tether. The plot concerns nearly-forgotten violence which has left some nasty unfinished police business, a spate of armed robberies, and Resnick's broken marriage. In spite of the flashbacks, between 1969, 1981 and the recent past, it is an excellent read, with brisk narrative breezes blowing refreshingly through the twisted recesses of this heart-searching cop's past. Resnick makes Inspector Morse seem jaunty, but then again he has a lot to be despondent about: his personal life consists of watching Notts County football team and listening to jazz records with only four cats for company; his working life has seen an erosion of respect for the law. Resnick cheers himself up by making outstanding sandwiches - not making but building: 'thin slices of Gruyere cheese, slices of smoked ham, halved black olives, onion, several pieces of sun-dried tomato and, finally, some crumblings of blue Stilton on top of two thick slices of light rye bread.' We readers do not need cheering up, however, as this is superb stuff - the book,that is, not the sandwich. Dave Brandstetter's LA patch is far from Harvey's nervy British provincial city. Private dick Brandstetter is the ageing creation of Joseph Hansen, and this is, in fact, the final Brandstetter mystery. But it is still a good enough place to start for new readers, a spare and stylish whodunnit set in sun-drenched, gentrified southern California. Brandstetter is a blond and blue-eyed veteran; a furtive smoker; another gourmet, though not of sandwiches - he even owns a good restaurant; he drinks malt scotch; and is, unusually for a sleuth, homosexual. Hansen's tone is cool and determinedly restrained, the better to evoke Dave's low-key integrity, so much so that a sudden elegiac paragraph about marshland lost to the city seems merely 'literary' guff from an accomplished writer of popular fiction who wants to be taken seriously. This tiny, preening aberration aside, Brandstetter's last case is a fine yarn of drug dealers, failed rock musicians, child abuse and dishonest local politics - especially at only a fiver. The Dangerous Edge is a spy story told by a woman in a field where it is generally gentlemen who prefer Bonds. Why was journalist John Blair shot? Why was he in Spain? Is it anything to do with that old East German agent now hanging round Prague? Search me, chum: ask Lesley Grant-Adamson. This is is a suspenseful, complex book, part thriller, part crime novel, converging on post-Velvet Revolution Prague. More labyrinthine plotting in JK Mayo's A Shred Of Honour. Witty, elegant, humane, Mayo is, like John Harvey, a 'real' writer dressed in genre clothing and making the snobbish distinction redundant. A cache of British chemical-biological-radiological weaponry has been stolen from the Gulf theatre of war and sent into the Nubian desert by forces unknown. As the caravan makes its way through Sudan, crumpled, likeably cynical military intelligence agent Harry Seddall plays his hunches about who did it and why. What is distinctive about Seddall's milieu is that the spies are vital, amusing and brilliant people, completely unlike Le Carres weary bureaucrats. The plot-twists are amazing yet not far-fetched. The book lodges in the memory because of Mayo's objective treatment of ruthlessness. All this plus more sandwiches, though sometimes of the knuckle variety.</p>

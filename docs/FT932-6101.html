			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Books: A happy mischief-maker - FT Children's Book of the Month THE BOGGART by Susan Cooper Bodley Head Pounds 8.99, 182 pages BOGGART GOES by many different names, depending upon which dank, dark corner of the British Isles you happen to inhabit. In the Isle of Man he is known as a Buggane; in parts of Scotland other than the one in which the opening chapters of this book are set, he might be referred to as a Bogle. Two characteristics of his character remain constant, however, no matter where he happens to live: he is an invisible creature that haunts particular places; and he is essentially a mischief-working thing, not one of the devil's darker representatives upon this earth. He is a games-player, a trickster, given to japes and tomfoolery; a creature with a talent, if not an instinct, for happy, meaningless mischief. Susan Cooper is best known for a quintet of novels known collectively as the The Dark Is Rising sequence which were amongst the finest achievements of children's literature in the 1980s. In these books she made a thoroughgoing imaginative investigation of many of the myths and legends of the British Isles, and also set herself the task of attempting to define the very substance of myth - the timeless battle between good and evil, light and dark, for example - within the wider context of a multi-faceted examination of the history of Britain itself. In a sense her new novel The Boggart is picking away at some of the same rich seams; but it is also, significantly differently, drawing our attention to the way in which there are quite as many unfathomable mysteries in our 'technological' present as there have ever been in the so-called 'primitive' past. The Boggart opens with a delightfully doleful piece of scene-setting in the Western Isles of Scotland, melancholy as any random skirl of the pipes. A lonely boggart, attendant for millennia upon the MacDevons of Castle Keep, witnesses the death of the last scion of the old family. Accustomed to making his mischief down the centuries in the peaceable fortress of Castle Keep and having no knowledge of the present, the boggart is innocently unaware of the fact that the world of the present day has effectively driven out the Old Things, burying the wild magic beneath layers of reason and time . . . Then everything changes - utterly. The MacDevons' nearest surviving relative proves to be a Canadian theatre director of Estonian origins. The family of four (which includes two children, Emily and Jessup) pays a brief visit to Castle Keep to claim their inheritance, taking the boggart back to Toronto with them by accident . . . the boggart wreaks havoc in the Canadian present, causing mayhem in the family's antiques shop, and ruining its Hallowe'en celebrations. Matters take a darker turn still when Emily's mother invites the ethically dubious Dr Stigmore to investigate whether her daughter might not be to blame in some way, being of a sensitive age. The doctor concludes that, as an emotionally disturbed adolescent, she shows every sign of having fallen prey to emotions that are classical links with poltergeist phenomena such as they are now witnessing. The boggart, slandered, persecuted, misunderstood, finally decides to take refuge in Jessup's computer, from where he communicates with the children by a piece of unintelligible gibberish that proves to be not the evidence of a virus attacking the programme but a phrase in Gaelic (recognised by one of the theatre's principal actors, a Celt himself), which means: 'I want to go to my own country'. And so he returns, down the line. The introduction of the supernatural into children's books, in whatever shape or form, can often induce a sense of world weariness in the reader. It can be an excuse for covert preaching (as in the case of CS Lewis) or, at the opposite extreme, a species of spurious light entertainment. Seldom does its evocation remain faithful to the spirit of what is known to be true of the beliefs of both past and present; and, incidentally, seldom has a book succeeded in reminding us that there are just as many superstitions and bizarre hopes linked to the possibilities of the computer terminal as there have ever been to the book of Common Prayer.</p>

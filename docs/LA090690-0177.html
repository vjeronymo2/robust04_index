			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: MORE EATERIES:  </P> <P> King Neptune's Seafood Restaurant and Nautical Museum, 17115 Pacific Coast  Highway, Sunset Beach.  </P> <P> Open daily 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Dinners are served after 5. (213) 592-4878.  Started as a place for the ex-Marine owner to display his huge collection of  nautical/military artifacts, this bar-restaurant-museum is one of the least  pretentious, and most bizarre, places in Orange County or maybe anywhere. Basic  seafood, like the ambience, comes in generous portions. KENT ZELAS  </P></p>

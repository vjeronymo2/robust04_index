			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Greenspan moves to allay fears over US inflation Jitters in financial markets about higher US inflation were overdone, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, indicated yesterday. He said further increases in US short-term interest rates were likely this year as the Fed returned US monetary policy to a more 'neutral' stance, but the tone of his remarks to Congress suggested another move was unlikely in the immediate future. Mr Greenspan said recent increases in the prices of some commodities and manufactured goods probably reflected the strength of industrial orders and production and should not be seen as evidence that inflation was accelerating. His comments about inflation were intended to reassure bond market investors, who have become apprehensive about inflation prospects following the Fed's decision on February 4 to raise short-term interest rates by a quarter of a point to 3 1/4 per cent. Long bond yields have risen sharply to well over 6.5 per cent on the assumption that the Fed would not have acted as it did if inflation were not a threat. Yesterday, Wall Street was mildly encouraged by his remarks. Long bonds showed moderate gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 24.20 higher at 3,911.66. Delivering his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins monetary report to Congress, Mr Greenspan sought to place the Fed's February 4 decision in a longer-term perspective. The Fed was gradually tightening monetary policy not because inflation posed an immediate threat but to prevent it getting out of control in 1995 and 1996, he said. The abnormally low interest rates of recent years were no longer justified because debt burdens were sharply reduced and the economy growing vigorously. 'To promote sustainable growth, history suggests that real short-term rates are more likely to have to rise than fall from here.' Mr Greenspan added that he hoped any increase in real short-term rates could be achieved in part through a further decline in inflation expectations. He said the Fed was no longer putting much faith in monetary aggregates as a guide to policy. He surprised some members of Congress by arguing that the gold price was a reliable guide to future inflation prospects, along with exchange rates and the interest rate yield curve. He forecast economic growth of 3 per cent or slightly more this year. Inflation would be about 3 per cent this year, fractionally higher than last year. The long-term economic outlook remained the best in decades. Greenspan soothes fears, Page 6 Government bonds, Page 33 Currencies, Page 35 World stocks, Page 41 London stocks, Page 44</p>

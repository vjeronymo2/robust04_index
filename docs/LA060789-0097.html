			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> AT&amp;T DENIES PARTNERSHIP WITH NINTENDO  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. denied reports Tuesday that it has  reached a partnership agreement with Nintendo Co., the Japanese video game  manufacturer, to provide consumers with a variety of information services.  </P> <P> An AT&amp;T spokesman insisted that discussions with Nintendo have been limited  to normal business contacts between a vendor and a potential customer. He said  that while AT&amp;T would be happy to have Nintendo as a customer, there has  been no agreement on joint development or marketing of any new services.  </P> <P> Nintendo said in a prepared statement that while no "concrete agreements" had  been reached, the company "feels very positively about its discussions with  AT&amp;T in the evolution of communications network technologies." The  statement went on to note that AT&amp;T "is currently prohibited from entering  into arrangements involving the development of electronic information services"  under the terms of a court order due to expire in August.  </P> <P> The Times reported Monday and the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that  AT&amp;T and Nintendo would work together to develop a new electronic  information service.  </P> <P> Nintendo, which revolutionized the video game business with a computer-driven  box that plays specially designed games, has indicated that it wants to tap the  capabilities of the 19 million Nintendo devices now in American homes. The  book-size boxes could easily be combined with a television to provide  computerized access to information services such as stock prices, home shopping  services or travel information networks.  </P></p>

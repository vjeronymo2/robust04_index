			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Two leading US retail names beat dollar funding targets Two top US retail names tapped the Eurobond market yesterday in arbitrage-driven transactions which enabled both issuers to beat their dollar funding targets by a comfortable margin. A three-year Dollars 200m zero-coupon offering from Merck, the big US pharmaceutical group, was designed to appeal to distressed holders of floating-rate notes structured with minimum and maximum coupons. This market has virtually collapsed in value in recent months due to the volatile interest rate environment. Lead manager JP Morgan said Merck's bonds offered these investors, mainly from Switzerland and the Benelux region, a way to recoup their capital. Mr Doug Rees, Merck's financing director, said the proceeds were swapped into floating-rate dollars at a rate well below its normal US commercial paper borrowing level. Syndicate managers estimated that Merck had made a saving of around 20 basis points. JP Morgan said about half the deal had been placed yesterday, though it bought back around Dollars 30m worth of paper. When the bonds were freed to trade, they rose to 82.82 from a re-offer price of 82.765. However, other houses reported slower than expected sales, which suggested that the aggressive pricing of 8 basis points below the US Treasury strip yield curve had put off investors not caught in the so-called 'mini-max' trap. AT&amp;T also made a considerable saving, thought to be around 10 basis points compared with its dollar funding levels, when it swapped the proceeds of its Ecu150m four-year eurobond issue into dollars. SBC said the Ecu's good performance against the D-Mark had prompted the issuer to pick that currency for its first non-dollar eurobond. AT&amp;T had also considered lire, Canadian dollars and D-Marks. The European Community is expected to tap the Ecu sector later this week, raising Ecu300m through an offering of seven-year eurobonds. The yield on the bonds is likely to substantially less than the French government's 10 per cent Ecu bonds due 2001. Federal Home Loans Bank System is also due to raise Dollars 1bn through its offering of two-year global bonds later this week, via Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley. Elsewhere, Salomon Brothers, on behalf of the UK Treasury, said the following privatised companies had repurchased their bonds offered in a sale held yesterday: British Telecom, London Electricity, Manweb, National Power, Scottish Hydro and Seeboard. In addition, SG Warburg Securities has been appointed to sell a Pounds 37m Manweb bond due 2008. The total proceeds received by the Treasury will amount to around Pounds 1.3bn while total proceeds from the sale of debt in privatised companies this year will be some Pounds 1.8bn. National Power said the repurchase would result in a charge to its profits of Pounds 29.5m, which will be reported as an exceptional item in the current financial year. Scottish Hydro is to charge about Pounds 18.8m against current year pre-tax profits.</p>

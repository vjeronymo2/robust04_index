			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Van Diemen's Land The Van Diemen's Land Company, the Australian pastoral company, has applied to the London Stock Exchange to cancel the listing of its ordinary shares with effect from 8.30am on November 14. The move comes as a result of VDL's long-standing non-compliance with the rule that requires more than 25 per cent of the share capital to be in public hands. Tasman Agriculture, VDL's majority shareholder, is to make the minority shareholders a cash offer for their shares following the delisting. The directors of VDL will then announce details of a rights issue to finance development of the Woolnorth farming assets.</p>

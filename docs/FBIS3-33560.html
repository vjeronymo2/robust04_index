			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Manuel Camacho Solis, Mexican national </F> commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, at San  Cristobal de las Casas Casthedral, San Cristobal de las Casas on  24 February -- recorded]    [Text] You have been following these negotiations very  closely. Things are moving appropriately. We have already agreed  on 50 percent of the issues presented to us today.    In this, we not only see the opportunity to satisfactorily  answer the demands but it is also an opportunity to produce a  broad affinity on the agreements for a political solution to the  Chiapas conflict and on the peace agreements.    Today is Mexico's Flag Day. Today's Flag Day celebration in  San Cristobal de las Casas has special significance for the  negotiations. The Mexican flag allows us to:    1. Maintain and defend Mexico's territorial integrity.    2. Resolve the Chiapas conflict in Mexican territory.    3. Search for dialogue instead of confrontations because we  trust Mexico and in its future.    4. It is necessary we reach agreements and respect each  other to build a better fatherland.    This is what I had to say today. Thank you for being here.  You are very kind.</p>

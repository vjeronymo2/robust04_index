			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Leading Article: From conflict to co-operation MR JACQUES Delors told the European Parliament yesterday that 'the very idea of a united Europe is in peril'. He was right. The European Community's economic malaise is undermining its political credibility. Many belabour the UK for 'competitive devaluation', or 'Anglo-Saxon circles' for undermining chances of economic and monetary union. This search for scapegoats is more than a pity; it is a mistake. Mr Delors rightly argues for a co-operative solution to Europe's economic problems. The difficulty has been that sensible co-operative solutions have not been on offer. On the contrary, those co-operative solutions that have been offered - the European Monetary System, as it operated between German unification and September of last year, for example - have made things worse, a possibility Mr Delors does not recognise. Nothing can be less appealing than defending the policies of the present government of the UK. Even so, it cannot be credibly criticised for whimsical resort to beggar-my-neighbour policies, as some do, however upsetting to other EC member states has been the manner of their implementation. UK gross domestic product contracted by more than 4 per cent between the second quarter of 1990 and the third quarter of last year. The UK also ran a trade deficit with the rest of the European Community of Ecu8.5bn (Pounds 6.3bn) in 1992, larger than that of any other EC member country, bar Spain, while, its overall current account deficit was Pounds 11.8bn (2 per cent of GDP). Against so grim a background, even a devaluation of 16 per cent cannot be viewed as predatory, whether or not it turns out to be a 'dead end', as the French prime minister has argued. No country can owe either exchange rate overvaluation or never-ending recession to its trading partners. Sterling was forced out of the ERM because its parity proved incompatible with economic recovery. It is for the same reason that the much-condemned speculators have doubted other parities within the system. What made these parities inconsistent with tolerable economic performance was German economic policy, on the one hand, and the determination to eschew a degree of exchange rate flexibility, on the other. It is peculiar, therefore, for leading figures in German politics, largely responsible for the former, and leading figures in French politics, principally responsible for the latter, to blame the consequences of those decisions on speculators, 'Anglo-Saxons', and other bugbears. The EC must deal with the underlying causes of its malaise. The Bundesbank, for example, is not so much a cause, more a victim of events. The most important cause was the refusal to allow the ERM to operate flexibly after German unification. The outcome has been a vicious circle of economic deterioration and political conflict. The co-operation for which Mr Delors rightly calls needs to start here. All else is secondary.</p>

			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL-STAR GAME FLASHBACK;  </P> <P> RIGHT THERE WITH THE BEST;  </P> <P> FRED LYNN'S 1983 GRAND SLAM MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN RUTHIAN, BUT IT WAS CLOSE  ENOUGH TO LAND IN THE HISTORY BOOKS  </P> <P> You come to Fred Lynn seeking knowledge about the one and only grand slam hit  in baseball's All-Star game.  </P> <P> You know Lynn delivered it in 1983, at Chicago's Comiskey Park, while he was  with the Angels.  </P> <P> You let Lynn take care of the rest.  </P> <P> Leaning back in a chair in front of his Tiger Stadium locker, Lynn can tell you  anything you want to know about the blast that earned him the  most-valuable-player award in the 50th anniversary All-Star game.  </P> <P> He remembers the inning: the third.  </P> <P> He remembers the count: 1 and 2.  </P> <P> He remembers the pitcher: Atlee Hammaker.  </P> <P> He remembers the pitch: hanging slider.  </P> <P> But most of all, Lynn remembers where the first grand slam in All-Star history  landed.  </P> <P> Right next to where the first home run in All-Star history had landed.  </P> <P> "They played the first All-Star game at Comiskey, and (Babe) Ruth hit the first  home run," Lynn says. "They showed me where he hit it. Mine was about five  seats from it.  </P> <P> "It's kind of weird. His was the first home run, mine was the first grand slam  and mine almost landed right where he hit his."  </P> <P> Lynn smiles, preparing his listener for the punch line.  </P> <P> "I guess," he finally says, "that means I have Ruthian power."  </P> <P> Five decades and five bleacher seats apart, the home runs live on as two of the  American League's proudest All-Star moments. Ruth's ground-breaker, a two-run  homer, provided the American League with the margin of victory in a 4-2 win  over the National League in the 1933 inaugural game. Lynn's slam, the key blow  in a 13-3 American League triumph, broke a string of 11 consecutive All-Star  victories by the National League.  </P> <P> "That was my ninth game and I hadn't won one yet," Lynn recalls. "It was  getting pretty tiring. We'd had some tough losses, some extra-inning losses.  </P> <P> "It was big that we won that one, but it was bigger still because we blew them  out. After that, the mystique about 'the National League jinx' was broken.  Since then, we've won our share of games."  </P> <P> But at the outset, the 1983 game had the look of another AL disaster. The  American Leaguers committed two errors in the first inning, including one by  Angel first baseman Rod Carew, who failed to catch a throw from Toronto pitcher  Dave Stieb and later said he lost the ball in the sun.  </P> <P> "Oh my gosh," Lynn remembers thinking. "Here we go again."  </P> <P> But Stieb got out of the inning by striking out Andre Dawson, Dale Murphy and  Mike Schmidt and by the third, the American League actually led, 2-1, courtesy  of a throwing error by Dodger second baseman Steve Sax.  </P> <P> By the fourth, that lead read 9-1, with Hammaker laboring through what he  called "probably the worst exhibition of pitching you'll ever see."  </P> <P> Boston's Jim Rice opened the bottom of the third with a home run. Carew singled  in another run. And by the time Milwaukee shortstop Robin Yount, the league's  most valuable player the year before, stepped up to the plate, the American  League had two more runners in scoring position -- Cleveland's Manny Trillo at  third base and Carew at second.  </P> <P> At that point, National League Manager Whitey Herzog instructed Hammaker to  walk Yount, loading the bases for Lynn.  </P> <P> Kneeling on the on-deck circle, Lynn admitted to seeing red.  </P> <P> "Just because it was the right move strategically doesn't mean I have to like  it," he said.  </P> <P> Then, worse still, he saw Morganna.  </P> <P> Yes, there she was -- Morganna Roberts, baseball's incorrigible Kissing Bandit,  in the ever-so-slightly clad flesh.  </P> <P> She had ambushed Lynn in Anaheim Stadium a month earlier and now she was  bounding across the Comiskey Park outfield, seeking another target before  security guards could intercept her and escort her from the stadium.  </P> <P> "I knew she wasn't coming after me again," Lynn said after the game, "but I put  my bats up in the sign of the cross. I'm not superstitious, but I believe in  playing it safe."  </P> <P> Superstitious? Lynn? Just because he had gone four for 56, one of the worst  slumps of his career, after his first encounter with Miss Morganna?  </P> <P> Finally, order was restored and Hammaker completed the intentional walk to  Yount. The bases were loaded. The National League, at long last, was on the  ropes.  </P> <P> Lynn dug in and, for the fourth time in his All-Star career, sent a baseball  over the outfield fences. History was made and the rout was on.  </P> <P> Herzog and Hammaker should have seen it coming. If only they had paid closer  attention to the American League's batting practice session. With one of his  warmup swings, Lynn hit a pitch onto Comiskey Park's roof, a titanic shot.  </P> <P> Glen Rosenbaum, the Chicago White Sox batting practice pitcher, was stunned.  </P> <P> "Bet there haven't been four or five hits like that off me," Rosenbaum said. "I  know the Bull (Greg Luzinski) hit one once, but I can't remember the others."  </P> <P> So, Lynn was ready. Soon, an Angel was about to go where no other All-Star --  not Ruth, not Gehrig, not Mantle, not Mays -- had ever gone before.  </P> <P> Lynn, now a 37-year-old outfielder-designated hitter for the Detroit Tigers,  ranks the slam among the greatest moments of his 15-year career.  </P> <P> "It was big," he says. "All-Star games are a lot of fun and I've had some  success in them -- four home runs. My only regret is not having the chance to  go for Stan Musial's record of six."  </P> <P> Lynn hasn't been back to the All-Star game since 1983. The time to catch Musial  has probably passed him by.  </P> <P> But for one summer night, with one swing of the bat, Fred Lynn was right there  with Babe Ruth.  </P> <P> Lynn can tell you about it.  </P></p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: ITT likely to take control of Ciga ITT Sheraton of the US is expected to try to gain effective control of Ciga, the luxury Italian hotel group, after acquiring a 14 per cent stake. ITT confirmed yesterday that it acquired the stake at an auction of Ciga shares last month. The US group refused to comment on whether it planned to increase its stake further. However, Italian regulations require a shareholder in ITT's position to make a public offering for a further stake equivalent to the one it already holds, which would take ITT's holding to 28 per cent. Gaining control of the luxury chain would be a coup for ITT. Its ambitions to acquire the Italian group appeared to have been thwarted last April by a successful Ciga rights issue and a rise in its share price. Acquiring Ciga now would be significantly more expensive than originally envisaged. ITT's initial offering last February valued the group at L740bn (Dollars 465m), although observers believe the assumption of the group's liabilities and payment of bankers' fees would have brought the total to L900bn. At current share price levels, a bid is likely to value Ciga at more than L1,200bn. ITT emerged as a surprise buyer for Ciga earlier in the year when it edged out Forte of the UK, then the front runner. Following ITT's bid, Ciga launched the rights issue and share auction; at L1,000 a share, the rights issue was expected to fail. This would deliver the hotel group to its creditor banks as underwriters, and they would then sell it to ITT at L740 a share. The rights issue was a success, however, as was the subsequent share auction. Ciga's shares have been trading consistently at a level above L1,000. Ciga said yesterday that the rights issue and auction had brought in L1,003bn, which would cover its short-term debt. The group owes L950bn to banks and a further L50bn to suppliers whose payments are overdue. Italian hotel analysts said they did not believe Ciga could continue as a quoted company with a diverse group of shareholders.</p>

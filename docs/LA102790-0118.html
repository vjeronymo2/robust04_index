			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREEDERS' CUP CAPSULES  </P> <P> A look at today's seven Breeders' Cup races at Belmont Park.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1-MILLION SPRINT  </P> <P> Distance: 6 Furlongs  </P> <P> This race is frequently not won by a true sprinter, but by a horse such as  Precisionist, who was dangerous up to distances of 1 1/8 miles. Dancing Spree,  winner of last year's Sprint, fits that mold, coming into today's race off a  couple of non-winning starts at 1 1/8 miles. Dayjur, the English sprinter, is  favored, and he worked sensationally the other day, running half a mile in :45  3/5, but he has the No. 13 post and is running on dirt for the first time. The  locals are giving short notice to Corwyn Bay, despite his two convincing sprint  victories in California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1-MILLION JUVENILE FILLIES  </P> <P> Distance: 1 1/16 miles  </P> <P> On a day when there is a dearth of sure things, Meadow Star appears to be a  sure thing. Picking the second horse is the challenge. Three California-based  entrants -- Garden Gal, Lite Light and Beyond Perfection -- have chances as  good as any others' to be runner-up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1-MILLION DISTAFF  </P> <P> Distance: 1 1/8 miles  </P> <P> The surprise would be if anyone but Go For Wand and Bayakoa formed the exacta.  Gorgeous, injured Friday, has been scratched, and that probably makes Colonial  Waters, winless in five starts this year, the third choice. Bayakoa, not  nominated for the Breeders' Cup, has been supplemented for the second  consecutive year at $200,000 as she tries to repeat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1-MILLION MILE  </P> <P> Distance: One mile on turf  </P> <P> Trainer Francois Boutin, who won this race twice with Miesque, the French  filly, could hit the winner's circle today with Priolo, who comes from off the  pace. Steinlen won the Mile last year, then was voted America's grass champion,  and although he is a lukewarm favorite today, not many trainers fear him. "The  European horses are the ones to beat," says Mack Miller, who trains Who's To  Pay, an 8-1 shot. "The course will be soft, and they're used to that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1-MILLION JUVENILE  </P> <P> Distance: 1 1/16 miles  </P> <P> Fly So Free, winner of the Champagne at Belmont three weeks ago, and Best Pal,  winner of the Del Mar Futurity and the Norfolk at Santa Anita, are the top  horses. Deposit Ticket, who finished last as the Champagne favorite, is seeking  redemption. Best Pal has been supplemented into the race for a fee of $120,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $2-MILLION TURF  </P> <P> Distance: 1 1/2 miles  </P> <P> Nine horses from France's Arc de Triomphe have come to the Breeders' Cup and  failed, but this year the Turf has Saumarez, the Arc winner owned by Bruce  McNall, the owner of the Kings, and Wayne Gretzky, his best-paid employee. If  not Saumarez, another European-based horse should win, because the Americans  are weak on the grass this year. Golden Pheasant, who would have run as  Saumarez's entrymate, is out with an injury.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $3-MILLION CLASSIC  </P> <P> Distance: 1 1/4 miles  </P> <P> California-based horses -- Wild Again, Skywalker, Ferdinand, Alysheba and  Sunday Silence -- have won this stake five out of six years, but with Sunday  Silence and Criminal Type retired, that trend could be interrupted today,  unless Flying Continental has a Jockey Club Gold Cup encore in his system.  Rhythm won the Travers at this distance, on a hot August day when Go And Go,  the Belmont winner, had a terrible return trip from Europe and ran badly. This  time, Go And Go has arrived without mishap and the cool weather should be more  to his liking. Dispersal and Unbridled, the Kentucky Derby winner, are good  horses who are stuck on the outside in this cluttered field. Izvestia, the  Canadian Triple Crown champion, would appear to have a good post, No. 1, but he  doesn't like running inside horses. BILL CHRISTINE  </P></p>

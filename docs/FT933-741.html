			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Accounts watchdog streamlines inquiries THE FINANCIAL Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog, is to streamline its procedures for investigating companies suspected of having breached accounting standards, it announced yesterday. The panel will also provide more information to other regulators and professional bodies on the reasoning behind its decisions, subject to concerns over confidentiality. Figures released separately by the panel yesterday show that 117 companies' accounts have been drawn to its attention since it began operations in 1991. Mr Edwin Glasgow QC, chairman of the panel, said in a speech yesterday that the change in its procedures had come in response to comments made during the past two years of its operations. He attacked criticisms that the panel had concentrated its disciplinary efforts on 'minnows', saying that he did not discriminate between small and large companies. He said that small investors were right to bring to the panel's attention 'legitimate concerns about companies who have chosen to put themselves on the public market'. Mr Glasgow said that litigation had been threatened by the panel against companies 'on more occasions than might be expected'. Only one such occasion has been made public, when Trafalgar House first resisted and then ultimately obeyed the panel's ruling without fighting it in court. He said the panel did not see its role as making moral judgments but - in a reference to creative accounting to show figures in the most favourable light - said: 'We are not complete fools and it often becomes abundantly and amusingly apparent why a particular 'mistake' has been made.' The panel is considering 15 cases and has made public statements in respect of 17 completed investigations. The panel concluded a total of 42 cases after discussion with the companies concerned. Some 38 cases were not pursued beyond an initial examination because they did not fall within the ambit of legislation or because no points of substance arose. A further 22 were not pursued after some preliminary consideration.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE OF MOTHERS IS STILL GUILT  </P> <P> There isn't a mother alive who doesn't empathize with Maria Gorbachev, who,  during a recent interview, complained that her son, Mikhail, had not visited  her in 3 1/2 years.  </P> <P> OK, so the kid is up to his armpits in earthquakes, nuclear disaster, the  threat of a unified Germany, civil revolutions, and Soviets fighting to leave  the country. Not to mention the trouble he's having at the office and the  shouting match between Raisa and Nancy that made the front pages. But is any  one of them a reason not to call?  </P> <P> Somehow it's comforting to know that Russian mothers engage in the practice of  "glasguilt." We do have something in common.  </P> <P> I happen to be a third-generation guilt-spreader -- maybe further back than  that. But I can remember my grandmother (who could freeze-dry coffee with one  look) saying, "I called you yesterday, but you knew it was me and you wouldn't  answer the phone."  </P> <P> My mother phones daily to ask, "Did you just try to reach me?" When I reply,  "No," she adds, "So, if you're not too busy, call me while I'm still alive,"  and hangs up.  </P> <P> I haven't done as good a job with guilt as my mother and grandmother. The  reason for this is answering machines. My children dial my number when they  know I am not at home. When I ask them why they never call, they say it is my  fault for not having an answering machine. I wouldn't give them the  satisfaction.  </P> <P> I hate their answering devices. It is true that these machines are generally  more polite than my kids, but I have never worked well under pressure. When a  recording tells me I have just a few seconds to leave a message, I choke.  Sometimes I just say, "Make me a grandmother" and hang up. The one that always  gets their attention is, "You're out of the will if you don't return my call by  -- " and then I break the connection.  </P> <P> According to Maria Gorbachev, her son's visit in 1987 lasted just 40 minutes.  Big deal. That's hardly enough time to remind him how long she was in labor  with him.  </P> <P> It's just a guess, but I suspect the entire time was spent listening to Maria's  monologues on the following topics: "So, Mr. Big Shot, how come you never  called? KGB got your tongue?"; "I might as well live in Siberia for all you  care"; "You think you can replace my black-and-white TV with a color set and  you won't have to bother with me"; "Oh sure, I could move to Moscow. Maybe  you'd visit me in the bread line," and "I'm glad your father is not here to see  how you treat your mother like a peasant."  </P> <P> The woman has style. If Pravda's wire service doesn't get her son's attention,  there's always "60 Minutes," Sally Jessy Raphael, Maury Povich. . . .  </P></p>

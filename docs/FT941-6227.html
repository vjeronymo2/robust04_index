			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses affected by news from US Late closing markets were affected by negative US data which suggested that inflation was rising, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT fell back after Monday's positive start to the week as equities were again battered by nervousness in the bund market. The Dax index closed the official session down 24.52 or 1.2 per cent at 2,067.05, and extended that loss in the post-bourse session, falling a further 46.00 to 2,057.20, as disappointing US data began to make itself felt. The Bundesbank's easing of the repo rate to under 6 per cent did little to excite enthusiasm, coming within most expectations. Of greater concern to the equity market is unrest among public sector workers, with IG Metall engineering union members due to ballot on strike action. Among the day's heavy losers Daimler-Benz shed DM18 or 2 per cent to DM795 and then to DM792.50 in the after market. PARIS retreated sharply at the close as worries about the implications arising from the release of US data took hold. The CAC-40 index, which had fallen to a session low of 2,176.46, closed off 54.94 or 2.4 per cent at 2,183.12. Turnover was FFr5bn. Among the worst fallers Euro Disney shed FFr1.30 or 3.7 per cent to FFr33.50, Thomson-CSf FFr11.50 or 5.8 per cent to FFr186.00 and L'Oreal FFr43 or 3.3 per cent to FFr1,242. ZURICH, mixed early in the day, turned lower after the release of the US GDP data, leaving the SMI index down 40.8 at 2,847.4, taking the cumulative two day decline to 2.8 per cent. UBS bearers, downgraded by a number of analysts after last Friday's results, fell SFr44 to SFr1,320, taking the cumulative three day decline to 9 per cent. CS Holding were steadier after Monday's 5.3 per cent fall, losing SFr3 to SFr635. SBC added SFr4 to SFr454: some analysts have recommended switching into the stock. Blue chips were marked down on profit-taking by foreigners, also taking the opportunity to bank currency gains. Nestle shed SFr23 to SFr1,260 and Roche certificates fell SFr100 to SFr6,900. MILAN was dragged lower by weakness in bonds and the lira and the Comit index shed 8.96 to 649.24, with the market also inhibited by the political outlook in the run up to the elections on March 27-28. Trading was halted for almost three hours due to technical problems, but volume was so low that the bourse hours were not extended. BCI shed L34 to L6,026 amid expectations that the privatisation would be completed. Foreign favourites were left lower on profit-taking. Fiat shed L59 to L4,692 and Pirelli shed L88 to 2,061. Among the telecommunications issues, Sip shed L101 to L4,047 and Stet was L123 lower at L4438. AMSTERDAM was buffeted by worries elsewhere on the continent and overseas and the AEX index lost 4.81 or 1 per cent to 415.94. There were steep falls among the heavily capitalised issues, with Unilever, for instance, losing Fl 2.00 to Fl 213.90. Pakhoed, the transport group, which announced that it was to issue 2.6m new shares, fell 70 cents to Fl 54.50. MADRID fell 2 per cent in line with weaker bond markets which were pushed lower by disappointment with the Bundesbank's smaller than expected repo rate cut, the US data and sales by foreign investors. The general index shed 6.78 or 2 per cent to 332.68 in nervous trading. Telefonica tumbled Pta85 or 4.3 per cent to Pta1,890 in volume of 6m shares after news that it was paying Dollars 2bn for Ental-Peru and CPT-Peru. BRUSSELS saw losses in the bank and insurance sector despite an interest rate cut by the central bank. The Bel-20 index closed up 1.10 at 1,516.90 in turnover of BFr1.9bn. Nonetheless, Arbed, the Luxembourg steel manufacturer, went against the trend, rising BFr300 or 7.3 per cent to BFr4,400, Among insurers Groupe AG lost BFr45 to BFr2,880. COPENHAGEN's KFX index retreated 1.27 to 112.04 with banks affected by a steep fall in Den Danske Bank, off DKr4 at DKr395. In contrast Unidanmark, the country's second largest bank, bucked the trend, climbing DKr3 to DKr258, helped by news that its new share issue of 6m A shares had been oversubscribed. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden index lost 16.4 to 1,522.5. ISTANBUL lost a further 2.67 per cent despite a wave of selective buying in the session. The composite index ended down 400.34 at 14,603.25, bringing the losses over the week so far to 9.85 per cent. The Turkish lira lost more than 6 per cent against the dollar, standing at TL21,500 in the afternoon. The most active shares were iron and steel group Eregli, down TL50 to TL3,550 and glassware producer Turkish Sise Cam Fabrikalari, down TL175 to TL1,775.

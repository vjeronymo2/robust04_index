			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Letters To The Editor: Nothing voluntary in low pay Sir, Samuel Brittan's disappointment over the quality of the debate on the economy in the election campaign so far (Economic Viewpoint, March 19) is certainly justified. It falls short of even the mediocre, with little attempt to relate the proposals put before the electorate to macroeconomic goals, especially economic growth and the reduction of unemployment. Yet Brittan himself is not above criticism on the score of shallow thinking. Why is it that economists of his persuasion straying into labour market analysis refuse to reconstruct themselves on the basis of the evidence? His 'consenting adults' model is catchy but pure fiction. Low-paid workers generally remain in their condition because labour markets are segmented. They have no realistic possibility of improving their pay and conditions given limited employment alternatives and the overwhelming bargaining advantage of their employers. To perceive this as a voluntary bargain between even approximate equals is a nonsense. Intervention to redress this imbalance can be via government or collective bargaining. Neither of these is perfect, but while they may lead to some negative consequences for employment, research also suggests some positive benefits for productivity. A particular example of this is the minimum wage which has been well researched in the UK both in its wages council and single national minimum forms. For its social as well as its economic implications it is important to address with some seriousness the scandal of widespread and endemic low pay and poverty in employment. Samuel Brittan's casual blackboard theorising will not do. Brian Towers, editor, Industrial Relations Journal, Strathclyde Business School, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow</p>

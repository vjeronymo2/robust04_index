			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Francois Fillon Confirms `The </F> Government's Intention to Make Research a National Priority'"]    [Text] Paris--According to a statement on 6 December by  Francois Fillon in his New Year's greetings to the media, the  French government "is politically determined to make research a  national priority," and is relying heavily on the major debates  now taking place to define by June the broad outlines of the  national scientific policy.    The Minister of Higher Education and Research emphasized  that  "in Europe, France is the only country where the research budget  is increasing, even if modestly. I can tell you that during my  meetings with colleagues from neighboring countries, I learned  that budgetary constraints were affecting their research much  more severely than our own."    The minister added that the national debate has been opened.  It will continue with the organization of a series of six  regional conferences, the first of which to take place in Le  Mans on 14 February, followed by others in Marseille, Grenoble,  Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Lille before the concluding national  debate scheduled for 9 April in Paris.    Fillon further said that "the preliminary task force report  being circulated since 26 November has already inspired some  fifty responses, mostly but not exclusively from the major  research institutions." The 30,000 copies of the final report  will be mailed out beginning on 1 February so that in-depth  institutional studies may get started.    The six scheduled conferences will address research and  innovation in PME-PMI (small and medium size enterprises),  reports from the scientific and social communities, research and  enterprises aimed at competitiveness, basic research, ways of  enhancing "France's assets," advanced training and research  organizations: structures and trades, and finally, the  international scope of research.    Fillon does not want these conferences, each of which will  involve around 300 invited participants, to become "High  Masses," but rather to generate "genuine dialogue." He expressed  hope that they will result in important ideas from which the  government will formulate the scientific and technological  policies required by the country's development and by the  international context. He did not conceal his support of  proposals for a five-year or programming law as in the case of  Defense, but he acknowledged that these proposals would probably  have to wait until after the 1995 election.    In response to some questions, Fillon said he hoped that the  new French space policy "would be defined soon. My ministry has  expressed its views on the subject but the Ministry of Industry  is the one in charge of Space." The minister announced that the  first contract between the government and research organizations  would probably be signed with the Atomic Energy Commission  (CEA), then with the National Institute for Computer and  Automation Research (INRIA).    With more specific reference to higher education, the  minister restated his intention of initiating as of this year "a  genuine technological track" and to intensify efforts to reduce  the concentration of his ministry's departments toward colleges  and universities, through the proven approach of  decentralization.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agenda for National Debate on Major Objectives of French Research            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Summary of 1993 Agenda                |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |September 1993                        |Introductory session of task force (C-|  |                                      |hairman: R.

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Travel: Dresden - bombed, battered and beautiful MUCH OF Dresden's historic core is still a reconstruction site, 48 years after RAF bombers smashed it. But the old architectural gems are slowly coming to light again in time for the city's 800th anniversary in 2006. The spirit of reconstruction was brought home to me after climbing the staircase of the Albertinum, when I spent some time on the first-floor landing absorbing Canaletto's five magnificent Dresden panoramas. On one of the churches he had painstakingly recorded scaffolding around the steeple. Sometimes life seems to stand still. The same steeple was encased in scaffolding during my visit as well. Although it is one of Europe's greatest art galleries, the Albertinum is mercifully neither overpowering nor crowded. It is all the more pleasurable, therefore, to take in the few rooms of Old Masters, where household names predominate. Even the Durers, Holbeins and Botticellis paled (at least for me) beside Titian, Vermeer, Raphael's Sistine Madonna and my own favourite: Rembrandt's joyous self-portrait with his wife. The one view by Canaletto that looks virtually unchanged is the courtyard of the Zwinger. Despite torrential rain, l found the Zwinger one of the most enchanting Baroque buildings I have seen - light and airy, as befits a palace built for pleasure and festivals. Eighty per cent of visitors to Dresden are there on business, and the hotels could fill their beds three times over throughout the year. Hotel prices trebled after unification two years ago, and, at least until recently, they are the most expensive in Germany. Even a double room in a two-star hotel can cost around Pounds 90. For most tourists, the obvious solution is bed and breakfast 10 miles from the centre at around Pounds 35. Visiting the former DDR is not just about seeing a clutch of great monuments. My suggestion is that, if you missed the fall of the Berlin wall, then go now, because for a comparatively short time you can witness a rare and exciting occurrence - the painful attempt by the east Germans to come to terms with their new fate: half a nation in metamorphosis. Everywhere you look, life in the old DDR (the letters still top many buildings) mixes with the new. A smart new cafe stands a few yards from a ladies' fashion shop, so staid it could have strayed from a 1930s film set. How they all love to drive their unlovely Trabants. We drove west down the silver road to Freiberg, so named because of the silver mined in the area for 500 years until the early 1800s. Grey apartments gave way to flattish countryside and impoverished villages with a good sprinkling of half-timbering. It was like a version of West Germany of 40 years ago. Paint seems to have been largely unobtainable, but here and there was a smartly manicured house and garden, perhaps the residence of a privileged party official, now unemployed. Freiberg's cathedral square had more charming buildings, but nowhere to sit or drink a coffee. A cathedral guide insisted on locking us out because it was the job of the next guide to let us in. Meanwhile, it rained. Old rules die hard. Inside, the roof had been repainted with superior Christmas-tree decorations based on 15th-century originals. The astonishing tulip pulpit was half-restored, while many of the Electors of Saxony reposed in stony splendour behind a screen. Freiberg is a half-day's excursion from Dresden. Meissen is a similar distance, accessible from Dresden by road or by pleasure steamer along the Elbe. Most go to see the porcelain, the first and the best of its kind in Europe - made since the early 1700s. I saw a beautiful thimble for Pounds 75, with dinner services pro rata. Both factory and museum are worth a detour, but buying is cheaper in Harrods. Finally to Weimar, in neighbouring Thuringia - a cultural showpiece even in communist days. Goethe's elegant but modest house - his home for 50 years - is preserved in time-warp fashion, from his inkpot and desk to the armchair he died in. Schiller, his poorer friend, lived only the last three years of his life near by. In bronze they bestride a plinth outside the national theatre where the Weimar Republic was born. Weimar's streets and squares are a delight. I chewed a Thuringian sausage in the market square while contemplating the house of Cranach the Elder. His last great triptych is in the parish church.</p>

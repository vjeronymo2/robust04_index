			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCCORMICK, FERGUSON WIN THREE-METER TITLES  </P> <P> Two-time Olympic medalist Kelly McCormick rallied from a two-point deficit on  her final dive Friday to win the women's three-meter springboard event in the  U.S. Diving Championships.  </P> <P> Kent Ferguson of Boca Raton won the men's three-meter springboard title, and  Pat Evans of Cincinnati took the one-meter springboard event.  </P> <P> McCormick beat runner-up Wendy Lucero of Aurora, Colo., by five points for her  ninth national title. Lucero led before the last of 10 dives, but McCormick's  reverse 1 1/2-somersault with 2 1/2-twists gave her a total of 507.66 points.  </P> <P> Lucero tried an inward 2 1/2-somersault but rippled too much water on entry,  was outscored and finished with 502.89 points.  </P> <P> Ferguson, who finished third in the last two U.S. Olympic trials, showed he has  recovered from shoulder surgery with a 19-point margin over runner-up Mark  Bradshaw of Columbus, Ohio, who was fifth in the 1988 Olympics.  </P> <P> Evans, the NCAA three-meter springboard champion from the University of  Cincinnati, had a 20-point margin over runner-up Mark Lenzi of Fredericksburg,  Va., the NCAA one-meter champion.

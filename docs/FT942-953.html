			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Superhighway push by Europe A group of leading Europe-based electronics manufacturers and institutions have formed an association to promote the development of multimedia technologies and services. The European Multimedia Forum, launched late last week, brings together computer manufacturers, telecommunications companies and publishers in a bid to facilitate the exchange of information and the development of business partnerships. The members include the Association of Commercial Television in Europe, British Telecom, Compaq, France Telecom, Hewlett Packard, ICL, Mercury, Philips, Sema, Silicon Graphics and Sony. It said: 'The forum will encourage cross-industry synergies and function as an interface between business and government. In particular, the forum will concentrate on the implementation of a European Information Infrastructure (the Europrean 'superhighway'). Formation of the forum follows quickly on publication of the Bangemann Report, which urged European companies to seize the opportunities offered by multimedia. Membership is open to any size of organisation interested in multimedia. The annual fee is ecu500 for small companies and ecu1000 for large companies and organisations.

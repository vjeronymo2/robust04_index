			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Suez reinsurance sale off as Scor cuts offer Suez, the French financial and investment group, has broken off negotiations to sell its Abeille Reassurances for around FFr2.1bn (Pounds 250m) to Scor, France's largest reinsurer, because the latter wanted an unacceptable price reduction. Suez said it would keep Abeille Reassurances which has premium income of around FFr4bn a year, though if 'any other potential buyer comes along, we will study their offer'. It noted that it was Scor who had initiated negotiations which had led the two companies to a preliminary agreement on June 15, by which Scor would pay FFr1.3bn in cash and cede 19 per cent of its capital to Suez in payment for Abeille Reassurances. 'In the end Scor insisted on a lower price and supplementary guarantees, which we found unacceptable,' said a Suez spokeswoman. Suez's rupture with Scor does not affect Suez's agreement in principle to sell the Abeille life and non-life divisions of its Victoire subsidiary to Commercial Union of the UK for FFr12.5bn. They are aiming to close the sale by the end of September. It was Commercial Union's lack of interest in the Abeille reinsurance operation of Victoire that attracted Scor, the largest French reinsurer with FFr7.9bn of premium income. Over the past three years, the Suez group has sold off some FFr35bn in assets, mainly parts of the Victoire insurance company to various buyers and also industrial holdings of Societe Generale de Belgique.</p>

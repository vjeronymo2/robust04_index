			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Resignation of party leader may help Hata A leading member of the Japanese minority coalition is to resign his party post because of supporters' anger over his part in the Socialists' departure from the government. Mr Keigo Ouchi said yesterday he would step down as chairman of the Democratic Socialist party, a small centre-right party, because of criticism over his support for the recent behind-the-scenes creation of a conservative alliance called Kaishin (innovation). He will, however, stay on as health and welfare minister. The gesture is a step in the government's strategy of trying to win back the much larger Social Democratic party, the key to its hopes of surviving for more than a few months. The walk-out by the socialist SDP in April, in protest at what it saw as a conservative bid to dominate policy, deprived the government of a majority, so paralysing such crucial but controversial legislation as plans for a permanent cut in income tax and a rise in sales tax. Without the socialists' support, Mr Tsutomu Hata, prime minister, had at the latest count just 202 seats in the 511-seat parliament, 54 short of a majority. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a close and powerful ally of Mr Hata, is generally accepted as the inspiration for Kaishin. Even so, Mr Ouchi's move is likely to help assuage socialist ire, the latest in a series of surprisingly favourable developments for the five-week-old Hata administration. Socialist leaders have hinted in recent days that they might consider rejoining the coalition if Mr Hata first resigned, in a symbolic act of contrition for allowing the Kaishin grouping to be formed, and then stood again for the leadership. The prime minister's recent decision to freeze a planned rise in utility prices has gone down well with SDP supporters. He yesterday vowed to produce plans this month to streamline the administration and cut state spending, another popular policy. Japanese businesses will welcome any sign that Mr Hata can delay another political crisis. They need a stable government to engineer a recovery and resolve the trade dispute with the US, on which the yen's value partly hangs. Yesterday's restart of shelved trade talks in Washington has done no harm to Mr Hata's standing in that respect. The new government has also managed to unblock progress on the long-delayed national budget for the current year, another obvious concern for business. This is now heading for passage this month. But to unfreeze the budget, Mr Hata has riskily had to agree to opposition demands to step up a parliamentary inquiry into political corruption. This will probably entangle Mr Ozawa and so risk giving the opposition an excuse to initiate a no-confidence vote. The three main opposition parties, the Liberal Democratic party, SDP and Communists, yesterday agreed that Mr Ozawa should be called to testify before parliament on allegations of illicitly receiving political funds from construction companies. Their demand is hard to resist, given the government's minority position.</p>

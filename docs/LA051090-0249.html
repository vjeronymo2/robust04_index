			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STEER CLEAR OF SPORT LOTTERIES, VINCENT WARNS  </P> <P> Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent has warned jurisdictions seeking major league  expansion franchises to stay away from sports lotteries, igniting a controversy  whose effects may be felt well beyond Washington.  </P> <P> As District Councilman Frank Smith Jr., chairman of the D.C. Baseball  Commission, put in writing his opposition to the proposed betting game, Lottery  Board Chairman Carolyn B. Lewis said the board has not considered including  baseball in the Sports Pool Lottery it recently gave preliminary approval.  </P> <P> Meantime, Rep. John Bryant (D-Tex.) said he would introduce a bill this week  that would prohibit state-run sports-betting enterprises.  </P> <P> The developments came a day after Vincent said, "Jurisdictions which engage in  sports betting and which are also seeking expansion franchises should be warned  that, at least, I will tend to consider those two things together."  </P> <P> Last week, the Lottery Board approved the rules for a game that would allow  legal gambling in the District of Columbia on professional football, baseball,  basketball and hockey. The game, which still must receive formal approval from  the District's Office of the Corporation Counsel and final approval from the  lottery board, likely would begin in September when the National Football  League regular season opens.  </P> <P> But Lewis said that since the Lottery Board began considering the Sports Pool  Lottery in 1987, football is the only sport that has been discussed for the  game.  </P> <P> Baseball "has not ever been under consideration," Lewis said.  </P> <P> Asked if she would support any kind of sports lottery if she knew it could  adversely affect Washington's chances of being awarded a baseball franchise,  Lewis said the Lottery Board has yet to make a final decision.  </P> <P> That decision will not come until at least the completion of a 30-day period  for public comment.  </P> <P> In a letter to Lottery Board Executive Director Lorraine Greene, Smith  requested "that the Lottery Board not consider creating a sports-betting  lottery system at this time.  </P> <P> "A sports betting lottery would . . . give Major League Baseball an avenue by  which they can deny Washington, D.C., a baseball team," wrote Smith, who  Tuesday raised the possibility of council action against a sports lottery.  </P></p>

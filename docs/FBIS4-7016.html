			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- A Japanese newspaper  April 21 quoted sources of the Foreign Ministry of the  Philippines as saying on April 19 that the U.S. ambassador to  the Philippines was putting pressure through President Fidel  Ramos on Filipino Foreign Minister Roberto Romulo to refrain  from remarks critical of the U.S. policy toward the Korean  peninsula.    The foreign minister criticized the U.S. policy, saying that  the strong hope of the United States for quick satisfaction  cannot be said to be a diplomatic policy and that the U.S. needs  to relax its confrontational attitude toward North Korea and  must continue to work for a peaceful settlement.    The U.S. ambassador expressed disappointment at this  criticism and complained that he did not expect such criticism  from an ally.    The ambassador, impudently enough, urged Filipino President  Fidel Ramos to order the foreign minister to stop such remarks  as putting the U.S. in an awkward position in the discourse  about the Korean peninsula.    This is an infringement on the sovereignty of the  Philippines.</p>

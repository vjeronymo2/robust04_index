			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Gungor Mengi: "Transition Period"] </F>   [Text] "We have liberated Ankara and Istanbul. Next will  be Turkey as a whole." This statement was made by Prosperity  Party leader Necmettin Erbakan... That is how he addressed the  jubilant supporters of his party, who were rejoicing over their  political party's victory in the local elections. Erbakan's  speech was covered by the television networks. Scenes from  rallies were shown during his speech, scenes recalling those  after Imam Khomeyni's Islamic Revolution in Iran. This  heightened the uneasiness in the people who watched the Erbakan  events on their television screens.    The claim that the Prosperity Party doubled its votes is  wrong; it increased its votes by three percent. Nevertheless,  the fact that its supporters are concentrated in large cities  had a bearing on the outcome of the local elections.    Erbakan's statement that they have "liberated Ankara and  Istanbul" has created anxiety in the broad masses, that is, the  other 81 percent of the people. The question that is being  asked is: From whom have they liberated Ankara and Istanbul?    Obviously, 81 percent of the people did not regard  themselves  as prisoners of a foreign and hostile force until yesterday. Is  it that this man who claims that they have "liberated Ankara and  Istanbul" wishes to announce that the ideology he represents has  become widespread in the country?  <H5>  Both a Muslim and a Democrat </H5>   The Prosperity Party's supporters have complained about an  increase in provocative activities aimed at deepening the  anxiety of the people and describing that party as a bogeyman.  Their complaint is justified. However, they must remember that  they have to take an understanding approach if they wish to be  treated with understanding.    No one can describe the jubilant feeling of the supporters  of  the Prosperity Party as being excessive--that is, provided they  behave and avoid disrespect for the values that make Turkey a  free and modern country.... We can still recall the appalling  incidents during the victory rallies held by the Republican  People's Party supporters in the 1970's. However, jubilation  must not be allowed to create a wave of confrontation. We have  a difficult transition period ahead of us. It will be a matter  of honor for the Turkish people to prove that the Islamic faith  can be maintained in a democracy. It will be an opportunity for  the local administrations to deal with this difficult era  without serious problems.    The Turkish people cannot abandon their freedoms. They  cannot achieve the level of prosperity they deserve by regarding  half of the world as their enemy and turning their backs on it.    If the Prosperity Party's concept of a Just Order paves the  ground for green Communism [Communism under the guise of  religion] and if the mayoral offices that have been taken over  by that party act in a way reminiscent of despotic Arab  behavior, the Prosperity Party's fate will definitely be similar  to that of the Social Democratic Populist Party, which scored a  significant victory in the local elections in 1989 but suffered  a serious defeat in the 1991 general elections.  <H5>  Our Democracy is Durable </H5>   No one must fear the Prosperity Party. We must not be  daunted by religious people who get organized. Nor should we be  daunted by the attire they choose to wear, attire which we  believe represents horrible regimes.    Those people have not come from Iran, Iraq, or Libya.  Furthermore, neither they nor those who disagree with them will  leave this country. We shall all coexist.    Many people behaved in an unruly way after the Democratic  Party come to power in 1950. They offended each other with  their vengeful activities. Furthermore, they challenged those  who tried to limit them by saying "there is democracy in this  country." However, 40 years have passed since then and Turkey's  democracy has matured. Obviously, from time to time we forget  that fact and become emotional and worried.    In view of this, Istanbul Governor Hayri Kozakcioglu's  statement, which was carried by SABAH yesterday, has been very  useful. He eased people's anxiety and, as an experienced  administrator, gave a lesson to the mayors who support the  Prosperity Party on their duties and powers.  <H5>  Governor Kozakcioglu is a Good Example </H5>   The Prosperity Party's officials and supporters have not won  a victory against the state, nation, and democracy. In fact,  they owe their victory to the state, nation, and democracy.  Their success will depend on the respect they show for those  values. It is true that the people have given them the stage.  However, they will be removed by the people if they fail to  realize that fact. Before that, however, they will confront the  laws of this country.    The worried majority of the masses were reassured by  Governor  Kozakcioglu's statement that interference in the people's daily  life, the way people dress, and the people's rights and freedoms  will be penalized and that the people, state, and contemporary  way of life are not unprotected. The statement was also  designed to save the Prosperity Party from paying dearly for the  activities of ignorant and unruly individuals who misunderstand  democracy.    Kozakcigolu is a good example of the daring and able  governors our country needs at the present time....    We hope that the officials who have graduated from schools  for clergymen and preachers will also regard him as an example.</p>

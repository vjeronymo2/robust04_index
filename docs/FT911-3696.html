			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar keeps up the gallop THE DOLLAR was very firm yesterday, particularly against the depressed D-Mark. The defeat of the ruling Christian Democrats in Sunday's state election in the Rhineland Palatinate, the home state of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, increased downward pressure on the currency. Mr Kohl's political difficulties weighed on the D-Mark at a time when it is already suffering from the economic problems caused by German unification and concern about growing instability in the Soviet Union. The decline of the D-Mark weakened all members of the European exchange rate mechanism against the dollar, but the US currency was strong in its own right, improving against non-ERM units such as the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. Hopes of a gradual recovery in US economic performance and fading expectations of lower US interest rates helped to push the dollar up to another 16-month high against the D-Mark. This followed on from the renewed surge in demand seen on Friday. There was no sign of central bank intervention as it broke through technical resistance at DM1.7620 yesterday and touched the day's high at another resistance point of DM1.7680, before closing in London at DM1.7660 compared with DM1.7360 on Friday. Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations meet in Washington next weekend, amid concern at an apparent lack of agreement on interest rate policy. It was also noted that the US administration's desire for lower rates does not appear to be shared by members of the policy-making US Federal Open Market Committee. A US press report last week suggested that the FOMC has agreed that interest rates may be low enough to end the recession. This coupled with concern among some FOMC members about rekindling inflation if rates are cut were major factors sparking the dollar's surge over the last two trading days. At the London close the dollar had also advanced to Y139.40 from Y138.35; to SFr1.4795 from SFr1.4705; and to FFr5.9475 from FFr5.8575. Its index climbed to 67.1 from 66.3. The D-Mark maintained the downward trend against the yen, which resumed last Thursday after the Bundesbank council failed to increase official German interest rates. In London the German currency finished at Y78.95, compared with Y79.70 on Friday and Y81.00 on Thursday. Sterling lost ground in the ERM, but stayed second strongest, according to figures from the European Commission. The pound fell 2.95 cents to Dollars 1.6925, after losing 5 cents on Friday. It remained steady against the D-Mark, however, closing unchanged at DM2.9900, while falling to FFr10.0650 from FFr10.0875; to SFr2.5050 from SFr2.5325; and to Y236.00 from Y238.25. Sterling's index weakened 0.6 to 91.6. In New York the pound recovered a modest 30 points to end at Dollars 1.6955.</p>

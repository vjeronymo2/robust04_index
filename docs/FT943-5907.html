			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Swedish forestry groups advance Clear evidence of a strong upturn in the pulp and paper cycle emerged yesterday when two of Sweden's leading forestry groups, SCA and MoDo, reported a sharp increase in first half profits. SCA said profits after financial items had risen to SKr818m (Dollars 105.7m) from SKr550m, excluding one-off items. MoDo returned to the black, swinging to a SKr471m profit after financial items from SKr319m loss a year ago. Both companies said they were feeling the effects of increased volumes and lower financial costs. MoDo also highlighted a sharp upturn in prices for pulp, fine paper and sawn goods as the basis for its turnround. SCA upgraded its full-year forecast, saying it now expected profits of between SKr1.9bn to SKr2.3bn. MoDo saw sales climb 12 per cent to SKr9.4bn, mainly because of higher volumes and increased prices for pulp and fine paper. The operating result climbed sharply to SKr909m from SKr277m. All the group's units reported higher operating profits. MoDo Paper, the fine paper division, swung to SKr127m profit from a SKr202m loss while Iggesund Paperboard saw profits rise to SKr332m from SKr156m. Group financial costs fell to SKr438m from SKr596m. The company says full-year profits will comfortably exceed SKr1bn.</p>

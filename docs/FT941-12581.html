			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Accident halts ferry services B&amp;I Line services between Dublin and Holyhead in north Wales have been suspended after the company's 20,000-tonne Isle of Innisfree ferry hit a berthing pontoon in rough weather at Holyhead. The pontoon was damaged, preventing the vessel, with 146 passengers on board, from docking. It returned to Dublin. B&amp;I said the accident meant the company would not be able to operate its twice-daily services between Dublin and Holyhead until February 8.</p>

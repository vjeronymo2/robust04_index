			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Blair's vision targets consumers Mr Tony Blair yesterday held out a vision of Labour as the party of national renewal - as an opinion poll showed that he would boost his party's overall popularity if elected leader. In a 20-page manifesto for the contest to succeed John Smith, Mr Blair promised to develop a modernised Labour party committed to consumer rights. Mr Blair's manifesto shuns interventionism, nationalisation and economic isolationism. But there are few specific policy commitments in the paper, which was accompanied by a four-page colour brochure aimed at the 4.3m voters in Labour's leadership election. The social democratic language of the manifesto does open a clear ideological gap between Mr Blair and the two traditional socialist candidates - Mrs Margaret Beckett, acting leader, and Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary. Mr Blair said he was seeking to modernise Labour's traditional values, rather than abandon them. Supporters of the two leftwing candidates said he was scrapping the party's basic principles. The manifesto also says that the market economy is in the public interest, and indicates that a Blair government would limit intervention to 'developing and guiding' industry in areas such as technological innovation and research and development. It endorses Labour's policies on progressive taxation, devolution, education and training, parliamentary and local government reform, crime prevention, minimum wages and the European Union, including lukewarm support for a single currency. The manifesto is strongly consumer-orientated, reflecting Mr Blair's conviction that Labour can win the next general election by appealing to a wide range of people disillusioned by economic decline and social disarray. Today's opinion poll, conducted by MORI for the Times, shows that Labour support would increase by about 3 percentage points if Mr Blair became the party leader. According to the poll, the party ratings over the last month (with those for the end of May in brackets) are: Labour 52 per cent (46 per cent), Conservatives 24 per cent (27 per cent), Liberal Democrats 20 per cent (23 per cent). But the 'Blair factor' would increase Labour's rating to 55 per cent, reduce the Tories to 23 per cent, and send the Liberal Democrats down to 18 per cent. Mr Blair is rated higher than Mr John Major and Mr Paddy Ashdown on who would be best at understanding world problems, Britain's problems, representing Britain in Europe and at handling Britain's economy. On understanding Britain's problems, Mr Blair is regarded as best by 40 per cent, Mr Major by 16 per cent and Ashdown by 20 per cent. Mrs Beckett is expected to issue her manifesto next week.</p>

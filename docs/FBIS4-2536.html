			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Chang Weimin: "Search for Oil Will Be </F> Intensified"]    [Text] China is to beef up prospecting for new reserves of  crude oil in its eastern part, where major oilfields are  concentrated.    The efforts are expected to verify enough reserves to make  up  for declining production in old oilfields.    Fields in the eastern part produce some 124 million tons of  oil a year. In addition, five oil-bearing areas are to be  developed in the next three years and are expected to yield at  least 10 million tons of oil annually.    Due to decades of exploitation, production at some old  oilfields has slumped over the past three years.    New technology will be used to recover more oil from old  fields and to develop heavy and super-heavy oil.    Measures for that purpose were outlined at what was billed  as  a "historic" conference held late last month by the China  National Petroleum Corp (CNPC).    A senior official from CNPC's Production and Development  Department last week said the measures have raised the  confidence of Chinese.    In an interview with Business Weekly, the official, who  declined to be identified said the five oil-bearing areas will  be part of a "second battlefield" to launch major maneuvers by  the energy industry.    The areas include the Liangjiang district of the Songliao  Basin, a block covering parts of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region  and the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu, and the shallow waters  of the continental shelf in the Bohai Bay.    If successful, the measures will ensure that annual oil  production in the eastern part remains above 124 million tons in  the next seven years.    Last year onshore oilfields produced 139 million tons of  oil.    China has expertise in enhancing the recovery of oil from  old  fields, but the official said major efforts are necessary to  perfect the expertise and to develop new technology.    The official spoke highly of last month's conference, saying  it was rare that nearly all senior officials and experts engaged  in onshore oil production attended the week-long conference.    The official reiterated the importance of stabilizing  production in the eastern part as a precaution in case big  discoveries are not made soon in the Tarim, Turpan-Hami and  Junggar basins in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The three  basins are expected to be the core of oil production in the next  century.    Some Chinese are wondering why the country, which lacks  enough energy for an economy of 1.18 billion people, does not  buy more oil from overseas when prices are only about $13 a  barrel.    Instead, high-ranking officials and oil industry  professionals seem to have worked out various plans for drawing  every drop of oil out of the ground.    Officials from different sources have ruled out raising oil  imports because the country lacks the foreign currency to pay  for it.    China's imports of oil have been on the rise over the past  several years and this year will be equal to exports.    But next year the country is likely to become a net importer  of oil. Experts predict demand for crude oil will exceed  planned production.    China imported 15 million tons of oil in 1993, compared with  19.31 million in 1992. Last year oil exports were 19 million  tons, 1.7 million less than in 1992.</p>

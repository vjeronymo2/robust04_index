			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Worldwide threat of weak demand A historical parallel to the present-day threats to the world economy would be enlightening to people with imagination. In 1938-39, the threat of communism to the capitalist democracies had by no means vanished. Yet in those years the main threat came from Nazi Germany. The blindness of many western statesmen to this new threat, and their continued obsession with communism, cost their citizens dearly by delaying preventive action against the Axis powers. Inflation is like the communist threat in 1938-39. Only the meretricious will say that it is yesterday's threat, or that we can forget about it. But for the time being the greater threat is one of global depression - by which I do not mean a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s, but a drawn-out under-performance of output and employment, politically as well as economically debilitating. Let me cite three out of many pieces of evidence. Credit Suisse First Boston points out in its October Economics Bulletin that the devaluation of sterling and the lira, relative to the D-Mark and the franc, have not had their normal postwar effect - higher inflation in the devaluing countries. Instead UK producer prices have shown only a glancing rise after devaluation, and Italian prices rose less than expected. On the other hand, French and German producer prices, especially the former, have actually fallen. Credit Suisse First Boston may be jumping the gun in calling the net effect deflationary. Consumer prices normally rise more than producer prices because productivity in services does not rise as quickly as in industry. Yet the price indices may be deceptive. The best statisticians cannot pick up all the quality improvements or special discounts that lie concealed behind the price-lists. Nor, as even the Bank of England warns us, should policymakers treat as inflationary the knock-on effects of indirect tax increases imposed by governments to relieve their structural budget deficits. The second instance comes from the Bank of England's new Inflation Report. This contains a chart, reproduced here, showing the expected profile of inflation derived from gilt-edged prices. This does indeed show some expected rise from a 1995 low-point, but not by much. The important lesson is that expected inflation in about 10 years fell by one percentage point between May and August, and by almost as much again in the period to October. Inflationary expectations are now 'down close to where they had been before sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism'. Indeed, assuming that gilt-edged yields contain some risk premium, as well as an allowance for future inflation, inflationary expectations lie within the government's 1-4 per cent range. Third, there are signs that UK retailers' price wars are no flash in the pan. Midland Global Markets Research has collated a good many pointers to retail price restraint being with us to stay. The retail sales price index has risen less than the underlying RPI and sales volume has increased faster than gross domestic product. Within the retail trade, the sectors that have held down prices most have seen the fastest sales. The war between BT and Mercury, together with the price cuts announced by Sainsbury yesterday, exemplify what is happening. There is a more cosmopolitan element too. Although the importance of China in the world economy has been hyped up, UK imports from the emerging markets  -eastern Europe, Latin America and east Asia together - have risen in a mere three years from 17 1/2 to 21 per cent of the total. As Credit Suisse First Boston suggests, such imports have put pressure not only on British margins, but also on the margins of traditional suppliers in western Europe and elsewhere. These direct influences on the price level of western European countries do not conflict with a monetary interpretation of inflation. What they do mean is that the effects of demand restraint come through more quickly into the price level. This is all to the good. Nor should the success of the new exporters be regarded as a threat. For they do not sell their wares to line their central banks with D-Mark, franc and sterling notes, but to buy western produce and know-how. What, however, threatens to throw a spanner in an otherwise benign set of consequences is the weakness of demand in the industrial world. The Bank of England mentions a 6 1/2 per cent growth of Nominal GDP as according with 'the real growth needed in the recovery, and the inflation target'. Yet such demand expansion is not taking place in the UK or in any other leading member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As The Economist pointed out last week, Nominal GDP is growing by 3 per cent or less in all EC countries except the UK; and even in the latter it is well below the Bank's benchmark. We should avoid a futile battle between those who see European depression in terms of inflexible labour markets and high costs of employing workers, and those who worry about inadequate demand. The more flexible labour markets become, the greater the benefits of a moderate but positive rate of demand expansion. In fact, the climate for pay flexibility and for a critical look at labour overheads has never been better - after many decades of moving in the wrong direction. But the one thing that could scupper this new mood and turn it into resentment would be if lower pay and prices simply led to slower demand growth in money terms, with little to show in output and jobs. * * * In this new phase the case for an independently accountable Bank of England has to be restated. Its sole task can no longer be just to stop inflation. Nor can the real economy be always safeguarded just by making the counter-inflationary strategy sufficiently gradual. Growth depressions may persist for years without causing a deflation that shows up in the statisticians' indicators. In current conditions an independent central bank needs to have an objective for nominal demand. Nominal GDP is the best-known variant but other measures, such as domestic expenditure, which I need not labour, may be more operational and suitable for concerted international action. There is nothing novel about all this. In spite of Alan Greenspan's attachment to price stability, the US Federal Reserve has always had other aims. The New Zealand Reserve Bank operates through a contract with the finance minister, which now covers inflation exclusively, but could be renegotiated next time to cover some version of Nominal GDP. The main case for an independently accountable central bank is not that it can magically bring price stability at a zero cost. It is the case for having one body clearly responsible for monetary policy, which could not then be blamed on some amorphous amalgam of politicians, officials and central bankers as at present. Moreover, it is a good democratic idea that fewer decisions should be taken by a central government, constantly looking over its shoulder at its parliamentary majority, and that more should be taken by other bodies accountable in other ways. It is still desirable that a central bank should acquire a first-class counter-inflationary reputation. For it can then get away with more demand stimulation when the time is ripe, and there will be fewer suspicions that it is taking inflationary risks to buy an election. But this need not prevent it having wider objectives. To revert to our opening analogy from the 1930s. The statesmen who most successfully took on the Nazis were far from soft on communism. But they were aware that there was more than one threat and that different threats could be uppermost at different times.</p>

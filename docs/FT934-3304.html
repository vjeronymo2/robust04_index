			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Overseas growth behind rise to Pounds 2.7m at Courts Strong growth overseas helped Courts, the retail furnisher, report pre-tax profits ahead 43 per cent at Pounds 2.72m for the half year to September 26, against Pounds 1.9m, writes Nigel Clark. The result was struck after a charge to deferred profit of Pounds 769,000, compared with a credit of Pounds 1.4m. The turnround was the result of increased overseas activity and represented the payments to date on hire purchase sales. Turnover rose 26 per cent to Pounds 105.8m with a 9 per cent rise in the UK and 46 per cent overseas. Favourable exchange rates accounted for 24 per cent of the overseas growth. Earnings advanced to 3.94p (1.23p) and the interim dividend is 2p (1.83p). Trading in the UK showed a slight improvement although the south of England, where most of the group's stores are situated, was still suffering from recession. Overseas, the principle increases in turnover were seen in Singapore, Mauritius, Malaysia, Barbados and Jamaica. In November a share placing and sale by its Singapore offshoot raised Pounds 21.5m and cut Courts' holding to 58.5 per cent.</p>

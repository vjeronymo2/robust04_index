			<p>BFN     [Text] Simferopol -- In an exclusive interview with a UNIAN  correspondent the other day, Mustafa Dzhemilev, chairman of the  Majlis of the Crimean Tatar People, stated that in the event of  a Ukrainian presidential election being held, Crimean Tatars  would "definitely be against Leonid Kuchma."    "We have quite often discussed our problems with  Interregional Bloc of Reforms [MBR] representatves -- and  Volodymyr Hrynyov in particular. He tends to view Crimean Tatars  as a Crimean ethnic minority. So if the choice is to be made  between Leonid Kuchma and Leonid Kravchuk, we would prefer the  latter. As for Ivan Plyushch, we have a bone to pick with him,  too."    Forecasting the activity of the Crimean Tatar group in the  Crimean Supreme Council, Mustafa Dzhemilev said they were  offered cooperation by Rossiya bloc group members but that it  was unacceptable. As for the Communists, the Majlis leader  said, "we can hear their secretary, Leonid Hrach, making a lot  of proposals that are not too bad. The Communists, however,  have always been saying one thing and, once in power, doing  another."    Mustafa Dzhemilev said that Yuriy Meshkov had suggested they  should back Serhiy Tsekov, former Ukrainian people's deputy and  supporter of the Rossiya bloc, as an appointee to the post of  Crimean parliamentary speaker, with a Crimean Tatar  representative then to be offered the post of deputy Supreme  Council chairman. The Majlis chairman said: "We find such  compromises deplorable and shall not accept them." The most  fair thing to do, in his words, would be to elect Refat  Chubarov, head of the Crimean Tatar deputies group, to the post  of Crimean parliamentary speaker. However, his candidacy will  not be put forward as he will stand no chance of winning. The  Crimean Tatars are most likely not to back anyone to this post.    Mustafa Dzhemilev expressed the hope that the Crimean Tatars  would succeed in appealing against the 14-seat quota granted to  them by the previous Crimean Supreme Council. Yuriy Meshkov's  statement that "the granting of even this quota was [former  Crimean parliamentary speaker] Mykola Bahrov's error," was  described by Mustafa Dzhemilev as nonpopulist and as an attempt  to exert pressure on the Crimean Tatars. He added that the  Crimean president's tactics might become the beginning of the  end of his presidency."</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Basic rate taxpayers are the target - Guaranteed Growth Bond A NEW National Savings product, to be launched in July, will help the government meet the planned Pounds 14bn increase in the public sector borrowing requirement. Described by the chancellor as a 'guaranteed growth bond', the product will offer fixed rates of interest guaranteed for only one year at a time. There will be a penalty, probably in the form of a reduced rate of interest, if the bond is cashed in earlier. The time-scale is a departure for National Savings, whose fixed rate certificates and bonds normally require investors to hold the products for five years to qualify for the maximum returns. Interest will be added to the bond annually after tax has been deducted at the basic rate. The guaranteed rate will be announced later. The minimum holding will be Pounds 1,000, with a maximum of Pounds 250,000. National Savings says that those who fall into the new 20 per cent tax band will have to claim back from the Inland Revenue the 5p in the pound extra tax paid. The product is likely only to appeal to basic rate taxpayers. Non-taxpayers will do better with income and capital bonds while higher rate taxpayers will be more attracted to National Savings certificates, which are paid free of income or capital gains tax.</p>

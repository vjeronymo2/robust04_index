			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (26): A paradise for pioneering spirits - The tourist industry is working to change the country's negative image THE ancient Inca festival of Inti Raymi, celebrating the midsummer solstice, is one of Peru's great tourist occasions. In a spectacular three-hour pageant inside the sacred fortress of Sacsayhuaman, Cuzco, locals re-enact the legendary clash between the Inca and Spanish cultures. Fantastically colourful costumes and swirling dances accompanied by a solemn narrative intoned in Quechua make for an unforgettable experience. Much of the charm of festivals such as Inti Raymi - repeated on different themes and different levels of splendour throughout the year in every Peruvian town, village and hamlet - is that they are not organised for the tourist. They are times when local people abandon everyday austerity and give themselves over totally to music, dance, religious or pagan ritual - and drink. Tourism in Peru is not for the faint-hearted. With a few important exceptions, a certain pioneering spirit is required. Travelling by road and air, while easier every day, demands stamina and good humour - flights may be cancelled without warning, carefully booked hotel reservations may prove untraceable. For the past five years, numbers of tourists have plummeted from a high of 120,000 to maybe a quarter of that. Any news abroad concerning Peru seemed bad news. Hyperinflation, economic chaos and guerrilla violence (although tourists were rarely caught up in it) kept all but the most adventurous - some would say the foolhardy - away. Now Peru is working hard to change that image. 'Tourism is the great multiplier,' says Mr Victor Joy Way, third vice-president of Peru, formerly minister of trade and tourism. 'It creates a market for craftsmen, a boost for restaurant-owners, taxi drivers, tour guides - almost everyone in a community benefits.' The fall-off in tourism has hit Cuzco, the ancient Inca capital, worst of all. 'More than 95 per cent of local inhabitants are partially dependent on tourism,' says Mr Edwin Gonzalez, manager of El Libertador hotel and a director of the hoteliers' chamber. 'Since the 1988 collapse, many hotels have closed, special tourist buses have been sold and experienced staff have found other jobs. When the tourists come back in numbers, we'll be unprepared.' June and July were better months, however. Occupancy rates, at about 25 per cent, were up on the previous year, although well below the 40 per cent needed to break even. Europeans currently account for over half of all visitors to Cuzco, according to Mr Gonzalez, replacing the Americans who are still dissuaded by their embassy from travelling within Peru. Lima hotels are now busier than for several years past, although the mini-boom is largely business-led, according to Mr Eduardo Arrarte, president of Canatur, the national tourist chamber. He points out that international recession has hit the tourist industry worldwide in recent years, but 'Peru's image is still bad, or it has improved only at the highest, governmental levels. The message hasn't got down to the travelling public yet.' Changing trends in world tourism should eventually favour Peru, he says. The average tourist, who wants to visit as many places as quickly as possible, will be the mainstay of the market for many years to come, but specialist tours are in ever greater demand. Peru is a paradise for nature-lovers, bird-watchers and butterfly enthusiasts; the high Andes are wonderful, largely unexplored terrain for hikers and climbers; and alongside the long-famous Inca cities of Cuzco and Machu Picchu are dozens of less familiar sites and less renowned cultures. Adventure tourism is also growing. Paragliding and bungee-jumping have caught on, while opportunities abound for white-water rafting, some as little as two hours away from Lima. Peru's Pacific rollers draw surfers from many countries. While convinced that development of tourism must be a matter for the private sector, the government is doing what it can to provide the bases for growth. Deregulation of domestic airways has already spawned a clutch of small airline companies which have inaugurated new air services to a number of hitherto remote provincial towns. And the transport ministry has made a priority of asphalting stretches of roads leading to tourist attractions. Outside Lima, hotel infrastructure leaves much to be desired. But investment has already begun. The discovery of the tomb of the Lord of Sipan led directly to the construction of three new hotels in the nearby coastal city of Chiclayo. And El Libertador, Cuzco's leading hotel, is expanding capacity from 130 rooms to 250 in anticipation of a tourist boom. South Korean hoteliers are reported to be taking a close look at investment opportunities in Cuzco. Their government has offered Peru Dollars 18m to rehabilitate the city's airport and feasibility studies are under way. One prime hotel property which could soon become available is the former monastery of San Antonio Abad, owned by Cuzco's archbishopric. Dollars 4m has already been spent on it. The government and Canatur would like to see cities such as Ayacucho - most famous as the cradle of Maoist guerrilla movement Shining Path, but also one of Peru's loveliest colonial towns - become tourist centres. Official estimates are that the average tourist spends Dollars 1,200 in a week's stay, a potentially huge boost to national and local economies. 'The first tourists will be guinea-pigs, of course,' admits Mr Arrarte. 'They'll be roughing it a bit, but that's how it always starts. I bet we find some very happy pioneers for Ayacucho.' One opportunity to 'sell' Peru falls on November 4 next year, when a total solar eclipse will be visible from the southern Peruvian coast. All 5,000 available hotel beds in the area have already been reserved by international travel agencies. 'When those people come, visit a few other places, go home safe and happy and tell their friends, it'll be the best promotion we've had for years,' says Mr Arrarte. it</p>

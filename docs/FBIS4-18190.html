			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brussels, March 31 (AFP) -- NATO Thursday [31  March] called on Russia to discuss what it said were  misunderstandings over the functioning of a joint partnership  program after reports that Moscow was reconsidering plans to  join the deal.    "Reports hint at a misunderstanding over the reason for the  existence of the Partnership, its objectives and functioning,  said a NATO official who refused to be identified. We are ready  to begin a dialogue with the Russians on the issue." [passage  omitted]    "NATO has understood that Russia wants to effectively join  the Partnership and (Russians) actually indicated possible  dates" for joining, the NATO official added.

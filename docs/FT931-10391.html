			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / France threatens to fine Hoover THE French government yesterday stepped up the political pressure on Hoover by threatening to fine the US domestic appliance company for its decision to switch production from its plant at Dijon in eastern France to Cambuslang in Scotland. Ms Martine Aubry, employment minister, said the Labour Inspectorate would fine Hoover for breaching French employment law. She claimed that the company, whose closure plans involve the loss of 600 French jobs, had failed to notify the company's works committee before announcing a plant closure. 'The very least a company should do is to respect the laws of the countries where it operates,' said Ms Aubry. 'Hoover did not conform with French law.' She said she also intended to check whether Hoover had broken European Community legislation. Hoover's action has been condemned by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president who is also Ms Aubry's father. But EC officials privately acknowledge that Hoover does not appear to have infringed EC regulations. Mr Delors himself said as much last week. However, the Socialist government, acutely aware that rising unemployment is one of the main reasons for its poor showing in opinion polls in the run-up to next month's legislative elections, is trying to keep the Hoover issue in the spotlight. One of the French government's main weapons against Hoover is new employment legislation which imposes stringent restrictions on companies planning to shed labour in France. It compels French employers to produce plans for alternative jobs for redundant workers and to seek government approval for redundancies. The Scottish Trades Union Congress and the French Confederation du Travail (CGT) issued a joint statement yesterday over the Hoover affair, writes Robert Taylor, Labour Correspondent. Demanding new rights for workers in transnational corporations, it called for the creation of European group committees in each company to enable consultations and collective discussions before economic decisions were taken.</p>

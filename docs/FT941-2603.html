			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Markets: Pilot error brings F&amp;C to earth - Serious Money Savings schemes that look too good to be true usually are. When F&amp;C launched its High Income unit trust, with a 10 per cent yield, just over a year ago, it seemed outstandingly attractive. True, the company itself pointed out that the yield was not guaranteed. And it said, openly, that investors were sacrificing most of their hopes of capital growth in order to enjoy this yield. But investors loved it. Many were despairing refugees from banks and building societies - and they had good reason to despair. For as the chart on page III shows, their income was being squeezed, not just in nominal terms but also in real (inflation-adjusted) terms. The trust was structured cleverly so that it could be tucked inside a general personal equity plan. So, investors could enjoy the income free of tax. Quite how the fund managers achieved all this was a bit harder to work out. Just over half of the money went into blue chip UK shares - which gave the fund its general Pep credentials. The bulk of the rest went into 'designer debentures' - short-term loans to blue chip borrowers which came with a bunch of premiums from selling options 'embedded' in them. The option element performed the miracle of getting the yield on the debentures up to 25 - 30 per cent. Repeat, 25 - 30 per cent. The snag was that capital losses were also effectively 'embedded' in the debentures: that is, they were likely to produce a capital loss on redemption. The rump of the fund was kept in cash, with part going to buy FT-SE 100 put options which would act as a safety net if the market fell out of bed. If some of this leaves you boggling, you are not alone. Few people understood even the broad principles of the fund. And it was impossible for even a knowledgeable outsider to make any sensible judgment on the detail. The broad idea seemed to be that the debentures were a way of turning capital into income, but the management hoped the share portfolio would produce compensatory capital growth. F&amp;C was, however, pretty clear about what the effect of any future changes in interest rates would be: 'The fund's deposit income will be lower when interest rates are low. But Foreign &amp; Colonial's calculations show that the projected 10 per cent income return will be achievable with base rates in the range of 4 per cent to 14 per cent. The income generated by the fund will not be affected by base rate cuts within this range.' Not an actual promise, but it is hardly surprising that this statement acted as a clarion call to the financial advisers who made so much money selling the High Income fund. In just over a year, the F&amp;C fund pulled in Pounds 500m, a remarkable amount for any new trust. Another fund management house, Morgan Grenfell, produced a copycat product which has attracted Pounds 40m. But a third group, Save &amp; Prosper, which had been planning to enter the market, pulled out suddenly in December. It explained that it was worried that a fund yielding as much as 10 per cent would devour its capital in order to meet its income target. It reckoned there was a 50/50 chance of investors losing half their capital in seven years; the rest would then evaporate even faster. This week, even though base rates are 5 1/4 per cent, F&amp;C announced plans to cut the High Income fund's yield from 10 to 9 per cent at the end of June. Its main explanation was that the reduction in money market rates had reduced the level of option premiums, and that it was expecting rates to fall further. Well, yes. But what really leapt to the eye was the capital performance of the units. Anyone who had paid the full 25p to buy the shares on their initial launch would, after costs, this week have got back only 22.6p. So, a near-10 per cent fall in capital value neatly cancels out the 10 per cent income received over the year. Roughly half the fall can be put down to the initial charge on the fund. But the rest is genuine capital loss resulting from the managers' chosen strategy. The Morgan Grenfell units have also shrunk in value since their launch in September. The stock market as a whole has risen over the period: the FT-SE 100 index, which includes the major companies in which the F&amp;C fund invests, is around 15 per cent higher than when the fund was launched. To be brutal, it has been a very disappointing investment. That, though, is history. What investors want to know now is whether they should cut their losses, or whether F&amp;C has just been going through a sticky patch. Some brokers have started suggesting investors should switch into equity income funds, which have produced far better total returns recently. But switching is always costly. And it is by no means certain that stock markets will provide such a favourable background for other funds over the next year. Does the F&amp;C fund warrant a cold shoulder in its own right? Here are two points to ponder. First, the fact that some capital has been lost already makes it even harder for F&amp;C to produce the goods in future. It will have to run ever faster to stand still. Getting a 9 per cent yield this year could prove as costly in capital terms as getting a 10 per cent yield last year. Second, it is hard to feel comfortable relying on a black box formula that has produced a crash landing on its maiden flight.</p>

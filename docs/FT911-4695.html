			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Cinema merger near collapse THE Dollars 1.4bn merger between General Cinema, the US cinema and retailing group, and Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the loss-making publishing and insurance company, appears to be on the verge of collapse. General Cinema said yesterday that it had failed to reach an agreement with Harcourt bondholders over the purchase of their securities, and that no further talks between the two parties had been scheduled. The takeover of Harcourt by General Cinema, first revealed on January 24, is conditional on 90 per cent of Harcourt bondholders accepting General Cinema's offer of between 32.4 cents and 93 cents on the dollar for Harcourt's junk bonds. General Cinema has said it will terminate the merger agreement if a deal with the bondholders is not struck before the deadline on the offer expires today at 5pm, New York time. General Cinema, which has twice extended the expiry date of its tender offer, said it was willing to raise its bid for the bonds. However, the company said the price demanded by the committee representing Harcourt bondholders was too high. The price of Harcourt's stock and junk bonds fell sharply on news of the breakdown in talks. On the New York Stock Exchange, Harcourt shares had fallen Dollars  3/16 to Dollars  3/8 and its 14.75 subordinated debentures due in 2002 had slipped 5 points to 32 by midday yesterday. General Cinema shares were down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 23 7/8 . Industry analysts said yesterday if the merger deal collapses, another buyer of part, or all, of Harcourt would have to be found quickly if the publishing and insurance group were to have a long-term future.</p>

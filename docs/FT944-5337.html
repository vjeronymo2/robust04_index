			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 Henry Kissinger's Diplomacy (Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 25) is not only far and away my book of the year; it is also one of the best books on the subject ever written. When I reviewed it in May, I suggested that anybody serious should have read it by Christmas. There is still time left. Note especially Kissinger's critical comments on British foreign policy between the two world wars. I also liked Bob Woodward's The Agenda: Inside the Clinton White House (Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 14.99). Not everyone will enjoy the style: very insiderish without giving sources. Yet it goes a long way to explaining how President Clinton reached his present predicament. Lord Howe's autobiography Conflict of Loyalty (Macmillan, Pounds 25) is written in the quiet tone that he uses in speech. Possibly that is why it has been under-rated by some reviewers. In fact, it is well organised and full of material, especially on Europe and foreign policy. It should survive long after some other memoirs of the Thatcher period, and before, have been forgotten.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: NEW PUBLICATION FOR INDEPENDENT BUSINESS  </P> <P> A new magazine aimed at helping small business owners solve their problems is  due out early next year. At first, Independent Business will be available only  to the 560,000 members of the National Federation of Independent Business.  </P> <P> But plans call for expanding the circulation in the future, said editor Dan  Kehrer. "We offer readers a real hands-on approach to running their business,"  said Kehrer. "We provide practical information and share advice from real  business owners."  </P> <P> One feature is called "Troubleshooter." The column highlights businesses that  have run into bureaucratic hassles. The first issue chronicles one firm's  problem with the Federal Aviation Administration and another's hassle with the  Internal Revenue Service.  </P> <P> The magazine itself is the product of small business created by Michael  Carpenter, the publisher; Thomas Sargent, publishing director, and Don  Phillipson, editorial director. Independent Business' editorial offices are in  Westlake Village.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Tips for Those Working at Home  </P> <P> More than 60,000 greater Los Angeles residents are working at home, according  to home-based business consultant Beth Smith. In 1987, 25 million people were  working from home at least part of the time and Smith believes that the number  will double by the year 2000.  </P> <P> Money, independence, freedom, adventure, resentment and frustration about their  other jobs have prompted people to set up a home-based business. Smith, who  frequently teaches courses on the subject, also publishes a bimonthly  newsletter called Business Line. A trial subscription of two issues is  available for $10. A one-year subscription is $24. For information write to  Smith at: 12935 Chippewa St., Sylmar, Ca. 91342.  </P></p>

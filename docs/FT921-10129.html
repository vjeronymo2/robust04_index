			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Technology: A speedy recovery - The London Ambulance Service is improving the way it cares for accident victims Every day in London some 2,000 calls are made to the accident and emergency ambulance service. Each caller has the same motive - to get the victim of a sudden serious illness or accident transported to hospital as quickly as possible. For some patients, however, the prospects of recovery will depend on the quality of treatment received before they reach the hospital gates. The speed with which a patient begins getting appropriate medical attention after a life-threatening incident often influences the chances of survival. This means beginning treatment at the scene rather than in hospital, and Britain's ambulance services are upgrading both their technology and training to make them better equipped for this task. Stage one of any treatment involves the ambulance service reaching the scene of an incident. In London this is not always easy. The London Ambulance Service, the biggest in the world, is currently investing heavily in new equipment and extending the technical skills of its crews. But it has some of Britain's poorest response times. This is caused by the capital's traffic problems and, in a service which serves 7m people, a huge element of unpredictability in demand. While 2,000 emergency calls is the daily average, there were 800 during a single hour of a recent icy morning. Computerisation of the control room at the service's Waterloo headquarters, which begins this month, should improve the speed and efficiency with which ambulances are despatched to incidents. Under the existing manual system details of emergencies are written down by telephone operators and then passed across the control room to despatch clerks. The clerks locate an ambulance from a manually-updated file of available vehicles and relay details of the incident by radio to the ambulance or telephone to its local station. In future the precise location, direction of travel, speed and availability of each of the capital's accident and emergency ambulances will be pinpointed on computer screens in the control room which display street maps of London. The information will be updated every 13 seconds. This moving picture of available resources will make it much easier for controllers to identify the ambulance nearest to an incident, and create a more flexible and mobile service in which the fixed-location ambulance station will decline in importance. A controller receiving a call will type the details into the computer. They will then be transmitted to a terminal in the ambulance. The computer will prompt controllers to ask telephone callers reporting incidents a series of simple questions - Is the patient conscious? bleeding?  -which will help to ensure that the most highly trained crews attend incidents where their skills are required. London Ambulance Service managers also plan an experiment in giving first-aid advice over the telephone while the ambulance is on its way to an emergency. A few basic steps to prevent choking or stem profuse bleeding may preserve life until qualified help arrives. Other measures are also being used to get emergency medical assistance to serious incidents more rapidly. Paramedics patrolling central London on motorcycles are proving their worth at overcoming traffic jams, in some cases beginning stabilisation of patients within a few minutes of a call. The paramedics are central to the current efforts to develop Britain's ambulance crews into a highly qualified front-line emergency medicine service. The government intends that all accident and emergency ambulances carry a paramedic by the mid-1990s. Paramedics are trained to perform life-saving functions like the resuscitation of heart attack victims, the insertion of tubes to maintain airways and the intravenous replacement of fluid after severe blood loss which previously had to await a patient's arrival at hospital. Before attending the initial seven-week paramedic training course ambulance staff must have at least two years' accident and emergency experience and then, after qualifying as paramedics, face periodic re-testing. Medical procedures are usually most successfully carried out by people who perform them regularly. Some ambulance managers believe it could prove counter-productive to have too many paramedics, since they would spend much of their time attending routine incidents which did not require their expertise. Equipment is being evaluated which would enable London paramedics to carry out electro-cardiograph tests, possibly transmitting the images by cellphone to hospital doctors for advice on what action to take. Accident and emergency ambulances are being redesigned with fewer windows to provide more storage space for high-technology equipment such as cardiac defibrillators, resuscitators and traction splints, and to give paramedics a better working area. London's new Leyland DAFs, converted by Customline, carry only one stretcher rather than the traditional two - it is demanding enough for a single paramedic to care for even one patient while speeding through traffic, says Barry Home, the London Ambulance Service's special services manager. Technological advance will continue to increase the range of life-saving equipment which it is possible to load into ambulances. 'But ultimately the decision-making skills of the paramedic are as important as knowing how to carry out procedures and use equipment,' says Home. 'The person on the spot must decide what action to take in what is always a unique situation. It means paramedic training and experience must be of the highest quality.'</p>

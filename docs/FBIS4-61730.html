			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Open letter issued by the chief editors of Minsk NARODNAYA </F> GAZETA, ZVYAZDA, SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA, and MINSKAYA PRAWDA;  date not given: "Belarusian Press on the Brink of Ruin"]    [Text] Dear Readers! It is perhaps for the first time in  the history of Belarusian journalism that we address you with  those words.    The newspapers that we happen to manage reflect political  and  socioeconomic processes in different ways. Sometimes, reality  receives utterly contrary assessments. This is only normal. A  diversity of opinions is one of the main illustrations of social  democratization.    However, the time has come for all disagreements to be put  aside.    The Belarusian press has found itself on the brink of ruin!    Recent days have seen yet another steep jump in paper  prices,  now running between 8 and 10 million rubles [R] per tonne. In  addition, rental payments and prices for printing materials,  publishing, and transportation services have all increased  considerably. The costs of publishing a large-circulation  newspaper are nearing R1 billion a week. Subscription revenues  are only enough for a few days. It stands to reason that while  setting prices for our publications, we tried to make them  affordable for all segments of society. This is a goal any  civilized state should seek.    Unfortunately, neither advertising nor other forms of  commercial activities, to which our papers are forced to resort,  can ensure the continued existence for the press.    We have repeatedly called upon parliament and the government  to undertake urgent measures to protect openness. Top priority  measures include: compensating postal workers for newspaper  shipments, distributions, and deliveries; support of printing  enterprises; a centrally managed system of paper distribution;  and lower taxes. Regrettably, our requests have not been heard.    The situation that has now taken shape forces us to suspend  publication of our newspapers.    This is not a strike, even though there are grounds to call  one. However, aware of the great responsibility assumed by the  press during the presidential campaign, we, for the time being,  decline from applying this legal tool to protect our civil and  professional rights. Editorial staffs continue to work as  normal, and are ready to resume publication as soon as a way out  the present deadlock is found.    Dear Readers: Our conscientiousness is clear in front of you  -- we have done everything possible...    We will also do the impossible, and will try to publish  issues devoted to May Day [1 May] and Victory Day [9 May], so  that we do not spoil your festive mood.    [Signed] Igor Osinskiy, SOVETSKAYA BELORUSSIYA chief editor;  Iosif Seredich, NARODNAYA GAZETA chief editor; Vladimir  Narkevich, ZVYAZDA chief editor; Nikolay Shloma, MINSKAYA PRAWDA  chief editor.</p>

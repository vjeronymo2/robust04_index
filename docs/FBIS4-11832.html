			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, March 31 (AFP) -- An Egyptian human rights  group called Thursday [31 March] for the release of 22 lawyers  held for up to four years for defending Moslem militants.    The Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights said in a  statement the detention of the lawyers was "an act of arbitrary  detention ... in violation of both the Egyptian constitution and  law as well as their basic human rights."    It said most of the lawyers had been "found innocent by the  courts of all charges brought against them" and were being held  despite orders for their release.    "This is a particularly alarming violation in view of the  role that these lawyers play in upholding the integrity of the  law," the statement added.    It said the lawyers had been held because they had visited  and prepared appeals for prisoners charged in terrorist cases  and were falsely accused of passing on information to people on  the outside of the prison.    One of the attorneys, Hasan al-Gharabawi Shihatah, has been  held since 1989 even though he was cleared of all charges in May  1990 and despite 25 release orders, the group added.    It has sent a list of 150 names to President Husni Mubarak  of  people still being held despite being declared innocent.    Islamic militants have targeted banks and foreigners in a  two-year campaign to topple Mubarak's government.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Tuesday: The UK's budget deficit has been falling, with economists predicting a 1994-95 shortfall of Pounds 30bn-Pounds 34bn, below the Treasury's forecast of Pounds 36bn. September figures, published today, are expected to show a borrowing requirement of Pounds 4.3bn. The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey will provide the week's first clue as to activity on the UK high street in September. Wednesday: UK retail sales volumes are expected to have rebounded after a weak August performance. But the picture has been confused by signs of weak personal income growth and buoyant M0 figures. The consensus forecast is for monthly growth of 0.3 per cent. Thursday: Britain's broad money supply growth has been weak during the recovery and September's annual growth rate in M4 is forecast at 4.8 per cent, near the bottom of the 3-9 per cent monitoring range. Friday: Analysts expect a slight widening in the UK's trade deficit with non-European Union countries to Pounds 320m in September, from Pounds 262m in August. But this small deterioration should not alter the underlying trend of an improving UK trade position.</p>

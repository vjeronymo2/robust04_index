			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Syria Conducting Negotiations To </F> Forge New Alliances"]    [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed sources  in London which are in direct contact with the Middle East  crisis have pointed out that there have recently been numerous  indications that new Syrian alliances may emerge in the region  because of the developments concerning the Arab-Israeli  negotiations.    The sources said that, as the United States supplied Israel  with weapons and offered nothing to serve the peace process,  Syria has begun to look once again for allies to supply it with  spare parts and weapons and work again to achieve the military  and strategic parity it had started, that is within new Arab  alliances that could surprise the Arab world.    The sources pointed out that Syria will overturn the  equation  in its relations, which will center on its interests that  secures power for it in the Middle East region. And that it is  currently making secret contacts with Arab parties with which it  has had strained relations in the past.    The sources said that what justifies this is that Syria has  begun to be subjected to great pressures to accept concessions  in its demands vis-a-vis Israel's withdrawal from the Golan and  the occupied Arab territories. And Damascus has begun to urge  the elimination of Arab differences and the restoration of  cohesion among the Arab states.</p>

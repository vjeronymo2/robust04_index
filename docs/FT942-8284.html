			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Craxi may seek refuge in Tunisia Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Italian Socialist leader, yesterday failed to return to Italy and turn himself over to Milan magistrates to answer a string of corruption charges. He now risks becoming the first former prime minister to have an international arrest warrant issued against him. Since losing his immunity from arrest with the convening of the new parliament a month ago, Mr Craxi has made himself scarce. From his second home in Hammamet, Tunisia or from Paris, he has communicated with the press through a series of faxes whose tone alternated between vituperation and self-defence. But the last fax this week was a medical certificate from one of his Tunisian doctors claiming he was ill. Affected by diabetes, he was unable to return to Italy. His wife, Anna, has been besieged at their Hammamet villa by reporters who can find no trace of Mr Craxi in any clinic registers. This has inevitably prompted speculation the disgraced politician is hiding behind the smokescreen of illness to avoid returning to Italy. Mr Craxi himself has frequently claimed he is a victim of a campaign to discredit the Socialist party and fears for his own safety. Of all the politicians involved in the corruption scandals, he is the figure who has aroused the most public animosity. On the rare occasions he stepped out in the street he has been jostled and jeered. Mr Craxi's behaviour suggests either he intends to seek exile in Tunisia or that he is simply playing for time while also being ill. A year ago Mr Craxi is reported to have approached his old French Socialist friend, President Francois Mitterrand, about retiring to France. Even if his request was considered favourably, this diplomatic form of exile became impossible with the arrival of the Balladur government. Mr Craxi wife has powerful friends in the Tunisian government, as well as the Tunis-based Palestinian Liberation Oragnisation, which he secretly helped finance. Lawyers are doubtful whether Mr Craxi could be returned under existing Italian-Tunisian extradition agreements especially as he would claim he was being tried politically. Others who claim to know Mr Craxi well believe he is a wily fighter, who will bide his time to return. He may genuinely be ill and also be waiting to see whether the new Berlusconi government will introduce some sort of amnesty for crimes of political corruption. The magistrates are still ill-disposed towards the idea of an amnesty. Yesterday Milan magistrates announced the arrest of Mr Franco Ambrosio, head of Italgranni and the so-called Naples 'king of grain', and Mr Giovanni Piero Elia, managing director of the Mediocredito Centrale, the state owned credit institute, on corruption charges. Mr Ambrosio was briefly arrested last October regarding the recycling of treasury bonds used as part of the L150bn in bribes paid in the Enimont affair that involved the reorganisation of chemicals industry. It appeared yesterday's arrests were linked to further investigations into the use of these treasury bonds. It is the first time the treasury-owned Mediocredito has been linked to the corruption scandals.</p>

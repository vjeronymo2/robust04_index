And yet, the Commission of the European Union (EU) does  not want to listen to the call for a crisis cartel in either the  steel sector or in other industrial sectors that are  experiencing difficulties.    On 15 February, the European Commission will hold talks with  Eurofer [European Steelmakers Association] on a further  reduction of the production capacity in private steel companies.  EU Commissioner Karel Van Miert, who is responsible for  competition policy, is extremely pessimistic. "We will never  reach the proposed objective of attaining a reduction of 30  million tonnes in the output of raw steel and of 20 million  tonnes in rolled steel."    The steel industry is currently enjoying a slight upswing.  Moreover, it is using the ponderous decisionmaking within the EU  on subsidies for the public sector steel industry as a pretext  for leaving everything as it was before. A number of companies  are requesting that the EU Commission itself intervene in the  mechanism of the market by declaring a crisis situation, as  happened in the 1980's. However, Van Miert does not want to  hear of any such proposal.    Meanwhile, the Germans are pushing for the establishment of  crisis cartels. Here, too, Van Miert has pitifully little  understanding for this idea. "We had a good steel plan. We are  not going to replace it with a bad one," he said. However,  mergers between steel companies will be allowed, provided they  do not give the companies concerned a leading position on the  market for specific products.    If the sector fails to table any plans for further  reductions  next week, the European Commission will have to review its  policy, said Van Miert. For instance, imports from East Europe  would no longer be slowed down, and individual consultations on  the prices of products would be stopped.  <H5>  Zinc </H5>   The call for crisis cartels has never been so clamorous  before, said Van Miert. Various sectors which are currently  experiencing difficulties -- such as the paper industry and the  chemical sector -- are knocking on the door in Brussels. The  zinc sector will also shortly present its agreements for a  10-percent reduction in production.    "As a matter of principle I am extremely reluctant when it  comes to cartel agreements of this kind," said EU Commissioner  Van Miert. As far as possible, Brussels is refusing to commit  itself, unless the crisis in the sector is all too clearly the  result of external factors. However, the European Commission  did tolerate similar agreements between European aluminum  producers, for the crisis in that sector had been caused by  massive Russian exports.</p>

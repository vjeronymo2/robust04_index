Yesterday, security forces engaged a group of 150  terrorists in a clash in the Korugan-(?Kislagi) region. The  area harboring the terrorists was encircled by two battalions  and subjected to intense artillery and mortar fire. Cobra  helicopters were also used. The terrorists, who sustained heavy  casualties, are taking advantage of the 2-meter high snow and  mountainous terrain and carrying their dead and wounded to  Kupgolu area.    Today, security forces began their search operations in the  area of the fighting. During the operations, acting on  information that a group of terrorists descended from Agri  Mountain into the surrounding villages, security forces searched  the villages located between the mountain and Armenia. A total  of 68 persons -- eight organization members, 28 abettors, and 32  wanted suspects -- were captured during the searches. With  these people, security forces seized three Kalashnikov rifles  and large quantities of unlicensed weapons and rounds of  ammunition.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / US ready for unilateral end to arms ban: White House move highlights differences in Bosnia policy Mr Willy Claes, Nato's new secretary-general, yesterday insisted that serious differences with the United Nations over air tactics in Bosnia could be bridged in spite of the failure of talks in New York this week. However, trans-Atlantic tensions over policy towards former Yugoslavia were fuelled by a statement from the White House that the US was prepared to defy its allies and take unilateral action to authorise arms supplies to Bosnia. Mr Claes told Nato ambassadors in Brussels that his hopes of a compromise with the UN rose after a telephone conversation with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general. Nato, under strong pressure from the US, is demanding the right to make more draconian use of its aircraft over Bosnia. It wants the right to carry out air strikes more rapidly, and without prior warning, in response to any provocations by the Bosnian Serbs. The British and French commanders in charge of UN ground troops in Bosnia insist that they are the best judges of how to protect their own men and humanitarian convoys in the war zone. In support of the case for caution, they have pointed out that children were playing in the area where Nato aircraft struck a Serb tank last month. Instead of the current procedure, under which UN commanders specify exactly which target the Nato aircraft should aim at, the Atlantic alliance wants its pilots to be given a range of at least four targets. Talks in New York on Monday revealed big differences between General Bertrand de Lapresle, the UN commander in former Yugoslavia, and senior Nato officials. However Mr Claes - in one of his first diplomatic initiatives since taking over Nato's top job - said he had ironed out some of the problems in a telephone talk with Mr Boutros Ghali. Diplomats said there was room for compromise over the issues of how much warning of impending air strikes to give the Serbs and the selection of targets. Yet the prospects for international co-ordination over Bosnia were clouded by a statement from the White House that President Bill Clinton might act alone in authorising arms deliveries to Bosnia's leadership. Ms Dee Dee Myers, White House spokeswoman, said the US was lobbying for a UN resolution lifting the embargo but added that if that 'doesn't succeed by November 15 . . . then we would look at ways to perhaps lift the embargo unilaterally. 'Our preferred position has been a multilateral lift,' she said. 'We certainly are going to pursue doing it multilaterally, working with our allies, particularly countries that have troops on the ground.' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, defended the UN's decision not to call in air strikes after a shooting incident in eastern Bosnia this week in which the driver of a UN aid convoy was killed. He said ground forces had made a 'vigorous' response by firing back at the convoy's attackers. This demonstrated that 'there were other means available' besides air power as a response to provocations.</p>

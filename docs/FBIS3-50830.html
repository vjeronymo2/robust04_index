The designations were made under the terms of Article 2 of  the constitutional law dated 17 December 1993, which empowers  the Disciplinary Board of Magistrates to designate and evaluate  Supreme Court members and prosecutors.    The whereas clauses of Court Resolutions Nos. 1 and 2  establish that the Disciplinary Board of Magistrates has  conscientiously chosen the best qualified-magistrates for the  posts.    The designated Supreme Court full members are: Luis Almenara  Bryson, Jorge Buendia Gutierrez, Andres Echevarria Adrianzen,  Carlos Giusti Acuna, Pedro Iberico Mas, Elmer Lozada Peralta,  Emilio Montes de Oca Peralta, Luis Ortiz Bernardini, Nelson  Reyes Rios, Javier Roman Santisteban, Lino Roncalla Valdivia,  Manuel Sanchez Palacios Paiva, Hugo Sivina Hurtado, and Elcira  Vasquez Cortez.    The designated supreme prosecutors are Miguel Aljovin  Swayne,  Ana Nelly Calderon Navarro, Blanca Nelida Colan Maguino, and  Pedro Pablo Gutierrez Ferreyra.    The two resolutions established that the Disciplinary Board  of Magistrates will issue, on behalf of the nation, the  certificates to the designated Supreme Court members.    Thanks to the constitutional law promulgated on 16 December  1993, the Disciplinary Board of Magistrates' functions were  expanded to include the designation of members of the National  Council of Magistrates, which is an institution that designates  and evaluates Peruvian judges, except for justices of the peace,  who are selected in elections by the people, as is set forth by  the Constitution approved in the referendum on 31 October 1993.</p>

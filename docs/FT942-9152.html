			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sandoz scales back research pact Sandoz and The Scripps Research Institute of California have scaled back an ambitious joint research pact following complaints that the Swiss pharmaceuticals group would corner the output of a large publicly-financed US institute. The original agreement, announced in December 1992, gave Sandoz first rights to all Scripps medical discoveries in return for Dollars 300m in contributions to the institute over a 10-year period. The revised agreement, announced yesterday, gives Sandoz first rights to only 47 per cent of Scripps's discoveries in return for Dollars 100m in contributions over five years starting in 1997, with an option for a further five years. Sandoz has also agreed to give up its casting vote on a Scripps committee that selects research projects and reduced its planned representation on the Scripps board from two to one. The original deal drew strong criticism from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), which provides Dollars 70m of Scripps's Dollars 120m annual research budget. Ms Bernadine Healy, NIH director, told a congressional subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and technology last June that the agreement 'would give Sandoz excessive control over Scripps.' It was, she said, 'an aberration, and in my view, a dangerous exception to an otherwise successful record of co-operation between industry and NIH-funded institutions.' Mr Ron Wyden, the subcommittee chairman, said the deal amounted to 'a corporate takeover of one of our biomedical research crown jewels'. The revised agreement explicitly acknowledges Scripps's independence. Mr Urs Barlocher, chief executive of Sandoz Pharma, said yesterday the group's lawyers had perhaps been too rigorous in drafting the original agreement. 'It is in our interest that Scripps be independent,' he added. Mr Barlocher noted that publicly-funded research bodies were supposed to help small businesses get access to new technologies, but it looked in this case as if the small businesses were being squeezed out. He said Sandoz would still have the right to look at all of Scripps's discoveries and could select any 47 per cent it wanted. As originally planned, Sandoz would send several researchers to work at Scripps. 'There have never been bad feelings on either side, and we have been able to maintain the spirit of the agreement,' he said. He was pleased the US authorities had accepted the principle that technology developed at a publicly-financed research institute could be transferred to any interested company, including one that was foreign controlled.</p>

Wu Jiapei, deputy director of the State Information Center,  said that China should seize the chance to develop the  information market during the current reform drive.    Now a vast number of institutions offer information  services.  At the least, there are 12,000 professionals in the state-run  economic information system, which has branched into the  country's 30 provinces, metropolises and autonomous regions.    Statistics show that Shanghai, China's largest industrial  city, boasts over 5,000 information organs, six-fold the number  for 1991. Information departments have been set up in almost all  industries.    Moreover, information exchanges have increased. For example,  trading volume reached 24.51 million yuan at an information  meeting in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province last year.    An expert from the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences said  that China's reform drive has resulted in a soaring demand for  information, which is considered key for companies to outpace  their rivals.    The information institutions also have to improve themselves  to survive in tough competition.    Many of them have provided specialized information, with  some  becoming authoritative consultants in certain industries.    Meanwhile, more advanced equipment has quickened information  delivery.    With the development of the economic information market,  legislation has topped the agenda in the field, with a set of  national regulations in the making.    North China's Hebei Province was the first in the country to  formulate and enforce a set of regulations on the economic  information market last December.    Wu said there is still much room for improvement, as most  information currently offered is regional and far from  comprehensive.</p>

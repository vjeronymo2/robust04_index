			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Andrew Longhurst A long spell of uninterrupted peace on a desert island might seem ideal for the complex task of devising a lawful and effective way of sharing the Pounds 1.8bn cash which Lloyds Bank has offered for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society among the society's members. But Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive, would use his time to indulge his interest in computers, French and golf rather than to run his business from afar. You can take one piece of office equipment with you, apart from a telephone and a fax - what would it be? I have not had enough opportunity to play with computers recently, so I would like a powerful PC and modem. My background is in computers; I joined C&amp;G as data processing manager and I read maths and statistics at university. My first act would be to send a message to C&amp;G saying that I retire and I'd use the computer to play Civilisation - it's a very long game that starts in 3000BC and goes on into the future, as you create your own civilisation. How would you cope with life on the island? I'm good at being on my own, but I do like to have the facility of communicating with people. I would hope that occasionally a rescue vessel might offer me a job, so if I got bored I could maybe get on one of those and start a new career. Would you become a beach bum? No - I'd want to maintain a lot of mental activity. But I wouldn't try to stick to a schedule - I'd get up when I felt like it, play on the computer when I felt like it, and so on. When I tired of the computer I would take a sand wedge on to the beach. I can't play out of bunkers at all and it would be a good opportunity to practise. You can take one film with you, what would it be? I'd take Jean de Florette. I admire Jean's tenacity, persistence and will to succeed, even though his farming projects in Provence ultimately fail. And a book? I would hope to have a CD-Rom program called Classic Library 2000 on the computer, which would keep me well supplied with literature. Even if I'm not allowed that, I would still like the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. What food and drink would you like on the island? This ties in with my luxury - 100 tons of best-quality top soil - as seen on Gardeners' World - so I could grow vegetables. The key thing would be that they'd be fresh and I'd have grown them. I'd also enjoy fishing and cooking. To drink I would have New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. You can take one person with you - who would it be? Catherine Deneuve, the French film actress. eI think she would improve my French conversation. How would you like to be remembered? It's not so much a question of liking to be remembered, as liking people to want me back again. I'd like to be missed rather than remembered.</p>

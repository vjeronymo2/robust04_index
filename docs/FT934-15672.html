			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Italian minister quits in row over privatisation MR Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, handed in his resignation last night as a result of serious disagreements over the government's privatisation programme. The minister on Saturday strongly criticised the approach to privatisation by Prof Romano Prodi, the head of Iri, the state holding company. This in turn produced an unusually frank rebuttal from Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, who stated his full faith in Prof Prodi. The row comes at a time when the Ciampi government is trying to accelerate privatisation and Iri is preparing to sell its stakes in two big banks by the end of the year. The essence of Mr Savona's attack on Prof Prodi was that as head of Iri he had no right to presume that privatisation through a public share offering - the chosen route for the state holding's extensive asset disposals - was the best means of divestiture in Italy. Privatisation policy, Mr Savona pointed out, was determined by a government team of which the minister himself was part. Mr Savona said it was more suitable to privatise via the French model, forming a 'hard core' of shareholders in advance to shape the management and policy of the companies and financial institutions being divested. Ammunition for Mr Savona's stance was provided last week by Mr Giorgio La Malfa, the former head of the Republican party. Mr La Malfa attacked the privatisation of Iri's banking interests through a public share offering, claiming that this mechanism would fragment ownership and dilute formal control. In these circumstances, he said, the old politically controlled management would have a good chance of staying on. Prof Prodi at one stage over the weekend offered to resign, but stayed on, having got the backing of the government.</p>

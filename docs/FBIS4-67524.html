			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``95,000 Tonnes of Nuclear Waste Have </F> Been Dumped Into the Seas'']    [Text] According to the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD], approximately 95,000 tonnes of nuclear waste have been  dumped into the world seas.    This was announced by the environmental spokesman of the SPD  Bundestag group, Michael Mueller. The Federal Government dealt  with a corresponding inquiry by the SPD late in the evening  yesterday.    ``Military enterprises are the main culprits,'' particularly  in former USSR, but also in Western countries, Mueller stressed.    Mueller called for a worldwide agreement against the dumping  of nuclear material and a ban of nuclear-powered submarines.    The member of the Christian Democratic Union, Klaus Harries,  suggested controlling the draining of radioactive waste water  from the reprocessing plants in Sellafield (Great Britain) and  La Haque (France).    The Federal Government sees no need to speak of a ``general  contamination of the world seas'' because of the dumping of  radioactive waste resulting from the civilian and military use  of nuclear energy. The European coastal waters (North Sea and  Baltic Sea) are not directly endangered.</p>

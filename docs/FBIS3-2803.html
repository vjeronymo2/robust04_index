Vice-premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen did not hear  the discussions because he held talks with U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher today. He is in the Ningxia NPC  delegation.    Today is the third day of the second session of the Eighth  NPC and all delegations held discussions the whole day.    After he listened to deputies' speeches in the Beijing  delegation, Premier Li Peng said that to achieve a due balance  between reform, development and stability is becoming a common  understanding of the NPC deputies and is extremely important to  accomplish all tasks spelled out by the session and ensure a  sustained, fast and healthy development of national economy.    Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji expressed his views on control over  price hike during a group discussion of Hunan delegation.    In Sichuan delegation, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua joined in the  discussion and made a speech. He said that in order to ensure  healthy economic development, it is necessary to obtain a  rational structure and obtain efficiency. This year great  efforts should be made to try to make loss-making enterprises  improve their performances.    Discussing with deputies in Henan delegation, Vice-Premier  Li  Lanqing said that this year the government will employ legal,  economic and administrative means to keep price rise within a  tolerable scope.    He also urged governments at all levels to pay close  attention to farming and ensure enough plantation of grain and  other farm crops.    During his discussion with deputies from Jilin Province, Li  Tieying, State Councillor and minister in charge of the state  commission for restructuring the economy, said that the current  reform in China covers two important aspects -- enterprise  reform and reform of the macro-economic structure.    Li said that in establishing a socialist market economy, it  is imperative to take enterprise reform as a central link in  which reform of major state-owned enterprises is the key.    Reform of the macro-economic structure is aimed at  establishing a structure which can efficiently exercise control  over national economy with economic law and means as the main  lever instead of administrative lever.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / N Korea attacks US missile plans North Korea yesterday called US plans to bolster South Korea's missile defences 'warlike', and said they should be scrapped if Washington hoped to reach agreement on inspection of the North's nuclear programme, AP reports from Tokyo. 'The US and the South Korean authorities will have to take full responsibility for the consequences to be entailed by their military steps,' the official Workers (Communist) party newspaper said. It did not elaborate. Last week the US disclosed plans to send Patriot missile batteries to South Korea to boost defences against a possible North Korean rocket attack.</p>

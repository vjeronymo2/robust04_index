			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Man In The News: In defence of half answers - Sir Robin Butler When Sir Robin Butler was appointed head of the UK civil service and secretary to the cabinet in 1988, he was said by one admirer to have 'the gift of disagreeing without causing offence'. Yet offence is precisely what Sir Robin has caused this week following his appearance before the Scott inquiry, which is investigating the arms-for-Iraq affair. In a prepared statement, he attacked the damage that he believed the inquiry's procedures had inflicted on the 'system of government, to the reputation of the civil service and to individuals'. Sir Robin also criticised media coverage that had 'permitted wild allegations and prejudging of issues'. The first charge led Lord Justice Scott to urge him to think critically 'about the established practices and convention' of Whitehall. The inquiry has already heard enough evidence to know that something went badly wrong in the handling of policy over arms sales to Iraq and the prosecution of three executives of Matrix Churchill, the machine tools company. Yet it is Sir Robin's assault on press standards that has called down the scorn of commentators. They have contrasted his concern for reporting standards with his justification of the practice of giving 'half answers' to parliament so long as they were accurate. This uncomfortably recalled the tradition of 'being economical with the truth', famously defended by his immediate predecessor, Sir Robert (now Lord) Armstrong. Such public exposure has not, until recently, been part of the job description of the head of the civil service. From his office in Downing Street, Sir Robin heads an organisation of over half a million civil servants who spend more than two-fifths of the national income. He selects the top civil servants who run government departments, is consulted on a wide range of appointments to quangos and other public bodies, and oversees the honours system. He is also responsible to the prime minister for the expenditure and management of the three intelligence services. In his role as Cabinet secretary, he co-ordinates policy-briefing for the cabinet and its committees. Sir Robin is the perfect mandarin from head to toe. At Harrow, the English boarding school, he was head boy. He took a double first in Mods and Greats at Oxford and played rugby for the university. He joined the Treasury in 1961 fresh from Oxford, became a founder member of the Central Policy Review Staff (the Whitehall think-tank) and was in charge of public expenditure in the mid-1980s. He served as private secretary to three prime ministers. He also found time to captain the Whitehall Mandarins cricket team for some years. If all that were not enough, Sir Robin oozes charm, decency and intelligence. He cycles to work from Dulwich, and gives his recreation in Who's Who as 'competitive games'. Such a pedigree might have marked him down as a traditionalist and defender of the status quo. But Sir Robin has been at the top throughout the most far-reaching revolution in Whitehall since the 1854 Northcote-Trevelyan report created the modern civil service. In the past six years, two-thirds of civil servants have been transferred into executive agencies, management has been devolved from Whitehall to front-line managers, and performance-related pay introduced. 'Delegating responsibility to managers and concentrating more on results appeals temperamentally to me, and I've enjoyed doing it,' he says. 'Since there has been bipartisanship over a large part of the programme, I have had no problem in giving a public lead on it.' However, there is a rising tide of public concern over the consequences of these reforms for the standards of the public services. A growing band of critics believes that he should be sounding alarm bells in defence of independence, impartiality and probity. 'There is a feeling that Sir Robin is not doing enough to stand up for the public service in Britain, to maintain the independence of the state,' says one. This band includes some of his fellow permanent secretaries, members of the 'College of Cardinals' who meet him weekly at the Cabinet Office. They have been buffeted by the Citizen's Charter, market-testing and now privatisation. From April, they will be required to lift the veils of secrecy behind which Whitehall's business is conducted. While Sir Robin denies that such worries were behind this week's statement to the Scott inquiry, it will have been welcomed by those urging him to draw a line in the sand over which the civil service will not be pushed. Yet if that was their hope, it has not been fulfilled. Instead, Sir Robin was made to look increasingly ill at ease under the sort of close cross-examination rarely encountered in front of a parliamentary select committee. Mirth greeted some of his replies, laughter in which clearly he could not share. The contrast between the openness of the Scott inquiry and the still secretive ways of Whitehall was starkly displayed. In one sense, Sir Robin has been placed in a difficult position. He became involved in the arms-for-Iraq affair only in 1990 when the prosecution of Matrix-Churchill became a possibility. He has, however, been called upon to account for the actions of ministers and officials since the early 1980s. Yet his for once uncertain touch may reflect the problem that gnaws at the heart of Britain's public institutions. This is the strain they experience in a prolonged period of one-party rule, during which public servants find themselves ineluctably acting more politically. 'In his heart of hearts, I think he would have preferred the government to change at the last election,' says Professor Peter Hennessy, Whitehall chronicler. 'Not because he is a Labour supporter but for the long-term health of the civil service.' Without change, mandarins such as Sir Robin must take on the burden of defending the public service against political corruption. It is not surprising that he is ill-at-ease at being asked to discharge a task that is more effectively exercised by the democratic process.</p>

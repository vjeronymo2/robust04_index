			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, arrested when he tried to enter Zaire under  an assumed name last week, boarded a private plane to return to his exile home  in Saudi Arabia. Amin, who is wanted by the Ugandan government for the torture  and murder of an estimated 250,000 people during his eight-year rule, is  believed to have been trying to make his way back to neighboring Uganda, where  residents say he has a force of 500 guerrillas camped along the Zairian border  awaiting his orders. A high-ranking Ugandan Foreign Ministry official had  called for Amin's extradition to Kampala to answer for thousands of atrocities,  but Zaire chose to deport him instead.  </P></p>

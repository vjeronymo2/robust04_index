			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Billiton: Correction Billiton, the metals and mining business within the Royal Dutch/Shell oil and gas group, made a net profit of Dollars 12m in 1991, not a loss as incorrectly stated in yesterday's report. Billiton has also asked for two other points to be clarified: it never operated a tin smelter in Ireland and it said its UK secondary lead operations are profitable and efficient and it is not negotiating to sell them.</p>

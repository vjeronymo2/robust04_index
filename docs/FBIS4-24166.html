			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Ten thousand people  demonstrated today in districts of Kigali under RPF [Rwandan  Patriotic Front] control, shouting anti- French slogans. In the  meantime, the French soldiers have continued their  reconnaissance mission in the west of the country, in the zones  under the control of Hutu-majority government forces. They have  made progress along the border with Zaire, as reported by France  Inter special envoy, Nicolas Poincare, who is in southwest  Rwanda:    [Begin Poincare recording] After they arrived in Cyangugu  yesterday, the French troops moved toward the interior of the  country today. The commandos have gone up north, toward a town  about which they know almost nothing. They have been to the  east, to a forest, where many Tutsi refugees have been hiding.  Finally, they have been southward, toward Bugarama, where a  refugee camp housing 15,000 people is reported to have been set  up. These French soldiers are not in large numbers, they are  about 200 paratroopers and marine commandos, but they seemed to  be in a hurry to get on with their job. They have been met with  exuberant welcome from the Hutus. The Hutu militiamen had  French flags around their necks. The children carried banners on  which Vive la France were written. At Nyarushishi refugee camp,  the 8000 Tutsi refugees have also welcomed the French troops.  These survivors of massacres were the first to be reached by  the paratroopers yesterday afternoon. They said they have been  under threat for weeks. [passage omitted]    These refugees are now being protected by 60 heavily armed  French paratroopers. They said they slept peacefully last night  for the first time for weeks. [end recording]</p>

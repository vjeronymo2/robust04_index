			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY CAN'T PLAYERS GIVE THEM A SIGN?  </P> <P> Money is tight, but once in a while my 12-year-old son and I are lucky enough  to go to a major league ballgame. When the game is over, my son rushes to beg  for autographs, only to be yelled at, pushed, sometimes smiled at and 80% of  the time ignored.  </P> <P> Who do these players think pays their wages? Do we have to be treated as a  disease?  </P> <P> Do you remember being 12? My son tells me, "Mom, some day I will make it to the  big leagues and I will never turn away from kids."  </P> <P> Here are some players who usually have time to sign autographs: Nolan Ryan,  Brian Downing, Jack Howell, Greg Vaughn, Dan Plesac and Bert Blyleven.  </P> <P> RUTH L. KLOTH  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

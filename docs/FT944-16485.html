			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Survey of Bulgaria (2): Ports are evidence of recovery - Prospects for growth are improving 'If Bulgaria had a serious government committed to rapid privatisation the economy would be in a much better state,' is the standard reply to enquiries about the state of the Bulgarian economy. It is true up to a point. A weak government backed by former communists has been slow in embarking upon a transparent process of privatising, downsizing or actually closing the biggest loss-makers among the several hundred large enterprises which formed the backbone of the former centralised economy. But although precious time has been lost it would be a mistake to conclude that the Bulgarian economy has become a hopeless case. The high rate of clandestine asset disposals through 'hidden privatisation', a 17 per cent unemployment rate, the steady rise in the number of self-employed workers and new private companies and a successful shift to new export markets in the west indicate that significant structural changes are taking place. After four years of declining output and incomes, the economy has bottomed out and gross domestic product is expected to show no growth in 1994 and a modest increase in output and incomes next year, aided by rising demand from both Germany and the former Soviet market. The physical evidence for such a recovery can be seen on the bustling quays of Bulgaria's biggest Black Sea ports, Burgas and Varna. Forklift trucks load pallets of lead and zinc, bales of chemicals and rolls of coiled steel on to ships destined for middle eastern and western markets. Big investments are planned to increase container handling and refrigerated warehouse facilities and raise volumes of oil and gas. Meanwhile, Bulgaria's large merchant shipping fleet of more than 2m dwt, which five years ago mainly served Bulgarian trade, is now 80 per cent hired out to foreign shippers, earning much needed hard currency for eventual fleet replacement. Varna and other Black Sea shipyards also report receiving more orders for new ships than they can handle without heavy new investment and better management methods. Refineries and petrochemical plants, such as Neftochim on the outskirts of Burgas which has been working at half capacity for much of the past three years, also report sharply higher export and domestic demand, and higher profits. At Neftochim, the country's largest refinery and petrochemical complex, a Lv12m loss in 1992 was converted into a profit of more than Lv1bn in the first eight months of this year on sales of Lv25bn, compared with sales of Lv12.4bn in the whole of 1992, although inflation distorts the figures. On the negative side, cumulative inflation over the first eight months of the year reached 65 per cent, about the level for the whole of 1993 and double the projected level agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The combination of sharp Lev devaluation in March and August/September and the resulting push to inflation has cut average wages in dollar terms to about Dollars 75 per month, forcing many workers to take second jobs in the private sector to escape poverty. The private sector now accounts for between 25 and 30 per cent of economic activity, although 90 per cent of industry is still formally in state hands and privatisation remains slow. Significantly, rapid growth in the private sector, especially in tourism, retailing, financial and other services, is being matched by a patchy but noticeable recovery in parts of the state sector, such as steel, metals processing, shipbuilding, shipping and chemicals which have been hard pressed to survive since the collapse of Comecon markets. The prospects for growth have been greatly improved by the successful conclusion of negotiations with Paris Club official creditors and the far more important London Club agreement at the end of June which reduced Bulgaria's Dollars 8.16bn debt to a group of more than 300 western commercial banks by about 47 per cent. The IMF, World Bank and other international financial institutions have pledged nearly Dollars 1bn to help finance the Dollars 716m up-front costs of the debt reduction and rescheduling agreements which will cost Bulgaria an estimated Dollars 300m a year. Thus far the London Club agreement, which re-opens Bulgaria's access to normal commercial bank lending, has not led to the sharp rise in foreign investment and foreign bank interest which followed the earlier conclusion of Poland's similar debt reduction accord. But foreign equity investment has risen from just over Dollars 100m to more than Dollars 500m during the past two years and several small- to medium-sized investments are pending in the brewery, hotel and tourism, food processing and other sectors as the privatisation agency grinds through its paces. Heavy infrastructure investment in telecommunications, roads, bridges, ports, pipelines and railway is also on the horizon as European and international lending agencies gear up to raise Bulgaria's profile as a key link in western Europe's expected fast-improving trade with the energy rich former Soviet states of central Asia and the middle east.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raimundo Lopez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 17 Mar (PL) -- Ricardo Alarcon, president of  the National Assembly of the People's Government, said today  that thousands of proposals from workers are being implemented  to clean up the internal finances of the country.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Alarcon explained that this  is one of the main results of the consultation with the labor  union rank and file to seek alternatives for the recovery of the  national economy.    That process, initiated under the leadership of the Cuban  Workers Federation at the end of last January, concluded this  Wednesday after some 80,000 assemblies attended by more than 3  million persons were held at the work centers.    The workers assemblies, Alarcon said, have served to discuss  collectively the possible general measures. The assemblies have  permitted each worker to express his opinions and discuss them  along with the opinions of others, so as to form a collective  consensus.    I think they have been useful in creating consensus behind  specific actions to be launched at the national level, Alarcon  stressed.    The legislative leader asserted that this aspect is as  important as the identification in each work center of the  problems and the decisions that are necessary "to immediately  reduce costs and improve efficiency."    From this point of view, Alarcon continued, thousands of  proposals and specific measures have been positively identified  and have materialized. Many of these measures are already being  implemented; they are being executed.    Since losing its former socialist bloc commercial partners,  Cuba has faced an adverse economic situation, which in financial  terms is expressed in an excess of currency amounting to over 10  billion pesos -- equal to the U.S. dollar at the official  exchange rate -- a 4.2-billion-peso fiscal deficit, and high  subsidies.    This situation deteriorated further as a result of the  tightening of the blockade the United States imposed on the  island more than three decades ago, which authorities estimate  has caused losses amounting to at least $40 billion.</p>

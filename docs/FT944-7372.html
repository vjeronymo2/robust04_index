			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Move to root out corruption in France Wide-ranging proposals aimed at stemming corruption in French political life were yesterday tabled by an all-party group of deputies in France's National Assembly. The proposals would reduce the share of corporate cash in political party coffers, submit politicians to audits of their personal wealth and make it harder for them to hold national and local posts simultaneously, and increase transparency and controls on the awarding of public contracts. It is unlikely all 18 legislative proposals in the group's 650-page report would become law, even though representatives of almost all the assembly's 577 deputies sat in the group, chaired by Mr Philippe Seguin, assembly president. The reforms could be debated by the assembly in mid-December, he declared. But Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is reluctant to introduce new legislation on corruption, arguing the current investigations of senior politicians and company heads show existing anti-corruption laws are working. To avoid being accused in next spring's presidential election of being lax on the issue, Mr Balladur is likely to react to reforms which Mr Seguin said were aimed at 'helping dissolve suspicion of public officials and restoring confidence in democracy'.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Major decides to defy Euro-sceptics: A ruthless drive to force Tory MPs into line MR JOHN MAJOR has made his choice. This week he stepped in at last to the policy vacuum left by the disintegration of his economic and European policies on September 16. The prime minister will defy the Tory Euro-sceptics by pressing ahead with ratification of the Maastricht treaty. He will seek to ease the process by keeping sterling indefinitely outside the European exchange rate mechanism. The first priority is economic recovery rather than stable prices. So a Conservative party that risked drifting into self-destruction has been given the lead it demanded. Mr Major's dilemma is that a large and angry segment of that party wanted to head in the opposite direction. Next week's annual conference in Brighton will see the first bruising skirmishes in a battle over Europe that threatens to engulf the government until next spring. Mr Major believes he will win. He can be far less certain of the cost the fight will inflict on a government whose authority has been shredded by devaluation. Nor will Maastricht be the last battle. The pro-European majority in his cabinet is content for now to accept a formula that defers a decision on sterling's return to the ERM for up to two years. They accept that Mr Major cannot join battle with the Euro-sceptics on two fronts. Unlike the chancellor, other heavyweights such as Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke have not been singing in their baths. Mr Norman Lamont may feel liberated by the removal of an exchange rate constraint. Many of his colleagues believe the economic and political imperatives that led the government into the ERM have been suppressed rather than removed. So Mr Major is emphasising in private as well as public that he has suspended rather than abandoned his view that sterling is better off inside than outside the ERM. As for the chancellor, Mr Lamont's peers believe he should be safe in the Treasury for the time being. The view around the cabinet table is that the prime minister cannot afford to move a self-declared champion of the Euro-sceptics while the Maastricht bill is in the House of Commons. But few expect Mr Lamont to remain in No 11 Downing Street much beyond next spring. Mr Major's decision to press on with ratification of Maastricht came at Thursday's cabinet meeting. It followed an intense round of contacts with his European colleagues which had convinced him that he could no longer prevaricate. President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl signalled that they would accommodate his political troubles by publicly eschewing any notion that they intended to leave Britain in the slow lane of a two-speed Europe. The quid pro quo they sought was tangible evidence that Britain would ratify the treaty well before a second referendum in Denmark in the middle of next year. Mr Major's counterparts warned him that his agenda for the European Community - completion of the single market; a drive to complete the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks; and commitments to EC enlargement - would be swept aside unless he could deliver on the treaty. Alongside those sticks was a carrot. They accepted Mr Major's judgment that the sceptical mood among the electorates of the Community demanded a clear response from the EC summit in Birmingham later this month. The prime minister was given the go-ahead to draft a declaration committing governments to put flesh on the concept of subsid-iarity - the devolution from Brussels to national governments of intrusive powers. There was agreement also that further declarations buttressing the intergovernmental nature of much of the treaty would be needed to pave the way for the Danish government to hold a second referendum. Mr Major linked that assessment of the mood among his partners with a broader judgment that the damage to Britain's standing would be damaged beyond repair if he sought to renege on Maastricht. He reminded the cabinet that he had extracted critical concessions in the final hours of the treaty's negotiations last December. That would never again be possible if the government did not keep its word. The prime minister was careful to ensure that every member of the cabinet put his or her name to the decision. There was a more fundamental point. In spite of his strong antipathy to federalism, Mr Major remains persuaded that Britain cannot prosper politically or economically on the margins of Europe. For for all the heat generated in recent weeks by the Eurosceptics, he is aware that the assessment is shared by a a comfortable majority in his party at Westminster. As the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher discovered, there is no future for a Conservative prime minister willing to admit that Britain has joined Europe's second or third division. Defeating the Euro-sceptics will not be easy. Party managers are promising a ruthless campaign to force MPs into line. But the signs are that up to 50 Tories are ready to refuse their support and that many more will be have to be coerced. The prime minister will therefore be forced to rely on the opposition parties to get the legislation through. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, is clear that he will not destroy his party's hard-won European credentials by attempting to defeat the bill. But he will seek to maximise Mr Major's discomfort in the protracted guerrilla warfare by Tory Euro-sceptics during the committee stage of the bill. It will be bloody and debilitating for his government. But in the end Mr Major had no other choice.</p>

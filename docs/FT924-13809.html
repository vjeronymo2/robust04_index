			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Consortium pledges support of Pounds 30m in ITN bid A GROUP of four media com-panies yesterday made an offer for Independent Television News, including a Pounds 30m commitment to support the news organisation. The move by Carlton Communications, Central Independent Television, London Weekend Television and Reuters, the news and information group, comes at a time of financial uncertainty for ITN. The news organisation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the ITV companies, is facing a Pounds 25m deficit over the next five years on the lease of its headquarters in London's Gray's Inn Road. An agreement in principle has just been reached on a five-year contract, worth an average of about Pounds 53m a year, to supply news to ITV. The consortium is offering Pounds 1 a share for all of the 400,000 existing Pounds 1 shares in ITN that its members do not already own. The Pounds 30m commitment will take the form of a subscription for new equity. Half the money would be raised by partly paid shares, with the rest on call when ITN needed it. A condition of the deal is that the consortium members would each hold at least 20 per cent. The final 20 per cent of the enlarged share capital would be available to the existing shareholders. Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, said last night: 'ITN is very important to the ITV network. There appeared to be a logjam. This is a solution.' One ITN shareholder suggested yesterday an alternative to the offer could be a mixture of equity finance from existing shareholders, plus a bank loan. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, a majority of the ITN shares is supposed to be held by non-ITV companies by the end of 1994. Because of that, ITN has had talks with three US broadcasting organisations - ABC, CBS and CNN - about the possibility of them taking a stake. Meanwhile, the ITV companies are likely to lobby the government to be allowed to retain a majority stake. Mr Richard Dunn, the chairman of ITN, said last night the consortium's proposal would be considered at an ITN board meeting on Monday. A meeting of all shareholders will be called. There are close links between the consortium members. Carlton is a 20 per cent shareholder in Central and a fellow shareholder with LWT in Good Morning TV, the breakfast television company. Carlton and LWT are also the shareholders in London News, the seven-day television news service. Mr Green is a non-executive director of Reuters. BBC audience fall seen, Page 12</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOUR ETHNIC ALBANIANS SLAIN IN YUGOSLAVIA AS 10,000 DEMONSTRATE  </P> <P> Police on Sunday shot and killed four ethnic Albanians, bringing to at least 14  the number killed in weekend political protests in Yugoslavia's troubled  southern province of Kosovo, witnesses said.  </P> <P> The four were killed as police battled about 10,000 demonstrators in Suva Reka,  30 miles southwest of Pristina, the regional capital, residents said.  </P> <P> Witnesses said police killed at least 10 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in rioting  on Saturday, including four in Orahovac, 190 miles south of Belgrade.  </P> <P> The weekend unrest was the worst violence to hit Kosovo since 28 people died  last year when ethnic Albanians rioted against restrictions on the province's  self-rule. The restrictions were seen as biased in favor of Yugoslavia's  biggest republic, Serbia.  </P> <P> At Orahovac, witnesses said four men were killed Saturday when police opened  fire on up to 2,000 Albanians demonstrating for free elections, the resignation  of local leaders and freeing of political prisoners.  </P> <P> Villagers said at least two other men were killed nearby, and witnesses said  three were shot in Djakovica, six miles from the Albanian border, and one in  Pec.  </P> <P> Local journalists said there were new protests Sunday in Orahovac, but no  details were available.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters believed EPA was unclear in its distinctions between new and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retrofit substitutes. In response, EPA has clarified this difference in this final rule. A tension  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists between deeming substitutes acceptable for as wide a range of end-uses as possible and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing some guidance to users on effective substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested duplicating listings for retrofits and new equipment, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that duplication does not always serve the goal of disseminating information about viable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes. Certain substances may not be attractive for long-term use because they contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFCs, and thus may only be listed for retrofits. Alternatively, substitutes may not be easily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented as a retrofit. It should be noted, however, that an acceptability determination for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in new equipment or as a retrofit option does not imply that the alternative is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unacceptable for use in the other category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The retrofit category within each end-use refers to the use of substitutes with some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification to existing equipment but without changing every component. Generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> speaking, retrofit refrigerants will not require completely new systems or redesign. Drop-in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacements require minimal retrofitting, as in cases where only the refrigerant needs to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replaced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new equipment category within each end-use refers to the use of substitutes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entirely new systems. No existing components will be used. This designation may be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for refrigerants which may require significant design changes. For example, use of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flammable substitute may require some design changes to mitigate potential risk. Submitters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must demonstrate how those risks can be addressed in new designs. In addition, alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies often require entirely different systems. For example, evaporative cooling does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not use a vapor compression cycle, and therefore cannot be used as a retrofit option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of submissions, the retrofit and new use categories should be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate end-uses and listed separately on the submission form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Listing Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Acceptable substitutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These determinations are based on data submitted to EPA and on the risk screen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in the draft background document entitled ``Risk Screen on the Use of Substitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Class I Ozone-Depleting Substances: Refrigerants''. In accordance with the guiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles for SNAP, substitutes were compared both to the substance they replace and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each other.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes the use of all acceptable substitutes presents lower overall risk than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued use of an ozone-depleting substance. Not all substitutes will necessarily be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate choices for all systems within an end-use. Engineering decisions must take into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account factors such as operating temperatures and pressures, ambient conditions, and age of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, especially during retrofits. For example, under industrial process refrigeration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both HFC&hyph;134a and HCFC&hyph;22 are listed as acceptable for retrofits. However, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances exhibit significantly different thermodynamic characteristics, and both may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for use within a given system. EPA believes such decisions are most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately made by the equipment owner, manager, or contractor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Users of HCFCs should be aware that an acceptability determination shall not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construed to release any user from compliance with all other regulations pertaining to class II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances. These include: (a) The prohibition against venting during servicing under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 608, which was effective July 1, 1992; (b) recycling requirements under section 608, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were effective July 13, 1993; (c) section 609 regulations regarding MVACS which were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective August 13, 1992; and (d) the revised production phaseout of class II substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under section 606, which was published on December 10, 1993. In addition, users of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-chlorine refrigerants should be aware that an acceptability determination shall not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construed to release any user from conformance with the venting prohibition under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 608(c)(2), which takes effect November 15, 1995, at the latest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Substitutes are listed as acceptable by end-use. These substitutes have only been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found acceptable for use in the specific end-uses for which they have been reviewed, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in this section. Users of blends should be aware that EPA has evaluated and found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable in each case only the specific percentage composition submitted for review; no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others have been evaluated. EPA strongly recommends that users of alternative refrigerants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adhere to the provisions of ASHRAE Standard 15_Safety Code for Mechanical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Refrigeration. ASHRAE Standard 34_Number Designation and Safety Classification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Refrigerants is a useful reference on refrigerant numerical designations. Users are also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strongly encouraged to contain, recycle, or reclaim all refrigerants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> CFC&hyph;11 Centrifugal Chillers, Retrofit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HCFC&hyph;123.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HCFC&hyph;123 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;11 in retrofitted centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because HCFC&hyph;123 contributes to ozone depletion, it is considered a transitional alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since it poses much lower ozone-depleting risk than continued use of CFCs, EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined that its use is acceptable for these end-uses. In addition, HCFC&hyph;123's GWP and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than almost any other alternatives. HCFC&hyph;123 is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not flammable. Since HCFC&hyph;123 is classified as a B1 refrigerant pursuant to ASHRAE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard 34, ASHRAE requires that a refrigerant vapor detector be placed in the machinery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> room. EPA strongly recommends that users of HCFC&hyph;123 adhere to this requirement and any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other requirements provided in ASHRAE Standards 15 and 34. Worker-monitoring studies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted by EPA demonstrate that HCFC&hyph;123's 8-hour time-weighted average concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be maintained at or under 1 ppm (less than the industry-established AEL of 30 ppm),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided that such standards are followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

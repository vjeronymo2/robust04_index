			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Europe's bright future - Analysts optimistic about market trends STOCK MARKETS in Europe have been powering ahead recently: Germany and Switzerland set records this week while others responded well to news on Thursday of the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts. But is it too late for small investors to join the European bandwagon, or is there still plenty of growth to come? Fund managers surveyed are unanimous in their optimism for Europe's stock markets generally. The consensus is that while there is little prospect of real growth in economies or corporate earnings until late 1994 or 1995, the markets will be driven by investors switching into equities as a result of interest rate cuts. Patricia Maxwell-Arnot, manager of the Lazard European Growth Fund, says: 'I basically believe that European equity markets are supported by two things: bond yields have fallen substantially and may still go down further, and interest rates, whichever way you look at it, are inevitably going to fall. 'Local investors are starting to look more favourably at equities. As yields decline, it is the natural instinct to look first for shares with a high yield, and then at the market generally. Really, what we are talking about in Europe is a weight of money story, and I don't think that is going to change. People argue that valuations are very high, but you can go quite a long way on the weight of money before fundamentals, in terms of p/e ratios, begin to create much difficulty. It is difficult not to be optimistic.' Anthony Bolton, manager of Fidelity's flagship European trust, also has longer-term reasons for his positive view of Europe. He feels there is still significant under-ownership of shares by domestic individuals and institutions in many nations. 'Quite a lot of countries in Europe have got big budget deficits and are desperately looking for ways to cut expenditure,' he says. 'They have ageing populations and are trying to shift the pension fund expenditure from the state to private hands, whether by encouraging funded schemes or private pension schemes. That creates new equity investors.' Bolton also sees the large privatisation programmes under way in Italy and France as stimulating investor demand, rather than depressing the markets. Although there is general consensus among fund managers on the big picture, views differ when it comes to which markets are likely to provide the best performance. Germany has experienced spectacular stock market performance over the past few weeks but UK fund managers are not rushing in. 'I do not like Germany, I think it is overpriced,' says Talal Shakerchi, who manages Providence Capitol's European trust. 'I would prefer to be in other European markets.' Lorna Harnby, one of the team managing the Fleming Continental European investment trust, agrees: 'In Germany, we are still underweight because the effect of low interest rates on the German market is much less marked than elsewhere. We are finding re-structuring stories in Germany  - the classic example is Volkswagen. In the absence of growth, we are making sure we are investing in companies which are re-structuring; they will emerge at the other end leaner and fitter.' France has been popular for some time. Harnby says: 'We are very positive there. We are very overweight in the French market, basically because we think they have got the furthest to fall.' Some investors' enthusiasm is wearing thin, though. 'I think the problem in France is really that although companies have depressed earnings, their stock prices have generally not fallen as much as in some other countries,' says Shakerchi. Switzerland offers a slightly different investment climate. 'It is perhaps a market all on its own,' says Shakerchi. 'Companies tend to have very international earnings - the Swiss have been very good at developing exposure to emerging markets, with operations in South America and the smaller Asian countries. Those areas are growing like mad. It is really quite a different story to the rest of Europe, but it is still an attractive story.' Maxwell-Arnot is also a fan. 'We have been big bulls of Switzerland. Swiss financial shares are relatively under-priced - we have had quite a good run in insurance and in banks.' Scandinavia is popular with most of the managers. Shakerchi sees markets there as offering the best value, along with Switzerland. 'Certainly, many stocks in those markets are well below historic highs. At the end of last year, I was finding a lot of cheap stocks in Scandinavia, he says. If you are looking at the core ERM countries, I think Denmark is perhaps the most attractive.' Maxwell-Arnott: 'Unfortunately, we have been consistently wrong on Scandinavia. I just find the whole market very expensive and, personally, I always try to limit the downside risk by buying things which are cheaply valued. In my view, Sweden is not cheaply valued and the other markets are pretty small.' Italy attracts mixed feelings. Shakerchi: 'The stocks are often very volatile there. They can move up and down by very large percentages, and it is not always apparent why they have done that. What we have tended to do in Italy is just buy a few stocks where we think the long term prospects are very good.' Harnby is also cautious. 'We are neutrally weighted in Italy; there is a very high political risk; and because that is not something you can apply any logic to, we don't want to be anything more than neutral.' Maxwell-Arnot is more positive. 'I do believe they have got their act together in terms of reducing their public sector deficit. If you look over a year, I think the market could be one with the most favourable environment and the best chance of revaluations.'</p>

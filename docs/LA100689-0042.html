			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SWANS SONGS FOR THOSE WHOSE WORLD IS GRAY  </P> <P> Conversation about the Swans used to revolve around pain and power and  amplified jackhammers, and how long it took your ears to stop ringing after you  saw the New York noise band play. They sang about brutality and dominance the  way that Springsteen sings about cars 'n' bars.  </P> <P> These days, the Swans sound more like the early, drony Velvet Underground than  they do like a cement mixer -- they even record for a major label, MCA -- and  Cure fans seemed to outnumber punks at their packed Palace show on Wednesday at  least 3-to-1. The beat is still huge, slow and relentless, but the spaces  around it are filled with "pretty" strummed guitar. It's as if they wanted to  show us that they could make a wall of noise from sad minor-7th chords too. The  Swans live were pretty sleepy stuff, perfect for those whose world is gray.  </P> <P> Michael Gira, Swan No. 1, kind of crooned in a flat, deep voice like some  ungodly mixture of Joe Cocker and Johnny Cash, and thrashed at one-third speed  about the stage like a frontman on a metal video slowed way down. Jarbo, the  keyboardist for most of the set, did as good a Nico impersonation as there's  been in a while, like a Valley Girl doing Marlene Dietrich. JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Howden purchase and Pounds 31m cash call HOWDEN GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineering concern hit hard by a Danish tunnelling contract, has, in an unconnected move, agreed to buy Novenco Industries, a Danish manufacturer of industrial fans, and has proposed a rights issue to raise Pounds 31.4m to fund the purchase and to reduce bank borrowings. Although Howden expects that the total cost of Novenco - which consists of five fan engineering companies - will be about Pounds 22m, the actual consideration will equal Novenco's net asset value at December 31 1992 - expected to be no more than Pounds 7.9m. The UK group will also pick up a 50 per cent interest in a property in Naestved, Denmark, for Pounds 1.3m. On top of that, Novenco's borrowings of about Pounds 7.8m have to be repaid and about Pounds 5m will be needed to integrate Novenco's operations with Howden's air and gas handling division. Mr Alan Maclachlan, Howden company secretary, said that the remainder of rights cash - about Pounds 9.4m - would reduce group debt, which stood at about Pounds 32m at the end of January, and would reduce gearing from 33 per cent to 'nearer the 20 per cent level'. Novenco, which in the year to April 30 made pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.8m on turnover of Pounds 45.3m, makes large and medium-sized fans, said Mr Maclachlan, adding that it accounted for less than 5 per cent of the turnover of Danisco, its parent and Denmark's biggest sugar producer. Howden said Novenco's installed product base was outside its own traditional geographical markets. Novenco is strong in Scandinavia, especially Denmark, the Far East, and has small operations in the UK, Canada and the US. Howden's main markets are South Africa, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and France. Mr Maclachlan stressed that no Howden plant in the UK would close as part of the integration. He added that the resultant spread of the installed base would be good for the provision of spares, a higher margin market than fan manufacture. The rights issue, underwritten by Robert Fleming, is on a 2-for-7 basis at 52p per share. The new shares will qualify for the final dividend in the year to April 1993, forecast to be 1.4p.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Descent from riches to rags: The dire state of the UK's public finances is forcing the government to consider radical remedies The figures are daunting. In the coming financial year, the British government will have to borrow about Pounds 1,000 for every man, woman and child in the country, tapping financial markets for funds at a rate of Pounds 1bn a week. The outlook, if the City of London is to be believed, is even more alarming. In five years, the pessimists say, the government could be borrowing more than 10 per cent of UK gross domestic product a year to plug holes in the public accounts, while the nation's debt to GDP ratio could be 70 per cent and rising. The dire state of Britain's public finances is all the more apparent when measured against the recent past. Three years ago, the public sector ran a large surplus, enabling the government to reduce the national debt. Today, the talk is of cruel choices between tax increases or welfare cuts and of a fiscal rake's progress into a structural budget crisis of Italian proportions. Although prospects for recovery are likely to be uppermost in Mr Norman Lamont's mind as the chancellor prepares his March 16 Budget, the government's announcement this week of an exhaustive review of public spending priorities over the rest of this decade is symptomatic of deep concern about the nation's finances. The official line is that the present problem is cyclical, reflecting the fall in tax revenues arising from the recession and rising costs, such as unemployment pay and other social security outlays such as income support. But serious commentators such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, as well as City securities houses, including Goldman Sachs and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, argue that part of the deficit is now structural. It will not be self-correcting if and when the economy returns to normal growth. Whatever the diagnosis, the chancellor cannot ignore the sudden shift from a Pounds 14.7bn public sector surplus in 1988-89 to a deficit of Pounds 25.7bn in the first nine months of the present financial year alone. The shortfalls in prospect threaten to make a mockery of the government's election manifesto promises such as making further cuts in personal tax rates. Financing the deficits could put a question mark over recovery from recession. But how has Britain got into this mess - if indeed it is a mess? And what does the decline into deficit of the past five years tell us about the outlook for public spending, taxation and correcting the deficit? There would be no deficit problem without the recession. But the recession cannot fully explain the deterioration. Social change, tax reform, political mistakes and electoral politics over the past 14 years have left their mark on tax revenues and public spending, and helped create Britain's deficits. Last November's Autumn Statement gave an important clue as to how the recession affects government finances. It revised upwards the public sector borrowing requirement forecast for the 1992-93 financial year to Pounds 37bn from the Pounds 28bn predicted at the time of the 1992 Budget. The Pounds 9bn worsening in the deficit was primarily due to a Pounds 6.7bn drop in anticipated tax receipts while spending this year was estimated to be Pounds 2.3bn higher than previously forecast. The sensitivity of tax revenues to economic slowdown is not a new phenomenon. Indeed, a drop in the tax burden in recession is an important aspect of the 'automatic stabiliser' mechanism in a modern mixed economy, which helps smooth the business cycle and revive growth. But the tax reforms of the 1980s - and in particular the corporation tax changes initiated in the then Mr Nigel Lawson's Budget of 1984 - appear to have increased the responsiveness of revenues to changes in the cycle. The government benefited from this in the period of strong growth in the 1980s, when the increase in corporation tax receipts contributed about one-third to the swing in public finances from deficit to surplus between 1984-85 and 1988-89. Revenues from corporation tax receipts grew at an average rate of 25 per cent a year in the five years after 1984-85 and were worth more than 4 per cent of GDP, or Pounds 21.5bn, at their peak in 1989-90. But the recession has produced an equally sharp contraction in corporation tax revenues. They fell to Pounds 18.26bn in 1991-92 and so far in this financial year have declined by 18.3 per cent to Pounds 9.97bn from Pounds 12.2bn in the same 1991-92 period. The worry for the future is that corporation tax revenues may not rebound once the recession is over. Their buoyancy in the 1980s partly reflected special circumstances, not least the unusual length of the upswing. Mr Lamont has since cut corporation tax rates below the levels bequeathed by Mr Lawson while companies have a large recession-generated overhang of losses to set against tax. The government's in-depth probe of the annual Pounds 260bn of public spending is a clear admission that something has gone badly wrong on that side of the budget. The departments selected by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, for initial scrutiny - social security, health, education and the Home Office - show where the government suspects structural problems are rife. When Mrs Margaret Thatcher took office in 1979, she was determined to reduce the role of the state in society and cut public spending. In the mid-1980s, the government's public spending objective was modified to 'take a declining share of the national income over time while value for money is constantly improved'. Yet Treasury estimates suggest that general government expenditure (that is, spending by central government and local authorities) less privatisation proceeds in the current financial year ending on March 31 will amount to 44.75 per cent of GDP - more than the 44 per cent share of 1979-80. The recession and the rise in unemployment to nearly 3m from 1.6m in April 1990 partly explain this disappointing trend. According to the latest estimates, each 100,000 rise in unemployment adds about Pounds 345m to the annual social security budget, with Pounds 45m going on unemployment benefit and Pounds 300m on income support, housing benefit and community charge benefit. The fact that this recession has hit the middle classes in the formerly affluent areas of the south-east has added to the government's costs. At the last count, some 411,000 income support recipients were receiving help with mortgage interest payments at an annual cost of Pounds 949m. But spending on social security will be 65 per cent more in real terms in 1992-93 than in 1978-79 and only 25 percentage points of this increase can be explained by the current recession. Between 1978-79 and the current financial year, social security payments have increased as a share of GDP to 13.2 per cent from 10 per cent. Social security expenditure has nearly doubled in nominal terms since 1984-85, when it was Pounds 40bn, to an estimated Pounds 79.2bn in the current financial year. Government figures show that, in real terms, the level of social security spending was higher at the end of the 1980s than after the 1979-81 recession in spite of nine years of growth. The increase in outlays in the current recession has been far sharper than in previous one. These trends reflect changes in society as well as rising unemployment. The number of people over the age of 75 has risen by 22 per cent since 1981; there are more single parents; more of the social security budget has to be spent on the long-term sick and disabled. There is no quick fix to resolving cost increases of this sort. Other changes in public spending have reflected deliberate political choices in response to the perceived needs of society or the wishes of the electorate. Annual spending on housing fell in real terms by 52.4 per cent between 1978-79 and 1992-93. In the same period, the public sector's annual expenditure on trade, industry and energy fell a real 37.5 per cent as a result of privatisation and the elimination of subsidies for ailing industries. On the other hand, the government's annual National Health Service budget has risen by 56 per cent in real terms since 1978-79 and is expected to account for 5.8 per cent of GDP in 1992-93, against 4.6 per cent 14 years ago. Law and order, transport and education have all required more funding, with annual outlays rising in real terms by 96 per cent, 28 per cent and 26 per cent compared with 1978-79. But the UK would be better able to afford such burdens if the past 10 years had not been punctuated by expensive political banana-skins and the prime minister and Mr Lamont had not greatly relaxed their grip over expenditure and taxation ahead of the 1992 general election. Of the political mishaps, the poll tax debacle was the most damaging and costly. The scale of the damage is clear in government figures for the 'new control total', a new spending measure introduced last summer that eliminates most cyclical spending. This jumped in real terms by 5.3 per cent in 1989-90. More than half of this increase (2.45 per cent) reflected a sharp jump in local authority self-financed expenditure as councils rushed to push up spending by a real 35.4 per cent to Pounds 15.6bn ahead of the introduction of the new tax. They acted in the knowledge that they could blame any consequences for taxation on central government: a gamble that paid off in 1991, when Mr Lamont increased value added tax to 17.5 per cent from 15 per cent to pay for a reduction in individual poll tax payments. Government spending on services such as health, education and the police has also risen substantially in response to changed priorities since Mr John Major became prime minister in November 1990. Overall spending on services grew in real terms by 4.16 per cent between 1990-91 and 1991-92, while growth between 1991-92 and 1992-93 has been budgeted at a real 5.97 per cent. Sharp increases in the control total have been budgeted for the current financial year, reflecting the increased spending on services announced before the election. The OECD, in its latest survey of the UK economy, estimates that roughly 30 per cent of the deterioration in the budget balance since 1990 has been due to structural rather than cyclical factors. It calculates that the cyclically adjusted budget deficit increased by about 1.5 per cent of GDP between 1990 and 1992, because of higher spending and reduced revenues. Much of this addition to the structural budget deficit reflected changes announced in the pre-election Autumn Statement of 1991 and Budgets of 1991 and March last year. But what of the future? Here the pundits differ. The OECD thinks the government should increase tax revenues by up to Pounds 10bn to steady the deficit. Goldman Sachs and the IFS see a need to close the annual gap between revenue and expenditure over the medium term by about Pounds 20bn. Looking ahead, Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist at Goldman Sachs and one of the seven-man panel of forecasters appointed to advise Mr Lamont, says that the public sector borrowing requirement in 1993-94 is likely to be about Pounds 54bn or 8.75 per cent of GDP. On a central, and possibly optimistic, assumption of 3 per cent growth from 1993-94 onwards, he says that the deficit is likely to stay at more than Pounds 50bn a year until 1997-98. Mr Bill Martin, chief economist of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, has simulated Treasury growth, expenditure and revenue projections to conclude that the PSBR could still be 2.75 per cent of GDP in the 1997-98 financial year, lifting Britain's stock of debt to some 50 per cent of annual national output compared with about a third at present. He warns that a more pessimistic scenario, which assumes lower growth and rising public spending in line with electoral demands, would produce a deficit of about Pounds 80bn in 1997-98. This would be equivalent to 10.25 per cent of GDP and result in a public debt to GDP ratio of 70 per cent that would still be rising at that stage. However, some experts, such as Mr Chris Trinder, research director of the Public Finance Foundation in London, warn against panic reactions to such deficit forecasts. The PSBR is the difference between two big numbers, and forecasts have been notoriously wrong in the past, Mr Trinder points out. Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and another of Mr Lamont's seven advisers, is also fairly sanguine. He says that some of the discretionary loosening of policy in recent years has been good for the economy, while the Maastricht treaty provides for deficits of up to 3 per cent of GDP. Until recently it seemed that the Treasury might be coming to terms with the deficits. In evidence to the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee last autumn, Mr Lamont cast some doubt on the Treasury's stated goal of balancing the budget over the economic cycle. While asserting that this was still the government's objective, he added: 'That has never ever meant taking the sum of the borrowing over the years and saying that it should sum to zero.' However, Mr Portillo's investigation of public expenditure points the other way. It is a reaffirmation of the government's determination to reduce public spending as a share of national income and leave wealth creation to the private sector.</p>

			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Prison officers urged to fight criminal justice bill Delegates from the Prison Officers Association were yesterday urged to mount an intensive campaign against government legislation which they fear will neuter their trade union rights. Mr Brian Caton, association vice-chairman, said the government's proposed criminal justice reforms were an attack on the POA's democratic right to represent prison workers and would only perpetuate troubled industrial relations. Delegates at a meeting, held at the Trades Union Congress headquarters in London, were told they should lobby their MPs to change the criminal justice and public order bill. Clauses in the bill make it an offence for anyone to induce a prison officer to withhold his services and for any officer to refuse to perform a duty imposed under prison rules. The association says the measure will have 'profound consequences for free collective bargaining' because it will allow the home secretary to regulate pay. It will also enable parts of a prison to be managed separately by different private companies, and require prison officers working in the state sector to transfer to private jails if necessary.</p>

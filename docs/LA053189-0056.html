			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHILD-ABUSE UNIT ACTIVE, DUFFY TELLS GRAND JURY  </P> <P> Sheriff John Duffy, responding to a San Diego County Grand Jury report critical  of the disbanding of the sheriff's child-abuse unit, denied Tuesday that the  unit was ever shut down.  </P> <P> Duffy's denial came as a surprise to Susan Golding, chairwoman of the county  board of supervisors. "If that's the case, it's certainly something he could  have said a long time ago," she said, adding that the board was told that the  specialized unit had ceased to exist. In a written response released Tuesday,  Duffy criticized a grand jury recommendation that the county allocate money  specifically for the child-abuse unit, saying it would "hamstring" his  effectiveness as sheriff. However, Golding said the board of supervisors is  likely to honor the grand jury's request in its upcoming budget deliberations.  </P> <P> The grand jury, in a report released April 20 that addressed the dismal state  of the county's system for dealing with abused children, recommended that the  Sheriff's Department immediately re-establish the child-abuse unit Duffy said  he would disband after a series of volatile disputes last summer with the board  of supervisors over the sheriff's budget.  </P> <P> During the board's budget deliberations then, Duffy complained of not receiving  enough money to keep his department afloat, and threatened to shut down the  child-abuse unit and other specialized units as a result.  </P> <P> County agencies have 60 days in which to respond to grand jury reports.  </P> <P> </P> <P> They Thought It Was Dead  </P> <P> Both the board of supervisors and the grand jury believed the child abuse unit  had been subsequently disbanded. "The information we had received was that it  had been disbanded as a unit, even though there were still officers responding  to child-abuse calls," Golding said Tuesday.  </P> <P> But in his written response to the grand jury report, Duffy said that "contrary  to popular belief," the child-abuse unit had never been disbanded, only  "decentralized." Six deputies who had been assigned to the unit were  transferred to outlying substations, where they continued to work on  child-abuse cases, Duffy said.  </P> <P> The shuffling of personnel was part of the sheriff's "emergency redeployment  plan," which took effect Nov. 1, because money for basic services had not been  provided by the county, Duffy said. "The potential for adversely affecting  officer and citizen safety was becoming increasingly severe. I therefore found  it necessary to formulate plans to staff these basic functions on a temporary  basis with personnel from other areas of the department," the sheriff wrote.  </P> <P> The proposed county budget for the fiscal year starting July 1 includes an  $18.8-million increase in the sheriff's budget, which Duffy said will fund  "most of the critical vacancies." All of the "redeployed" personnel are  scheduled to return to their original duties July 1, and the child-abuse unit  will resume business as usual at its centralized station, according to Duffy.  </P> <P> The grand jury report also suggested that the county specifically allocate  money for the child-abuse unit -- money which could not be diverted to any  other use.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fought Recommendation  </P> <P> Duffy fought the recommendation by citing the County Charter, which gives him  authority to organize the sheriff's department. "I must be allowed the  administrative flexibility to address internal resource allocation needs,"  Duffy wrote, adding that to do otherwise might threaten the public safety.  </P> <P> Though the county has traditionally permitted the sheriff to decide how to use  the money allocated for his department, Golding said it is legally possible for  the board to designate the use of certain funds. "I can't speak for the rest of  the board members," Golding said Tuesday, "but at the moment I would say the  likelihood is that we would" allocate money specifically for a child-abuse  unit.  </P> <P> The board of supervisors will begin deliberations on the county budget June 26.  </P></p>

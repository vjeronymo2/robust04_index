			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / CBI urges faster settlement of bills MEASURES to speed the payment of bills by large companies to thousands of small suppliers were proposed yesterday by the Confederation of British Industry. The CBI said small businesses are estimated to be owed more than Pounds 100m in overdue debts at any one time. It urged large companies to declare their payment policies in annual reports rather than give a detailed calculation of the average time taken to settle bills as urged by the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Richard Brucciani, CBI smaller firms council chairman, said: 'The problem of late payment requires a change of culture and attitude in business, and a published statement of corporate payment policy would give suppliers a useful insight into this. 'It would also expose directors to scrutiny and provide a basis on which they and their auditors could be tackled for poor payment practices in breach of their stated policies.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] At a news conference today, the parliamentary  opposition presented its plans for the negotiations to be  resumed with the ruling HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] on 31  May. Jasenka Dudic has the report.    [Dudic] We insist on the legality, democracy, and respect of  the agreement, and the opposition will not back down on this  because it believes that the legislative authorities must be an  example in honoring those principles. However, the opposition  is ready to make concessions, but it also has its own  conditions. Drazen Budisa [chairman of the main opposition  party, Croatian Social Liberal Party] had the following to say:    [Begin Budisa recording] We are ready to repeat the  procedure  in the Chamber of Counties from the point at which it was  suspended. We are prepared to be flexible concerning  appointments, but the repetition of the procedure in the Chamber  of Counties would, of course, demand that everything revert to  the initial situation in the Chamber of Deputies. The positive  fact, which in a way indicates the HDZ's flexibility, is that  they are also ready to pass a confidence vote in Mr. Mihanovic  [new president of the Chamber of Deputies] in the Chamber of  Deputies. [end recording]    [Dudic] The opposition believes that the HDZ will show  flexibility in the future too, and that a solution will be  found. Failing this, the opposition will resign from all its  parliamentary posts. If the crisis continues, the opposition  believes that early elections are becoming increasingly  possible. The opposition stresses that, although it is ready,  early elections are not its aim. It wants to solve the  parliamentary crisis in line with the Constitution, the code of  practice, and the agreement. [passage omitted]</p>

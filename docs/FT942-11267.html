			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: A confusing state of Haitian affairs Sir, I am a bit confused. Former US President George Bush has suggested to current President Bill Clinton that the US discontinue its efforts to return President Aristide to power in Haiti because he lacks sufficient support there ('Clinton toughens stance against Haitian junta', May 4). He also feels that it would be a mistake to intervene militarily because 'no US lives are at risk in Haiti today'. Since when has US policy in central/South America aligned itself with the wishes of the local population? And when did 'US lives' and not 'US interests' become the driving force in policy decisions?

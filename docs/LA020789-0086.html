			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKHEED TO CUT UP TO 800 JOBS AT AERONAUTICAL SYSTEMS UNIT  </P> <P> Lockheed will eliminate 700 to 800 jobs during the next year at plants in  Burbank, Palmdale and in Santa Clarita under company plans to reduce operating  costs, a Lockheed spokesman said Monday.  </P> <P> Spokesman James Ragsdale said the jobs will be cut through retirements and  normal attrition in addition to layoffs. He could not say what percentage of  the job cuts would come through layoffs, but he noted that in a normal year,  200 employees retire and several hundred more leave for other reasons.  </P> <P> The Lockheed division affected by the cuts, Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Co.,  has reduced employment by almost half, to 15,400 workers, as production of  various aircraft -- such as the L-1011 commercial airliner and the P-3  submarine surveillance plane -- has been phased out over the past eight years.  </P> <P> Although some of the lost jobs will be salaried, many will be wage positions  paying $13 to $17 per hour. The company is seeking to reduce its operating  costs by 13% in 1988.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the union representing the company's hourly workers said it had  been told as recently as December that the company hoped to avoid further  reductions. Ragsdale said he was not aware of such statements to the union.  </P> <P> "We had gotten indications that things should pick up in the early 1990s," said  Don Nakamoto, editor of American Aeronautics, the newspaper of the  International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, District 727. He  said the company hoped to avoid any job reductions in 1988.  </P> <P> Nakamoto said Lockheed's $600-million contract to design an updated submarine  surveillance aircraft should create more jobs at plants in Burbank, Palmdale  and elsewhere. But Nakamoto also said Lockheed planned to continue reducing its  Burbank operations, moving production activity north to Palmdale and elsewhere.  </P> <P> "It is an alarming situation," Nakamoto said. "We realize that this is due to  the fact that there is a lull period in the production cycle, but our members  are worried about it."  </P></p>

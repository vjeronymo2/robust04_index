			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Books: A closet full of Oscars LONG DISTANCE RUNNER: A MEMOIR by Tony Richardson Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 17.50, 313 pages WHEN TONY Richardson was a schoolboy during the second world war Yorkshire was bursting with live theatre. His friend William Gaskill explained why in A Sense of Direction: 'With the war British theatre had become decentralised; the Old Vic and Sadler's Wells had moved to Burnley under the direction of Tyrone Guthrie and tours were sent all over the North'. The Bradford Civic Playhouse not far from Shipley where the Richardsons lived had a full-time professional theatre school. Donald Howarth, Bernard Hepton and Robert Stephens started there. Gaskill and Billie Whitelaw regularly attended Esme Church's acting classes. With an enunciation of the English language that harked back to the days of Beerbohm Tree, Miss Church was a dominant force among stage-struck locals. 'One person she didn't dominate (Gaskill continues) was Tony Richardson, the son of a pharmacist who lived down the road. His elongated figure and squeaky drawl singled him out in the artistic circles of the West Riding. He was iconoclastic about anything that was sentimental and old-fashioned. He would return from trips to London or Stratford with a description of the newest work by Peter Brook, the 21-year-old whizz-kid, and pour scorn on all our sacred cows.' Richardson's iconoclasm continued when he and Gaskill went to Oxford where, with John Schlesinger, they dominated the student theatre after Tynan had departed. Both of them went on to try their luck in London and after some years of obscurity both made theatrical history at the Royal Court Theatre. Whereas Gaskill has remained faithful to theatre as an art-form and is currently directing at the Cottesloe, Richardson aimed at and won all the glittering celluloid prizes . . . Sloane Square and Shaftesbury Avenue, leading via British film studios and Broadway, to Hollywood. Richardson's astonishing trail of success and devastation was similar to Alexander's; after Los Angeles there were no more worlds left for him to conquer. He simply had to live there mucking in as a permanent resident, even abandoning for long periods his idyllic rural retreat, Le Nid du Duc near La Garde in Provence. He died of Aids in November 1991 at the age of 63. Shortly after his death his family discovered, in an obscure cupboard where he kept his Oscars, a manuscript written six years before and set aside. His eldest daughter, the actress Natasha Richardson, remembers asking him what he was writing: ''I'm having a go at my life, a sort of memoir'. 'How great,' I replied  - to which he guffawed, 'No it's not, it's not interesting, it's shit and very boring but I'm doing it as a kind of exercise'.' To publish it now, posthumously, just as it is, was obviously the right decision. In the breezy, ruthless, incisive, spontaneous manner, that all who knew him remember so well, the book gives us a fine overview of Tony Richardson's career seen through the glowing eyes of its chief participant. Much of it makes invigorating reading. It reveals his joy in adventurous foreign travel as much as his dedication to work. He was a great believer in location shooting and the two were were frequently combined. His candid character-sketches of many of the theatrically great and good whom he directed - John Gielgud, Katherine Hepburn, Tallulah Bankhead, Kim Stanley, Joan Plowright, Mary Ure, Hugh Griffith to mention but a few - are often masterpieces of insight. Whatever his reservations he is never mean or ungenerous. He is especially acute about Olivier: 'At heart Larry was what the French call a cabotin. The term is difficult to translate - not exactly a ham: a performer, a vulgarian, someone who lives and dies for acting. The grand seigneur was one of the roles he played, but at heart it was foreign to him. And at heart he knew or perhaps he didn't know at the time - that his attempt to transform Vivien into a great classical actress was a failure.' Richardson's account of his collaboration with John Osborne will be collated by future biographers with Osborne's account of Richardson in Almost A Gentleman. Although they became estranged after making The Charge of the Light Brigade the mutual indebtedness is made abundantly clear on both sides  -as is the great debt both careers owed to George Devine, about whom Richardson writes with particular warmth. Richardson's tracing of the fortunes of the Royal Court Theatre up to and especially after the great seasons of 1956 (Look Back in Anger) and 1957 (The Entertainer) will be disputed; indeed, they have already by Lindsay Anderson in his introduction. A glaring omission is any mention of Richardson's homosexual liaisons. He never confesses at any point there was a gay side to him. But there are many discussions of his affairs and would-be affairs with women. His courting of Vanessa Redgrave opened in bizarre fashion. He sent her a letter while in the same restaurant. It was delivered by hand to the table where she was being wined and dined by Bernard Levin. As she did not have her reading-glasses, it was read to her by an angry Bernard. Was ever woman in this humour wooed? Was ever woman in this humour won? While married to Vanessa, Richardson directed Jeanne Moreau and fell hopelessly in love. The affair gave Richardson's life a fresh turn and led to his living in France. But his passionate affair with her was like a real life re-play of Jules et Jim and did not last. Richardson pays tribute to his enduring relationship which followed with Grizelda Grimond, by whom he had a daughter. All of Richardson that ultimately matters is here. The less attractive, the callous manipulative side is best forgotten. Richardson approached friendships not merely as if they were games of chess but as if they were games of simultaneous chess. He was a theatrical Kasparov turning from board to board, moving rapidly on each, his head teeming with brilliant calculations. He kept one so busily absorbed in one's own game one never knew what was happening on the other boards. Reading Long Distance Runner one can at last find some of it out.</p>

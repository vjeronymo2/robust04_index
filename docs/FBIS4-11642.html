			<p>BFN     [Text] The Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has  received a delegation of the Foreign Policy Association in  Denmark which is currently visiting Jordan. During the talks,  the prime minister reviewed the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations  on the Middle East. Here is more:    [Begin al-Majali recording] In fact, discussing, rather  [than] negotiating because, still, Israel hesitant on getting on  the principles of the negotiation. In other words, the  principle items, which is the occupied territories, which is  water, and refugees. These three. And they want us to  negotiate on tourism, on energy, on trade, on, on, on, on, which  is what we call the items of normalization rather that to solve  the principles.    Now, as I said, going back to our thinking or a state of  mind  that in peace negotiation nobody should be the winner or the  loser, all should be gaining. We did innovate an idea where we  put all the items on the same level. No priority. All have the  same priority. And then we went further and we suggested to  them, and they accepted, that we put them into baskets. Now in  each basket we put items which we want, items which they want  and we discuss them at the same time.    Unfortunately, so far, for reasons of their own, they are  not  coming through for this negotiation. They say: Look here, we  cannot discuss or negotiate occupied territories, withdrawal  from the land, or shares of water. Let it be this at the very  end when we have the peace treaty.    In other words, I just want to be very quick. They want to  put the agenda upside down. In other words, the last word on  the agenda was the peace treaty to be put on the top and now we  negotiate peace treaty and then these items will come through.  [end recording]</p>

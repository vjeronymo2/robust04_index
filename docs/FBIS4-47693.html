			<p>BFN     [Text] East London April 30 SAPA -- The strike that  paralysed vote counting in Transkei and other parts of the  Eastern Cape is over. IEC spokesman Mike Chandler said from  regional headquarters in East London that the strikers had  received assurances from IEC head office in Midrand that their  pay claims were receiving attention. He said cheques were being  airfreighted to the Eastern Cape.    Counting in Transkei only started after midday Saturday [30  April], when the strikers returned to work.    The strike had also been called off in the Queenstown  sub-region and counting stations there were operational.    Chandler said there had been a late start to counting  throughout the province.    Some areas had transport problems in getting ballot boxes to  counting stations. Others had problems contacting IEC head  office for the permission required before they could begin  counting.    There had also been some problems in the reconciliation of  ballot papers in Port Elizabeth, and counting started a "little  later" there as well.</p>

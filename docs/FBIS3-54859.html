Elections"]    [Text] Volodymyr Hrynyov and Leonid Kuchma, who have  formed the Interregional Bloc for Reforms, held their first  press conference last week. All the questions asked by  journalists basically brought up three issues: The upcoming  elections, the economic situation of Ukraine, and prospects for  its relations with Russia following the victory of the  Zhirinovksiy party in the elections for parliament. Strange as  it may seem, the journalists first brought up the third issue.    No doubt, Leonid Kuchma said, I would prefer to see a party  supporting Yeltsin get the majority of the votes. There is  nothing we can do about it. People who voted for the Liberal  Democratic Party voiced in the first place their discontent with  economic failures and general impoverishment. At the same time,  stressed Mr. Kuchma, one should not dramatize the situation --  Zhirinovskiys come and go, but Russia will always remain. For  all pledges of help, no country of the world community provided  any tangible economic aid to Ukraine. So whether you like it or  not, the success of our economic reforms is impossible without  close ties with Moscow. In addition, the strong union of Russia  and Ukraine would secure the geopolitical peace in the region.    Mr. Hrynyov approached this issue from a different  perspective. The worst thing for me, he said, is not that  Zhirinovskiy won but that the centrist forces have failed. This  should become a good lesson for us. We must seek to unite  democratic forces.    Another question was whether the Interregional Bloc would  cooperate with Rukh in the elections, how close this cooperation  would be, and if it was possible that both organizations might  recall their candidates in favor of one another.    We are ready to cooperate with all progressive forces, said  Hrynyov, that put the individual above the rest of the values.  The individual, society, and the state -- this is the order of  preference that holds sway in civilized countries.  Unfortunately, Rukh is currently cooperating with organizations  that advocate quite the opposite principles. However, I do not  rule out forming electoral blocs in the hinterland.    Mr. Hrynyov noted that he firmly stands for a federative  division of Ukraine. In his opinion, this presents sizable  economic advantages for the country. As for regional  authorities, it is easier for them to decide what enterprises  should be privatized, put up for auction, sold, or simply shut  down.    Mr. Kuchma was just as specific on this issue. He prefers  the German option of state division, where with a strong central  power, local parliaments retain a considerable portion of power,  which provides them with efficient economic leverages for the  local economies. In that country, rights go along with  responsibilities. Although local authorities there funnel  substantial funds to the federative budget, they actively  influence industry, agriculture, and trade in their regions.  Otherwise, they would go bankrupt. In Ukraine, however, some  of the oblasts live at the cost of their neighbors.    Leonid Kuchma and Volodymyr Hrynyov were pretty skeptical  about government activities, seeing the main thrust of its  efforts being -- to put it mildly -- misdirected. They also  think that during a transition period, it is impossible to build  a strong economy without a strong government. Unfortunately,  neither the executive branch nor the president's actions can be  called strong.    In a usual straightforward manner, Mr. Kuchma made it clear  that Ukraine is now facing the question: To be or not to be?  Unfortunately, we are sharing the same oil bucket with Russia --  and if we fail to pay that country for energy sources, we are  going to kick this bucket.    Our correspondent asked why our living standards dropped  ten-fold at a time when production decreased only by half.  Leonid Kuchma said that production should not necessarily slump  proportionately to the drop in living standards. There are some  enterprises, for example, that could be closed without people  ever noticing this. However, there are more difficult cases. As  an example, he cited the Southern Machine-Building Plant  [Yuzhmash]. While this enterprise manufactured up to 60,000  tractors per year, its present output is one tractor per day.  Gas supplies to the enterprise were reduced by 90 percent. We  used to say restructuring and reform. These are all merely  words -- in reality, we were basically destroying the economy.</p>

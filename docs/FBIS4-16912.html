			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1625 GMT on 19 April carries a 10-minute program on  the process leading up to the statement by Russian President  Boris Yeltsin urging the Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde.  Presenter Sergey Dorenko opens the program by saying that "at  1617 GMT today the Russian president's statement on the Bosnian  crisis came out. You, perhaps, already know about the  aggravation and about the fact that the Serbs are in direct  conflict with UN forces. I wrote it down as it was dictated to  me by telephone -- we have just talked with the president's  press service -- and I will try to recount what I have grasped:  The president said that the situation has reached a point of  dangerous confrontation. The Serbs have been requested to  withdraw from Gorazde immediately, to let the UN contingent  pass, to unblock all UN forces, all UN contingents. Also, the  Russian president's invitation to the United States and the  European Community to hold a summit on the Yugoslav conflict  with Russia's participation was confirmed. Signed by Yeltsin,  Russian president".    Dorenko goes on to update the situation in the Bosnian  region  and international reaction to the aggravation of the crisis. He  says that "since about 1100 GMT today Moscow has been in  turmoil, as we have learned from our sources. The text of the  above presidential statement on the Bosnian crisis was being  decided. The statement could have appeared earlier if  everything had been clear regarding it. After 1100 GMT Vitaliy  Churkin met [Duma Chairman] Ivan Rybkin, an hour later he was in  Vladimir Shumeyko's office, at 1415 GMT he reported to his  minister, Andrey Kozyrev. Before that, at 1405, he cancelled  his promise to take part in our program live. Incidentally, he  pleaded indisposition -- a diplomatic excuse, one should think.  The Foreign Ministry was not ready for an publicly announced  decision. I will venture to speculate about why there was such  a big delay with the statement. The thing is that the Foreign  Ministry did not have a unanimous view. We believe that Andrey  Kozyrev tried to foresee the development of events and was  afraid to acknowledge Russia's clear fiasco in the Yugoslav  crisis, while Vitaliy Churkin, who was in charge of the Serbs  and could forfeit his career because of his protegees'  disobedience, said straight away that he placed all  responsibility on them and described their actions as betrayal.  Both Foreign Ministry officials could not ignore a third view  which maintains that we must fight on the side of the Serbs. It  seems that it is for precisely this reason that Vitaliy Churkin  spent so much time in Rybkin's and Shumeyko's offices. His  refusal to be here live shows that his stand was gaining ground  with great difficulty".    Further in the program, over archive footage of 'Arafat's  activities, Sergey Dorenko comments on Yasir 'Arafat's visit to  Moscow and its goals. He sees Russian involvement in the Middle  East peace process as yet another attempt by Russian diplomacy  to assert its major international standing. But the Yugoslav  lessen should serve as a warning.    Dorenko concludes by reminding the viewers that the program  was the first to announce Yeltsin's statement on the Bosnian  crisis.</p>

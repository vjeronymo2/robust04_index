			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Flash news from Reuters Reuters has not done badly in the 10 years since flotation. Its earnings per share have increased 8.32 times over that period, its share price more than nine times. No-one pretends Reuters can match that record in the next decade. Nevertheless, the company is one of the few FT-SE 100 stocks that promises organic revenue growth of more than 10 per cent a year for the foreseeable future. Reuters may achieve even more if it can successfully leverage its financial markets expertise into new fields, such as medical information. Add a splash of multimedia appeal as Reuters diversifies into television and radio and it adds up to a compelling investment story. Still, the market was not in such stargazing mood yesterday. Instead it knocked 5 per cent off Reuters' shares, chiefly on worries about the slight shrinkage of operating margins. That, though, owes more to recent acquisitions, such as Quotron, which have inflated the revenue line but have  -as yet - contributed no extra income. The continuing doubts about Globex also cast a shadow out of proportion to its financial significance. Moreover, the success of Instinet and Dealing 2000/2 should more than compensate. The real issue therefore is not whether to buy Reuters but what premium to pay for it. The market may have pushed the rating far enough for the time being especially as Reuters' new orders have softened this summer. But as the charms of cyclical recovery stocks fade when the UK interest rate cycle turns, Reuters should come back into its own.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Political Notebook: A chancellor-in-waiting John Major has six weeks in which to reshuffle his cabinet. Beyond the first week of January, the timetable for the March budget will make it impossible to change his chancellor. Without a switch at the Treasury, a reshuffle would not be worthy of the name. We are told the prime minister has not given the issue much thought. He has one or two other things on his mind - the economy, the Edinburgh summit and the arms-to-Iraq scandal among them. Mr Norman Lamont has concluded he is safe. He may well be. Many on the right of the Tory party at Westminster are not so sure. They are campaigning for a continuation of the status quo, warning the whips that Mr Lamont's departure from the Treasury would shatter the uneasy calm on the back benches. But the most striking element of this less-than-discreet lobbying is not their loyalty to the chancellor, but their fear of his most likely successor. Mr Kenneth Clarke has emerged from the chaos of the past two months as indisputably the most powerful minister in Mr Major's cabinet. As home secretary, officially he ranks third in the pecking order. For different reasons, though, his influence has eclipsed both that of Mr Lamont and that of his close friend and mentor Mr Douglas Hurd. One - slightly jealous - colleague who has watched him at close quarters says that the home secretary has been transformed by events since Black Wednesday. Where others lost their nerve, Mr Clarke reinforced his authority. It is partly a question of temperament. After seven years on the front line  -at employment, health, education and latterly the Home Office - Mr Clarke is one of the government's most experienced firefighters. Once dubbed the thinking man's lager lout (in fact he can't abide the stuff) he has learnt to rein in his instinctive pugnacity, replacing it in public with a more controlled self-confidence. After the sterling debacle, Mr Clarke appeared almost daily on the nation's television screens to state calmly that, yes, the government had suffered a huge setback, but now it was getting on with the job of picking up the pieces. When Downing Street wanted someone to appear on a BBC Panorama programme to defend the prime minister against (erroneous) charges that he had suffered a nervous breakdown, the home secretary was the natural choice. In the process, Mr Clarke quickly established himself as the 'bus' candidate should Mr Major suffer a nasty accident. But what really frightens the Tory right is that he staked a compelling claim also to what will remain for some time the toughest job in the government - running the economy. Black Wednesday persuaded Mr Clarke to broaden his horizons. He has never made a secret of his strongly pro-European views. Nor has he hidden a conviction that the pound cannot for long be excluded from any European-wide effort to stabilise exchange rates. Hitherto, he has been relatively circumspect about promoting his cause. The resurgence of the anti-Maastricht, anti-ERM forces within the party persuaded him that the other side of the argument had to be put loudly and clearly around the cabinet table as well as to the wider world. He sees Britain's return to the ERM as a question of when rather than if. He is ready, if it proves necessary, to advocate higher taxation to close the ever-widening gap in the nation's finances. He was one of the strongest advocates of protecting capital projects in the spending round. Mr Clarke is proud of his label as a One-Nation Tory. He wore it again this week when he told the Tory Reform Group that the emergence of a dispossessed underclass in the inner cities represented the greatest threat to civilised democracies. So the right has cause to be fearful - but those who seek to bracket him as an old-fashioned Wet make a serious mistake. If he is unencumbered by the baggage of theoretical monetarism, he is adamant that low inflation is the prerequisite for a successful economy and a less divided society. An unashamed meritocrat, he is as dismissive of Tory paternalism as he is as some of the more extreme ideology of Thatcherism. His call this week for a drive to help the poor and disadvantaged offered free-market rather than statist solutions to their deprivation. His speech to the TRG was peppered with allusions to the enterprise culture and to individual responsibility. He sees his principal task at the Home Office as taking on the 'producer' interests represented by the police and the prison officers. But above all, Mr Clarke he has proved himself confident and robust during crises. With no immediate prospect of economic recovery, there will be plenty more of those for the chancellor. The question Mr Clarke's admirers are asking is whether Mr Major has the confidence to give him the job.</p>

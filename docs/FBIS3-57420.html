Sergey Shakhray: `I Could Not Care Less About My Own  Status'"]    [Text] Sergey Shakhray, former vice premier, is now deep  in thought on the issue of retaining the post of nationalities  and regional policy minister in the new Cabinet. Shakhray's  doubts have been brought about by a rather dubious status  assigned to him in the Cabinet. Instead of "the man in charge"  of regional policy, which has been Sergey Mikhaylovich's duty in  the past several years, now he thinks of himself as a "front,"  just like Gaydar and Fedorov who have already left the  government. Questions of regional and nationalities policy are  now simultaneously in the "supreme jurisdiction" of two vice  premiers -- Yarov and Zaveryukha.    Shakhray's efforts spent over the two past years in seeking  to settle relations with Tatarstan now appear to be simply  undone. At present, problems related to the future treaty  between Russia and Tatarstan are being discussed in other  offices while the minister himself learns about them from press  reports. "Only after I stated this to INTERFAX did they phone  and invite me to study the draft treaty," Sergey Shakhray said  in an interview with MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS.    The situation that has developed over Chechnya is even more  unpleasant. No one is paying attention to Shakhray's directive  not to treat representatives of the Chechen government as  leaders of an independent republic. Chechnya Vice Premier M.  Mugadayev visits Viktor Chernomyrdin in a perfectly official  capacity. "Now the regional leaders, especially from Chechnya,  do not wish to talk to me. They know there is no way of fooling  me," Sergey Mikhaylovich comments.    Phone conferences with the regional leaders are now held  behind the minister's back.    "I could not care less about my personal status," Shakhray  says. "But this year the fall of the ruble is threatening the  collapse of Russia's state integrity. This is evident to all.  It is sad to see which conflicts are brewing and know what  needs to be done to `remove' them but have no real power to do  so."    According to Shakhray himself, he has 10 more days to think.  During this time decisions on the makeup of the Council of  Ministers Presidium and on the distribution of duties in the  government are to be promulgated. "Then it will become clear  what the composition of the executive branch will be like, and I  will make the final decision," Shakhray says.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Books: A Grecian affinity - JDF Jones admires the work of Mary Renault MARY RENAULT: A BIOGRAPHY by David Sweetman Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 18, 322 pages MARY RENAULT - real name Molly Challans - was an English, Oxford-educated, professional nurse, lesbian, mildly reclusive, who lived in South Africa from 1948 until her death in 1983 and who wrote a sequence of the most remarkable and successful historical novels of this century. As this workmanlike and readable biography shows, she made a difficult transition from her half-dozen 'contemporary' novels, usually setting bisexual themes against a hospital background and climaxing in The Charioteer (surely it cannot be 'the best British novel to come out of World War Two') to eight novels which are extraordinary in the depth and detail of their evocation of daily life in ancient Greece - The Last of the Wine, The King Must Die, The Bull from the Sea, The Persian Boy, etc. The most surprising thing about this is that she scarcely knew Greece: she went there on holiday only twice - in 1954 (including a single day in Crete]) and in 1962 - and appears to have had no particular affection for its modern manifestation. She was no classicist but she did not shirk her scholarly research, which evidently was as indispensable to her fictions as her imaginative genius. The child of a sad marriage, she had studied at Oxford in the years when Gilbert Murray was giving his famous lectures and the Ashmolean was benefiting from the discoveries at Knossos of its former curator, Sir Arthur Evans. She drifted for years, signed up as a nurse at the Radcliffe, met her lifelong partner, Julie Mullard, wrote her first novels, worked through the war, and moved to South Africa (to the suburbs first of Durban and then of Cape Town), where she was active in the Progressive politics of her adopted country. David Sweetman argues that she was consciously aware of a parallel between the moral decisions offered to private citizens in fifth century Athens and 1950s South Africa, but that hardly seems central to her creative achievement, where her identification with ancient Greece has something uncanny and unforgettable to it. She discovered Jung fairly late - 'a most exhilarating peak-in-Darien feeling' she commented, and added, with true wit, that the travails of Theseus in The King Must Die should have been called The Mother Strikes Back. If this biography has a thesis, it is overstated: that she was 'a key figure in the sexual revolution of the twentieth century'. True, her portrayal of homosexuals as central characters in her novels probably helped to change public and middle-brow attitudes, and she had a cult gay readership, especially in the US. 'The Last of the Wine was a rite of passage, The Persian Boy a gift for young male lovers. Gay bookshops in San Francisco had prominent 'Renault' sections', Sweetman notes. Her books became part of the curriculum of the new university discipline of Gay Literature. But she was much more than that: I suspect that her novels will survive, and not just in the bookshops of California and the tourist kiosks of Crete. The King Must Die has just been re-issued by Sceptre (Pounds 5.99)</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / UK Company News: BET sells hire side to Hewden Stuart HEWDEN STUART, the plant hire company, is buying Hireplant, a general plant and tool hire business, from BET for Pounds 10.8m in cash. The deal is being partly financed through a placing, organised by James Capel, to institutional shareholders of 6m new ordinary shares each at a price of 119p. The shares closed up 2 1/2 p at 121p yesterday. Hireplant has some 400 employees, operates 24,000 items of plant and has its head office near Oxford. It is an amalgamation of the general plant and tool hire activities of BET, the business services company, which until about two years ago traded under their own names. Hewden Stuart will acquire the 29 freehold properties and 10 leasehold properties through which Hireplant operates. Its depots are spread throughout the UK, although many are located in the Midlands and south of England. Five are in Scotland, under the name of Bob Tait Plant, which has a separate operation with its own head office. Current budgets of Hireplant, for the year ended March 311994, estimate turnover of Pounds 16m and a trading loss of Pounds 500,000.</p>

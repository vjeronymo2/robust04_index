			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: New fund to target Vietnam A new international fund which aims to raise up to Dollars 100m for investment in Vietnam will be launched at a Japan roadshow next week before being offered to investors in the US and Europe, the managers said yesterday. The management company of the Vietnam Frontier Fund, which is to be listed in Dublin, is 70 per cent controlled by Finansa Thai, a Bangkok-based merchant banking group, 20 per cent by stockbrokers HG Asia, and 10 per cent by NX Oanh Associates of Vietnam. Among the directors are Mr William Colby, former head of the US Central Intelligence Agency, and Mr Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a former minister in the South Vietnamese regime and adviser to the present Vietnamese communist government. If successful, the new 10-year fund will be the fourth such group targeting Vietnam; the other three have raised some Dollars 170m, but finding viable investments in Vietnam has proved a slow process and investors in the latest fund will pay out only 50 per cent of their commitment at the start. The fund, which is to be marketed by Nomura in Japan and by HG Asia elsewhere in the world, will attempt to take advantage of Vietnam's rapid economic growth by investing in a range of property, industrial, mining, infrastructural and other projects. This will include companies being privatised or partly privatised by the Vietnamese government. 'This is the first institutional fund that is being targeted at Japan and the US as well as Europe,' said Mr George Morgan of HG Asia in Bangkok.</p>

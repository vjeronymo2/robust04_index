			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Alitalia faces tough cuts instead of subsidies A tough restructuring plan to cut mounting losses at Alitalia, the national carrier, will be the first test of the Italian government's resolve to avoid subsidising state companies and prepare them for privatisation. The plan has yet to be made public but the three-month-old board of Alitalia unveiled its broad aims this week. These included 'a sizeable reduction' in the group's 18,000 personnel, mainly among ground staff; more flexible employment for pilots and cabin crew; better use of the fleet; and 'decisive action' on spending. The outgoing Ciampi government approved plans for paying 800 early retirement pensions as a means of shedding staff. But the new restructuring plan appears to be much more radical than this. The tone of some members of the Berlusconi government suggests considerable hostility to the instrument of early retirement as a way of balancing the books. If this is translated into action, Alitalia could face a similar confrontation with unions as did Air France. Unless measures are agreed quickly to cut Alitalia's losses, the company has warned it will have to call a special shareholders' meeting and might have to write down some capital. During the first quarter of this year losses reached L190bn (Dollars 118.75m) against losses of L345bn for 1993 as a whole. On Monday, a company statement blamed the figures on a combination of the depressed state of international economies, airline overcapacity, a drop in business travel and fierce fares competition. Last year Alitalia made L791bn worth of investments of which L580bn went towards five new aircraft and L146bn in equity interests. This also helped push up the company's debt which rose from L694bn to L1,645bn in 1993.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Adverse exchange rates hold Scapa back to Pounds 20m ADVERSE exchange rates held back growth at Scapa, a manufacturer of papermaking and printing equipment with a third of its business in the US, as it revealed virtually flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m for the first half. Mr David Dunn, finance director, said the weak dollar in the first half had depressed US profits by Pounds 1.4m. However, if the effects of the pound's devaluation continued throughout the rest of the year, 'the big hit in the first half would be reversed'. Acquisitions in the US, Europe and Scandinavia helped Scapa report an 11 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 156.9m for the six months to September 30. Mr Bill Goodall, chairman, said all of the group's divisions had 'turned in encouraging results' given the difficult market conditions. Europe showed the strongest growth, with sales up 84 per cent to Pounds 41.3m and operating profits jumping 66 per cent to Pounds 4.4m. Mr Dunn said the increase was solely due to the acquisitions of Scandiafelt of Sweden and an Italian filtration company. These had more than offset a setback in engineered rolls, which had been affected by the decline in installation of papermaking equipment. Sales in the UK remained steady at Pounds 55.4m (Pounds 55.6m), although profits fell 17 per cent to Pounds 4.24m. The industrial materials division in the UK had been 'the one bright spot in the UK', Mr Dunn said, with significant benefits from integrating some of the Italian filtration business. Sales in North America were Pounds 3m lower at Pounds 52.2m when translated into sterling, although they actually increased in dollar terms due to acquisitions. Mr Dunn said that stripping out currency factors and acquisitions, sales had been totally flat. Operating profits fell 5 per cent to Pounds 11.9m. North America was proving the most favourable of Scapa's sectors, said Mr Dunn, although as yet there were no reliable trends. The dividend was increased by 5 per cent to 1.6p. Earnings per share were depressed by exchange rates, and the Pounds 55.6m rights issue in May 1991, falling from 6.2p to 5.7p. COMMENT Scapa has been running hard to keep up and it appears to be succeeding. Margins are under pressure, but not as severely as had been expected. Management has so far moved quickly to cut costs, thus retaining a competitive edge as paper manufacturers begin to use fewer suppliers. The downside of protecting margins has been an increase in stocks and debtors, adding an even heavier working capital burden to an already investment-hungry business. This might ease a bit in the second half, but not by much. Further growth should come from more acquisitions - Scapa has a Pounds 70m cash warchest - and a hefty currency gain if the rates stay anywhere near current levels. Forecasts are for Pounds 47m which, on a prospective p/e of about 16.5 times, leaves the shares looking fairly valued.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Copper takes a severe hammering THE BATTERING which most base metal prices have taken from the recession finally caught up with the copper market this week. Prices showed signs of things to come on the London Metal Exchange on Monday, when three-month copper fell below support at Dollars 2,155-Dollars 2,160 a tonne and touched five-week lows. But dealers were looking for fresh support at Dollars 2,130, although they believed falls to Dollars 2,100 were possible. In the event, copper closed on Tuesday at Dollars 2,090 a tonne - a fall of Dollars 52 a tonne on the day. Analysts blamed substantial selling from the Far East and China for forcing the market down so sharply. The Chinese have previously been in the market as buyers. Mr Neil Buxton, of Metal Bulletin Research, said copper had been defying economic gravity since the recession began, and had had the greatest potential of all the base metals for decline. But every time the price seemed under threat, an interruption to supplies or Chinese buying had come to the rescue. It appeared unlikely that rescue would be at hand this time, he suggested. Stocks were rising, and there were no supply problems. On Wednesday the rout in the copper market continued. In after hours trading three-month metal fell below the psychologically important Dollars 2,000-a-tonne level. In three days the market had fallen Dollars 185 or 8.5 per cent. On New York's Commodity Exchange (Comex) the active May contract hit the lowest level seen since the contract began trading in 1988 - 86.95 cents a lb. 'It's technically oversold, but I don't see anybody wanting to step in front of this,' a New York analyst told the Reuter news agency. LME traders were expecting Wednesday to be volatile as options were declared. In the event about 5,700 lots of 'put' options - equivalent to more than 143,000 tonnes of copper - were exercised. Although this was an unusually large number, Mr William Adams, analyst with Rudolph Wolff, said it was 'in the price'. Brokers had seen the copper price retreating from Dollars 2,400 at the beginning of the year and had acted to manage the risk. In the longer term, according to Mr Lawrence Eagles of GNI, the London futures brokers, it should be remembered that copper production will not be reined in until prices fall below 70 cents a lb. He pointed out that Chilean producers have a marginal cost around 35 cents a lb, and will continue to expand production. On Thursday LME copper remained volatile. Japanese buying in early trading took the market up to Dollars 2,055 a tonne, but further Chinese sales eroded the gains. It closed at Dollars 2,016 a tonne. Copper is still traded in sterling on the LME. Cash copper closed on Thursday at Pounds 1,305.50 a tonne, down Pounds 105.50 on the week. Two studies of the aluminium industry warned on Monday of a lack of primary aluminium smelters that will leave the supply-demand balance very tight by 1996, forcing prices up to high levels. Both suggested that a price of 75 cents a lb (USDollars 1,653 a tonne) was needed before the go-ahead for any new smelters would be given. Prices are very far from that level at the moment, and any tightness of supply also seems a long way off in a week when LME warehouse stocks advanced by 18,000 tonnes to a record 1,754,425 tonnes. Three-month aluminium touched a new 16-month low of Dollars 1,125 a tonne (51 cents a lb) on Wednesday before edging back to Dollars 1,126. The three-month aluminium price closed on Thursday at Dollars 1,140.50, down Dollars 6.75 on the week. Zinc and lead, however, have been supported by news of production cuts in Canada and Mexico which analysts estimated would remove about 110,000 tonnes of refined zinc and 74,000 tonnes of lead from the market this year. Empresas Frisco of Mexico has suspended operations at its Real de Angeles zinc-lead-silver mine and Curragh Resources has stopped producing concentrates at its Faro mine in the Yukon. These follow recent reductions by MIM, Pasminco, Cominco and Noranda. Mr Buxton, of Metal Bulletin Research, suggested that lead had reached a turning point after the recent decline. Cash lead closed on Thursday at Pounds 282 a tonne, a rise of Pounds 8 on the week. The cuts in lead and zinc production are also restricting the supply of silver, which is often a by-product. 'The silver supply could be restricted regardless of the price,' said Mr Eagles of GNI, pointing out that Peruvian silver production fell by 11 per cent last year. However, the silver price has slipped in the past week along with other precious metals on the London bullion market. It closed on Thursday at 385 cents a troy ounce, down 9.5 cents. Gold closed at Dollars 336.95 a troy ounce, down Dollars 2.80 on the week, as profit taking took its toll after last week's run-up. Platinum closed Dollars 6.75 down on the week at Dollars 358.75. Of the softs, sugar has proved the most interesting as New York raw sugar has fallen back from its three-year highs. The May contract, which touched 12.52 cents a lb on Monday, retreated below 11 cents on Wednesday as the funds and commission houses bailed out. Fears of tight supplies appear to have disappeared this week, with the Cuban harvest expected to come in near 6m tonnes. But the dominant factor in ending the recent run has been the total lack of physical purchases at the high prices, said Mr Eagles. Next week London Fox is expected to announce major changes to its raw sugar market. Its present contract traded just 1,399 lots last month.</p>

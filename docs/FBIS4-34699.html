			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Azucena Lievano from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today in a communique, President-elect Ernesto  Samper said he is very concerned about the international  repercussions of the bold statements made by Andres Pastrana.  Samper's communique said: "I will not establish an electoral  dialogue with the candidates defeated in the recent elections."    President-elect Ernesto Samper said his position today  remains unchanged since yesterday. He reiterated the accounting  books of his campaign are in the hands of the prosecutor, who  has begun an investigation. He explained that those who are  involved in irregular actions will not participate in his  administration.    [Begin Samper recording] I want to reiterate my commitment  to  having my campaign funds open to review. I also want to  reiterate my unyielding resolve to continue fighting drug  trafficking. [end recording]    Samper also referred to the journalist implicated in this  episode.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What kind of  relationship is there between you or the campaign and the  journalist?    [Samper] None whatsoever. This journalist is not even a  member of my party. [end recording]    Meanwhile, amid the controversy, Samper devoted time today  to  the homeless of Cauca Department. The governors of Indian  communities today requested assistance from President-elect  Ernesto Samper because, according to them, their living  conditions following the tragedy are subhuman.    Samper met with the homeless who have been relocated to (?La  Plata de Infalz) and he pledged to develop specific actions,  through the Agrarian Bank and other institutions, to help them  get back on their feet and move to safer areas.</p>

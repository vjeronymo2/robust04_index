			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Assembly was informed today that  Pakistan has thus far paid $658 million to the United States for  the F-16 planes. In a written reply during the question hour,  Defense Minister Aftab Shaban Mirani disclosed that the delivery  of these aircraft to Pakistan was scheduled to begin in April  1993, but the supply was stopped due to the Pressler Amendment.  He said negotiations are under way with the U.S. Government on  this issue.</p>

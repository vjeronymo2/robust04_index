			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Company earnings woes upset bourses WORRIES about corporate earnings, combined with fading hopes on interest rate cuts, depressed bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was hit by disappointing news from the luxury goods group LVMH and the insurer UAP, and disappointment on the interest rate front. The CAC-40 index fell 24.62 or 1.4 per cent to 1,749.86 in modest turnover of FFr2bn. LVMH fell FFr231 or 6.1 per cent to FFr3,570 on news that sales in the third quarter fell 7 per cent, and the company's forecast that 1992 net profit would be close to 1991 due to a slowdown in growth in key markets and the recent currency turmoil. UAP dropped FFr19.50 or 4.8 per cent to FFr388 on news of a 59.5 per cent fall in first-half net attributable profit. The shares were also depressed by news that UAP would inject more than FFr1bn, the top end of market forecasts, into its Banque Worms unit. UAP's results upset Axa, which is due to report today. Its shares fell FFr31 to FFr780. Paribas fell another FFr6.50 to FFr324 as analysts downgraded their 1992 earnings forecasts following Tuesday's news of the bank's decision to knock FFr500m off the sale price of Ciments Francais. FRANKFURT took the view that the Bundesbank will not cut interest rates at today's council meeting and then fell sharply in late trading on rumours of dividend cuts and downgrades in the banking sector. The DAX index closed down 23.47, or 1.5 per cent at 1,510.30 as turnover rose to DM5.9bn from DM4.6bn. Although the market believed that there would be no cut in the Lombard rate this week, after the Bundesbank left the securities repurchase tender unchanged, some analysts held out for a cut by mid-November. Rumours that Deutsche Bank might cut its dividend this year took its shares down by DM17.30 to DM657.00. Dresdner Bank slipped DM12 to DM357 on rumours that it planned a rights issue and that its earnings prospects had been downgraded. Commerzbank was off DM7.00 at DM245.50. Linotype went against the trend, rising DM23 to DM359, after saying that it expected to pay a dividend and would show an operating profit this year. MILAN rose in active trading, encouraged by the bigger-than-expected fall in yields at the BOT auction. Stet and Sme, re-admitted to trading after Tuesday's suspension, attracted the most attention. The Comit index rose 8.16 to 427.05 in turnover estimated at more than L200bn after L139.8bn. Sme rose L111 or 2.3 per cent to L4,849. Dealers said the stock was in demand on persistent hopes that Iri would sell its controlling stake, in spite of recent denials, and that minority shareholders would be bought out. Stet, which had recently fallen on news of its purchase of Finsiel, jumped L120 or 9 per cent to L1,440. Its strength raised worries among some dealers that the company might be preparing the ground for a rights issue. Savings shares in Italmobiliare were temporarily delayed from trading for excessive gains while the ordinary shares rose L1,770 or 5.3 per cent to L35,300 after Tuesday's news on Ciments Francais. ZURICH weakened, with chemicals depressed by an earnings downgrade on Ciba-Geigy on Tuesday. The SMI index closed 18.4 lower at 1,909.0. Ciba-Geigy registered shares lost SFr9 to SFr604 while the bearers were SFr7 lower at SFr620. Nestle, rumoured to be interested in bidding for Sme of Italy, saw its bearers down SFr10 at SFr1,010 while bearers in UBS, which reports third-quarter figures today, lost SFr6 to SFr829. AMSTERDAM reversed Tuesday's rise with a fall in the CBS Tendency index of 0.2 to 104.6. Philips, down 60 cents at Fl 19.60, began to be affected about worries of disappointing third-quarter earnings next week. DSM, which releases its interim figures today, rose 30 cents to Fl 85.00: expectations are for third-quarter net profit of between Fl 70-80m, down from Fl 102m in the same 1991 period. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden general index rose 3.2 to 726.1. Turnover fell to SKr302m from SKr402m. COPENHAGEN's all share index fell to a new year's low, down 0.51 at 250.42 as the banking sector came under presure, writes Hilary Barnes. BRUSSELS, however, was lifted by banking stocks which rose on optimism about interest rates. The Bel-20 index closed 5.25 higher at 1,135.21 in turnover of BFr1bn.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 28                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           Open     10.30     11.00     12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1035.62   1035.24   1035.63   1031.15 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1096.59   1097.31   1097.69   1096.18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes          13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1029.06   1028.05   1027.40   1028.09 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1092.62   1094.80   1092.15   1091.64  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Oct 27    Oct 26    Oct 23    Oct 22    Oct 21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1038.79   1038.16   1034.38   1021.53   1015.54 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1100.79   1104.46   1108.83   1095.16   1087.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1036.21; 200 - 1101.20 Low/day: 100 - 1026.52  200 - 1090.92  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE HAWK'S NEST INCIDENT AMERICA'S WORST INDUSTRIAL  DISASTER BY MARTIN CHERNIACK MD; FOREWORD BY PHILIP J. LANDRIGAN MD AND ANTHONY  ROBBINS MD (YALE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $10.95)  </P> <P> During the years of the Great Depression, a marvel of civil engineering  comprising a dam, tunnel, power station and plant, was erected in the hills of  West Virginia. For years, Union Carbide boasted "that the Hawk's Nest  hydroelectric plant could illuminate the entire city of Charleston."  </P> <P> Yet the untold story of this monumental achievement is the cost in human lives:  By conservative estimates, more than 750 workers, mostly migrants and mostly  blacks, died from acute silicosis, an occupational, inhalant-induced lung  disease, in the construction of the great three-mile-long Hawk's Nest Tunnel.  </P> <P> The number of deaths caused by silicosis may well have been higher, Martin  Cherniack posits: Workers would have been evicted from the camps when they were  no longer able to work. Cherniack, a physician and former researcher at the  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, has reconstructed this  epidemiological tragedy of 50 years past from courthouse archives of the lives,  deaths, grievances and physicians' reports as well as from interviews with  those who worked in the tunnel.  </P> <P> Despite such handicaps as physicians' misdiagnoses of the condition and Union  Carbide's crucial deletions of documents "related to work on the tunnel,  allegations of silicosis, or the hundreds of legal actions that were brought on  behalf of former workers," Cherniack has worthily retrieved from historical  oblivion a major disaster in the history of industrial health.  </P></p>

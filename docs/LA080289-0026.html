			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK HATCHET JOB?  </P> <P> Residents of Burbank's Rancho area said a private tree-trimming company hired  by the city butchered neighborhood trees to make room for a power line.  </P> <P> Trees were cut into flat-top and V-shaped forms, Burbank electric services  manager Greg Simay said. Most of the trimmed trees are along a four-block  stretch of Parkside Avenue, with some trees along Mariposa Street and  Morningside Drive also cut.  </P> <P> Simay said two people have complained to the city about the trimming. In  response, City Councilman Michael Hastings has proposed that the city review  its tree-trimming policy.  </P> <P> "It's not so much that the job needs to be done, it's how it's being done,"  said Jim Vorhees, a Mariposa Street resident who also is a member of the  Burbank Civic Pride Committee. "It's just a hatchet job."  </P> <P> The trimming was needed to create a five-foot clearance for a 4,000-volt power  line along Parkside Avenue, Simay said.  </P></p>

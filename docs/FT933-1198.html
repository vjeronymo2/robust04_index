			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (24): Braced for a bruising battle - France / After the currency crisis in August, Alice Rawsthorn assesses the problems facing Mr Balladur as his government tries to kick-start the economy EVEN Mr Edouard Balladur, France's usually unflappable prime minister, must have winced when he read a recent letter from a group of bankers in Liberation newspaper, attacking the 'ayatollahs of the strong franc' for the damage they had wreaked on the French economy. Mr Balladur, who had cast himself in his first four months as prime minister as the chief proponent of the franc fort policy of protecting the French currency, had just emerged from the humiliation of the August currency crisis when the speculative assaults on the franc had left his monetary policy and the European exchange rate mechanism in tatters. France, like its fellow European Community member states, had been forced to broaden its ERM fluctuation margins from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent. So far the franc has proved to be surprisingly stable in the wake of the crisis. Moreover, Mr Balladur's popularity has remained intact. He still has the highest approval rating at this stage in his tenure of any prime minister in the Fifth Republic apart from Mr Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who reigned over the Hotel de Matignon during the 1970 economic boom. The critical question is whether Mr Balladur can continue to command the public's support in the 18 months until the presidential elections in spring 1995. The conventional wisdom is that both his conservative coalition's hopes of remaining in power - and his own chance of ousting Mr Jacques Chirac, the head of the RPR party and mayor of Paris, as the right's presidential contender - will be contingent on his success in revitalising France's sluggish economy and halting the rise in unemployment. So far Mr Balladur has had no success on either front. The economy, squeezed by high interest rates and a strong currency, slid into recession during the opening months of this year, when it registered a second successive quarterly decline in the real rate of growth for the first time since the Gulf War. Consumer spending and industrial investment have remained weak in spite of the reductions in interest rates since the conservative victory in the March parliamentary elections. The fall in the franc's value has not been sufficient to trigger a significant recovery in exports. Salomon Brothers forecasts a 1.5 per cent fall in the real rate of GDP growth during the course of this year. The latest surveys of business confidence suggest that industrialists do not expect to see an upturn in the economy until the fourth quarter at the earliest. In the meantime unemployment, which was already at a record level of 3m people when the right came to power in the March parliamentary elections, has since risen steadily to around 3.2m, or a record 11.7 per cent of the workforce (the highest of any G7 country) and is expected to reach 12.5 per cent by the end of this year. Mr Balladur's response has been to try to kick-start the economy through a combination of employment reforms and public sector expenditure. Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, recently unveiled a series of measures intended to make it easier for employers to create new jobs by liberalising France's infamously strict employment law. These include waiving employers' social security payments for the first three new workers they hire and making the 39-hour working weeks more flexible. Meanwhile, the success of the 'Balladur bond', the special bond issue launched this summer which raised FFr110bn, rather than the FFr40bn originally forecast, has enabled the prime minister not only to step up his public expenditure plans but to promise income tax cuts next year for middle income employees. However, the government's room for manoeuvre is restricted by a number of factors. One is the budget deficit. Mr Balladur, who inherited a sizeable deficit from the previous socialist administration, hopes to limit this year's deficit to FFr317bn. However, most private sector economists suspect it will be rather higher at around FFr350bn. Another inhibiting factor is the structure of the present recession which has had a devastating effect on consumer confidence partly due to fears of joblessness and partly to the high rate of real interest rates, or the discrepancy between retail price inflation and bank base rates. In past French recessions inflation has been higher than base rates, thereby encouraging consumers to spend money for fear of being caught out by rising prices. But inflation has been at least six percentage points below base rates throughout the current slump, a scenario that has encouraged consumers to save rather than spend. Societe Generale estimates that the personal savings ratio rose from an average of 10.9 per cent in 1987 to 12.8 per cent last year and is now well over 13 per cent. The success of the 'Balladur bond' illustrates just how nervous French consumers have become. A large chunk of the FFr110bn used to buy the bonds had been lying idle in savings accounts or SICAV money market funds. The bond holders could just as easily have spent their money, but had chosen instead to save it and then to invest in government bonds. Mr Balladur from this autumn hopes to take advantage of this 'saving spirit' by encouraging both the Balladur bond holders and other savers to participate in the government's privatisation programme. But his government has to balance its desire to secure the success of the share sales against the need to regenerate the consumer side of the economy. Moreover, it faces a tough task in rebuilding consumer confidence given that the toll of job losses shows no sign of stopping and that real interest rates remain high in spite of the recent reductions in borrowing costs. Finally, the government is hidebound by monetary constraints: by its desire to maintain a reasonably strong franc and to safeguard the process of European monetary union which has made it cautious about cutting interest rates. These issues are also complicated by additional factors such as the uncertainty over France's economic and strategic relationship with Germany, the doubts about the EC's future and the tangled arguments over the Gatt trade agreement. The economy ministry recently reassessed its growth projections for 1994. It stuck to the initial estimate of 1.4 per cent growth made in June, although it dramatically revised its view of the underlying state of the economy. The ministry has upgraded its expectations for export growth, due to the recent fall of the franc, but has downgraded its forecasts for consumer spending because of the low level of confidence. All in all Mr Balladur - and the French economy - face a bruising 18 months before the 1995 presidential elections with, or without, the critics of the 'ayatollahs of the strong franc'.</p>

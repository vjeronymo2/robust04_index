			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AGOURA'S STELLE AGAIN SETS MARK IN 2-A 100 BACKSTROKE  </P> <P> Once, apparently, was not enough for Agoura High's Jason Stelle.  </P> <P> Not content with breaking his own Southern Section 2-A Division record in the  100-yard backstroke in Friday's qualifying heats, the junior shattered the mark  again in Saturday's 2-A finals held at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Stelle swam a blistering 50.87 to break his day-old record of 51.26. In the  process, he turned in the second-fastest time recorded in a Southern Section  championship meet. Only Steve Barnicoat with a time of 50.68 for Mission Viejo  in the 1984 4-A meet has swum faster.  </P> <P> Stelle had said Friday that he hoped to break the 51-second mark for the first  time. Agoura Coach Mike Mulligan was not a doubter.  </P> <P> "He's just awesome," Mulligan said. "He always shoots for the moon and gets  it."  </P> <P> Stelle nearly doubled as a Southern Section champion, taking second in a highly  competitive 200 individual medley. His time of 1:53.26 earned him All-American  status but was a shade behind Shuichi Matsumoto of Laguna Hills, who turned in  a 1:53.15.  </P> <P> Stelle's near double-win was duplicated by another area swimmer during the 3-A  finals. Sprinter Evy Wild of Hart took won the 50 free, swimming a personal  best 24.38 (bettering her previous best of 24.39), then just missed in the 100  free as Meredith Booker (52.25) of Beverly Hills squeaked past Wild (52.81).  </P> <P> But one title is still cause for a Wild celebration. Like Stelle, she is a  junior. "There's no strategy in the 50," Wild said after the race. "You just go  all out."  </P> <P> Wild's swimming was, for all practical purposes, the bright spot on an  otherwise blank canvas for Valley 3-A schools. Crespi's Rusty King and  Burbank's Casey Grigg placed third in the 100 butterfly (51.35) and 200  individual medley (1:57.27), respectively.  </P> <P> The 2-A story was somewhat better, with Stelle's heroics leading the Agoura  boys to a fifth-place finish (69 points).  </P> <P> Harvard finished sixth and won a Southern Section championship in the 200  medley relay. The team of Ryan Crosbie, Jon Paul, Mike Chang and Robin Lee swam  a 1:41.57 to score 32 of the team's 64 points. Defending 100 butterfly champion  Chang later took third in that event (51.22).  </P> <P> In the girls' meet, Jenny Bissel of Agoura turned in third-place finishes in  the 200 individual medley (2:12.64) and the 100 butterfly (59.96) to pace  Agoura to a ninth-place team finish (45 points).  </P></p>

A public  security officer nevertheless warned him that further  investigation would be conducted regarding the pieces he wrote  for overseas media during this period. Wang said, however, that  safeguarding the freedom of speech is a component of China's  democratic movement and that he would continue writing.    Deprivation of political rights primarily refers to the  right  to vote and stand for election, the freedoms of speech, press,  and assembly as laid down in the constitution, and the right to  take up posts in an enterprise or institution, among other  rights.</p>

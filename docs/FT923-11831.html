			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Chemical Banking income soars 30% CHEMICAL BANKING, the third biggest US bank that was formed recently by the merger of Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust, yesterday unveiled a 30 per cent rise in second-quarter net profits, to Dollars 240m. For the first six months of 1992 the net income was Dollars 500m, up by 37 per cent year-on-year. These are the first quarterly results from Chemical since the merger was formally completed last month, and the comparative 1991 figures cited represent a pooling of the two precursor banks. Combined total assets are now Dollars 142bn. Earnings per share in the second quarter were unchanged year-on-year at 83 cents, while the net income per share for the first six months was Dollars 1.83, against Dollars 1.67 in the first half of 1991. The earnings per share numbers are affected, however, by the fact that the bank sold 57.5m new shares last January, in an issue that raised Dollars 1.5bn. Mr John McGillicuddy, chairman, said the bank's earnings momentum continued in the second quarter with strong results in most businesses. He said pre-tax earnings were 72 per cent improved year-on-year and the results were achieved against the backdrop of high bad-debt provisions and loan write-offs. Net interest income in the second quarter was 14 per cent improved at Dollars 1.1bn, while non-interest revenues were Dollars 744m, up from Dollars 713m a year ago. Bad debt provisions were Dollars 345m in the second quarter, compared with Dollars 303m a year ago and Dollars 375m in the first quarter of 1992. Mr McGillicuddy said the provision level would decline during the remainder of the year. Non-performing assets totalled Dollars 6.56bn at the end of June, about the same level as a year ago and more than Dollars 300m higher than the level at the end of March 1992. Commercial loan write-offs during the quarter amounted to Dollars 345m, up from Dollars 273m a year ago. If less developing country write-offs are added the figures rise to Dollars 398m, against Dollars 759m a year ago. Total staff at the end of last month was 39,974, down by 4,528 since the merger was first announced last July. On Wall Street, Chemical's share price was marked Dollars 1 lower to Dollars 36.</p>

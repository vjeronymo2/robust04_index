			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (8): Population surge is a crucial issue - There may well be 10bn people on the earth by the year 2050 THE WORLD'S population is growing at an unprecedented rate, consuming more resources than ever - nearly a billion people will be added to the planet during the 1990s, according to the Worldwatch Institute. As the number of poor people is increasing, human migration is growing and renewable resources, such as water and land are increasingly under threat. Such realities make the population issue a crucial one for sustainable development. There are about 5.5bn people in the world, with an average annual increase of 97m projected for the coming decade. International experts agree that population growth rates will have to be reduced, and the pattern of human activities changed, if ecological catastrophe is to be averted. The two go hand-in-hand because it is not simply high population growth rates that are threatening the environment. Developed countries, with relatively low birth rates, consume most of the world's resources. A Bangladeshi, for example, consumes energy equivalent to three barrels of oil a year, a US citizen 55 barrels. As Oxfam puts it: 'Industrialised countries generate significantly more damage per person to the global environment than do people in developing countries.' Sustainable development therefore calls for a fairer distribution of the benefits of development among the world's people. High population growth rates in developing countries - where 80 per cent of the world's population lives - will, nevertheless, put even greater pressure on the world's resources. The higher the population in developing countries, the higher their energy use and pollution, especially as economies develop. More water is needed, more forests are cleared, inappropriate agricultural practices increase and wildlife species disappear. Population growth in developing countries is responsible for about 79 per cent of deforestation, 72 per cent of arable land expansion and 69 per cent of the growth in livestock numbers. Such problems are further compounded by the increasing migration of people - to urban areas and to environmentally sensitive inland areas - in search of productive land and jobs. Addressing high birth rates means addressing poverty in such countries, say international agencies. More than 1bn people live in absolute poverty without adequate food, clothing or housing. North-South relationships regarding debt, trade, aid and technology transfer are seen as longer-term means of tackling poverty. Programmes to tackle high birth rates focus on improving third world health and education, and providing readily available and affordable family planning. Practice shows that birth rates can be reduced voluntarily by raising the status of women through education and providing them with opportunities other than the traditional child bearing role. It is thought that more than one in five births in developing countries may be unwanted. The worst case scenario for the population explosion is that there could be 12.5bn people in the world by 2050 if immediate action is not taken. The most likely scenario is a figure of 10bn people. Fertility patterns can change in just one decade. Development and consumption patterns will have to follow suit, says the United Nations Population Fund. 'World resources are adequate for the sustained development of the planet - if they are carefully used,' it warns.</p>

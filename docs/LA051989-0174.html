			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITISH INFLATION RATE CLIMBS TO 8%  </P> <P> Britain's annual inflation rate rose to 8% in April from 7.9% in the previous  month, boosted by higher rents and water charges, the government said today.  </P> <P> The 0.1 percentage point increase was more than economists had expected and  increased expectations that prices would move even higher rather than peak at  around 8% as Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson had forecast.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said its retail price index rose 1.8% in April to 114.3.  The index stood at 112.3 in March and 105.8 in April, 1988.  </P> <P> Economists had expected an annual rate of 7.7% and a monthly gain of 1.4%.  </P> <P> The government pushed up interest rates nine times to the current 13% from 7.5%  last summer in an effort to control inflation. However, the resulting higher  mortgage rates, which are included in the index, have had the effect of pushing  up the annual inflation rate.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Phase I major modification applications may propose  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or contract SAB extensions; provided that a contract SAB extension into an adjacent market may be proposed only if, at the time the Phase I major modification application is filed, the licensee in the adjacent market (on the requested channel block) has the right to enter into such a contract (see &sect;22.912(c)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Phase I major modification application may propose a CGSA that is not contiguous with the authorized or proposed CGSA, provided that the non-contiguous CGSA meets the minimum coverage requirement of &sect;22.951. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Phase I licensees may also file applications for or notifications of minor modifications to its system. However, such minor modifications may not reduce the size of the CGSA below the minimum coverage requirement of &sect;22.951. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phase II <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Phase II is an open-ended filing process that allows eligible parties to apply for any unserved areas that may remain in a market after the Phase I process is complete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If a Phase I initial application is granted for a market and channel block, Phase II applications (applications for authority to operate a cellular system in any remaining unserved area) for that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 121st day after the Phase I application was granted. If no Phase I initial applications are granted for a market and channel block, Phase II applications for that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 31st day after the FCC dismissed the last pending Phase I application. If no Phase I initial applications are received for a market and channel block, Phase II applications for that market and channel block may be filed on or after the 32nd day after the expiration of the relevant five-year build-out period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) There is no limit the number of Phase II applications that may be granted on each channel block in each market. Consequently, Phase II applications are mutually exclusive only if the proposed CGSAs would overlap. Furthermore, only mutually exclusive Phase II applications with the same filing date are entitled to inclusion in a random selection process. Where all mutually exclusive Phase II applications have different filing dates, the FCC may grant the earliest-filed application and dismiss all applications excluded by that grant. For the purposes of this section, the filing date of an application is the date on which that application was received or the date on which the most recently filed major amendment to that application was received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Phase II applications may propose a CGSA covering more than one cellular market. Each Phase II application must request authorization for one and only one CGSA. Phase II applications may propose  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and contract SAB extensions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Settlements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Settlements among some, but not all, applicants with mutually exclusive applications for unserved areas (partial settlements) are prohibited. Settlements among all applicants with mutually exclusive applications (full settlements) are allowed and must be filed no later than 15 business days before the random selection process is scheduled to take place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limitations on amendments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Notwithstanding the provisions of &sect;22.122, Phase I applications are subject to the following additional limitations in regard to the filing of amendments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The FCC will not accept amendments (of any type) to mutually exclusive Phase I applications prior to the conclusion of the random selection process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The FCC will not accept major amendments to Phase I applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Minor amendments required by &sect;1.65 of this chapter must be filed no later than 30 days after public notice announcing the results of the random selection process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.951 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Minimum coverage requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing system that abuts the unserved area, must propose a contiguous cellular geographical service area (CGSA) of at least 130 square kilometers (50 square miles). Area within contract SAB extensions counts toward the minimum coverage requirement. However, area within  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SAB extensions does not count toward the minimum coverage requirement. Applications for authority to operate a new cellular system in an unserved area, other than those filed by the licensee of an existing system that abuts the unserved area, must not propose coverage of water areas only (or water areas and uninhabited islands or reefs only), except for unserved areas in the Gulf of Mexico MSA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;22.953 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Content and form of applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applications for authority to operate a cellular system in an unserved area must comply with the specifications in this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New systems <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

The paper original of each application must be enclosed in a stiff cover fastened securely along the left edge, without exposed sharp edges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transmittal sheet <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The first page after the front cover of the application must be the transmittal sheet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Copies of the required transmittal sheet may be obtained by contacting the Consumer Assistance Office, Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW, Washington, DC 20554. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) On the transmittal sheet, the following information is required: the name of the applicant, the channel block, and the market number or numbers and the market name or names in which the proposed CGSA is located. This information on the transmittal sheet must match exactly the information on the jacket of the microfiche and the cover of the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The transmittal sheet also contains a certification. Applicants must certify to the following: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> I hereby certify that this application for an authorization in the Cellular Radiotelephone Service is complete in every respect and contains all of the information required by FCC Form 401 and the Federal Communications Commission's rules governing this service. I acknowledge that, if upon examination by the FCC, this certification is found to be incorrect, the FCC will dismiss this application without further consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I certify that I am the real party-in-interest in this application and there are no agreements or understandings other than those, if any, disclosed in this application, which provide that someone other than the applicant has a direct or indirect interest in the application.

The Israeli attacks on the citizens led to the destruction  of  numerous houses and the death and wounding of a number of  victims as a result of the rocket bombardment by the special  units without concern for the lives, safety, and possessions of  the civilians, the blood of whose brothers at the holy  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has not dried up yet.    The brother President Abu-'Ammar pointed out that these  kinds  of Israeli practices would reflect negatively on the peace  process and cause concern at this sensitive stage of the  development of the situation in the Middle East.    The brother President Abu-'Ammar asked Secretary Christopher  for an immediate intervention to put an end to this aggression  against the secure citizens, who are being besieged as a result  of the curfew imposed by the Israeli occupation forces since the  brutal massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque.</p>

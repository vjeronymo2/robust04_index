			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Personal View: Boundaries of fair play On Monday, the House of Commons gave a second reading to the Boundary Commissions Bill. The Home Secretary describes it as a desirable piece of administrative tidying up and it is not being officially opposed but some Labour MPs consider it a shameless gerrymander intended to decide the next general election. Mutual agreement was behind the original rules for boundary-drawing in 1944. But those rules have proved unsatisfactory. Mutual agreement was, to some degree, behind their modification in 1958. But in 1948, and again in 1969, it was the Labour party that, unilaterally, engaged in what the Conservatives each time called a shameless gerrymandering by altering or delaying the commissioners' recommendations. There are four boundary commissions, one each for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Since 1958 they have been required to recommend a new set of boundaries to the House of Commons at intervals of not more than 15 years. Mr Kenneth Clarke wants to change the term to 12 years to ensure that the current revision is complete by December 31 1994, leaving the prime minister free to call an election at the moment when the economy is at its most favourable in the fourth or fifth year of this parliament. In last month's general election, successful Conservative candidates had on average 71,084 electors in their constituencies; Labour MPs had 61,546. A revision of boundaries that aims to equalise constituency size will necessarily cost Labour several seats. Labour city centres get depopulated; Conservative suburbs grow. Despite some whistling in the wind by Mr Roy Hattersley and Walworth Road, it seems certain that Labour will lose between 10 and 20 seats - making a difference of between 20 and 40 to the majority in parliament. It is easy to see why the Conservatives are eager for the change and why some people are eager to obstruct it. When a government has an overall majority of 21 (or less after by-elections) a straight addition of 30 or so will look like a welcome bonus when the dissolution comes. There is an administrative case for reforming the current arrangements quite apart from the partisan one. The existing procedures are cumbersome. The 1983 redistribution took more than seven years to complete: the new boundaries that came into force in June 1983 were based on registration figures compiled in October 1975. The delay produced anomalies in constituency size. In Australia in 1984, it took only seven months to redraw the political map, turning 125 constituencies into 148 with full judicial hearing for any objections to the changes. But in the UK, boundary commissioners have been unpaid and the High Court judge at their head is only allowed one day every six weeks to attend to the work. The commissions have been seriously understaffed. Appeals can be farcical. Everyone involved knows that they are in effect a political charade in which no one may utter the key phrase 'party advantage'. The rules binding the commissioners contain at least three anomalies. First they are told to make constituency electorates 'as equal as practicable' while they are also told to respect natural communities 'as far as practicable'. There is no guidance on how far from the quota (currently 69,281 for England) they may diverge in order to make a constituency coterminous with a local authority - but they have (perhaps rightly) already decided to keep the Isle of Wight (with 102,000 or 1.4 times the quota) a single undivided seat. Until now they have respected London Borough boundaries but with Kingston at 1.3 quotas and Kensington and Chelsea at 1.2, they seem likely for the first time to treat Greater London as a single unit. As a single unit, it is entitled to 71 seats whereas if the 32 boroughs are treated as separate, inviolable units, London is entitled to 77. London now has 84 seats - will it lose 13 or only seven? Every redistribution necessarily increases the size of the House of Commons  -it has drifted from 625 in 1950 to 650 in 1983. It is likely to be more than 660 in 1995. There is also the possibility of litigation, reasonable or vexatious. Late in 1982, three different Labour-inspired lawsuits delayed the last redistribution by three months. If the House of Lords had been willing to consider a final appeal, the 1983 general election would probably have had to be delayed or to have taken place on the old boundaries. Since 1983 there has been a general leap in the use of judicial review; the number of cases accepted has tripled. It is difficult to change the rules in midstream - by now the commissioners have already done a quarter of their work. But unless the rules are changed, the commissioners may meet Mr Clarke's new deadline of December 31 1994 only to find that the courts stop him from presenting their recommendations to parliament until too late for Mr Major's preferred election date - perhaps even until the next parliament.

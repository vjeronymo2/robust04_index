			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Congress specified that the EPA must establish standards which require ``the maximum degree of reduction in emissions of the hazardous air pollutants *&blank;*&blank;* that the Administrator *&blank;*&blank;* determines is achievable *&blank;*&blank;*'' (section 112(d)(2) of the Act). In addition, Congress limited the Agency's discretion by defining the minimum baseline (floor) at which standards may be set, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) For new sources, the standards for a source category or subcategory ``shall not be less stringent than the emission control that is achieved in practice by the best controlled similar source, as determined by the Administrator,'' and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For existing sources, the standards ``may be less stringent than standards for new sources *&blank;*&blank;* but shall not be less stringent, and may be more stringent than: (A) the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources (for which the Administrator has emissions information) *&blank;*&blank;* or (B) the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources *&blank;*&blank;* for categories or subcategories *&blank;*&blank;* with fewer than 30 sources'' (section 112(d)(3)of the Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Selection of Pollutants and Source Category(ies)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 112(b) of the Act lists the HAP to be regulated with standards established under section 112. Section 112(d), as amended, requires the EPA to promulgate emission standards for each category or subcategory of major sources and area sources of the HAP listed in section 112(b). For the purpose of developing these standards, the EPA may distinguish among classes, types, and sizes of sources within a category or subcategory. The NESHAP are to be developed to control HAP emissions from both new and existing sources pursuant to section 112(c) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The initial source category list (57 FR 31576, July 16, 1992), required by section 112(c) of the Act, identifies source categories for which NESHAP are to be established. This list includes all major source categories of HAP known to the EPA at this time, and all area source categories for which a finding of adverse effects warranting regulation has been made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The source category list identifies ``surface coating processes_aerospace industries'' as a source category because it contains major sources emitting at least 10 tons of any one HAP or more than 25 tons of any combination of HAP annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The aerospace industry encompasses original equipment manufacturers of commercial, civil, and military (including space) aerospace vehicles. In addition, rework facilities, which repair and repaint aerospace vehicles, constitute a major portion of the industry. There are also many subcontractors providing support to the industry, especially to the OEM's, who subcontract out various portions of the work. These subcontractors may engage in many of the processes found at OEM or rework facilities, or in just a few. Further, subcontractors may conduct operations for non-aerospace industries at facilities at which they conduct aerospace operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purposes of this rule, the EPA has defined the source category as consisting of all facilities engaged in the manufacture or rework of any aerospace vehicle or component. This includes all OEM's, rework facilities, and subcontractors. The EPA decided to include subcontractors in the proposed rule because they perform substantial amounts of work, much of which could otherwise be carried out at an OEM or rework facility and which is virtually indistinguishable from processes at the OEM or rework facility. However, if the subcontractors' facilities are not major sources, they would not be subject to the proposed standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Early in the development of the proposed standards, the EPA developed model plants to correspond to the basic structure of the industry_commercial and military segments, each having OEM and rework facilities_with the intent of developing subcategories for standards development, if necessary. On the basis of the information provided, however, the EPA has found that, with one exception for depainting operations, there is no need to distinguish among these segments for the processes for which standards are being proposed under the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

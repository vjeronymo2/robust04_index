			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Perspectives: A whiff of sanity in the trenches - Alasdair Steven recounts a wartime outbreak of goodwill It is 80 years since the momentous first Christmas of the Great War. When Tommy and Jerry stopped sniping at each other, met in the middle of No Man's Land and played football. A simple act but one that was never repeated and caused consternation among the High Commands. Over that festive period, amid the carnage, mud, barbed wire and rotting corpses, sanity prevailed for a flickering moment. Christmas 1914 was always meant to be historic. The German troops had been told at the outbreak of war in August that they would be home 'before the leaves fell'. The British that they would be home by Christmas. Disillusionment and homesickness were setting in in those inhospitable freezing trenches. The ghastly reality of unrelenting savage war was begining to dawn. Accounts differ. But what is not in doubt is that on those barren flat fields close to Ypres, in the north of France, the soldiers of the two sides met and shook hands. In The Times there are letters from officers in the field saying that 'everything on Christmas Eve was dead, even our own pet sniper who normally sends over a good-night kiss at 9.15. Someone came running along the line and announced a truce had broken out.' Just how did such a thing happen? A graphic account in the Illustrated London News suggests that a German soldier walked through the lines bearing a Christmas tree. 'He invited the troops to go over and have a smoke and a palaver; with one accord a truce for the night was signed. The compliments of the season were passed with much enthusiasm between friend and foe.' That story owes, perhaps, a certain amount to journalistic colouring. The accepted and authentic story goes thus: the lines at Ypres were only 25 yards apart. From the German lines came the strains of Stille Hacht, Heilige Nacht. The Germans shouted at the end: 'Come on Tommy, it's your turn now.' The British replied first with The First Nowell and then a rousing account of O Come All Ye Faithful. The Germans followed with Adeste Fidelis. The soldiers from both sides huddled in their trenches desperately trying to keep warm. The North Sea is only a few miles away and the winds blow around Ypres and the surrounding countryside with an icy rawness. Arctic squalls make a visit to a place such as Hill 60, close to the scene of the 1914 meeting, a chilling experience. Through this bleak mid-winter a German called out: 'Come on Tommy, stand up.' No Briton dared move. Snipers were about. The war was still very much on. No Christmas truce had been intimated. Then the British soldiers spotted a German silhouetted against the wintry sky approaching singing a solo of Stille Nacht. Slowly, and with understandable caution, both sides slowly crept over their trenches. With mounting emotion this motley collection of foes met amid the shell holes and craters. Both sides were suspicious from the outset. Was it a trick dreamt up by Jerry? Suddenly there was chatter and laughter. People embraced, cigars were exchanged and jokes made. Tommies larked around in Jerry's Pickelhaube, the German spiked helmet, and photos were taken of stern officers and men not quite knowing how to look. But in the gruff, heavily-moustached faces there is evidence of a smile. The eyes look relieved and at peace. A young German who had been to university in America did the translation. A German lieutenant asked a rather stuffy British major if he would send a photograph of himself to his sister in Liverpool. The weird truce spread along the line for about two miles. A surreal atmosphere hung over those windswept acres. And yes, a football match was played. At first with a tin can, then a proper ball was found. Jackets and scarves were used for goal posts and 'the Saxons beat the Anglo-Saxons 3-2'. The dead of both sides were buried with padres from each nation assisting at the service. There was even a local rule agreed: 'If by any mischance a single shot had been fired it was not to be taken as an act of war and an apology would be accepted. Firing would not be opened without due warning on both sides.' The report in The Times ended rather colourfully with a grand overall picture of the incredible sight: 'There were so many lights that it looked like Henley Royal Regatta on a Saturday night.' In certain places the truce lasted until new year. The Highland Light Infantry were settling down to celebrate the serious matter of the new year when a German popped his head round their dugout and wished them all a happy day: 'We told him amidst much laughter that we were at war with him and he must play the game and pretend to fight.' But the High Commands were furious. Central to the British war offensive was the belief that the Hun was an evil beast. If the ordinary British soldier started thinking otherwise he would automatically lose his will to fight and kill. A letter from a sub-lieutenant to his mother in Birmingham bears this out. 'It was amazing to realise,' he wrote, 'that the Germans were rather cheery characters, it seems silly to be fighting them.' Any further fraternisation with the enemy was banned. Indeed two British officers tried to repeat the experience the following year and were court-martialled. Today the truce of Christmas 1914 is one of the few attractive memories of the war. An oasis of sanity among four years of slaughter and misery. Strangely, the papers of the day were remarkably cool about reporting the event. In The Times, among the (horrifying) list of deaths and the advertisements for Harrods Sale (corsets on special offer at 13s9d) and a full-page Horlicks advertisement (at 1s6d invaluable for a genuine soldier) there are about half a dozen reports on the dash for peace at Ypres. But Christmas 1914 proved the compassion of the ordinary man. With unremitting turbulence and death scattered all about him the human spirit proved indomitable. If only the High Commands had listened to Tommy and Jerry the history of the the 20th century might have been very different.</p>

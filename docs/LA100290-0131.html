			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPROMISE IS SEEN AS '92 CURTAIN RAISER  </P> <P> The compromise budget accord hammered out by the Republican White House and the  Democrat-controlled Congress raises the curtain on the battle for the  presidency in 1992 -- and foreshadows the major battle lines between and within  the parties during the next two years.  </P> <P> Bush is banking on the hope that the harsh economic nostrums of spending cuts  and tax increases prescribed for 1990 will be all but forgotten two years hence  when, if all goes well, the revitalized economy will be soaring.  </P> <P> "The real goals are to get spending under control and economic growth going  again," said Charles Black, chief spokesman for the Republican National  Committee. "That means a healthy economy and history tells us that the state of  the economy is the biggest issue in presidential elections."  </P> <P> To be sure, no one can guarantee that the remedies devised at the bipartisan  budget summit will produce a rosy economic picture. But as congressional  analyst Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute pointed out: "One  thing the summit negotiators felt sure of, was that if they didn't do anything  at all, the economy would be that much worse in 1992."  </P> <P> For their part, Democratic leaders backing the budget agreement see it as a  chance to establish some voter confidence in their fiscal management abilities,  an area where polls have long indicated their reputations to be sorely in need  of repair.  </P> <P> For example, a recent Times Mirror poll showed that when asked which party is  best able to generate economic growth, 40% of those interviewed chose the  Republicans, while only 29% favored the Democrats.  </P> <P> "With this plan George Bush has given us an opportunity to take the high ground  and show people that we put the national interest above the special interests,"  said Al From, executive director of the Democratic Leadership Council, a group  of centrist Democratic elected officials.  </P> <P> By regaining the confidence of the public and restoring their own confidence in  themselves, Democrats believe that they will be in a strong position to raise  their favorite issues of economic justice against incumbent Bush in the 1992  campaign.  </P> <P> "We think fairness is still our main issue," says Richard Moe, a former Jimmy  Carter White House aide and now an adviser to House Majority Leader Richard A.  Gephardt (D-Mo.).  </P> <P> "And we believe that the whole debate over the budget has helped frame the  issues we can use," he added.  </P> <P> "Democrats went through an important baptism of fire by using the  'tax-breaks-for-the-rich issue' against Bush and forcing him to back off his  campaign pledge to cut the capital gains tax," said political analyst Kevin  Phillips, author of the bestseller "Politics of the Rich and Poor," which  lambastes both parties for short-sighted economic policies.  </P> <P> Many Democrats contend that baptism lends further credibility to the charge  that they plan to use against Bush in the 1992 campaign.  </P> <P> One big problem with carrying out these presidential campaign scenarios is that  the intraparty disagreements on the budget are nearly as intense as the  differences that pit the parties against each other. Thus, even if the package  is adopted by Congress, it may be difficult for either party to muster the  unity needed to exploit the potential political advantages it offers.  </P> <P> In both parties, prominent activists and officeholders -- from House Minority  Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) to New York's Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo --  contend that the budget package is either bad politics or bad economics, or  both.  </P> <P> "This package will lose jobs, raise taxes and deepen the recession," Gingrich  said. He and other conservative Republicans object mostly to the proposed tax  increases in the package.  </P> <P> "The gasoline and liquor tax increases are directed right at the ethnic urban  voters who swing back and forth in elections," said David Keene, chairman of  the American Conservative Union. He worries that these voters, who were  attracted to Bush by his pledge not to raise taxes, might return to their  traditional home in the Democratic Party as a result of Bush's shift on that  issue.  </P> <P> Cuomo, who many now consider a favorite for his party's 1992 presidential  nomination, will issue a statement today opposing the proposal, according to  Brad Johnson, chief Washington lobbyist for New York state.  </P> <P> Cuomo objects, among other things, to the proposal to partly repeal  deductibility of state and local taxes.  </P> <P> So far as the 1990 congressional elections are concerned, most analysts think  that the net impact when voters go to the polls in November will be minimal.  Some challengers in both parties will try to get votes by exploiting resentment  of the tax increases in the package.  </P> <P> But incumbents who back the compromise will claim credit for avoiding the  disruptions that automatic spending cuts would have brought.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By YONHAP from Moscow] </F>   [Text] Regarding our country's media reports that China  will provide military assistance to North Korea in case a  military collision breaks out on the Korean peninsula, a  spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry denied such reports,  reported ITAR-TASS in a Beijing-dispatched story.    The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, in a telephone  interview with ITAR-TASS, strongly denied such reports by saying  that the reports are a absolutely groundless fiction [chonjoguro  ssulttae omnun hogurago].    The news agency reported that the spokesman, however, kept  silent on reports that a close woman relative of North Korean  President Kim Il-song visited Beijing at the end of May and  agreed with the Chinese side to receive food and energy if  economic sanctions are imposed on North Korea.</p>

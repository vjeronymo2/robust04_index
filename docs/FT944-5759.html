			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Gaullists reject early play-off: French conservatives have abandoned the idea of holding primaries to choose a presidential candidate France's conservative coalition yesterday buried the idea of holding US-style primary elections to choose a single right-wing presidential candidate. Representatives of the RPR Gaullists and the centre-right UDF federation yesterday pronounced primaries 'impossible' and said a victory for the right next year would depend on rival conservatives having 'the will' to rally together in time for the final round of voting on May 7. The possibility of the French right reaching across the Atlantic for a device to settle their differences always seemed a long shot, though the RPR-UDF agreement in 1991 that called for staggered, regional primary elections ending at least three months before the presidential vote was modelled on US lines. The first round of voting in France constitutes a kind of a primary, in that only two candidates go to the final vote and they are usually of the right and of the left; but the bare fortnight between the two votes gives no time for party wounds to heal. The primaries idea mainly failed because by the time it started to get serious consideration this autumn - as Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president and possible Socialist presidential contender, began to profit in the opinion polls from the rivalry of Gaullists Mr Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur - the same opinion polls showed that Mr Chirac would lose to Mr Balladur in primaries. With primaries therefore seen as a partisan device by Balladur supporters to squeeze Mr Chirac out of the race, their formal demise yesterday was greeted with relief by the Chirac camp and irritation by Mr Balladur's. But the prime minister clearly intends to play on the fact that - unlike Mr Chirac - he has wide support within his UDF coalition partnership. 'A unity candidacy remains as necessary as ever,' he said yesterday, though he does not intend to go public with his Elysee campaign until early January. Recent polls have shown that Socialist European Commission President Jacques Delors has overtaken Mr Balladur as frontrunner in the presidential race. Mr Delors has yet to announce whether he will run. Mr Chirac, the only significant declared contender, trails a distant third.</p>

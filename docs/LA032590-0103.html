			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DECLARATION' CAUSES OUTPOURING OF DEEPLY DIVIDED OPINIONS  </P> <P> Re "A Declaration" (March 14): On the front page of the View section, we are  shown a couple in living color looking mistily into each other's eyes like  Bogart and Bacall. But they are not Bogart and Bacall.  </P> <P> They are two young girls who have chosen to be lesbians.  </P> <P> My intent is not to criticize anyone for their choices. But I am critical of  the manner in which The Times has presented the article.  </P> <P> There is still, and always will be, a great majority of society that is not in  agreement with homosexuality. I consider myself part of that majority, and my  friends and acquaintances, both male and female, agree that the article is  offensive.  </P> <P> In my opinion, it is not in the interest of society to further any  organizations that profess theories of separatism like the lesbian sorority  mentioned in your paper.  </P> <P> If valuable space is to be used in your newspaper, please let it serve the  whole of society. Don't just write anything simply because it is modern or  considered "chic."  </P> <P> RICH COLLIGNON  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

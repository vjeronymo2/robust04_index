			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report London COCOA prices finished lower, and New York prices were sharply down at midday, after talk of thunder storms in the Ivory Coast prompted nervous speculative long liquidation. However, one weather report said the storms were expected to be isolated and the weather was likely to remain mostly dry over the next few days. Concern about dry weather in the region has been a key supportive factor. Precious metals maintained a firmer tone on the London bullion market as GOLD was fixed at Dollars 339 a troy ounce before edging higher despite the dollar's rally on the back of an unexpectedly large drop in US weekly jobless claims. The dollar's recent decline has noticeably boosted demand for gold in other currencies, dealers said. In Germany on Wednesday gold was fixed at DM15,360 a kilo - its lowest level since 1979. One source estimated investment demand for gold in Germany was currently at four times the 1991 level. New York COTTON futures were modestly higher at midday after touching lifetime lows at the opening as the threat of crop damage in the Delta from the remains of Hurricane Andrew diminished, traders said.</p>

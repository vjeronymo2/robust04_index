			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (32): Figuring out the differences - Accounting and reporting Of all the countries in all the world, very few offer investors a consistent or comparable set of accounting standards to help them interpret financial performance. The pitfalls in attempting to interpret different sets of accounts and negotiating through the widely varying tax structures pose considerable challenges. Many emerging markets have less formalised accounting standards, varying degrees of disclosure and different underlying philosophies which affect the figures. A number of commentators divide the world between tax-driven accounts and accounts more geared to investors. The former may often have the incentive to keep published profits low, the latter to boost them. For countries in the former category, the published accounts are those that are submitted to the revenue authorities. Countries often have relatively hidebound, fixed formats governed by legislation or 'charts of accounts'. The latter category includes the UK and the US, where tax returns are separate - and even contradictory - and accounts are geared primarily towards investors. Mr John Tetley, a member of the consultative group of the International Accounting Standards Committee (Iasc), who has particular knowledge of French and Portuguese-speaking Africa and South America, says the differences between countries can 'cause quite a lot of trouble'. 'If you are thinking of investing in family-owned local businesses, you have very little idea what the accounts mean,' he says. 'They report what they want to.' He argues that many have relatively few accountants or bookkeepers, let alone consistent standards which they can apply. Policies vary on the revaluation of assets, on depreciation and the treatment of foreign currency. In particular, he highlights the role of indexation in high inflation countries such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, which can make comparisons confusing. 'You are never quite sure what you are looking at,' he says. A survey conducted last year by the Centre for International Financial Reporting and Analysis (Cifar)* pointed out a number of difficulties in interpreting international financial statements. The information on companies in emerging markets is limited and often filed long after the year-end. Many subsidiaries conduct transactions with parent companies, adding to the awkwardness of extracting relevant, timely data. English translations of annual reports and other financial information are often unavailable or unreliable. Converting figures expressed in local currencies may prove problematic. Varying year-ends makes comparison difficult and auditing standards vary. That is before accounting standards. Cifar cites eight particular issues treated in vastly divergent ways across the globe: depreciation, inventory methods, deferred taxes, consolidation principles, discretionary reserves, inflation adjustments, foreign currency translation, and the valuation of fixed income and equity securities. Some see signs of optimism for the future from the work of the Iasc, which has been attempting over many years to establish a set of standards transcending national differences. Some countries have adopted Iasc standards wholesale, or developed their own versions based on the same international approach. For example, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange last year issued new rules requiring foreign incorporated companies to present reports in line with Iasc standards. They have been incorporated into requirements in Pakistan, Zimbabwe, Malaysia, Kenya and India. The Asian Development Bank and the United Nations Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International Standards of Accounting and Reporting have used Iasc standards. However, Iasc standards have been criticised for the political compromises necessary to build consensus between different countries' standards. The result has been a wide range of alternative treatments which did little to improve ease of interpretation for readers of accounts. That has now begun to change significantly, with the organisation's 'comparability/improvements' project designed to bring about greater harmonisation. The motivation has been partly to gain recognition for Iasc standards from the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), which would allow far wider recognition of the standards in different national stock exchanges. The strategy has begun to pay off, with Iosco now endorsing the Iasc cash flow statement standard, for example. But more wholesale ratification is likely to be a long way off. To add to the confusion, some of the national accounting standards setters are also beginning to become more interested in international collaboration, in a way that may threaten the Iasc's traditional role. Standards setters from the UK, US, Canada, France, Australia and elsewhere have in the past two years begun discussing sharing the workload for research and standards drafting on a number of topics. There are still wider concerns that Iasc and other national standards were devised in the developed world and may be far less appropriate without substantial modification in many of the emerging markets regions. Meanwhile, investors need to bear in mind tax issues within emerging markets. Mr Peter Dickinson, international tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in London, says one of the key tax questions in emerging markets is 'how to get one's money out'. 'You need to understand the exchange control regulations,' he says. 'A lot of countries have very tight controls, such as South Africa and India.' In addition, he says there may be specific stipulations on how money is held through the banks. Within countries, there are often federal, regional, state or city taxes to be considered. Then there is the small print in the double taxation treaties agreed between the investor's country and the country for investment, which may impinge on returns. 'There is a much higher degree of risk in emerging markets,' says Mr Dickinson. 'Investors should think long and hard at their potential after-tax returns.' He says the most important factor for investors tends to be withholding taxes on dividends paid outside the country. In addition, the position is far from static. 'The rules keep changing,' he says. 'In some countries like China the rules on how much tax to pay move from one month to the next.' * International accounting and auditing trends. 3rd edition, 1993.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Views" column: "The Support"] </F>   [Text] It appears that [Albanian President Sali] Berisha's  regime not only does not understand us, but it is even  intensifying its provocations with persecutions and statements  that completely flaunt the truth, with the very obvious aim of  deceiving the international community and international public  opinion.    In a statement issued yesterday, the Albanian Foreign  Ministry accuses the Greek Government of war-like talk. It  underlines that "playing another Bosnia in the southern Balkans  would mean a widespread Balkan war for which Greece will be  fully responsible. The policy of threatening Albania is a policy  of failure."    The Albanian Foreign Ministry though, does not say anything  about the wave of terrorism that has been launched against the  North Ipirus people. It says nothing about group arrests and  interrogations.    Of course it says nothing, since the U.S. State Department,  which supposedly does not have any evidence of the oppression of  the Greek minority in Albania, has not said anything either.    It is this "lack of evidence" and many other things that  encourage Tirana to continue its provocations and accuse Greece  of seeking another Bosnia in the southern Balkans.    Greece does not seek another Bosnia nor any war, but seeks  peace in the Balkans and good relations with all its neighbors.    However, the development and further improvement of good  relations with Albania depends on respect for human rights and  the rights of the Greek minority.    With its terrorizing of the Greek minority, Berisha's regime  proves that it is not a state of law. It needs to prove  continuously to the international community that it is  developing into a state of law, a state of democratic freedoms,  with respect for human rights.    Of course, the U.S. Government, which is the main supporter  of Berisha's regime, knows this; it just pretends it does not.  That is where the responsibility lies for Tirana's  provocations, which depict Greece, a country that hosts 500,000  Albanians and supports its economy, as seeking war.    If the U.S. hypocrisy stops, Tirana will immediately stop  its  provocations too.</p>

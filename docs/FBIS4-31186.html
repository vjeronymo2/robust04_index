			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dan Andronic: "On His South American Tour </F> Nicolae Vacaroiu Was Accompanied by the Representative of a  Company Involved in Radioactive Materials Trafficking"]    [Text] After having published our article titled "Romanian  Companies Trade With Radioactive Material and Armaments From the  Soviet Union," now we can let you know that we are in possession  of information proving that one of the members of the government  delegation headed by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, which  visited a number of Latin American countries, was the  representative of such a company.    Thus, in Chapter 5 of the official list of the delegation,  which contains the names of the businessmen accompanying the  prime minister, one finds the name of Constantin Francu,  director of the board of the Dunarea Ltd. company.    We consider it strange that the same person, Constantin  Francu, was once caught at the Varsand border crossing point, in  Arad County, trying to take over 10 kg of red mercury. It is  noteworthy that this was the largest red mercury seizure ever  made on the territory of Romania and that the place of origin  was the former Soviet Union.</p>

Attending the meeting of Visegrad group heads of state and  government with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Pawlak and  Olechowski stressed that, partly as a result of Polish pressure,  the original U.S. concept had been broadened to include the  question of relations with Russia, and the willingness of the  Atlantic alliance to strengthen the independence of the former  Soviet republics. Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak stressed the  importance of the "Partnership for Development," under which the  United States would make its economy more open to cooperation  with the states of Central and Eastern Europe.    For Andrzej Olechowski, the "Partnership" proposals offered  enough security to the states of the region, in the event that  in Russia, "historical reflections took precedence over  democratic thoughts."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim  Yong-sam Monday decried the demand of people of all walks of  life for another "Uruguay Round [UR] negotiation" concerning  agricultural market opening, and ruled out the possibility of  another negotiation, claiming that the demand came from  ignorance of "diplomacy," according to a radio report from Seoul.    It was outrageous of the traitor to try to justify the  kowtowing diplomacy and treacherous diplomacy yielding to the  brigandish demands of foreign aggressors and call for accepting  it.    He openly broke his "election commitment not to open the  rice  market" when it was still vivid in people's memory. This  revealed once again the true color of the poor fellow who has  prolonged his life with perfidy and treachery.</p>

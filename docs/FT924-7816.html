			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: No fear of flying - William Packer is intrigued by Peter Greenaway's choice at the Louvre PETER Greenaway is that most perplexing of types to a fellow Englishman: a film-maker who would sooner be known as artist and intellectual - a man more interested in ideas, and the exploration and extension of the possibilities of his craft, than in any mere pleasuring of his audience. His films, with their pretentious titles (Drowning by numbers, A Zed and two noughts) their affected music, their obscure jokes and art-historical references, tease when they do not shock, shock when they do not bore, and bore when they do not infuriate. He is, in short taken more seriously abroad than at home. Two major European institutions have lately had the bright idea of inviting his collaboration, not in the making of a film, but in the preparation of exhibitions intended to test the idea of what an exhibition may be, or do. Understanding his predeliction for lists and categories, and to mark its own tercentenary, the Academy of Fine Arts at Vienna recently asked him to nominate, as the title puts it, 100 Objects to represent the World, which ended last week. I did not see this exhibition, but I have the catalogue, with its inventory of objects and images, and its instructions for their display  - a shadow, a fallen tree, a gate, a wheelchair, fire, ink, a gibbet, a pig, a kiss, Adam &amp; Eve. 'Exhibit 100 will be the catalogue of the exhibition . . . open at the page that comments on Exhibit 100 that shows the Exhibition Catalogue open at the page that comments on Exhibit 100 that . . .' Pretentious? Perhaps, but intriguing too, and an exhibition I wish I had been able to see for myself. His current exhibition at the Louvre in Paris, is, on the surface, rather more orthodox, yet here, too, the glossing and testing of ideas, the personal ruminations, the propositions and self-justifications, the striking of attitudes - these lists are habit-forming - soon declare themselves. Greenaway was given the freedom of the Department of Drawings at the Louvre, to make a choice on any theme. He took as his subject man's earth-bound envy of the birds and the dream of personal flight. Le bruit des nuages of the exhibition's title - the sound of the clouds - is, he says, 'what I eventually wish to hear when I am truly airborne.' It is not a large show, 93 works in all, from the 15th to the 19th centuries and passing from the humane classical fantasies of Mantegna to the dark psychological symbolism of Odilon Redon. To break off at more or less the moment of man's mastery of powered flight was quite deliberate. But the arrangement is not chronological: rather it brings appropriate images from all periods together in nine sections, under headings subsidiary to the main theme. The first of them, indeed, deals not with flight at all, but with man's earth-bound condition, borne down by gravity, against which he struggles to lift himself. so the dream of flight begins. Turn by turn we consider the angels, and the imaginative release of a spiritual ecstasy. We explore the clouds and skies and the upper reaches of the air. And as sure as we approach unto heaven itself, so as surely are we damned by our presumption, and the great fall begins. Down we go, with Phaeton and Icarus, down into hell or, at the very least, down to earth, that the whole cycle may begin again. The quality of the work, it need hardly be said, is wonderfully high but it is the variety within the common theme that is the point. From Van Dyck's St Francis receiving the stigmata to studies of cloud effects by Delacroix, Constable and Whistler, it brings together, in this stimulating melange of fantasy and objectivity, spirituality and the mundane, works that more orthodox scholarship would never think of seeing by the same light. And by doing so, Greenaway says much that is useful, unexpected and intriguing of our common human aspirations and spiritual longings, that speak to us still, through all the differences of time and culture. We have such collections in the UK that might readily be plundered and illuminated in just this way, by any suitably educated, free and radical eye. The Artist's Eye exhibitions at the National Gallery have long offered an admirable example, within their necessarily limited scope. Would that others would only follow. 'Le bruit des Nuages': Louvre, Paris, until February 1</p>

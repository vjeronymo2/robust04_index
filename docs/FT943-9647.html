			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Management: Hitting the open road - A restructured Pirelli is pinning its hopes of a return to profit on a culture of transparency During the next year or so, Pirelli's managers will be seeing a lot more of Marco Tronchetti Provera, the Italian tyre and cable manufacturer's managing director. Pirelli, a company which has invested heavily in the latest fibre-optic technology, is installing video conference facilities throughout the group. The network is in place for the group's research units in Germany and Italy. The UK, Brazil and France will follow. A separate network for management should be in place by the end of the year. Tronchetti Provera is a manager who wants to see and be seen. In Italian and English, he talks repeatedly about clarity, transparency, visibility and information flow. The video conference, he says, apart from its obvious advantages for researchers who need to see each other's models and plans, makes management easier. 'I do a global tour twice a year to make contact with people, and every month the main people in charge also come to Italy,' he says. 'But with the video conference, you don't just talk face to face; it allows more flexible management.' Video conferences are also a symbol of how Tronchetti Provera has changed Pirelli since Leopoldo Pirelli, the chairman, gave up executive control in February 1992, the nadir in the company's 122-year history. That was just after Pirelli had been forced to abandon its takeover of Continental, the slightly bigger German tyre-maker. About half Pirelli's L673bn (Pounds 276m) consolidated loss for 1991 was blamed on the cost of mounting the bid. The takeover was prepared by a complex network of alliances, built on secret guarantees that Pirelli would cover any losses on Continental shares incurred by its allies. The strategy looks like the exact opposite of the culture of transparency Tronchetti Provera has now instilled in Pirelli. The managing director is too tactful to put it that way. 'I think that all crises can help accelerate the process of change. Crisis in the market, internal crisis, if led in the right direction, can achieve good results rapidly.' The Continental debacle was the spur which allowed Tronchetti Provera to cut costs, reduce the company's break-even point, and slice debt from L4,000bn in January 1992 to L2,000bn in June this year. Excluding the sale of non-core businesses, Pirelli factories have been reduced from 102 to 80, and the workforce from 50,000 to 40,000. Another stage of this restructuring began last month, when Pirelli announced it would sell its farm tyres business in the US. The group's results for this year should demonstrate the benefits of this post-crisis restructuring to concentrate on the core tyre and cables businesses. In 1993, Pirelli's net losses narrowed to L96bn. The company expects to return to net profit in 1994. Tronchetti Provera has tried to encourage what he sees as strong potential inside the group. More than 60 per cent of the company's managers have changed position within Pirelli in the last two years, for example, and new ideas have been promoted in the cables and tyres operations. 'It was clear to me (in early 1992) that Pirelli had the internal capacity for product innovation in tyres, which was under-used. We had a strong brand name in the world, the result of product quality, but also of the imagination of our new products,' he says. 'So we started to provide incentives for this capacity.' Cables, he says, followed suit. That is where Tronchetti Provera's emphasis on communication comes in. He has tried to encourage flows of information: 'If development (of ideas) is left up to each country, it's difficult to collaborate and innovate. If, on the other hand, you try to transfer information quickly between quality people . . . that's when ideas are born and opportunities to do new things.' Pirelli has also kept more in touch with clients. A higher proportion of turnover in the tyres division - 65 per cent - now comes from the replacement market rather than the own-equipment market. That means margins are higher, but also that the demands of customers are clearer. In cables, US subsidiaries have relayed information to the centre about the leading edge of the multimedia revolution, encouraging Pirelli to develop its high-technology fibre optics more aggressively. Nevertheless, many Italian observers still seem to expect Pirelli to behave like other Italian companies with the same heritage, cutting deals behind the closed doors of the salotto buono (good drawing room) of Italian corporate tradition. Tronchetti Provera's career fits the traditional template: he married Leopoldo Pirelli's daughter (they are now separated) and his family investment company owns 5.75 per cent of Pirelli's holding company. But he dismisses this old-fashioned interpretation of Pirelli's ambitions. For example, he says stories about how Pirelli wants to exert an influence over Stet, the state-owned telecommunications company, after it is privatised, 'make us angry'. Rumour has it that Pirelli will link up with Mediobanca - the influential Milan merchant bank which advised the group on the ill-fated Continental takeover - to take control of Stet by the back door. Tronchetti Provera describes this as 'rubbish' and points out that Pirelli wants liberalisation of the telecoms sector, not perpetuation of a private monopoly. He does, however, foresee continued strong technological co-operation between the two companies. 'It's a serious industrial project by Pirelli and by Pirelli only - not a power-play as some have tried to depict it,' he adds. Clearly the moment for the geographical expansion of Pirelli has arrived. As for acquisitions, it seems the ghost of the Continental bid may have been finally exorcised. 'Before thinking of acquisitions, a company must be under management control, be cost-effective, and have a capacity for innovation. Then it can look at opportunities,' says Tronchetti Provera. Has Pirelli reached that point? 'We're close.'</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICAN OFFICIALS HELD IN CALEXICO BRIBE CASE;  </P> <P> SHOOTING: TWO FROM CONSUL'S OFFICE IN SAN DIEGO ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY TRYING  TO BUY THE IDENTITY OF THE BORDER PATROL OFFICER WHO WOUNDED YOUTH.  </P> <P> The investigation of the controversial shooting of a Mexican youth by a Border  Patrol agent took an unusual twist Tuesday when Calexico police arrested two  Mexican consular officials who allegedly attempted to bribe a police employee  to learn the identity of the agent involved.  </P> <P> Officers from the Imperial County city made the arrests at a restaurant in  nearby El Centro at 2:20 p.m. Tuesday after authorities arranged a sting in  response to a bribe offer of $500 to $600, Calexico Police Chief Leslie Ginn  said.  </P> <P> The two men in custody -- both employees of the Mexican consul's office here --  were booked on suspicion of bribery, police said.  </P> <P> "Even if this were Joe Blow off the street, he'd have gone to jail for bribery  too," Ginn said.  </P> <P> The shooting victim, Eduardo Garcia Zamores, 15, was wounded in the torso Nov.  18 as he straddled the fence on the border between Calexico and Mexicali, the  state capital of Baja California.  </P> <P> The agent contends he fired because the youth was about to throw a rock at him.  </P> <P> Zamores says the shooting was unprovoked and several witnesses have backed up  his story.  </P> <P> The case has resulted in huge protests as well as charges and countercharges by  investigators of each country against their counterparts. The youth has filed a  $9-million negligence claim against the Border Patrol. The bribery allegation  seems likely to escalate the controversy.  </P> <P> Ginn said a Calexico-based female Mexican consular official approached a female  police employee Monday and offered $500 to $600 for the agent's name. Mexican  officials want to extradite the agent, but have been unable to obtain his name  from U.S. authorities.  </P> <P> The police employee notified her superiors, Ginn said, and a decision was made  to go ahead with a "meet" as part of a criminal bribery investigation.  </P> <P> The two Mexican officials met Tuesday with the police employee at a Denny's  restaurant in El Centro, while police had the scene under surveillance, Ginn  said. The two consular officials allegedly handed over the cash and the police  worker gave them a piece of paper on which was written a name -- not that of  the Border Patrol agent -- then police moved in, Ginn said.  </P> <P> "They were arrested on the spot, brought down and booked into our city jail,"  said Ginn, who has headed the small department for 5 1/2 years after a 29-year  career as a San Diego police officer.  </P> <P> Arrested were Ascension Martinez Pena, 46, the consulate's chancellor, or  administrator, and Karla Elena Correa Ibarra, 27, a secretary, who allegedly  made the initial contact with the police employee, Ginn said. Both were  released on $5,000 bail.  </P> <P> The police chief said he believed neither of the two has diplomatic immunity,  which is accorded to many representatives of foreign governments.  </P> <P> Marco E. Lopez, the San Diego attorney who is representing them, said he  believed both were shielded from arrest by diplomatic protection.  </P> <P> "The big shots in Washington are going to have to explain that to me," Ginn  said.  </P> <P> Enrique Loaeza, the Mexican consul general in San Diego, declined to comment on  specifics of the case.  </P> <P> Lopez contended that his clients were "entrapped" and that Calexico police were  motivated by vindictiveness toward Mexican officials.  </P> <P> Ginn denied the allegations. The police chief has charged publicly that his  investigation of the shooting is "at a standstill" because Mexican authorities  have refused to provide him access to the victim and have impeded his inquiry.  </P> <P> Mexican officials contend that they have cooperated with police.  </P></p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Arts: Lessons from the low life - Mary Rose Beaumont reviews Peter Howson in Glasgow It may sound somewhat premature for an artist to have a major retrospective at the age of 35, but Peter Howson has no difficulty whatever in filling the vast halls of Glasgow's McLellan Galleries with astonishing conviction. The earliest work in the exhibition is a small but vivid crucifixion; painted at the precocious age of six, it is prophetic of the subject of many of his mature paintings, in which a single figure is tied to a post, a humiliation actually undergone by a schoolfriend of the young Howson. This unpleasant event left an indelible memory of human cruelty which has never been exorcised and is indeed one of the constant motifs in his work. Howson attended the Glasgow School of Art from 1975-77. He did not flourish and left, ironically, to join the Scottish Infantry, which confirmed his early experience of male brutality, later recorded in several shocking pictures. Before returning to the School of Art, he did various menial jobs which gave him a unique insight into the low life of Glasgow, a fruitful source of inspiration ever since. His repertoire of characters, observed during those years, include boxers, dossers, derelicts and drinkers, all failures and rejects of our society. Scottish Expressionism came to the fore during the 1980s, and Howson, along with other graduates of the Glasgow School of Art, sprang to prominence in an exhibition called New Image Glasgow which alerted the world to a new, feisty, urban-based art, inspired to an extent by German Expressionism, but with a compassion for the underdog which was peculiar to Scotland. Baudelaire would have been delighted with this late 20th century celebration of 'the heroism of modern life'. Howson has been accused of excessive caricature. I think exaggeration is a better word, exaggeration of features and gestures to make his point: the bully boys look more bestial, the depraved look more delinquent, and the depressed look suicidal. Mob hysteria, such as at a football match, and Nazi salutes given by those taunting a trussed and helpless victim, are warnings against the kind of mindless violence with which we are becoming increasingly familiar. So-called 'Patriots', as we know, are easily transformed into right wing extremists. Howson's most impressive achievements are his triptychs, which have rightly been called apocalyptic. The world is his stage and human conflicts and desires his subjects. Violence on a global scale is endemic in these works, yet he can present sympathetically the predicament of a single individual: in 'The Three Faces of Eve', 1990, the three panels trace the downfall of a young woman from innocent childhood through the stew of a grotesquely decadent nightclub to her degradation and probable death in a graveyard. One is swept along by the narrative, marvelling at the technical skill with which the artist has deployed the complex compositions. Portraits are important to Howson. He has portrayed himself in many moods and aspects, but perhaps his most sustained achievement is the set of 25 etchings entitled 'Saracen Heads', 1988, a gallery of exquisitely drawn heads of types encountered in the Saracen pub close to his studio in Glasgow's East End. A series of 'Gallowgate Guests', 1991, in mixed media on paper, investigates another terrifying array of mostly evil-looking people, many of whom, like the pig-faced patriot have appeared in the paintings (to September 5). At the Glasgow Print Studio Adrian Wiszniewski is showing a new suite of ten prints in a variety of techniques entitled 'Sex and Matisse'. The prints play on a variety of themes by or of Matisse - a bather, an odalisque, a musical instrument in an interior and a photograph of the wheelchair-bound old man directing an assistant (an odalisque up a ladder) on the placing of his paper cut-outs. Wiszniewski also had in mind Madonna's book Sex, the titles of his prints wittily playing on the crossover between artist and artiste, between camp and vamp. Wiszniewski has abandoned his erstwhile dreaming youths for wall paintings covered with huge abstract marks made with a house painter's brush. Cursively written neon signs give full rein to his visual jokes and puns, such as 'If In Doubt, Use Black', a hoary art school cliche, or 'This Happy Void', a phrase with which the artist aims to counteract the prevailing fin de siecle gloom with bouncing optimism. The most recent work is in cut and painted perspex. Here too, the titles are important: 'Coffee and Cream' is a small white square set over a larger one in 'Cafe au lait'. A set of glorious carmine rectangles arranged according to the Fibonacci system is entitled 'Rosebud', a not so oblique reference to Citizen Kane. These seem to me to be key works, perhaps a turning point in Wiszniewski's career (to July 24). The William Hardie Gallery is showing Some Very New Paintings by David Hockney. The paintings are designated simply as 'The First (or Twenty First) VN Painting', and what is VN about them is that they are brilliantly coloured, almost entirely abstract paintings in the same mode as those currently on show in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. The works stem from Hockney's designs for Richard Strauss's Die Frau Ohne Schatten, performed at Covent Garden last autumn. As the hero of the opera is Barak the Dyer, Hockney conceived the settings in terms of colour, light and texture, which has translated very effectively into easel paintings. Those who think of Hockney as a consummate draughtsman and figurative painter will hate these VN paintings, but those who are prepared to follow him onto the stage will enjoy them for their lush ebullience (to August 27).</p>

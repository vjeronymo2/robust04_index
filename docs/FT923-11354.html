			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Companies House review is ordered THE Department of Trade and Industry yesterday announced a review of Companies House that could lead to the full or partial privatisation of the Cardiff-based agency. The move signals a further step in the government's programme to put services into the private sector where appropriate. 'The government's job is to govern, not to administer,' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday. 'This is the basis on which I intend my department to carry out its review of agencies, starting with Companies House.' Supporters of Civil Service privatisation have long argued that Companies House is an ideal candidate for privatisation, but any decision to sell it would be considered controversial because of potential implications for jobs and because of worries over impartiality under private control. The department is soon to appoint consultants to help with the Companies House review, which will examine its operation and role and advise on how its work can best be carried out in the future. Among options to be studied will be full or partial privatisation, contracting out of some activities or continuing as present. The department promised full consultation with staff and unions. Companies House employs the equivalent of 1,150 full-time staff and incorporates companies, makes company information available to the public, and takes action against companies which file their reports late.</p>

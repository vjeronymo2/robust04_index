			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Gautama Fonseca: "The North Americans and </F> Our Right"]    [Text] The media have been reporting several land ownership  litigations involving U.S. citizens are being heard in our  national courts.    They have also disclosed the U.S. Embassy in Honduras  released a note on 18 February stating "a delegation consisting  of two personnel of the U.S. Senate" are visiting our country to  learn about the cases in question.    The same media also reported Senator Jesse Helms is  sponsoring amendments to the internal legislation of his country  "to exclude from foreign aid any state that 1) Has prior to,  during, or after the amendment: a) Nationalized or expropriated  any property that belongs to a U.S. citizen; b) Relinquished or  annulled any contract or agreement with a U.S. citizen; or c)  Taken any other action (such as levying discriminatory taxes or  others) aimed at seizing or controlling property of a U.S.  citizen. 2) Has failed to give adequate and effective  compensation for the property within a three-year period. Such  a compensation must be effected in convertible currency  equivalent to the total value of the property as required by  international law."    Disregarding the peculiar language of the translation, it  seems to us our government must carefully study this type of  news, because they do not necessarily agree with that that is  stated in our Constitution or with the rules of Public  International Law or Private International Law which we have to  follow.    It is a known fact to everyone that Article 30 of the  Constitution states "Foreigners must respect authorities and  abide by the law from the moment they enter national territory."  Article 33 establishes that "Foreigners cannot lodge a complaint  or demand compensation from the state in any other way or case  that Hondurans can."    It also stipulates foreigners "will not resort to diplomatic  channels except when justice is denied (and that) to that  effect, the fact a sentence is not favorable to the person  filing the complaint will not be seen as a denial of justice.  Anyone violating these regulations will no longer be authorized  to live in the country."    Although it is no secret the United States is a superpower  and as of today is the number one nation on earth, this does not  mean, if it wants to act according to the law and morals, it  should try to become sort of a comptroller supervising the  legality of third states.    Therefore, to prevent unnecessary frictions and so relations  between our country and the United States can develop within the  framework of mutual respect, our Foreign Ministry must ensure  that all U.S. citizens who come in contact with our country  memorize those two articles of our Constitution.    The U.S. Embassy, on the other hand, should help in carrying  out this task for reasons that obviously need not be mentioned.</p>

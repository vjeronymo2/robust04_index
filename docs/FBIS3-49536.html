			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A special declaration issued by the Bulgarian  Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Bulgaria regarding the NATO  summit held in Brussels states as follows:    The Partnership for Peace initiative is a qualitatively new  step in the relations between the partner countries and NATO.    We welcome with satisfaction the North Atlantic Alliance's  readiness to open up in relation to the problems of security in  Eastern Europe and to accept new members in the future. We  regard the holding of consultations with NATO in the event of an  immediate threat to the security of certain Central and Eastern  European countries as one the most promising and useful forms of  political cooperation within the framework of the initiative.    The Republic of Bulgaria declares its interest in taking  part  in the implementation of the Partnership for Peace initiative,  which is in conformance with Bulgaria's readiness to share the  responsibility for strengthening stability and security in  Europe.</p>

He accused the  political powers involved in the ruling process of adopting a  harsh, centralized, and backward approach to running the  country's affairs. He said this confirms that there is no desire  to unify institutions, but rather to maintain the status quo.    In an interview with AL-AHRAM to be published on 2 February,  al-'Attas said he rejected an offer by Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih to join the General People's Congress to avoid  further division within the Yemeni Socialist Party.    Al-'Attas affirmed that there are military movements in the  two sections of Yemen, particularly after the suspension of all  projects to rebuild, restructure, and unite the Armed Forces  since the declaration of unity on 22 May.    The Yemeni prime minister accused the state of collaborating  with terrorists to strike at rival political forces in the local  arena. He noted that the terrorist elements in Yemen are being  used in operations at home and abroad.    Asked when he would return to Sanaa, al-'Attas said: Soon,  once we reach full agreement on the security arrangements and  the legal and constitutional guarantees that aim to rearrange  affairs and establish peace and stability in Yemen.</p>

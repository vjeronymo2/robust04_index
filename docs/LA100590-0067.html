			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURY COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> MAN SAYS MORTICIAN FELT BEATING WAS JUST  </P> <P> When David Wayne Sconce learned that rival mortician Timothy Waters had been  savagely beaten, he responded that Waters got what he deserved, another  mortician testified Thursday during Sconce's preliminary hearing on a murder  charge in Ventura County Municipal Court.  </P> <P> Waters had spread word among Southern California morticians that the Sconce  family's mortuary, the Lamb Funeral Home, was violating state funeral home  laws, testified Donald Richard Gray, a retired mortician.  </P> <P> Gray testified that he was just opening his Aftercare Funeral Services mortuary  in Van Nuys in 1984 when Waters warned him not to contract with Sconce for  cremations because the Lamb Funeral Home burned more than one body at a time  and stole dental gold from the bodies it handled. Gray said he repeatedly  mentioned the allegations to Sconce, who denied them.  </P> <P> Gray testified that while helping transfer bodies from his station wagon into  cardboard cremation containers at the Lamb Funeral Home in February, 1985, he  told Sconce that Waters had been severely beaten.  </P> <P> Sconce is serving a five-year sentence after pleading guilty to paying two men  to beat up Waters, and another five-year sentence for pleading guilty to  stealing gold from bodies and conducting multiple cremations.  </P> <P> In the Ventura court, he has been accused of poisoning Waters with oleander to  silence his allegations about the Lamb Funeral Home operation.  </P> <P> Dr. Fredric Rieders, a Philadelphia-area toxicologist, testified Thursday that  he conducted extensive chemical tests in 1988 that conclusively proved that  oleander was in Waters' system and caused his death.  </P> <P> Waters' sister has testified that oleander grew wild near her Zuma house, where  Waters spent the last weekend before he died. But prosecutors have not  presented evidence on the specific form of oleander that Waters ingested. MACK  REED  </P></p>

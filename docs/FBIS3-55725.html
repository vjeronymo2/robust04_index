No decision was reached before  the lunch break. Three figures were proposed -- 14, 20 and 50  people. A rating vote left only the last two numbers for  further debate, but none scored a majority in further voting.    Factions, their leaders and numbers are of special concern  to  the present legislature in which the Liberal Democratic Party  can command the largest single group of deputies and thus have a  decisive say in voting.    Before the break the Duma elected members of the commission  charged with seeing to it that the electronic system used in  registering and displaying voting results function effectively,  and two other commissions. The deputies also elected a  provisional secretariat of the State Duma.</p>

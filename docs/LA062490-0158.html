			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RIGHT THING  </P> <P> In "Doing the Right Thing," a YAF activist in San Diego said: "I wasn't there  during black slavery -- why should I pay for it?" My first response, I must  admit, was anger, and I went to my computer in a burst of indignation to dash  off a reply to this individual's self-centered ignorance.  </P> <P> But the more I looked at that quote, the more I came to realize that in a  certain warped way, I agree with it.  </P> <P> I am a black man. Statistically speaking, that means that in terms of virtually  every indicator of life-quality, I am heir to more than my fair share of  misery. It means that, as far as the police are concerned, I was born a  suspect. It means that I am slandered and libeled with numbing regularity by  mass media, which reduce me to bite-sized, easily digestible bits of stereotype  rather than dealing with me as a whole human being. And finally, it means a  legacy of frustration whose depth defies words.  </P> <P> So, yes, I agree with that nameless YAFfer. I wasn't there during black  slavery, either, and I shouldn't have to pay for it. But I do. Every day, I do.  </P> <P> LEONARD PITTS JR.  </P> <P> Baldwin Park  </P></p>

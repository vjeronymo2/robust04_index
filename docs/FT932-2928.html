			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (3): Market is immature - Mobile data services MOBILE data has an identity problem. There is little argument that the market for mobile data is potentially enormous - but for the moment many customers appear confused by the plethora of emerging services and equipment. Market size estimates vary wildly but Arthur D Little has identified 3.8m potential users for wireless data services in the US by the end of the century and PA Consulting has predicted that there will be 2m users of two-way mobile data in the UK by the end of the decade. To date most mobile communications have focused on voice. However data transmission has several key advantages over voice telephony: it is generally cheaper, quicker and more accurate and while pagers and cellular phones play an important role, they have limitations when it comes to transmitting complex or large volumes of information. Typical applications for mobile data involve transferring information to and from portable computers or mobile data terminals and office computer systems or other mobile users. Potential users include the projected owners of a new generation of hand-held devices called 'personal digital assistants'. Mobile data will provide corporate sales forces with up-to-date customer information or keep track of emergency services, truck fleets or railway wagons. But so far, mobile data has failed to live up to early expectations and most mobile data operators have been scaling back their subscriber projections, and in some cases their investments. The shortfall may simply reflect the fact that most services are still in their infancy, or it may be because there are a bewildering array of delivery systems. In the UK, for example, mobile data services are offered by the cellular operators, dedicated mobile data network operators such as Hutchison, Ram Mobile Data, Cognito and Vodafone's Paknet, specialist network operators such as Securicor Datatrak, and over public and private mobile radio networks - all using incompatible standards and equipment. Unlike the cellular telephone network operators, who have managed to attract more than 1.5m subscribers for their voice services in the UK, the uptake of data services has been somewhat disappointing. In contrast, most estimates put the total number of subscribers to all data services in the UK at about 10,000. Generally, transmitting data over a non-dedicated service means sacrificing transmission quality, coverage or compromising in some other area such as message length. In addition, transmitting data over an analogue cellular system is considerably more difficult than over the public switched telephone network. Nevertheless, much of the research shows that many customers require a combination of voice and data communications. One solution is to build the specialist electronics into dedicated equipment or use a special cellular modem. Vodafone's Mobile Data Service, which claims several thousand users and claims to be 'the UK's most widely-used mobile data communications solution', uses a special cellular data link control modem to enable customers to transmit and receive error-free data over the Vodafone cellular network which provides automatic standards conversion. Another option is to wait for digital cellular telephones based on the pan-European GSM standard. Vodafone has already tested a feature developed for it by Sema called the short message service centre which enables messages of up to 160 characters to be sent to a GSM handset and displayed on its LCD screen. Paging is perhaps the most obvious application of this facility although Vodafone acknowledges that 'the size cost and short battery life of a GSM phone relative to an advanced alphanumeric pager will ensure that GSM does not compete head-to-head with the European paging market.' However, the GSM specification also includes a 'V24 interface' which will eventually link the mobile directly to any terminal - for example, a mobile fax machine or a portable computer. This could bring the GSM phone into more direct competition with the dedicated mobile data networks. The UK government issued five 25-year licenses for nationwide public mobile data networks in October 1991. Prior to this only privately-owned radio networks had existed. The new licence winners were Cognito, DMC, Hutchison Mobile Data, Motorola and Ram Mobile Data. Of these, DMC and Motorola did not take up their licences but Paknet, now owned by Vodafone, was subsequently awarded a mobile licence in addition to its existing fixed licence under which it had been providing a packet-switch data service. Cognito was closed after the sale of its parent, Dowty Group, last year, but was relaunched last autumn after a management buy in-buy out deal. Cognito's new service provides customers with a mobile two-way text messaging system using a hand-held communicator called a Messenger which has a small screen and keyboard and operates via the group's nationwide data cellular network. Hutchison Mobile Data and Ram Mobile Data have also launched their mobile data services - using rival and incompatible equipment. Hutchison's system is based on Motorola's RD-LAP system which is also used by Deutsche Telekom in Germany while Ram, a joint venture involving US-based Ram Broadcasting and BellSouth, France Telcom, Swedish Telcom and Bouygues,is using Mobitex packet-switching technology developed by Ericsson. Mobitex is beginning to emerge as a de facto standard in Europe. So far, Ericsson has won contracts from seven out of the 10 European mobile data licenses awarded. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (Etsi) is still working on an official standard which is not now expected before 1996 at the earliest. In the meantime the relative growth of competing mobile data technologies probably depends on how quickly useful applications software is developed. This is clearly recognised by Mr John Jarvis, Ram's new chief executive in the UK, who says the group is encouraging the development of new vertical and horizontal applications, and the migration of existing applications running on private data networks. Already, more than 100 application projects are in trials with Ram. Among the applications which have recently been adapted for use on the Ram system are Dispatcher, a Window's-based fleet dispatch software and hardware package, and Remote-1, a comprehensive field call activity management tool and communications package. Ram and Computer Services for Industry have jointly developed Mobilink-400, an interface enabling portable terminals to interact with IBM AS-400 systems. In addition, Ram and Lotus Development have recently announced an agreement to develop a wireless version of Lotus cc:Mail, the market leader in Lan (local area networks) -based electronic mail systems which will enable portable computer users to send and receive electronic mail messages. Mr Jarvis believes that having applications in use by real customers will give public mobile data an important head start against GSM and reinforces mobile data's distinct advantages over other mobile technologies. 'We have an edge in response time and in terms of cost,' he says. One area which appears to hold particular promise for public mobile data is fleet and freight management, monitoring and security. This is also the specialist niche chosen by Securicor Datatrak. A new version of the established automatic - tracking Fleetrak system enables drivers to send and receive messages using in-vehicle terminals and printers. Securicor Datatrak owns and manages its own wide area radio-based communications network in the UK and claims that its system has a number of advantages over other mobile data services including faster set-up times. Over the next seven years its should become clear which mobile data technologies are going to survive the inevitable shake-out. Like many other segments of the fast-expanding mobile communications industry, mobile data is still an immature market with competing technologies jostling for position.</p>

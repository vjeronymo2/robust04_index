			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Personal View: Arts funding, too precious to be a political drama President George Bush's removal of Mr John Frohnmayer, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, illustrates what happens when politicians meddle in art. Mr Frohnmayer's tenure of office demonstrated what has long been known at the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Endowment's UK counterpart: namely that artists need freedom to experiment, and that freedom can be costly and controversial. The Arts Council spends Pounds 200m annually on the arts under protection of its royal charter. Its chief executive is accountable to parliament. The system provides a buffer from political interference. In an election year in the UK, not surprisingly siren voices have already been calling for direct ministerial funding of the arts' 'flagships', including the Royal Opera House and the Royal Shakespeare Company. At present these organisations receive grants from the Arts Council, whose experts assess artistic quality - that elusive category  - and their value for money. It may be tempting for a new arts minister to short-circuit this process and send the cheques himself, but the consequences of such a move would be serious. It would ride roughshod over the 'arm's length' principle of keeping politicians away from 'artistic' decisions (contrived by Lord Keynes, the Arts Council's founder and first chairman); and it would store up significant political fall-out, since the minister would then have to provide detailed answers in the Commons on questions relating to everything from Hamlet's father's ghost to the cost of costumes in a production of the Ring Cycle. Direct funding of the arts remains an unattractive political option. This does not mean the arts are politically unimportant. It means a distinction must be drawn between an effective public policy to support the arts and the practical means to carry it out. A recent independent survey for the Arts Council revealed that 71 per cent of respondents values the arts as a prime contributor to the quality of life; and 69 per cent supports public investment in the arts. In 1990, 17m adults regularly attended more than one type of arts event. In the past five years opera audiences have risen 15 per cent; jazz by 10 per cent. Last year 100m people visited art galleries and museums, far more than attended football matches. Later this year the Arts Council will unveil its national arts and media strategy which aims to take account of the changing patterns of leisure and participation in the arts. The Arts Council will look to a new government to assist it in carrying out the national strategy. However, there is another reason why British politicians should pay attention to the arts: they make money, in fact more money than the UK motor industry. How? Arts expenditure: the total estimated spending on the arts in 1990-91 was Pounds 1.5bn - modest in the context of the UK gross domestic product of Pounds 547bn. The Pounds 1.5bn provides for libraries, the Arts Council, military bands, museums and galleries and new arts buildings. Arts income: according to the Treasury, the arts contributed Pounds 6bn to the UK balance of payments in 1990. This figure includes the sale of works of art, publishing, television and film royalties and arts expenditures in tourism. By contrast, the value of UK vehicle exports in 1990 totalled Pounds 4bn. On the basis of this evidence, television news ought to carry stories nightly about the arts industry, displacing the familiar litanies of Rover. But this is unlikely. The 'big issues' in the election will be health, education, defence and taxation. Scarcely any other issue receives detailed public scrutiny. So what do the main political parties have to offer the arts? The Conservatives promise 'an expanding partnership between the state and the private sector', pointing to the success of the government's business sponsorship incentive scheme which has produced Pounds 30m annually of business support. In spite of talk of 'incentives for the successful development of the arts', no new fiscal measures have yet been mentioned by the government despite indications that a national lottery might be included in the manifesto. Labour has produced arts policy documents, including the crafts, design, women in the arts and architecture. Its 'big idea' is a new ministry of arts and media. The Arts Council is to remain. The party also proposes new statutory responsibilities for local authorities. However, a 'weak' obligation to support the arts placed upon local councils might produce an extra Pounds 50m-Pounds 100m bill for the environment secretary. Labour has also made noises of approval for a national lottery to support the arts, sports and the environment. Like Labour, the Liberals promise a single ministry for the arts. They undertake to provide increased public funding for the arts 'up to the European Community average', which suggests a quadrupling of the Arts Council's grant. They also promise to abolish entrance charges to museums and galleries. The Scottish National party's policy for the arts is predicated on the belief that Scotland's national culture is under threat from the dominant culture of England. The SNP promises a national theatre for Scotland, and action to safeguard traditional folk arts. So far so good. One big difference between the forthcoming election and that of 1987 is that the political parties seem to have taken the arts more seriously. But the general principle, pace Mr Frohnmayer, is that the arts are too precious a resource to be the subject of radical party political differences. What is undoubtedly clear is that the arts will be remembered long after Ecu and Emu are forgotten. Lord Palumbo is chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain</p>

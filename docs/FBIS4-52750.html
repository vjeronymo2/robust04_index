			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  and select cabinet ministers on Friday agreed on the need to  come up with powerful measures by the end of June to promote  deregulation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said. At  a ministerial meeting on government regulation plans, Hata said  drawing up effective deregulatory measures is a mission of his  administration, the top government spokesman told a news  conference.    The premier and the ministers also concurred on the need for  each cabinet minister to take the lead on relaxing economically  restrictive government regulations in the face of resistance  from government ministries and agencies, Kumagai said.    Friday's meeting drew Hata, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa,  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, International Trade and  Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, Management and Coordination  Agency Chief Koshiro Ishida, Economic Planning Agency Head  Yoshio Terasawa and Kumagai.    Kumagai said the cabinet will convene a second ministerial  get-together on deregulation possibly next week by inviting  heads of ministries and agencies holding control over a number  of regulations. The government has vowed to come up with  full-scale deregulatory measures by the end of June as part of  efforts to spur domestic demand and hence the nation's appetite  for imports.    The cabinet meeting came at a time when the government's  administrative reform headquarters is striving to seek specific  deregulation measures at its three working groups. Earlier  Friday, a business leader urged Hata to relax various government  regulations on real estate trading and  telecommunications-related industries.    Isao Nakauchi, vice chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), called on Hata at the premier's  official residence and made the pitch. Nakauchi told reporters  he informed Hata of his dissatisfaction with the government's  working groups on deregulation, saying their talks have been  dominated by bureaucrats and that opinions of the private sector  have not been well reflected.    Hata reportedly told Nakauchi, who is also chairman and  president of Daiei Inc., a major supermarket chain, that he  hopes to promote deregulation through the initiatives of his  cabinet rather than the bureaucracy.    In the morning, Keidanren submitted to Kumagai a letter  urging the government to promote deregulation. Kumagai told his  news conference that the working groups will bear sufficient  fruit in their efforts to seek effective measures to ease  regulations. "We must work to comply with requests from both at  home and abroad, or what you might call real demands," the chief  cabinet secretary said.</p>

			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sedgwick pressured The Pounds 143m rights issue from Sedgwick, the insurance broking group, to fund its acquisition of financial services group Noble Lowndes from TSB and Scandinavian insurance broker Arvid Bergvall, came as a surprise to the market. One insurance broking specialist described the move as 'realistic recognition by Sedgwick of the need to push more deeply into the consulting market'. Sedgwick shares came under growing pressure as the session wore on, with dealers becoming increasingly nervous about the possibility of US group Transamerica placing a short 20m nil-paid shares in the market this morning. The US group, which has a 24.1 per cent stake in Sedgwick, said it will not take up its full entitlement to the issue. By the close Sedgwick were 15 lower at 191p, with turnover reaching a hefty 5.1m shares, the biggest single day's business since mid-July.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Excellent basis for funding research Sir, Your editorial, 'University reform' (October 11), calls for research funding to be restricted to a designated 20 or so universities. But if such concentration is to occur, it must be strictly on the basis of excellence. There is a belief in some quarters that high-quality research can only be conducted in large institutions. Yet of the 20 top research universities at the last research assessment exercise, 11 were of middle or small size (London School of Economics, Warwick, Lancaster, Sussex, York, Birkbeck, Durham, Exeter, Essex, East Anglia and Bath). These 11 have demonstrated that it is not necessary to be big to be excellent or innovative. A high degree of focus, support for new fields, an interdisciplinary approach and the ability to be flexible and fast-moving can, individually or in combination, compensate for lack of size.

There are grounds to believe that these barriers may be  removed by the United States in the near future. For its part  the united States stressed the need to streamline customs  tariffs and taxes in Russia. The two sides expressed the hope  that Russia will create a favourable climate for foreign  investors.    Kozyrev also met with Japanese Government representative  Nobuo Matsunaga to discuss the situation on the Korean  peninsula.

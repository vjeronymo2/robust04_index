			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Arts: Exiles go wild for the Bahian beat Imagine Elton John, George Michael, Shirley Bassey and Kate Bush sharing a stage and you get some idea of the excitement frothing around the Albert Hall this week when the Four Great Bahians, Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa and Maria Bethania, collectively gave the Bahian Festival in London a celestial climax. The singers all come from that Brazilian state that looks towards Africa for its history and culture, and although, to add some spectacle, the Mangueira samba school from Rio were also on the bill, it was very much a celebration of Bahian music. When political exiles in London in 1969, Gil and Caetano became Rolling Stones groupies, and once back in Brazil they added electric guitars to the traditional samba rhythms to create Tropicalism, the most distinctive Brazilian sound for the next 20 years. This reunion concert gave to a new generation of voluntary exiles music that was indirectly inspired by their temporary home. They loved it. You expect Brazilians to stand up and samba at the tap of a drum; you do not expect them to know every word of every song. It is distinctive music. Unlike Spanish Latin American music, with its sensual brass obligatos, the music of Brazil is drum driven - very African. To outsiders the singers often seem to sing across the musicians: it has no easy appeal - it is a national ritual. The atmosphere was naturally relaxed, the singers appearing solo, to duet, to quartet, as the mood took them. Gil was exuberant; Caetano wistful; Costa and Bethania full-throated. Romantic ballads and plangent songs of home nestled alongside rousing chants, in which the audience hurled back as echoes the Amazonian caws of the singers. There was no interval and the bars stayed open. There was also the overpowering sight of Mangueira, the Manchester United of the samba bands, sashaying its way on to the Albert Hall stage. First the percussionists, dressed like camp centurions; then the poseurs, arrayed like gigantic birds of paradise, parading plumage tails 15ft wide; finally the dancers, quivering every inch of their bodies. Once the balloons had fallen; the audience had danced itself dry; the flags had been fluttered; the fever had died down, the Four Bahians returned for their own encore. It was both a personal event yet also a national occasion, a vibrant nostalgia for home. It was no place for a foreigner to be. While the Rio carnival might now be a tourist attraction Bahia hugs its local identity and for one night the heart beat of Salvador, its capital, was in SW7.</p>

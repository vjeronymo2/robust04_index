			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The brother leader of the revolution received  leaders of the Palestinian alliance forces: the Popular Front  for the Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic Front for the  Liberation of Palestine, the Islamic Jihad Movement, Fatah  Movement-Intifadah, the Palestinian Liberation Front, the  Palestinian Front for the Popular Struggle, the Palestinian  Communist and Revolutionary Party, the Vanguards of the  Palestinian Liberation Party, the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and the Islamic  Resistance Movement -- Hamas.    The Palestinian alliance forces have issued a statement in  which they stressed that their meeting with the brother leader  of the revolution falls within an awareness of the historic  responsibility shouldered by the pan-Arab forces that are  resisting the plans of submission and Zionist dominion. Within  this framework, developments on the Arab and international  arenas were discussed, in particular developments related to  occupied Palestine in the aftermath of the massacres that are  being committed by the Zionist enemy against the Palestinian  people, the latest of which is the sacred Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre.    The statement reiterated the rejection of the Palestinian  people and its revolutionary and pan-Arab forces of the unjust  and unfair measures that are imposed against the Great  Jamahiriyah by the so-called UN Security Council. The statement  underlined that these measures are a result of the principled  and firm stance of the Great Jamahiriyah and its commitment to  issues of the Arab nation, foremost of which is its fundamental  issue, Palestine, and its rejection of the U.S.-Western-Zionist  domination plan.    These measures not only target the Arab Libyan people, but  they also target the whole Arab nation. The sons of the Arab  nations and its dynamic forces are called upon to work towards  putting an end to the embargo, which they should not honor.    The statement pointed out that the leader's view of these  developments truly expressed the (?Arab nation's) goals and  aspirations and its adherence to its national and historical  rights to protect its interests, wealth, and sovereignty.    The statement of the Palestinian alliance forces said that  Jerusalem was a holy land for the divine religions and the  capital of struggling Palestine. The masses of our people will  never accept anything other than that and will resist the  Zionist plan targeting its Arab nature, obliterating its  history, and Judaising it.    Accusing our Palestinian people and our Arab and Islamic  nation of terrorism was only a conspiracy against our right to  freedom and life in order to force us to neglect our just  humanitarian demands.    We do not practice terrorism, and we do not target unarmed  innocents, as they do, but we seek freedom, which is guaranteed  by all laws and divine codes and confirmed by human rights  conventions.    We are for the just peace that guarantees the legitimate  rights for our struggling Palestinian people and our fighting  Arab and Islamic nation.    We reject and resist, and we call and mobilize the masses of  the Arab and Islamic nation to resist and overthrow, the  imposition of hegemony and domination in the name of peace.    The submission projects put forward through the Madrid  process and Washington, the bilateral and multilateral talks,  and the Oslo talks are considered an abandonment of our people  and nation's rights that will not achieve peace.

			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-SANDINISTA MARCH HELD BY BROAD COALITION  </P> <P> After six months of government-imposed quiescence, Nicaragua's civic opposition  returned to the streets Sunday with a spirited but peaceful march by 4,500  people representing the broadest coalition of anti-Sandinista forces ever  gathered.  </P> <P> The turnout was less than half of what opposition leaders had hoped for. But  they said that the march, which drew Communist factory workers, right-wing  businessmen and activists of 13 political parties, was the first step toward  building a united opposition bloc for next year's general elections.  </P> <P> Behind a multicolored row of party flags, the marchers filed 17 blocks through  the hot narrow streets of two working-class neighborhoods. Banners and shouted  slogans announced long-held grievances against the revolutionary government:  militarism, political prisoners, hyper-inflation, wage restrictions and  poverty.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Symbolic Coffin Burned  </P> <P> As the march ended just outside the city's cemetery, several youths burned a  black box symbolizing a Sandinista coffin, then spit on it.  </P> <P> For more than a year, opposition parties have pressed a common agenda of  constitutional reforms that would ease the Sandinistas' grip on political  power. But Sunday was the first time they had joined together, not only among  themselves but also with the anti-Sandinista business chamber and all four  dissident union federations, to measure their combined forces.  </P> <P> "Today is a historic day for Nicaragua," Miriam Arguello, president of a  Conservative Party faction, told the marchers from the back of a pickup truck.  "This is a starting point for the unity that has lain dormant so long because  many of us were afraid."  </P> <P> Arguello was among 38 Nicaraguans jailed after a protest rally July 10 in  Nandaime, a town south of Managua, turned violent. A sharp crackdown on that  rally, after the collapse of peace talks with U.S.-backed Contras, ended 10  months of relative freedom for anti-Sandinista groups.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Restrictions Eased  </P> <P> Hoping for new peace talks after President-elect Bush takes office, the  Sandinistas have eased political restrictions in recent weeks. They freed the  last of the Nandaime prisoners in December and gave opposition leaders the  required permit to march Sunday. The police kept their distance and did not  wear riot gear.  </P> <P> However, the government did move to keep people away from the march. As soon as  the march time was set, the Sports Ministry arranged a baseball game in Managua  between national all-star teams for the same hour. Thousands of tickets were  given away and the game was televised live.  </P> <P> Both pro-government newspapers reported in recent days that the U.S. Embassy  had given $25,000 to six conservative opposition leaders to pay their followers  in the march. The embassy and the politicians denied the story, and leftist  participants in the march dismissed it as an attempt by the government to sow  dissension among its foes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> March Called 'Total Failure'  </P> <P> The official Voice of Nicaragua radio called the march "a total failure," and  opposition leaders admitted disappointment with the turnout. They said  Sandinista authorities denied permits that would have allowed private bus  owners to transport marchers here from several provincial cities.  </P> <P> The occasion of the march was the 11th anniversary last Tuesday of the slaying  of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, a newspaper publisher and prominent foe of the  Somoza family dictatorship. His assassination helped push Nicaragua toward  revolution, and President Anastasio Somoza was toppled 18 months later.  </P> <P> A march on the 10th anniversary of Chamorro's death -- held in an atmosphere of  somewhat greater political freedom -- drew about 10,000 people. It was  sponsored by the Nicaraguan Democratic Coordinator, a conservative coalition  representing about half the forces assembled Sunday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chamorro's Widow Active  </P> <P> One leader who worked to broaden the demonstration was Violeta Barrios,  Chamorro's widow and successor as publisher of La Prensa. After serving in the  first post-Somoza junta, she turned against the Sandinistas.  </P> <P> "Pedro always believed that opposition unity was indispensable for getting rid  of the Somoza tyranny," she told the crowd Sunday. "We are in the same  situation today."  </P> <P> Father Bismarck Carballo struck the same theme in his homily at a memorial Mass  before the start of the march, as did several speakers along the route.  </P> <P> "This is the moment to ask the Virgin Mary and Jesus to help us work together,"  he said. "In unity there is strength."  </P> <P> Eli Altamirano, the Communist Party's leader, called for "a government of  national salvation" made up of opposition groups.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Common Cause' Cited  </P> <P> "Many people think this is ridiculous because of the contradictions among us,"  he said. "They forget the common cause of those who are tired of military  dictatorship, war, ruin and misery."  </P> <P> In recent months, visiting U.S. congressmen and European political leaders have  urged anti-Sandinista groups to work together. Opposition leaders said they met  for several weeks before overcoming differences about who would march where and  who would deliver the six main speeches.  </P> <P> "We had some agitated clashes over ambitions and egos," said Mauricio Diaz,  head of the Popular Social Christian Party. "Some of us have not spoken to each  other in years. We are starting to mature as an opposition, but it will still  be a while before we can turn into an electoral front."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Need for Single Slate  </P> <P> While agreeing that the task will be difficult, several other politicians said  they are convinced of the need to field a single opposition slate in the  November, 1990, election, when it is presumed that President Daniel Ortega will  seek reelection as the Sandinista candidate.  </P> <P> Ortega won election in 1984 over six opposition candidates. The Democratic  Coordinator, the most powerful opposition group, boycotted that election,  charging that the rules favored the Sandinistas.  </P> <P> "The opposition has to look for ways to keep mobilizing people against the  Sandinistas, then we can worry about who will be the candidate," said Erick  Ramirez, a Social Christian Party leader with presidential ambitions.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Victor Torres, Humberto Rios, and Juan de Dios </F> Garcia]    [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, 28 Feb --  Subcommander Marcos has stated the delays at the negotiating  table are due to the lack of response from the federal  government to eight points of national interest related to  democracy, amendments to the electoral law and the Criminal  Code, aspects of the ownership and use of land, and respect for  and a new relationship with Indian communities.    The EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] representative  commented that so far there are "just pieces of paper" at the  negotiating table. For that reason, he expressed his certainty  that this phase will conclude without specific agreements.  Those pieces of paper, he affirmed, do not yet give security or  guarantees to Indians that they will live well or feed  themselves.    He said those points will have a bearing on the future of  Mexico and noted the EZLN is not prepared to lay down its  weapons, since it is certain that the pacification process in  Chiapas is not simple. The signing of a peace accord, he added,  will not be fast or easy to attain, and many days will pass in  order to obtain satisfactory responses to the proposals by the  EZLN General Command.    During a private meeting with foreign correspondents, the  subcommander felt all the demands on the list submitted to  Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation  in Chiapas, can be resolved by the federal authorities with a  total commitment and interest in improving the conditions in  which Mexico's Indians live.</p>

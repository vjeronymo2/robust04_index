			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAUL GONZALES FINALLY GETS CHANCE TO WIN A PRO TITLE  </P> <P> The last time Paul Gonzales was supposed to fight for an important  championship, he won without lifting a glove.  </P> <P> His opponent, Salvatore Todisco of Italy, didn't show up for the gold medal  bout in the light flyweight division of the 1984 Olympic Games because his  broken thumb was in a cast.  </P> <P> It won't be so easy for Gonzales this afternoon.  </P> <P> The slick boxer, voted the most outstanding fighter in the Olympics in his  hometown, finally gets a chance to win a world professional title when he  challenges International Boxing Federation bantamweight champion Orlando  Canizales. (2 p.m., Channel 4, delayed).  </P> <P> Gonzales (14-2) won a unanimous decision over Canizales three years ago in Lake  Tahoe, but is the underdog in the rematch.  </P> <P> One reason is that he hasn't fought since Nov. 13.  </P> <P> In fact, injuries and managerial troubles have limited him to only 16 fights  since the glory that was Los Angeles six summers ago.  </P> <P> His business relationship with former policeman Al Stankie soured after more  than one TV movie had been in the works about the Primera Flats gangster and  the cop who took him out of the streets and into the Hollenbeck gym.  </P> <P> "We no longer work together, but I love Al," Gonzales said. "I always will.  We're still like father and son. He's got his crazy ways, but we still talk all  the time."  </P> <P> The 26-year-old challenger, who will be paid $30,000 today, now manages  himself.  </P> <P> He has worked out the past two months at the Dame Boxing Club in Los Angeles,  run by ex-State Athletic Commission official Marty Denkin.  </P> <P> "I like what I've seen of him in the gym," Denkin said. "He's stronger now and  he doesn't get hit so easily with the right hand."  </P> <P> Canizales was able to knock Gonzales down in the first fight, a briskly paced  12-rounder waged outdoors on a hot afternoon at the flyweight limit of 112  pounds.  </P> <P> Canizales (24-1-1) hasn't lost since.  </P> <P> "This will be a tough fight, no doubt," Gonzales said after a light workout  Friday.  </P> <P> "But this time I'll fight my fight. I'll out-think him, I'll out-box him. There  won't be any need for a slugfest."  </P></p>

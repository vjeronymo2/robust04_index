			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading ANOTHER record session yesterday rounded off the life of the September contract on the FT-SE Index, which expires after 10 o'clock this morning, writes Terry Byland. Volume was driven by activity from marketmakers trying to keep ahead of a wildly expanding equity market and by traders seeking to roll over positions into the Dec-ember contract, which takes over market leadership today. Overseas purchasers bought early into the London market's stock index futures on the back of the effective 10 per cent devaluation of sterling. The September contract moved above 2,510 twice during the session before closing around 2,483, in line with the underlying index, as required for the contract expiry. The December contract closed at a premium of 56 over September, with fair value, the calculation allowing for dividend flows and financing costs, estimated at around 42; brokers regarded the level as acceptable. In view of the excitement in the equity market yesterday, this morning's expiry in stock index futures could prove lively, according to dealers. Traded options were equally lively, recording turnover of 69,249 lots, and volume in the FT-SE option reached 27,204.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tomas A. Granados: "OAS: Looking for New </F> Clothes"]    [Text] Just like an old lady getting ready for a love  affair, the OAS is looking for modern clothes and attractive  makeup as if to try and erase the unpleasant memories of its  past coexistence with military dictatorships and U.S. invasions.    The only thing new up to now is its secretary general,  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, who was elected to this post  on 27 March following an unusually difficult race against Costa  Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus.    Gaviria, who will have to wait until the end of his term in  office on 7 August before assuming the leadership of the OAS,  trusts that the hemispheric organization will begin a new  chapter of relations "respecting the path chosen by each  country...without the disagreements and controversies of the  past."    The truth is that these are new words, perhaps a preview of  what could be a readjustment of this regional mechanism to the  new post-Cold War realities, something the United States should  also seek with all its Latin American and Caribbean neighbors.    But Gaviria's statements seem to head down a path different  from that of the theories of U.S. officials linked to this  region, such as Michael Skol, regarding a "hemispheric  convergence."    According to the assistant secretary of state for  inter-American affairs, this convergence is understood as a way  to identify with the fundamentals of Washington's foreign  policy, in other words: the protection of national security,  fomenting economic growth, and encouraging democracy in the  world.    In statements during a 23 February news conference in Miami,  Skol did not say whether the national interests of neighbor  countries would be included in this convergence. But he did say  that Washington is planning to establish "a relationship in  which talks and reciprocity, rather than unilateralism, would be  foremost."    After the East-West confrontation was buried under the ruins  of the Berlin Wall and since the days of Washington's crusade  against the advance of communism in that part of the world has  changed, this could be the time for the OAS to try and win the  credibility it never enjoyed.    Toward this end, a majority of countries of the region  supported Gaviria, some of them dragged (Foreign Minister  Niehaus said pressured) by U.S. influence. Michael McCurry, a  spokesman for the U.S. State Department in Washington, explained  that the Colombian president "has proven to be committed to  democracy, to have solid economic policies, to be a strong  leader, and to have the capacity to lead."    Now, the former Fresno, California lyceum student faces the  not so easy task of recovering the trust the OAS lost in the  eyes of several generations of Latin American politicians  because of its indolence before the outbreaks of military  dictatorships and complicity with the U.S. invasions in the  Dominican Republic (1965), Grenada (1983), and Panama (1989), as  well as its incapacity during the Falklands conflict (1982)  between Argentina and Great Britain.    He will also have to do something to solve the OAS' lack of  prestige, as expressed when in 1983 countries like Mexico,  Panama, Venezuela, and Colombia chose to disregard it and form  the Contadora Group as the forum for the discussion and solution  of the Central American conflict.    This move, considered to be the first genuinely Latin  American initiative without U.S. participation, was followed by  the creation of other groups in which the White House is not  represented, such as the Rio Group, and since 1991, the holding  of the annual Ibero-American Summit conference.    According to the opinion of various Latin American foreign  ministries, Gaviria will have the task of developing the image  of "a new OAS," immersed in consolidating democracy on the  continent, dedicated to promoting American integration, and  willing to become the center for dialogue that will draft the  basic guidelines for continental policy.    Even though methods for the crusade against communism in  this  part of the world are a thing of the past, today, the  expectations are in confirming if "this new OAS" will be able to  adjust itself to the needs of development and the struggle  against poverty in the region being sidetracked by controversial  theories of "limited sovereignty, humanitarian intervention,"  and "preventive democracy."    These theories were put into practice for the first time in  Somalia where thousands of U.S. soldiers played a starring role  under the protection of the United Nations. But after the  setbacks suffered by those troops in early October 1993,  Washington understood that regional groups like the OAS must  play a more active role in this type of operations, whether  these operations are intended to maintain peace or to supervise  the reestablishment of constitutional order.    Military and diplomatic experts broached this subject during  a meeting in mid-March in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The OAS  called the meeting to discuss new measures related to  hemispheric security and its results could lead to the creation  of a new regional military mechanism that will replace the old  structures of the Inter-American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty,  TIAR, and the Inter-American Defense Board, IADB.    Previously, a special meeting in Washington in mid-December  1992 approved an amendment to the OAS Charter, sponsored by  Argentina, opposed by Mexico, and Jamaica and El Salvador  abstained, to the OAS Charter that allows the "suspension" of  any member state that disregards the democratically-established  norms.    The OAS Charter calls for respect for the principles of  sovereignty and self-determination of the peoples. Gaviria will  now be responsible for proving the practical value of these  precepts or seeing if they are just words.</p>

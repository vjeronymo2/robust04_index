			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (4): Doing business is a costly affair Although Vietnam is making progress towards ironing out the wrinkles in the country's legal system and improving its tangled bureaucracy, the cost of getting established and doing business, already alarmingly high, is rising fast. Basic overheads are among the highest in the world and commercial rents in the capital, Hanoi, and in the bustling southern industrial hub of Ho Chi Minh City have already overtaken those of some of the world's leading cities. Residential rates are not far behind. While prime office rents are officially capped at about Dollars 18 per square metre per month in Ho Chi Minh City foreign businesses hunting for what little international-standard space is available are often asked for as much as Dollars 50-Dollars 60. Making phone calls abroad is almost prohibitively expensive and resident business people advise newcomers to get their headquarters to call them back to save money. A severe shortage of trained personnel, even those with the most basic office skills, is nudging local salaries higher. Poaching of qualified staff is rife. A young local graduate with some work experience and good English - firmly established as the lingua franca of business - can command a monthly salary of up to Dollars 400, almost double the figure in 1993. Unaware of how fast costs are rising, many foreign investors fail to make allowances in their feasibility studies and find themselves drastically revising budgets or even pulling out of projects. This partly explains why only about a quarter of the roughly Dollars 10bn in foreign investment pledged so far has actually been invested. 'It's fairly easy to get a joint venture going but it's the implementation that's the problem,' says an Australian lawyer with seven years of experience advising clients on start-ups in Vietnam. 'People should double their estimates of administrative costs, for example.' In spite of a much-trumpeted government campaign against corruption, incidents of graft are on the rise. In property, for example, even once suitable premises have been found for representative offices, investors often find themselves having to pay unofficial 'fees' to secure the site. One leading European bank early this year was told there was a Dollars 200,000 price tag on a prestigious, French-era villa in Ho Chi Minh City and drafted a contract on that basis. Shortly after the US lifted its trade embargo on Vietnam in February, bank executives negotiating the deal were told the price had risen to Dollars 250,000. They assumed the contract would be re-drafted but were shocked to find that the official negotiating the deal would only accept the difference in cash, payable on the spot. Residential space, also in short supply, is best sourced through one of the few official state agencies (which charge hefty fees) or by contacting the numerous private 'agents', who can often be little more than well connected individuals. Many will also demand high fees. For property developers, one headache is how to gauge compensation to be paid to people living on land designated for development. Officially-set rates are usually ignored, by the Vietnamese partner or by residents facing relocation. Project delays can be severe as the two sides in the joint venture wrangle over how much should be paid. 'I think the government is trying to do its best to solve the problems but on a day to day basis you've got people grabbing what they can,' says the director of a US property firm planning to develop a hotel in Hanoi. His joint venture partner has asked him for Dollars 1.5m to build a road nearby as well as a Dollars 250,000 'lobby fee', apparently to be used to speed up licensing procedures. Although the government is acutely aware of the need to streamline the bureaucracy and plans a vigorous campaign of what it calls 'administrative reform' in 1995, the project licensing procedure is still clogged with unnecessary paperwork. The State Committee for Co-operation and Investment is responsible for licensing all forms of foreign investment, usually a joint venture, a 100 per cent foreign-invested enterprise or the looser Business Co-operation Contract. Although it was planned as a 'one-stop' shop for foreign investors, more than 10 ministries claim jurisdiction on some aspects of foreign investment and much time is spent shepherding paperwork from ministry to ministry. Many businesses save time and money by hiring foreign consultants on the ground to ease applications through the system. But today's business climate is still in stark contrast to when the country first started opening up to foreign investors as part of its policy of doi moi. Vietnam's only telephone links with the outside world in 1986 were nine, scratchy, international lines, most of them connecting Hanoi with Moscow, then the country's main benefactor. Today, 1,500 lines offer clear connections to almost anywhere in the world. Mobile phones are common in Saigon and have recently appeared in Hanoi. Regular domestic flights, most using European Airbus aircraft, connect the capital with Ho Chi Minh City, the coastal town of Danang and other destinations. The legal environment, although still murky, has improved slowly but steadily. This year has seen a surge in the amount of regulations issued, most of them aimed at clarifying aspects of the Foreign Investment Law. Among them, a radical ruling dating back to July allows foreigners to buy property in their own right. Property analysts say the move has put Vietnam ahead of jurisdictions in Thailand and even Singapore, where foreigners are limited to ownership of certain floors of a building. Another decree, passed in March, sets out guidelines for settling economic disputes involving foreign investors at a special economic court. However, foreign lawyers based in Vietnam say most investors will prefer to seek remedies offshore until the precise mechanics of the court are clearer. Foreign investors complain that inadequate consultation at the drafting stage means laws are often incomplete, requiring clarification later through the issuance of guidelines. Recent currency regulations outlawing the use of the dollar in domestic transactions, for example, leave open the question of whether sectors that rely on foreign currency revenues to repay debts offshore (such as hotels) have to receive income in the local, non-convertible currency.</p>

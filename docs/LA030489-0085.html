			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SATTERFIELD WAS A VICTIM OF CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT  </P> <P> Bob Satterfield, a member of the Notre Dame national championship football team  who collapsed and died suddenly at a nightclub in January, was a victim of a  congenital heart defect, a medical examiner announced Friday.  </P> <P> Satterfield, 22, a former Notre Dame High School standout from Encino, "died as  a result of subtle congenital heart defects which were previously unknown and  resulted in cardiac arrest followed by seizure activity," said a report from  Dr. Fred M. Busse, the medical examiner of Berrien County, Mich.  </P> <P> The heart defect amounted to an "abnormality in the system which regulates the  heartbeat," Busse said, quoting the opinion of Dr. S. Bharati, director of the  Congenital Heart and Conduction System Center in Chicago.  </P> <P> Satterfield died on the morning of Jan. 19 after he collapsed at a nightclub in  Niles, Mich., a few miles north of South Bend. He had traveled with his  teammates to Washington for a White House ceremony commemorating the team's  national championship, and they had returned to South Bend the previous  evening.  </P> <P> Satterfield, an offensive and defensive back, went to the nightclub with two  teammates, tailback Mark Green and defensive end Darrell Gordon. He danced  several times and sat down to talk. Upon leaving, he stood up, suddenly put his  arm out and collapsed, first to the table and then to the floor, and went into  a seizure, Busse said.  </P> <P> Life-support measures were not started for at least six minutes after emergency  assistance was summoned, and two neuropathologists who also examined autopsy  materials believe Satterfield was brain dead by that time, Busse said.  </P> <P> "Mr. Satterfield had been in excellent health," Busse said. "As a member of the  Notre Dame football team, he was required to maintain a high level of physical  condition. His medical history did not reveal any obvious cause for his sudden  death."  </P></p>

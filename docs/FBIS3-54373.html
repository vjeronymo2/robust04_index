			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] London, QUDS PRESS -- A Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] spokesman has denied Hamas' connection in any way with  attacks launched by fundamentalists against government targets  in Egypt.    A responsible Hamas source said that talk about Hamas' link  with a captured fugitive in an ambush set up by the Egyptian  police in Cairo's suburbs last week is totally fabricated and  baseless. This sort of talk is devoid of logic and credibility  and falls within framework of the deliberate campaign of  distortion against Hamas' positions in the Arab world.    The source reiterated that Hamas' armed activity is limited  to resisting Israel. He pointed out that Hamas does not carry  out this sort of activity against any Arab or foreign party.  Such activity is not a Hamas strategy.</p>

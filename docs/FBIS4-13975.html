			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 26, IRNA -- A morning daily here  Tuesday [26 April] commented on the establishment of peace in  the Middle East and said that real and lasting peace is only  possible through full and sincere cooperation of the regional  countries free of any foreign influence and interference.  Referring to the visit to Saudi Arabia of the U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher, `TEHRAN TIMES' said the visit has two  objectives.    The first, said the paper, is to speed up the process of  signing the Gaza-Jericho peace accord despite popular  Palestinian opposition, and the second is to justify the illegal  presence of the U.S. in the Persian Gulf and push the sale of  U.S.-made arms to members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation  Council (PGCC).    U.S. policy in the Middle East is to legitimize the presence  of the Zionist entity in the region at any cost, said the paper  noting that America must realize that even the Palestinian  Liberation Organization (PLO) has reached the conclusion that no  peace will be achieved unless `all Palestinians' unanimously  accept the terms.</p>

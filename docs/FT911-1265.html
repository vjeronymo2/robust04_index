			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): AEU chief questions Labour's pay policy CONTROVERSY over Labour's pay policy re-emerged yesterday when a leader of the AEU engineering union cast doubt on whether Labour could 'square the circle' of a national minimum wage and higher pay for skilled workers. Mr Gavin Laird, AEU general secretary, said a Labour government might not be able to introduce a national minimum wage unless there was sustained economic growth because it would have to compress pay differentials to do so. Mr Laird's remarks came after the AEU supported a TUC policy endorsing free collective bargaining as well as a national minimum wage. A TUC policy document was amended after controversy over pay differentials. The document now says: 'Any exceptional increase given solely for the purpose of implementing the provisions of statutory minimum pay legislation will not be regarded by trade unions as a vehicle for general increases.' Mr Laird said there would have to be increased generation of wealth through growth in manufacturing to make the policy work. 'If that is not done, you can forget about the national minimum wage,' he said. Mr Laird wrote in the AEU Journal before the TUC document was revised that for employees in engineering and manufacturing 'pay norms and incomes policies can be of no relevance'. He argued that to fund a national minimum wage the government would have to deliver a substantial improvement in the quality and quantity of training and give manufacturing industry the same incentives to investment as in Japan and Germany. Although TUC leaders agreed unanimously on the revised policy which will be debated at the Trades Union Congress in September, there has since been continued evidence of the internal strain caused by the question.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Oleksandr Moroz, Ukrainian Supreme Soviet </F> speaker, by Grigoriy Spektor; place and date not given: Under  the "Hello!" rubric: "Speaker Proposes Strong Government for  Ukraine"]    [Text] Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of Ukraine's Supreme  Soviet, has decided to meet the press in his new capacity. The  questions to the speaker were put by OBSHCHAYA GAZETA  correspondent Aleksandr Spektor.    [Moroz] The decision to put myself of all people at the head  of parliament is the optimal variant. In the difficult time  Ukraine is going through, the reins of government should be in  strong hands. In guiding parliament I am not supposed either to  tug at the reins or to let them go slack. Today all normal  politicians are Marxists in the best sense of the word who,  having dialectically mastered the whole mass of knowledge, are  creatively using it. If one tries to pressure me they'll know  where to quit.    [Spektor] Do you think selling land may mark the beginning  of Ukraine's pulling out of the crisis?    [Moroz] Given the Republic's economic situation, to turn  land into a commodity, is a crime before the people and the  future generations. An unemployed person in the West gets  benefits 50 times that of a Ukrainian professor's salary.  Granted dual citizenship, that person could buy with his  benefit payment vast tracts of land. Selling land as a  condition for getting foreign investments is unacceptable.  Investors of this sort may pursue different ends. Investments  for partnership may be secured in a dignified way, through a  long-term lease for example. But the West's attitude to Ukraine  is too short-sighted. Including to Ukraine's desire to become a  non-nuclear power. No, we are not in a position to maintain  nuclear weapons today. They should not become necessary for us  in the future. But we cannot get rid of them overnight.  Compensation to Ukraine for giving up nuclear weapons is in  fact the West's payment for its own peace and security. But the  West has decided to profit by someone else's misfortune; it has  offered Ukraine only humiliating handouts. This, despite the  fact that the desire of a nuclear power to go over to  non-nuclear status has no precedent in world history so far.    [Spektor] Do you agree with the widely held opinion that a  number of deputies are engaged in commerce?    [Moroz] Yes, this did and will happen. It is the  possibility to engage in honest commerce that progressive  politicians have been pressing for. But to benefit the state,  the people, not just themselves alone. In order that commercial  activities of deputies stay within the law, the commission on  combating organized crime should be real, effective, and  subordinated to the Supreme Soviet chairman. This parliament is  in for difficult and unpopular measures, with part of Ukraine's  population, to reinvigorate the ailing economy -- primarily the  sphere of regulating foreign currency turnover, and control over  credit policy. There should be an efficient government in order  to control economic life normally. The present government is no  longer competent, it is incapable of creative work. Therefore a  new government should be formed immediately without waiting for  possible presidential elections: Anarchy is ruinous for Ukraine;  if the paralysis of power drags on, the process of  disintegration may become irreversible. [interview ends]    For the time being Oleksandr Moroz is among those who are  running for president. It is probable, however, that closer to  the election date he will drop out. Most probably in favor of  Leonid Kuchma.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Butte AGM ends with demand for poll on resolutions A long and acrimonious annual meeting of Butte Mining in London yesterday ended with some shareholders demanding a poll on all the resolutions put before them. The outcome will not be known for at least three weeks. Butte's main activity is prosecuting US lawsuits - it is seeking damages of up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) from former managers and promoters - and several of the shareholder-defendants were at yesterday's meeting. They included Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur who was a promoter and former director of Butte, and his daughter, Fiona. But, unlike many of his former colleagues, he remained silent during the meeting and refused to comment afterwards. However, many of the questions posed at the meeting came from Newsham Investments, which is understood to be an offshore vehicle for the Smith family interests. Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, chairman, said the 'unusual' Butte articles of association gave 30 days for a poll result to be announced, so he intended to write to all shareholders urging them to vote and return proxies within 21 days. It emerged after the two-hour meeting that there are questions about a key 7.9 per cent block of Butte shares, once owned by Mr Smith but taken by Societe Banquaire de Paris, apparently when he fell behind with loan payments. Butte discovered at the weekend that these shares had changed ownership, but the company had not been notified - suggesting a possible breach of UK company law. Butte has begun formal moves to establish the beneficial ownership of the shares. Another big block of Butte shares, 7 per cent, is controlled by Edinburgh-based Waverley Mining Finance. Mr Willie McLucas, Waverley's managing director, said after the meeting he was undecided about how to cast his votes. His remarks during the meeting made it clear he did not see eye to eye with the present board - particularly over the question of the value of Butte's former assets in Australia. On the other hand, Mr McLucas said he did not particularly want to line up with the defendant-shareholder group. Mr Lloyd-Jacob was closely questioned about the holders of unique loan notes issued to raise about Pounds 1.3m in November which give the holders a share in any litigation proceeds and a charge over all the company's assets. He said some of the holders had asked not to be identified, which caused Mr Keith Anderson, representing one of the nominee shareholders, to complain: 'It is the loan note holders, a body not identified to ordinary shareholders, that control this company.' Mr Lloyd-Jacob said an out-of-court settlement of the US litigation was 'improbable.' He added: 'Any want of prosecution is a default on the loan stock. While the company can be bid for and management thrown out, it will not be an easy matter to shut down the law suit.' The chairman was not without his supporters. One commented: 'It is because of this management's efforts that the company is still in existence when some might feel it was designed to disappear, to be just another corporate casualty.'</p>

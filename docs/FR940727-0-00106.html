Procurement Fraud Indicators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> Procurement Fraud Indicators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. During the identification of the government and services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Need determinations for items currently scheduled for disposal or reprocurement, or which have predetermined reorder levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Excessive purchase of ``expendables'' such as drugs or auto parts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Inadequate or vague need assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Frequent changes in the need assessment or determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Mandatory stock levels and inventory requirements appear excessive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Items appear to be unnecessarily declared excess or sold as surplus, while same items are being reprocured. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. It appears that an item or service is being purchased more as a result of aggressive marketing efforts rather than in response to a valid requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h. Need determination appears to be unnecessarily tailored in ways that can only be met by certain contractors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Items and services are continually obtained from the same source due to an unwarranted lack of effort to develop second sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. During the development of the statements of work and specifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Statements of work and specifications appear to be intentionally written to fit the products or capabilities of a single contractor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Statements of work, specifications, or sole source justifications developed by or in consultation with a preferred contractor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Information concerning requirements and pending contracts is released only to preferred contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Allowing companies and industry personnel who participated in the preparation of bid packages to perform on subsequent contracts in either a prime or subcontractor capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Release of information by firms or personnel participating in design or engineering to companies competing for prime contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Prequalification standards or specifications appear designed to exclude otherwise qualified contractors or their productions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Requirements appear split up to allow for rotating bids, giving each contractor his or her ``fair share.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h. Requirements appear split up to meet small purchase requirements (that is, $25,000) or to avoid higher levels of approval that would be otherwise required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Bid specifications or statement of work appear inconsistent with the items described in the general requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> j. Specifications appear so vague that reasonable comparisons of estimate would be difficult.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> k. Specifications appear inconsistent with previous procurements of similar items of services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

Statements justifying sole source or negotiated procurements appear inadequate or incredible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Solicitation documents appear to contain unnecessary requirements which tend to restrict competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Contractors or their representatives appear to have received advanced information related to the proposed procurement on a preferential basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. During the solicitation phase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Procurement appears to be processed so as to exclude or impede certain contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. The time for submission of bids appears to be unnecessarily limited so that only those with advance information have adequate time to prepare bids or proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. It appears that information concerning the procurement has been revealed only to certain contractors, without being revealed to all prospective competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Bidders conferences are conducted in a way that apparently invites bid rigging, price fixing, or other improper collusion between contractors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.

Indications that any contractor has received special assistance in preparation of his or her bid or proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> l. It appears that a contract is given an expressed or implied reference to a specific subcontractor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> m. Failure to amend solicitation to reflect necessary changes or modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Books: Driven by destiny STRANGE PILGRIMS: Twelve Stories by Gabriel Garca Marquez, translated by Edith Grossman Jonathan Cape Pounds 14.99, 188 pages TOLSTOY'S two great novels are so central to our culture that they have overshadowed his shorter fiction such as The Kreutzer Sonata, A Billiard-Marker's Notes, a tale about gambling fever, Strider: The Story of a Horse and dozens more fine stories. The shorter fiction of the Colombian-born, Nobel Prize-winning writer Gabriel Garca Marquez should not be allowed to suffer from a similar eclipse. He too works just as powerfully on a small canvas as a large one. Marquez's epic-narrative of his own people, One Hundred Years of Solitude, was his attempt at writing a War and Peace; his most recent novel to be published in Britain, The General in His Labyrinth, about a revolutionary soldier whose finest hour has passed, showed Marquez comfortably accommodating himself to the confines of an average-length novel; in this latest book, Strange Pilgrims: Twelve Stories, translated from the Spanish by Edith Grossman, Marquez commands our rapt attention through stories some of which are only a few pages. They were written over the past 18 years, the fruits of the writer's experiences while residing abroad. Some have appeared in an earlier form as articles, film or television scripts. All 12 were re-written within the last few years and the collection was conceived as a unity. We travel from Barcelona to Rome, Paris, Geneva, cities seen in that same pitiless light, exposing both the mean and the miraculous, that illuminated the Colombian jungle and the Amazonian towns and villages of his longer works. The characters are mostly Latin-American exiles. By living abroad they have escaped from oppression but not from of a destiny that is driving them towards their often premature deaths. Sometimes the death-sense comes to them in the form of a dream or apparition; at other times it is couched in a phenomenon of nature like that land wind that attacks the Spanish town of Cadaques in summer. In 'Tramontana' - the story named after it - the young night-club singer from the Antilles recognises in it the portent of his own imminent death: 'It was a Caribbean certainty that could not be understood by a band of Scandinavian rationalists aflame with summer and the hard Catalan wines of those days, which sowed wild ideas in the heart.' In 'Bon Voyage, Mr President' the ex-premier of a Caribbean island living in exile in Switzerland has just as acute a sense of his own mortality but with greater reason. He awaits a cancer operation in a Genevan hospital. The ambulance driver whom he meets on a preliminary visit and who becomes his friend is a fellow-countryman. Theirs proves to be a loaded friendship. The man and his grasping wife are hoping to make a broker's turn on the funeral arrangements. Indeed throughout this macabre but memorable collection we are never far from the graveyard. 'Maria dos Prazeres' is an elderly whore in retirement in Barcelona who identifies with those who daub the names of the anarchist-leaders killed in the Civil War on the anonymous tombstones. She is training her dog to weep over her own grave when the time comes. In 'Trail of Your Blood in the Snow' the wealthy young Spanish bride has a cut on a her wedding-ring finger that will not heal. By the time she and her husband, who picked her up on the beach a week or two earlier, have driven through the night to Paris she has all but bled to death. Equally bloody is the fate of the spinsterly governess in 'Miss Forbes's Summer of Happiness'. She is found one morning by her young charges - with whom she has been so punitive - dead in bed from multiple stab-wounds. In 'I Only Came to Use the Phone' a Mexican-born music-hall artist's car breaks down in the desert while she is on the way to re-join her husband in Barcelona. She thumbs a lift from a coach full of strangely passive women. It stops at a country mansion where they disembark. The women, mental patients, are being admitted as new inmates of a residential home staffed by warder-like nurses. The unfortunate motorist is doomed to spend the remainder of her life in this virtual prison. Tales like these have overtones that grimly resonate in the modern consciousness. We witness the way certain individuals seem singled out for a destiny as cruel and senseless as it is unmerited. If your preference is for stories that radiate a measure of joie de vivre, the kind that, say, Katherine Mansfield once wrote, then you should stay away from Marquez. The nearest we get here to a glimmer of humour from him is in 'Sleeping Beauty' where the Latin-American narrator cannot believe his good fortune. He has been seated in the aircraft next to the beautiful young woman travelling on her own. He had eyed her covetously, silently, in the airport lounge at Charles De Gaulle during a long delay. After take-off she hangs a notice saying 'Do Not Disturb' around her neck and falls instantly asleep. On arrival in New York she wakes up as the plane lands. The only words she speaks to him are 'Goodbye' in Spanish. Destiny up to its tricks once again. In the world of Marquez it never ever does one a favour.</p>

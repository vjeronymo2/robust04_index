"There are no and will be no contradictions" with Boris  Yeltsin. "I have never put my problems on the shoulders of the  president and I am not going to do that", Chernomyrdin told  reporters on Monday after a 30-minute meeting with the  president, adding that the talks focused on the 1994 budget.    Boris Fedorov remains the finance minister for the time  being  and it is the president who is to decide on his fate, according  to the prime minister.    "Fedorov continues to work in his position. I have not  accepted his resignation", Chernomyrdin said adding that it is  the president who is to decide on whether to accept Fedorov's  resignation.

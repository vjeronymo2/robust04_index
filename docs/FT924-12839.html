			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Economics: Retail gloom remains THIS week will bring disturbing reminders of the difficulties plaguing the British economy and should provide some explanations for the government's decision to cut bank base rates by a full percentage point last Friday. Subdued domestic demand will influence Wednesday's retail sales figures for September. Although shop sales began quite strongly, analysts report that discretionary spending fell during the days following Black Wednesday and expect a small decline in sales volumes compared with August. UK money supply figures on Tuesday are expected to show that bank and building society lending was weak last month. Economists expect that Britain's trade figures on Thursday will continue to show visible and current account deficits of more than Pounds 1bn in September. Although sterling's devaluation since September 16 will make exports more competitive, Britain's heavy dependency on imported goods could result in bigger visible trade and current account deficits in the months ahead. Towards the end of the week, the German Bundesbank should produce its M3 money supply statistics for September. These will be inflated by the large-scale currency inflows during last month's crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism. Bundesbank watchers will monitor reactions to the figures from central bank council members to assess whether German interest rate cuts are in the offing. Signs are growing of a sharp slowdown in activity in Germany. Some indication of current inflationary pressures will come in preliminary cost-of-living data from North Rhine Westphalia and Baden Wurttemberg. Some of the week's highlights follow. The median of economists' forecasts from MMS International, a financial information company, are given in brackets. Today: United States, final presidential debate in East Lansing, Michigan.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We are clearly drawing closer  to the early dissolution of the chambers of parliament and the  consequent general election. If anyone still had any doubts,  then those doubts were removed a short time ago -- half an hour  ago -- by a communique from the Quirinale [president's office].  The communique says: In accordance with Article 88 of the  Constitution, tomorrow morning President Scalfaro will receive  Senate Speaker Spadolini at the Quirinale at 1130, and he will  receive [Chamber of Deputies Speaker] Napolitano at 1700 that  afternoon. [passage omitted]    The Quirinale's communique says, I repeat: In accordance  with Article 88. This is the article concerned with the early  dissolution of the chambers of parliament, and it stipulates  that the president should consult with the Senate speaker first  and then with the Chamber of Deputies speaker before proceeding  to dissolve parliament. The chambers should be dissolved by  Sunday [16 January], when [President] Scalfaro will then set  aside his reservations about Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio  Ciampi's resignation.

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RABBI HIER  </P> <P> What a guy, that Marvin Hier! He fights anti-Semitism, finds aging Nazis and  remembers the Holocaust.  </P> <P> Why, he even educates people about the Armenian genocide. But his new tourist  attraction should not be named the Museum of Tolerance. Some years ago his  center gave an award to U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Jeanne  Kirkpatrick for her support of Israel, the same Jeanne Kirkpatrick who has  supported every pseudodemocratic (read: fascist) government in Central America.  If it was not nice to murder Jews in the past, it is also not nice for the U.S.  government to sponsor dictators who murder our Central American neighbors.  Hier's center is no longer deluged by my $10 donations.  </P> <P> Ann Bourman  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Romania seeks to encourage foreign investors THE Romanian government has reaffirmed its commitment to facilitating direct foreign participation in the country's economy. A government statement issued yesterday stressed that foreign investors would receive the same rights as Romanian nationals and that there would be free access to markets throughout the economy. The government aimed for minimum intervention in commercial activities and its role would be 'almost exclusively supportive'. At the same time, the government announced that in particular it would encourage foreign participation in priority sectors, including agriculture, energy, transport and telecommunications to speed up Romania's transition to a market-led economy. Foreign investors participating in priority sectors would be able to negotiate on an individual basis for additional investment incentives, according to the Romanian Development Agency (RDA), a state-funded body responsible for alerting potential investors to opportunities in the country. In particular, foreign participants could negotiate for additional tax relief and customs duty reduction. Foreign participation was a key factor in restructuring he Romanian economy and the government needed to stimulate further interest. So far, the level of foreign interest had been disappointing, the RDA said. In the two years to March 1991, foreign investment in Romania totalled approximately Pounds 188m of which 60 per cent had come from western Europe.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Improving Repair Effectiveness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basic I/M SIP submittals must include a description of the State's technical assistance program and a description of the repair technician  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training resources available to the community. The technical assistance program must provide the repair industry with information and assistance related to vehicle inspection, diagnosis, and repair.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Minnesota I/M program offers assistance to repair technicians through the Consumer Advocate program and the MPCA currently publishes a quarterly newsletter that serves as the main communication link between the repair industry and the MPCA. Appendix 21 contains the repair technician curriculum used by vocational/technical colleges, community colleges or post-secondary programs to train automotive repair technicians.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 51.372 lists each of the elements that must be included in SIP submittals. The Minnesota submittal addresses each of the elements listed in the Section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Implementation Deadlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> States implementing decentralized basic programs must have such programs fully operable by January 1, 1994. The Minnesota I/M program has been fully implemented since 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> IV. USEPA Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The USEPA has identified additional deficiencies in the I/M submittal that the MPCA must adequately address before the USEPA can proceed with final approval. The deficiencies are presented in the following comments. If MPCA adequately addresses the deficiencies during the 30-day comment period, USEPA will proceed with final conditional approval of the I/M SIP submittal. In the event that the State does not adequately address the deficiencies outlined below, the USEPA will take final action to disapprove the basic I/M SIP submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Minnesota Rules 7023.1020 has been amended such that visual inspection of fuel inlet restrictors is no longer required. Therefore, the emission reductions obtained in the proposed program must be less than or equal to those obtained by the existing program. Since visual inspection for fuel inlet restrictors was previously required, there must be comparable improvement to the program if this element is to be removed. There is no evidence that the program has been strengthened. The State should either reinstate the fuel inlet restrictor requirement or make other improvements to the testing program so that the reductions are as good or better than under the existing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) USEPA has identified two issues regarding the compliance rate claimed by the State in the submittal. First, the submittal provides conflicting estimates of the number of unregistered vehicles in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. The contractor estimates that 22,000 vehicles in the area are registered without undergoing testing, while MPCA estimates that only 12,000 vehicles are registered without undergoing testing. The conflicting estimates undermine the reliability of the 97% compliance rate arrived at by the State. Secondly, the State uses a 96% compliance rate in the Mobile 5a modeling inputs, yet claims a 97% compliance rate in the submittal. USEPA can accept the 96% compliance rate without any further information or action on the State's part. If the State chooses to continue to claim the 97% compliance rate, it must supply USEPA with an estimate of the number of unregistered vehicles and a description of mechanisms the state will employ to identify and encourage registration of unregistered vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The USEPA is concerned that the $35.00 citation imposed on vehicle owners who fail to undergo testing and properly register their vehicles is not sufficiently high to deter non-compliance. The USEPA requests that MPCA provide further information on the maximum fine imposed on vehicle owners that fail to undergo testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The USEPA believes that Minnesota's lack of a defined penalty schedule for cases of serious violations of the State's contractual agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly lessens the stringency of the State's enforcement efforts. In addition, the State has not provided any description of its mechanisms for permanent fee retainage from the contractor. The MPCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must provide USEPA with a schedule of typical retainage for serious violations of the contractual agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The submittal indicates that quality assurance officers do not have direct authority to impose disciplinary action against inspectors employed by the contractor. MPCA quality assurance officers may only recommend disciplinary action or discharge of an employee. MPCA must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commit to requiring the contractor to act upon the State's recommendation for disciplinary action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> V. Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The USEPA is proposing conditional approval of the Minnesota basic I/M SIP revision request for CO. Section 110(k)(4) of the Clean Air Act allows USEPA to conditionally approve a plan based on a commitment from the State to adopt and submit specific enforceable measures within one year from the date of approval. USEPA's conditional approval of Minnesota's basic I/M program is based upon MPCA's commitment to adopt specific enforceable measures as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outlined in the July 5, 1994, letter from Charles Williams, Commissioner MPCA, to Valdas Adamkus, Regional Administrator, USEPA. If Minnesota fails to implement the necessary changes within the one year period following the date of approval, the approval will automatically convert to a disapproval of the SIP. Automatic disapproval of the SIP will trigger the 18-month sanctions period of Section 179 of the CAA. In addition, USEPA can elect to exercise its discretionary authority to impose sanctions prior to the end of the 18-month period. Finally, disapproval will trigger a 24 month Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) clock under Section 110(c) of the CAA. MPCA must also adequately address the deficiencies outlined in the section entitled ``USEPA Comments'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  during the 30-day comment period. If MPCA adequately addresses the comments, USEPA will proceed with final conditional approval of the I/M SIP submittal. In the event that the State does not adequately address the deficiencies, the USEPA proposes in the alternative to take final action to disapprove the basic I/M SIP submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on USEPA's proposal to conditionally approve. Public comments received by September 6, 1994 will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators.) A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables, this action remains classified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

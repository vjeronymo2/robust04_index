			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / D-Mark eases on hint of German rate cut MR HELMUT Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, yesterday helped to ease the recent strength of the D-Mark on foreign exchanges by saying that long-term German interest rates could drop to below 6 per cent in the current cycle of falling rates. In an interview published in the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr Schlesinger did not specify when long-term interest rates - currently at around 7.25 per cent - would come down. However, analysts said yesterday that long-term rates in Germany could only fall when the market believed that the prospects for reducing inflation were improving. Mr Schlesinger's remarks were interpreted as unusually optimistic from the Bundesbank president, who also said he was confident that Germany's inflation rate could fall to about 3 per cent next year from an average of about 4 per cent in 1992. Dealers bought dollars in the wake of his remarks, and the US currency rose by two pfennigs against the D-Mark, to close in New York at DM1.5885. The interview also helped to boost sentiment in the UK equity market. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares rose from Monday's all-time closing high to a new peak of 2,845.6 points, before ending at a new closing high of 2,842.0, a gain of 34.3 on the day. The remarks also eased pressure on the French franc, after several days in which it had threatened to approach its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism. The French currency closed at FFr3.411 against the D-Mark in London, up more than half a centime on the day. Although the D-Mark was weaker against most currencies yesterday, sterling was a significant loser. The pound fell 1 pfennig to close at DM2.4425 in London, while in New York it closed at DM2.441. It also lost more than 2 1/2 cents against the stronger dollar in London, closing at Dollars 1.539 from Dollars 1.5645, and easing further in New York trading to Dollars 1.5365. Wall Street stocks firmed after economic data indicated that the US economy had expanded in the third quarter of this year. The Dow Jones Index closed 8.64 points stronger at 3,3231.1.

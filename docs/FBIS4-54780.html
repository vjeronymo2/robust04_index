			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- "Hungary's ship is heading  for a safe port, and a good steersman knows everything not only  about navigation but also of landing," Minister of Foreign  Affairs Geza Jeszenszky said at an international press  conference held by the management of the ministry on Wednesday.  "The anchor is yet to be cast well but the present cabinet has  already marked out a place for it," Jeszenszky continued, using  this metaphor to summarize the results of the Hungarian  Government's foreign policy over the past four years.    The minister said this policy has been successful, also  according to foreign opinions. The government has carried  through most of what it promised in this field at the time of  taking office, he said. The cabinet's accomplishment is based  on ideas and values professed by the bulk of the population.  This has contributed to establishing the external preconditions  of internal political and economic development, Jeszenszky said.</p>

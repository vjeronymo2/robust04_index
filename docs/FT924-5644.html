			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Brussels fines rail grouping THE European Commission fined the International Union of Railways (UIC) Ecu1m (Pounds 810,000) yesterday after railway companies effectively prevented customers from buying cheaper tickets, Reuter reports from Brussels. The companies limited their competition by restricting the number of agencies which could sell railway tickets and setting a single rate of commission linked to uniform conditions of payment, the Commission said in a statement. They also prevented agencies from lowering the fares they offered by passing on some of the commission to customers.</p>

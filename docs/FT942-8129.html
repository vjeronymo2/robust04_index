			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Gardening (The Chelsea Flower Show): Cornwall transported - Patricia Morison on the exhibitor taking the Monument Stand Two worlds of gardening intermingle on this year's Monument Stand at Chelsea. The Monument site in the Great Marquee is the most prestigious an exhibitor can be given. It is large - 4,250 sq ft - so only the big players in horticulture can afford to take it on. This year, the site has been given to Burncoose and Southdown Nurseries from Gwennap, a village far to the west in Cornwall. Burncoose and Southdown was established only 12 years ago. The display, designed by co-owner David Knuckey, is intended to be as Cornish as clotted cream, based around the engine house of a tin mine, with a shingle beach and rushing stream. It will be planted with species to show that although the Cornish gardener sometimes benefits from almost sub-tropical warmth, there can also be cruel frosts and lashing, salty winds. About 10 articulated lorries will be needed to take this Cornish scene to Chelsea, at a cost of Pounds 30,000. Charles Williams, Burncoose's other owner, who is not short of connections after spending his 20s working for merchant bank Lazards, found a City sponsor in Gerrard &amp; National. It is like a parable of modern success. In the 1980s, a young banker senses that the party is winding down and turns to the good life in wellingtons. Believing gardening to be a growth stock, he goes west and joins up with a local nurseryman. He then spots a gap in the market to sell plants by mail order in the UK and abroad. After 12 years, the nursery has a turnover of Pounds 650,000, 80 per cent of it mail order, and customers in 19 countries. The apotheosis comes with a display of Cornish nostalgia on the Monument Stand. There is, however, more behind Burncoose than City nous. The other world on the Monument site is gardening as it was long ago: of gentlemen amateurs with long purses and a passion to know and grow rare plants. Williams has a gardening pedigree which stretches back to great-grandfather JC Williams, Liberal MP for Truro and a great name in British gardening of the Edwardian period. JC sponsored the plant-hunters George Forrest and Ernest Wilson, grew their discoveries and created the famous 'williamsii' hybrid camellia. The family seat was (and still is) Caerhays Castle, built by John Nash, where four generations have planted and re-planted 60 acres of woodland with rare and delicate trees and shrubs. Julian Williams, Charles's father, is a distinguished gardener who has carried on the Caerhays tradition of hybridising. His son teases him for being a 'tree creeper', delighted to discuss Caerhays rarities by the hour. Charles Williams is Cornish to the core. The huge variety of plants he sells, often rare, speaks of a historic pedigree. For cuttings of camellias, magnolias, rhododendrons, pieris or myrtle, he can take branches from specimens planted by his ancestors. There is nothing about this in the Burncoose catalogue. Perhaps it is felt that only an elite of customers will respond to the thought of Rhododendron lindleyana or Michelia doltsopa with that kind of family tree. The catalogue speaks the language of the future - or so Williams hopes. In four languages, it explains the rules for export orders and the single European market. The rules changed in 1993 - nurseries no longer needed to have an export certificate or inspection by a ministry official for every order. Williams and Knuckey were already doing the bulk of their UK business by mail order. Selling plants by post raises complications undreamt of by companies dealing in shirts. Williams 'factors in' the not inconsiderable cost of dealing with customers' calls - the lonely gardener who wants to chat, or the one seeking advice. The problems of mail order to foreign buyers have always deterred British nurserymen, but not Burncoose. Distant customers are determined, knowledgeable, rich - and place large orders. Burncoose's Japanese customers usually spend between Pounds 500 and Pounds 1,000 an order. It takes three days for plants to travel from Gwennap to the Japanese customs hall. Plants destined for Japan, Israel and the US (all good customers) have to be bare-rooted, and the Ministry of Agriculture makes sure every trace of Cornish earth is washed off. Plants for Australia and New Zealand have to be defoliated, which makes the game less worthwhile. But Europe, especially since 1993, looks a far easier and more profitable market - as well as one which the continentals seemed ill-equipped to exploit. Successful though the Dutch, French, and Italian horticulture industry is, Williams discovered that their nurseries grow plants exclusively for retailers. Plant mail order does not exist in the rest of Europe. Within three months, 1994's new, trilingual catalogue had produced 33 orders with a value of Pounds 11,200. The Germans are particularly eager, while a list strong on tender species is attractive to southern Europeans. Burncoose has allied itself with Torsanlorenzo near Rome, a nursery which can supply big plants at big prices; a cordyline with an 8ft girth costs Pounds 600 plus carriage. The Monument Stand might look to visitors like Cornish nostalgia, but a lot hangs on Burncoose's display. Large stands do not necessarily mean large orders. Increasingly, stalwart exhibitors are beginning to ask if a stand at Chelsea justifies the expense when they can sell their stock twice over at the Hampton Court flower show. Burncoose has a different perspective, one which sees the Monument Stand as a world stage. Burncoose and Southdown Nurseries, Gwennap, Redruth, Cornwall TR16 6BJ; tel: 0209-861112.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Architecture: A shiver of excitement - Will the lottery change the face of Britain 'I strongly believe man cannot live by GDP alone . . . I would like to see everyone in this country share in the opportunities that were once available only to the privileged few.' Those were not the words of Labour leader Tony Blair but of prime minister John Major when he opened the English Heritage conference last month. He was not talking about a radical re-arrangement of government spending plans but pinning his hopes on the success of Britain's national lottery, starting next month, which is expected to produce billions in revenue. Part of these proceeds will be spent in five different areas, the five 'good causes' - arts, sport, national heritage, charities and a fund to mark the millennium. John Major is optimistic that enough ideas will be forthcoming for ways to celebrate the millennium, and that 'a wave of creativity will be unleashed'. What is curious about the whole lottery process is that what has been unleashed so far is a wave of bureaucracy and a cascade of commissariats, commissions and committees. There is also much uncertainty. Who will make the awkward choices about criteria and quality that will determine the success or failure of an application for lottery funds? In fact, it all comes down to the five godfathers of the lottery: their views and opinions are going to count, as are their prejudices and preferences. The five godfathers are Lords Gowrie and Rothschild for arts and heritage; David Seiff for charities; Rodney Walker for sport; and Stephen Dorrell, who has the awesome responsibility for the millennium. These five wise men will all receive more petitions and more advice than they can sensibly stand. Their offices have already started to grow and all five have spent a great deal of valuable time at seminars and struggling to establish the best possible criteria to guide applicants for grants. None of them has been particularly effective about letting the public know what is going on, and none of them seems quite clear about the role of the Office of the Lottery, inevitably known as Oflot. Presumably Oflot will keep an eye on Camelot, the commercial operator of the lottery. What is clear is that the majority of the cash is to be spent on capital projects and that each project is expected to raise matching partnership funding. This is a likely area of difficulty. Mainly, capital projects means buildings, and there is a shiver of architectural excitment running through the profession at the prospect of an end to the dole queues of architects and builders. It seems to me that while the heritage world will acquire funds to save more buildings and more collections, the people who are really going to have the most fun are the nine millennium commissioners who are engaged in what their founding minister, Peter Brooke, called a 'unique and golden opportunity to mark the year 2000 in grand style'. Brooke was also rash enough to talk about providing additional landmarks of very high quality. 'Landmark' is a dangerous term that is beyond definition, and the new minister who chairs the commission, Stephen Dorrell, does not seem quite so keen on it. The nine commissioners are a curious bunch. Heather Couper is a lady astronomer; Richard Dalkeith will one day be the 10th Duke of Buccleuch and Queensbery; Robin Dixon is a bobsleigh champion and Northern Ireland businessman; John Hall built a successful but hideous shopping mall called Metroland in Gateshead; Simon Jenkins likes architecture and once edited The Times; Michael Heseltine wanted to be prime minister and now runs the Department of Trade and Industry; Michael Montague is a businessman appointed to represent the political opposition; and Patricia Scotland is a barrister and former member of the Race Relations Committee of the Bar General Council. Their chairman, Stephen Dorrell, is secretary of state for national heritage. You are definitely missing out if you have not received a personal visit from one or all of these commissioners. They were decribed by their own office - rather charmingly - as 'a panel of informed amateurs', and they are all desperate not to be responsible for the sanctioning of any white elephants. They see themselves as the heirs of the Victorians who built the Great Exhibition in 1851 and of the quiet socialists of the 1950s who built the Festival of Britain. They are rather anxious not to be seen to be creating monuments. They are much more likely to fund the planting of a forest or the protection of a species than build a cathedral to mark the 2,000th Christian year. The national mood - I cannot speak for Michael Heseltine, who has a strong streak of megalomania - would seem to be against monuments, and especially against monuments to the egomania of architects. The Eiffel Tower in Paris marked the centenary of the French revolution and Sydney's Opera House was funded by a lottery. There have been hundreds of great expositions since 1851. But the number of successful un-political monuments in the world is very small. By the end of next month you will be able to fill in an application form for a grant for your very own millennium project. But the guidelines are not quite prepared. The last millennium in England was presided over by Ethelred the Unready. With such a short time to go, will there be time for the commissioners to come up with something really inspiring that could change the face of Britain for ever? The whole thing is indeed a lottery.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Sharp rise in US factory orders IN mixed US economic data published yesterday, factory orders in June recorded their biggest gain in 11 months, while personal incomes failed to grow at all in the same month. The 2.3 per cent rise in orders received by manufacturers reverses the 0.9 per cent decline in May. The durable goods sector rose by 2.7 per cent, having fallen 2.1 per cent the previous month. Defence orders, always volatile on a monthly basis, shot up by 19.5 per cent, mostly offsetting the 23.2 per cent decline in the previous month. Excluding defence, overall orders rose by 1.9 per cent. Personal incomes were statistically unchanged in June, after four months of very modest increases. Personal spending rose by 0.5 per cent, following a revised 0.3 per cent advance in May. The net result was a drop in the national savings rate to 4.8 per cent in June from 5.4 per cent the previous month. Both sets of figures confirm the overall picture of the economy provided in the second-quarter gross domestic product returns released on Thursday, which showed growth at only half the rate of the first three months. There is life, though not great vigour yet, in the manufacturing sector, and caution on the part of consumers uncertain about the future.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Will Bohuslavizki  </P> <P> School: Estancia High School  </P> <P> Sport: Football  </P> <P> Position: Receiver  </P> <P> Height: 5-8  </P> <P> Weight: 150  </P> <P> In a single game, Bohuslavizki, a senior, surpassed his reception total of last  season and tied the Estancia single-game reception record. A non-starter last  year -- he had only eight receptions -- Bohuslavizki moved into Estancia's  starting lineup Thursday and caught 11 of Matt Johner's passes for 269 yards  and three touchdowns to help the Eagles rally to defeat Los Amigos, 30-27.  </P> <P> Bohuslavizki had five receptions for 138 yards and two touchdowns -- one of 50  yards, the other of 14 with 34 seconds remaining -- in the final three minutes  of the game. "We kept throwing it," Estancia Coach John Liebengood said. "And  they didn't make any adjustments. They didn't do anything different.  Consequently, he kept catching the ball."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other top performers:  </P> <P> * Brent Austin, an El Modena cross-country runner who ran 16 minutes 17.6  seconds for three miles to finish second in the Bronco Classic Saturday and  lead El Modena to the team title.  </P> <P> * Kennedy's Vince Church, who rushed 25 times for 255 yards, ran for three  touchdowns, caught a pass for another and made an interception in Kennedy's  26-14 victory Friday over Cypress.  </P> <P> * Estancia's Matt Johner, who passed for 342 yards and three touchdowns in the  Eagles' 30-27 victory Thursday over Los Amigos.  </P> <P> * Costa Mesa's Ryan McEvoy, who completed 15 of 25 passes for 294 yards and  four touchdowns in the Mustangs' 41-7 victory Sunday over Twentynine Palms.  </P> <P> * Mission Viejo quarterback Tim Snowden, who completed each of his 12 passes  and amassed 208 yards in the first half of a 42-12 victory Friday over Long  Beach Jordan.  </P></p>

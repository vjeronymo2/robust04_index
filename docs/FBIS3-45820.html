			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Earnestly Studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of </F> Deng Xiaoping" column by Wang Senhao, coal industry  minister: "Reformative Thoughts on Coal Industry Moving Toward  the Market Economy"]    [Text] Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping [Selected Works] is important Marxist  literature. The book collects important works during the period  from September 1982 to February 1992. We had personal  experience and took part in the practice during this period.  Therefore, we find the selected works intimate and easy to  read. Centering closely round the main theme of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics from beginning to end,  the book expounds a series of creative theoretical viewpoints.  It has enriched and developed Mao Zedong Thought with many new  ideas and viewpoints and manifests the features of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is China's  contemporary Marxism and is a brilliant example of upholding the  ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from  facts.    Using historical materialism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has put  forward the viewpoint that the productive forces play a decisive  role in the development of human society and has given creative  Marxist answers to questions such as the nature of socialism,  the fundamental tasks of socialism, and the fundamental standard  for testing various kinds of work.    In studying the Selected Works, we must firmly  grasp the viewpoint that the productive forces play a decisive  role, abide by the productive forces criteria, and gain a  thorough understanding of the essence of the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. Systematically studying  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics is of great practical significance and  farreaching historical significance to further increasing  understanding, adhering to the party's basic line, enhancing  vigor, doing pioneering work, making progress, and carrying out  historical missions.    The practice in reform and opening up during the past 10  years and more has shown that the development rate of our  country has been fast and that the broad masses of the people  are satisfied with the development rate. Viewed from the  development of the coal industry, these 10 years and more have  been a period for the fastest development in the history of the  coal industry. The output of raw coal increased from 618  million tonnes in 1978 to 1.115 billion tonnes in 1992. The  average annual increase was 35.5 million tonnes. After 1986,  the shortages in coal supplies, which had lasted for many years,  eased up. Great changes took place in the coal production  technology and the degree of mechanization was raised by a big  margin. The degree of mechanization in coal mining in key state  mines was raised from 32.5 percent in 1978 to 72.26 percent in  1992. Safety in mines improved annually. The death rate in  producing 1 million tonnes of coal was lowered from 9.44 people  in 1978 to 5.43 people in 1992, a decline of 42.5 percent. The  death rate in producing 1 million tonnes of coal in key state  mines was lowered from 6.94 people in 1978 to 1.06 people in  1992, a decrease of 84.7 percent. Relatively great achievements  were also made in opening up to the outside world and coal  exports were increased by a big margin. All this has clearly  proved that Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the policy of reform and opening up  we have adopted are entirely correct.    The coal industry is an important basic industrial sector of  the national economy and is also the basic industrial sector  which is most seriously affected by the traditional planned  economy structure and which has least vitality among state  enterprises. At a time when the economy is shifting to the new  economic structure, a large amount of problems left behind by  the traditional planned economy structure are woven with new  contradictions and new problems cropping up in the course of  entering the socialist market economy. This has put coal  enterprises in a very difficult position. Affected by the  traditional planned economy structure over a long period, coal  mines have been run only by coal departments and only coal has  been produced in coal mines. In the construction of coal mines,  the scale has been stressed and economic results have been  belittled. This has led to the emergence of a serious imbalance  and many other major problems in the total supply and demand of  coal, production structure, product mix, and the economic  results of coal enterprises. Such problems mainly include:  1) The coal industry lacks the capacity for further  development. By the end of this century, there will be a  big contradiction between the available coal production capacity  and the needs of the rapid growth of the national economy.  2) A big contradiction exists between the production  structure of the coal industry and the demand structure of the  national economy. The proportion of rural coal mines has  become larger and more and more newly-increased coal output is  produced by scattered, small-scale, and nonregular coal mines.  This is not in keeping with the gradual concentration of coal  consumption on power, steel, and chemical enterprises and the  direction of the development toward large scale and stability.  It is impossible to have a long-term and steady supply of coal  to meet the needs of the national economy. 3) There is a  big contradiction between the possible coal industry output and  the railroads' and transportation department's possible capacity  for coal. Since the layout of coal resources and that of  the productive forces of the national economy are developing in  opposite directions and the product mix of coal is unitary, the  coal produced cannot be converted locally, the problem of coal  transportation has remained unresolved for a long time and many  coal enterprises do not have the basic conditions for production  and operation. 4) Key state coal enterprises have an  excessive number of workers, low productivity, and heavy  losses. At present, key state coal mines produce over 480  million tonnes of coal and have a total of 3.6 million workers.  However, Australia produces more than 200 million tonnes of  coal, but has 30,000 workers. The difference is nearly 40-fold.  The gap between our level and the world's advanced level is too  big. Although these existing contradictions and problems in the  coal industry at present are expressed as problems of total  supply and demand, structural readjustment, and economic  results. In essence, they reflect in a concentrated manner the  drawbacks of a complete set of policies for production and  construction in coal mines, investment policies, and the  operational mechanism of coal enterprises formed in the planned  economy structure. In resolving these contradictions and  problems, it is necessary to formulate policies and find a way  out in reform and to restudy and redesign new ideas, a new  framework, and new mechanisms for the coal industry to move  toward the market in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the general  demand on the establishment of the socialist market economy  structure put forward in the decision on several questions on  the establishment of the socialist market economy structure made  at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  and using as reference the experience in the development of the  coal industry in foreign countries. I would now like to put  forward some reformative thoughts and tentative views on how the  coal industry in China should move toward the socialist market  economy.  <H3>  I. Break the Barriers in the Industry, Mobilize the  Strength of Various Quarters To Run Coal Mines </H3>   Running coal mines should not be limited to one industry,  locality, or country and transindustrial, transregional, and  transnational comprehensive mining companies should be organized  to carry out comprehensive development and operation. In the  coming 10 years, the national economy will enter a new period of  rapid development. How much coal will be needed and what will  be the production capacity of the coal industry by the end of  this century? Many domestic and foreign specialists and scholars  are constantly studying and exploring these questions. The  Ministry of Coal Industry is also studying and formulating  development plans. According to tentative views on revitalizing  the coal industry, put forward by comprehensive state  departments in 1992 after Comrade Deng Xiaoping made his  important remarks during his southern tour, the ministry has put  forward the target of producing 1.5 billion tonnes of coal by  the end of the century. At present, the coal production  capacity of the whole country is about 1.1 billion tonnes. By  the end of this century, the decrease caused by the decline in  coal production capacity will be about 100 million tonnes. To  attain a production capacity of 1.5 billion tonnes, more than  400 million tonnes of newly added production capacity is needed.  In the short period of seven years, it is not at all easy to  increase the production capacity by 400 million tonnes and it  will be difficult for the state to provide the financial  resources. There is a serious insufficiency in strength for  further developing the coal mines. Therefore, in addition to a  number of key mines, built with state investment in a planned  way, the strength of various quarters should be mobilized and  funds from various quarters should be pooled to build coal  mines. Coal mines run by collectives in townships and towns  should be developed continuously and with great efforts. To  consolidate, support, reform, combine, and raise to a higher  level collective coal mines in townships and towns, and to  comprehensively improve the quality of coal enterprises, have  become strategic tasks which brook no delay in the development  of the coal industry in the coming 10 years. Proceeding from  the reform of the coal distribution system and in accordance  with the principle of benefiting those who make investment, it  is necessary to encourage the electricity, metallurgy, chemical  industry, and railway departments, and enterprises under these  departments, to make investment in running coal mines and to  encourage localities which have a shortage of coal to run coal  mines in localities where coal is abundant. It is necessary to  welcome and attract foreign coal enterprises, commercial  companies, and financial firms to make investment and run coal  mines in China in the form of joint ventures and cooperation.  Industrial departments should provide high-quality services in  terms of geology, design, construction, technology, equipment,  and management, for departments, localities, and domestic and  foreign enterprises and companies which make investment in coal  mines and should carry out management by the respective trades.  It is necessary to make use of the market economy structure to  resolve the contradiction of the coal industry's lack of  strength for further development.  <H3>  II. Break Away From the Traditional Practice of "Allocation  of Levels" of Construction Scales in Central State-Owned Coal  Mines; Proceed From the Actual Layout of Coal Resources; Pay  Attention to the Principle of Economic Results; and Use State  Funds for the Construction of State-Owned Coal Mines in a  Relatively Concentrated Manner </H3>   The state should mainly grasp several key coal export  provinces and areas and build a number of large energy bases  which can support the whole country in despatching both coal and  electricity from regions where coal reserves are abundant,  conditions are favorable, and the input-output results are good.  The development, production, and operation of key state-owned  coal mines in provinces and regions where there is a shortage of  coal or where coal is for their own use, should, in principle,  be managed by the provinces or regions. Support should be given  to provinces and regions which despatch coal in the construction  of local commodity coal bases, sales of locally produced coal on  the market, and supply of coal power plants, steel works, and  other consumers which need large quantities of coal.  <H3>  III. Break Away From the Traditional Mode That Coal Mines  Can Only Be Run by Coal Enterprises; Develop Industry for Local  Processing and Converting Coal to Reduce the Pressure on Coal  Transportation </H3>   Because of the imbalance between the location of the coal  resources and that of the productive forces in the national  economy, and because of the planned economy structure in the  past 40 years and more since the founding of the republic, coal  enterprises can only run coal mines, their product mix is  unitary, little of the coal produced is converted locally and,  as a result, the amount of coal transported into or out of  provinces and regions has increased annually and more and more  coal is transported out of central and western provinces. In  1990, the net amount of coal transported out of the central and  western areas accounted for 80 percent of the whole country's  total and there has always been a shortage in the coal  transportation capacity. Therefore, all mining areas with the  relevant conditions should construct power plants and coking  plants and should develop other chemical products with the coal.  Some may make unified plans for coal, electricity, railway, and  seaports and carry out unified development and comprehensive  management so that most of the coal can be converted locally,  the pressure on coal transportation can be reduced, and the  basic operational conditions for the coal industry's entry into  the market can be created.  <H3>  IV. Get Rid of the Traditional Concept of Paying Attention  to the Scale of Construction While Belittling Economic Results  and of Spending Money Without Paying Off Debts; Lay Stress on  Economic Results </H3>   In building new state-owned coal mines, including major  technical transformation, it is necessary to use new modes, new  mechanisms, and a high technological level of equipment, to use  less people and to obtain better economic results. Coal mines  with poor conditions or economic results, or without the ability  to pay off debts, should not be built. In this way, the level  of the coal-mining equipment and economic results of key  state-owned coal mines in China will reach, or come close to,  the international level in 10 to 20 years as a result of our  efforts.  <H3>  V. Make Great Efforts To Readjust the Industrial Structure;  Establish the Strategic Position of Diversified Management </H3>   The establishment of the socialist market economy structure  has enabled the coal industry to enter a historical period of  changes and the problems of an excessive amount of people  employed, low productivity, poor economic results, and great  losses are confronting severe challenges. Because of this, the  coal industry must persistently regard coal as the foundation,  optimize the industrial structure, and make great efforts to  develop diversified management and tertiary industry. It is  necessary to reduce the number of people employed and increase  economic results. The surplus personnel from the enterprises  can be used for diversified management and tertiary industry.  Diversified management covers a wide scope, including  production and operational activities of the first, second, and  third industries. For example, processing in depth and  conversion of coal and the comprehensive development and  utilization of the resources of mining areas; the development of  tertiary industry which requires less investment and provides  more job vacancies; and the development of industries other than  the coal industry. This is a major strategic measure in the  development of the coal industry. Not only old mining areas  should develop diversified management and blaze new paths, new  mining areas should also develop diversified management and take  the road of comprehensive development, change the face of  operations in the coal industry as soon as possible, and  increase economic results so that coal enterprises can extricate  themselves from a difficult position.  <H3>  VI. Change the Operational Mechanism of State-Owned  Enterprises, Establish a Modern Enterprise System Which Is In  Keeping With the Requirements of the Socialist Market Economy,  and Effectively Integrate Enterprises Under Public Ownership  With the Market Economy </H3>   In carrying out experiments on establishing a modern  enterprise system it is necessary to select a number of coal  enterprises which have a more favorable geological position,  better conditions in terms of resources, and better economic  results. Experiments on companies with limited liability can be  carried out in some of these enterprises and experiments on  joint-stock companies can be carried out in others. On the  basis of the experience gained, management and operation by  companies should be gradually practiced in state- owned coal  mining enterprises. Relations in property rights should be put  in order and the ownership of investors should be separated from  the property rights of legal persons. The ownership of  investors includes stock ownership, that is, the investors are  entitled to: Benefit from assets according to law in the  capacity of stockholders; participate in the selection of  managers; participatin in major policy decisions; the right to  transfer stock ownership; and entitled to other rights. The  legal person property rights include the possession,  utilization, benefits, handling, and allocation of the property  of the legal persons according to law and the legal persons are  responsible for their own operational activities with their  independent property. Enterprises have the legal person  property rights and, through the establishment of the capital  system and the assets management responsibility system, the  system of assuming sole responsibility for profits and losses  can really be implemented in enterprises. It is necessary to  enable enterprises to manipulate, utilize, handle, and operate  their assets, to make good use of deposited funds, and to  effectively bring about added value in accordance with the  relationship of market supply and demand and the law of value.  In this way, enterprises can put an end to the situation of  mixing up the duties of the government and those of enterprises,  lay a foundation for enterprises to stop being appendages of  government administrative organs, and create the basic  conditions for government departments to practice management by  respective trades. Coal enterprises which are not selected for  experiments should continue to resolutely implement the  "Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations on Industrial Enterprises  Under the Ownership of the Whole People Changing Operational  Mechanism," reform the internal management system, and practice  replica legal person operation in units under them so that these  units are entitled to the rights of legal person enterprises  within the enterprises, undertake the responsibilities of legal  person enterprises, and embark on the orbit of development "on  their own in four aspects." Nonproductive and nonconstruction  units should operate independently, assume sole responsibility  for profits and losses, find their own way out, and strive to  survive through moving toward the market.  <H5>  VII. Increase Coal Exports </H5>   In 1992, China produced 1.115 billion tonnes of raw coal, of  which 20.2 million tonnes were exported, accounting for 1.8  percent of the coal output. This is far from being in keeping  with a big coal-producing country with an output of 1.1 billion  tonnes. A major cause is the problem of the export structure.  The export of coal is only managed by the China National Coal  Import and Export Corporation and the enthusiasm of various  other major enterprises, or major coal-producing provinces, is  not given full play. This situation must be changed and coal  exports should be a chief source of foreign exchange. It is  necessary to formulate, in accordance with the requirements of  the socialist market economy, a set of policies for coal exports  which are in keeping with our national conditions, and which can  arouse the enthusiasm of various sectors, and to smash the coal  export structure which does not conform with the market economy  laws and in which only one corporation operates. It is necessary  to remove restrictions in an appropriate way, gradually give key  coal enterprises the right to make decisions on exports, and  increase the export volume of coal to earn more foreign exchange  for the state. To avoid confusion in coal exports, to  coordinate work in various aspects of coal exporting  enterprises, and to unify policies toward foreign countries in  coal exports, the establishment of a China Coal Imports and  Exports Commercial Chamber can be taken into consideration.  This chamber can study and formulate policies for coal exports,  fix the lowest price limit and the range of price fluctuation,  collect and provide information on the international coal  markets, and investigate and study the operational activities of  domestic coal exporting enterprises to increase the competitive  power of our coal exports, supervise and maintain normal trade  order, and do a good job in coordinating coal trading activities  with foreign countries by coal exporting enterprises and in  providing services for them.    At present, we are living amid deep changes following the  development in reform, opening up, and modernization. The faces  of the social relationship and social economy are undergoing  tremendous changes. So long as we earnestly study and use Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, constantly raise our consciousness and firmness  in implementing the party's basic line, deepen reform, and speed  up development, the coal industry will certainly have  flourishing and prosperous prospects.</p>

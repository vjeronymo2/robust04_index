			<p>BFN     [Text] The new tourism structure, which will be headed by  the Tourism Ministry [as heard], has been implemented gradually  since 1 April. Osmany Cienfuegos, vice president of the Councils  of State and Ministers, said in a news conference a few minutes  ago that this new structure in the tourism sector is seeking  greater economic efficiency, more profitability, more  expeditiousness in transactions, and better organization  throughout the country.    Three main hotel chains have been created. The [name  indistinct] chain which will group the four- and five-star  hotels. This chain will be headed by Javier Ardizones, former  Cuban ambassador to Italy. The Horizon chain, which is headed by  Jose Fernandez de Cossio, former Cuban ambassador to Mexico,  will comprise three-star hotels. The other chain is the National  Blue Island chain, which is headed by Rafael Cespedes, and which  in addition to grouping a number of hotels, will also be in  charge of other facilities that will offer special honeymoon and  other services for national tourism. The installations of the  two international chains will be included in this group.    At the national level, the entertainment and tourism  companies are organized to exploit the potentials of each  province or municipality in the cultural, historical, and sports  areas, among others.    This report has been released by Osmany Cienfuegos at the  close of the first working meeting on tourism and the role of  the media, which was held for three days at the international  press center.</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHEMICAL FIRE CLOSES OTAY MESA ROAD  </P> <P> Fire officials closed half a mile of Maxwell Road near the Otay Mesa landfill  Monday after a chemical fire broke out at a hazardous-waste disposal company  near the dump's entrance, authorities said.  </P> <P> The fire, which started about 6 a.m. and produced a small, poisonous cloud,  occurred when workers at Appropriate Technologies II were moving 15 to 20 steel  and plastic barrels, containing dry chlorine and toxic soil, and six of the  plastic drums ignited, said Sam Schreck, Chula Vista fire inspector.  </P> <P> The workers at the company, in the 1700 block of Maxwell Road, controlled the  flames, which erupted from an apparent chemical reaction, Schreck said. None of  the steel barrels caught fire, but they did bulge from the heat of the burning  plastic barrels, he said.  </P> <P> Teams from the San Diego County and San Diego hazardous materials units  answered the alarm, along with Chula Vista firefighters, Schreck said. They  used water from fire hoses to break up the small toxic cloud, which was about  30 feet above the yard, he said.  </P> <P> After two firefighters wearing protective suits and breathing equipment entered  the blaze area, the agencies decided to inspect each drum, Schreck said.  </P> <P> They found some of the remaining dozen drums to still be hot, he said. Those  drums were reopened, broken down into smaller five-gallon containers, then  treated in a thermal reactor, which neutralizes the chlorine, Schreck said. The  contents of the remaining barrels were repacked into sterile drums and also  neutralized.  </P> <P> Schreck said the company did not appear to have violated any toxic-waste  disposal regulations but that state landfill investigators are also looking  into the cause of the fire.  </P> <P> No one was injured in the blaze and no nearby residents were evacuated because  the nearest homes are about 2 miles west of the landfill, which was closed all  day, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television A restaurant where I lunched recently employed an unusually cunning trick when it came to the desserts. If chocolate mousse was ordered a huge bowl was left on the table with a dish to serve yourself. The result was that the men, not wishing to appear greedy, helped themselves to an unaccustomed small portion - yet left the restaurant feeling that it was an abnormally generous place. In the first of a new series of A Cook's Tour Of France (BBC2, 8.00) Mireille Johnston has a look at the chocolate mousse in Tours. Also back with a new series is People First which deals today with asthma (C4, 8.00). Later on the same channel, after a debate about British politics in Critical Eye (9.00), there is a Film On 4 Premiere Paper Mask (10.00), with Paul McGann as a hospital porter impersonating a doctor. This black drama is directed by Christopher Morahan Even though the current series of Red Dwarf VI (BBC2, 9.00) is not up to standard, it is still better than most running comedies. It is leagues ahead of Billy (11.15, ITV) in which stand-up comedian Connolly looks uncomfortable.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 24 Apr (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR praises the Lebanese  Government's stance on the recent assassination of the Iraqi  opposition figure in Beirut, describing it as courageous and  decisive.    The paper says in its editorial today that the Lebanese  Government first asked the Baghdad Government to lift the  diplomatic immunity of the perpetrators of the crime so they  could be brought to trial. When the Iraqi Foreign Ministry  refused, Lebanon immediately announced the severance of  diplomatic ties with Iraq.    AL-AKHBAR adds that this incident reaffirms the Iraqi  regime's continued involvement in terrorist acts and President  Saddam Husayn's insistence on continuing to liquidate his  opponents abroad. The incident also reaffirms that any attempt  to improve ties with the Iraqi regime or to have confidence in  it is useless.    In conclusion, the paper says it is regrettable that the  assassination of the Iraqi opposition figure in Beirut came at a  time when some have been calling for Arab unity and Arab  solidarity.</p>

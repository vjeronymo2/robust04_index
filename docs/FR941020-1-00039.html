			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region III announces its intent to delete a site from the National Priorities List (NPL), Appendix B of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), 40 CFR part 300, as amended, and requests comments on this deletion. EPA identifies sites that present significant risks to human health or the environment and maintains the NPL as the list of the worst of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be remediated using the Hazardous Substances Superfund. As described in &sect;300.425(e) of the NCP, any sites deleted from the NPL remain eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions in the unlikely event that conditions at the site warrant such action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA plans to delete the Suffolk City Landfill Site in Suffolk, Virginia from the NPL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will accept comments on this Site for thirty days after publication of this document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures that the EPA is using for this action. Section IV discusses the Suffolk City Landfill and explains how the Site meets the deletion criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. NPL Deletion Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 300.425(e) of the NCP, 40 CFR 300.425(e), provides that releases may be deleted from or recategorized on the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making a determination to delete a release from the NPL, EPA shall consider, in consultation with the state, whether any of the following criteria have been met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Responsible parties or other persons have implemented all appropriate response actions required;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) All appropriate Fund-financed response under CERCLA has been implemented, and no further action by responsible parties is appropriate; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The remedial investigation has shown that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Releases may not be deleted from the NPL until the state in which the release was located has concurred on the proposed deletion. EPA is required to provide the State 30 working days for review of the deletion notice prior to publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> STRONG MOZART PERFORMANCE FOR OPENERS;  </P> <P> ORCHESTRA: PIANIST CECILE LICAD BROUGHT AN UNUSUAL PERCUSSIVE APPROACH TO  CONCERTO AT SAN DIEGO CHAMBER ORCHESTRA'S SEASON DEBUT.  </P> <P> Maestro Donald Barra and his San Diego Chamber Orchestra inaugurated their  1989-90 season Monday night at Sherwood Auditorium with a largely Russian  program that would have been an apt ornament to the recently completed Soviet  arts festival. Glinka's quaint, nationalistic tone poem "Kamarinskaya,"  Kabalevsky's playful suite "The Comedians" and Tchaikovsky's frequently  overlooked "Mozartiana Suite" provided unhackneyed, albeit affably lightweight,  programming.  </P> <P> The concert's anchor, however, was Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 14 in E-flat  Major, K. 449, with guest soloist Cecile Licad. Local audiences may recall her  impressive performance last season with the visiting Scottish Chamber  Orchestra. Her energetic, assertive Mozart interpretation was a tribute to both  her strong technique and even stronger personal music vision. Unlike Gustavo  Romero's elegant and at times mystical approach -- he played two Mozart  concertos in the same hall just three days earlier -- Licad's Mozart bristled  with percussive attacks and a surprisingly brilliant timbre. Unfortunately, her  zeal frequently pushed her well-polished runs ahead of the beat.  </P> <P> Even Garrick Ohlsson, the strapping American pianist who opened the San Diego  Symphony season with another Mozart piano concerto, rendered Mozart with  graceful intimacy. But, if Licad's view of Classical style is not the current  party line, the striking pianist from the Philippines made an arguable case  without apology.  </P> <P> The orchestra's accompaniment was clean and supportive, although not as  authoritative as the soloist's execution. Barra had recruited some new string  players, with favorable results in the orchestra's tone and discipline.  Glinka's "Kamarinskaya" gamboled at a jaunty tempo, and the gregarious  Kabalevsky suite featured well-turned solos from concertmaster Igor Gruppman,  percussionist Patrick Pfiffner and clarinetist Frank Garcia.  </P></p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Euro Colour declines to Pounds 46,000 European Colour, a maker of dyestuffs and pigments and paints and varnishes, yesterday announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 463,000 to Pounds 46,000 for the year ended March 31 on turnover virtually unchanged at Pounds 13.3m compared with Pounds 13.5m. Mr John Finchett, chairman, said that recession in one market sector reduced sales in the second half. Profits, depressed in the first half by non-recurring expenditure, did not recover in the second half. After a tax credit of Pounds 54,000 (Pounds 99,000 charge), attributable profit came through at Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 364,000). The dividend is held at 0.65p, with a final of 0.4p.</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Decline in BASF profit continues PROFITS of BASF, the German chemical group, have continued to decline, falling 25 per cent to DM632m (Dollars 372m) pre-tax in the first quarter of 1991. 'We do not foresee a rapid recovery of our markets - or a dramatic deterioration,' said Mr Jurgen Strube, chief executive. Business in the US had not improved after the Gulf war, though an upswing could occur if demand for cars and houses improved in line with higher consumer confidence. BASF is the first of the big German chemical groups to report on progress so far this year. Bayer reports today. Mr Strube also cited currency shifts and depressed selling prices, business difficulties in Brazil and Argentina and weaker trends in some western European regions such as Scandinavia. Higher sales volumes in Germany and important European markets had not been enough to compensate for the problems in North and South America. Noting the downturn in business had started in the third quarter of 1990, Mr Strube said forecasts for 1991 could not be based on the first quarter, which was strong last year. For the rest of 1991, 'I expect we can sharply reduce the gap with the previous year seen at the end of the first quarter'. He would not be drawn on whether profits would be down on the reduced 1990 result, similar to that of 1987. 'Matching the 1990 and 1987 earnings this year will take a considerable effort - and more than just a dash of luck'. The first quarter decline occurred on turnover 3.5 per cent lower at DM11.5bn. Domestic sales rose 2 per cent, but those abroad were down by 10 per cent due to currency movements. In the US, turnover was down 10 per cent in dollars and 18 per cent in D-Marks. Last year, total pre-tax profits were 37 per cent lower at DM2.7bn, with net income down by 45 per cent to DM1.1bn. Cash flow, however, was only 9 per cent lower at DM5bn. Earnings per share were DM24 (DM38). Mr Strube said BASF expected the dollar to stabilise at DM1.60 rather than at the current level, just over DM1.70. A rapid drop below DM1.50 was unlikely. Last year's dollar weakness had a downward impact of DM1.3bn on sales.</p>

Without political reform and  developments towards a fair legal system, the economic reforms  in China would reach their limits, Kinkel warned during talks  with Chinese Justice Minister Yang Xiao in Bonn today, according  to the Foreign Ministry.    Kinkel also underlined the German government's willingness  to  provide support in all areas which would serve to develop a  system based on the rule of law in the People's Republic. The  foreign minister also called on the Chinese government to use  its influence on North Korea and to do everything to prevent a  military conflict. The North Korean nuclear issue had to be  solved within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / A struggle to stay the distance: Economic and political pressures could undermine the French government's austerity programme The French government's momentary panic last month about the value of the franc has turned into longer-term depression about the fate of the economy. Fuelling the ruling Socialists' anxiety is the near-certainty, on present trends, that they will be buried in a landslide victory by the centre-right in next March's legislative elections. But to give in to the electoral temptation of relaxing economic austerity would bring swift retribution on the foreign exchanges. This, in turn, might endanger the minority government in parliament, and advance the very elections it dreads. Certainly, most of the warning lights on the economic console have now gone from amber to red. The burden of carrying virtually the highest real interest rates in Europe - 7 per cent or more - has crushed the life out of retail sales, construction and investment, and has brought growth in the overall economy to a standstill. The country's pilots make few public concessions to the fact that the ship has run aground. President Francois Mitterrand has devoted his convalescence since his September 17 prostate cancer operation to preparing for his appearance at tomorrow's EC summit in Birmingham. His imperturbable prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, remains clearly wedded to the policy of the franc fort he espoused as finance minister. His successor, Mr Michel Sapin, concedes the current lifelessness of new investment, but complains that this does not reflect the real condition of the economy. Other Socialists do not share Mr Beregovoy's Micawber-like hope that something may turn up in the next five months to save them from electoral disaster. Some have bailed out: Mr Michel Charasse, after presenting a 1993 budget based on unrealistically rosy economic assumptions, abandoned his post as budget minister to join the Senate. Mr Michel Rocard, the likely Socialist contender to succeed Mr Mitterrand, is openly pessimistic about next spring's elections, while many junior ministers recently flocked to the launch of a political organisation by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, for 'socialist renewal' in France. Outside the Socialist camp, too, some conservative politicians and businessmen - particularly in the hard-pressed construction and hotel sectors - are beginning to question the wisdom of continued austerity. The consensus that France has no choice but to keep the franc hooked to the D-Mark and wait for the Bundesbank to lower its rates is starting to break up, as slowdown threatens to turn into slump. The latter is most evident in the construction sector. Housing starts fell 17 per cent in the first seven months of this year on the same period in 1991. One property company now offers a free car to anyone brave or foolish enough to take on record real mortgage rates and buy a new house. According to one estimate, French banks have FFr400bn-FFr500bn (Pounds 47bn-Pounds 59bn) tied up in property, through their own holdings and mortgage loans, and their profits are now tumbling as they make bigger provisions for depreciation and bad debts. The government is rather more sympathetic to other victims of the gap between inflation, brought down to an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in September, and the cost of borrowing, as set by the Banque de France's base rate of 9.85 per cent. It has stepped in to provide some cheaper investment funds for small companies, out of an awareness that these businesses provide the best hope of bringing down an unemployment rate that remains stuck above 10 per cent. But this year's list of small business failures is still likely to be 11 per cent higher than the 55,000 which went bankrupt in 1991. The upshot of all this has been to reduce growth sharply, with expansion of the gross domestic product falling from 1 per cent in the first quarter to a mere 0.1 per cent in the second quarter. What impetus there has recently been in the French economy has come from exports; but France's competitive edge will be dulled, at least for a time, by the franc's appreciation against the pound, lira and peseta. The government is predicting growth of 2.1 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent next, but most professional forecasters in France estimate the economy will expand at most by 1.7 per cent in 1992 and by 2 per cent in 1993. As a result, few take seriously the government's estimate that it can contain next year's budget deficit to FFr165bn. The chief difficulty for the leaders of the main opposition parties, the neo-Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF, is that they have, as yet, no distinctive alternative economic programme to put to the electorate. They plan to censure the government's 1993 budget, but will almost certainly fail for lack of parliamentary support from the Communists, who do not want to precipitate the legislative elections. Mr Edouard Balladur, the former conservative finance minister who is tipped to lead a centre-right government next spring, blasts the Socialists for failing to cut spending, debt and taxes enough. But, apart from accelerating privatisation and using the proceeds to reduce public debt, he has little different to propose. Even while striving to be partisan, Mr Balladur is forced to admit the Socialists' achievement in mastering inflation and redressing France's foreign trade balance. Employers' leaders remain convinced of the merits of an exchange rate that has exerted downward pressure on their wage costs. 'We understand, but we don't agree with, those businessmen who say: 'Please give us a bit of reflation',' says Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, vice-president for economic policy at the Patronat employers' association. If the government gave in to siren voices for change, says Mr Seilliere, all that would happen is that 'after a brief illusory reflation of consumption, a brief period of lower export prices, a brief period of lower interest rates, we would after a few months have to raise interest rates again'. The achievements of years 'could all be reversed in one day'. But this Patronat position, Mr Seilliere warns, is 'not eternal'. It depends crucially on the Germans lowering their interest rates in the not-too-distant future. Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the Banque de France governor, yesterday sought to convince his countrymen of the existence of light at the tunnel's end. Long-term French interest rates had come down, he said, and he predicted that an easing of interest rates in Germany was not far off. What remains of the broad consensus on economic and monetary policy may fall victim to election fever, which is fast setting in. The legislative elections to the National Assembly are, of course, not the only target in French politicians' sights. There is also the presidency. Mr Mitterrand's illness, compounded by his unpopularity, have given rise to a general feeling that somehow he will not, or ought not, serve out his full second term to 1995. Mr Mitterrand himself fuelled such speculation last year when he suggested putting a constitutional limit on the presidential tenure. Seeking to quell this speculation, Mr Mitterrand let it be known earlier this month that he prefers a single, non-renewable, seven-year term. His choice of seven years, rather than, say, five years, dashed opposition hopes that Mr Mitterrand might apply the reform to himself by quitting the Elysee next spring, five years after his re-election in 1988. But the opposition parties are still arguing about whether, if they win in March, they should 'cohabit' again in government with President Mitterrand, or somehow try - perhaps by a government-inspired constitutional reform - to force him out of the Elysee. All this political uncertainty has been compounded by the Maastricht referendum. A big Yes majority might have changed the political landscape, with the Socialists recovering and wooing pro-EC centrists into the sort of large social democratic party that exists in many other European countries, or the RPR and UDF sinking their historic differences over Europe. Instead, the narrowness of the referendum verdict unsettled the existing parties and gave a fillip to dissidents within them. Maastricht opponents such as Mr Philippe Seguin in the neo-Gaullist RPR party and Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement in the Socialist party, may have lost the referendum. But their arguments in favour of a more flexible exchange rate policy, for instance, may be remembered in coming months. Mr Chevenement wants to re-forge the Socialists into a 'hard left' party if they are badly beaten. He may succeed. The Socialists are not scoring much more in the current opinion polls than the pathetic 18.3 per cent of the vote they won in last spring's regional elections, while the combined RPR/UDF score runs between 43 and 46 per cent. Some Socialists privately agree with the psephologists' predictions that they may lose half their present tally of 253 seats. Ever since ditching the Communists in the mid-1980s, the Socialists have been looking for allies. They failed to strike an electoral pact with the Greens earlier this year. But now, with the reappointment of the renegade UDF member, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, to the Socialist government as agriculture minister, the Socialists are casting towards the centre. They can count on internecine warfare among their opponents. The UDF and RPR are trying to thrash out a common platform for the March elections, but they still disagree over European policy. Aggravating tensions between the two parties is their leaders' rivalry for the presidency, now given keener edge by the possibility of Mr Mitterrand's early departure. After some 20 years at the head of their respective parties, Mr Jacques Chirac of the RPR and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing of the UDF probably ought to be making way to younger, less shop-worn successors. Not a bit of it. Both seem to have emerged from the Maastricht campaign, in which they supported the treaty but never shared a platform, re-invigorated for the fray. This was most obvious in the case of Mr Giscard d'Estaing, who put his heart and soul into pleading for a Yes. But Mr Chirac seems to have done himself presidential good by pleading the treaty's cause against majority sentiment in the RPR. 'Chirac did badly in presidential run-offs because he always seemed to be the prisoner of his party,' says Professor Olivier Duhamel, a leading political scientist. 'After the Maastricht campaign, that no longer seems so true.' France thus looks set for a prolonged bout of debilitating election fever, which could sap cross-party support for economic austerity just as high interest rates are threatening to drain life out of the economy.</p>

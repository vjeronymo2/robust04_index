			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (7): Hard life on the land - Francis Ghiles looks at a quiet revolution in farming The past 12 months have been difficult for Tunisian farmers. After four good years of rainfall, which produced an average cereal crop of 1.6m tonnes annually, output of wheat and barley in 1994 is expected to fall to half that figure. This, in turn, will shave 1 to 1.5 per cent off the rate of growth of gross domestic product and will more than double the cost of imports to around Dollars 250m to Dollars 300m. In the past, a year of drought often led to disaster, but this is no longer the case today. The country's economy is far more diversified and 1994 shows signs of being an excellent year for tourism. In farming, the growing spread of irrigation and wider use of fertilisers are leading to more diversified and better quality crops. Despite the progress of recent years, the sector still contributes on average 15 per cent of GDP while employing 45 per cent of the labour force. To enact reforms in a country characterised by semi-arid climate and a very fragmented pattern of ownership, where 80 per cent of farms comprise 20 hectares or less, is no easy task. But, as a younger generation of well-trained technicians take up new posts and as more of the 500,000 hectares of state-owned land is leased for 25 years to private companies - which include smallholders and foreign companies such as Shell - a quiet revolution is afoot, whose chances of success depend on a sustained effort over the next decade. These changes are also encouraged by a policy aimed at developing and conserving water resources and ensuring that even remote areas get access to drinking water and electricity. The latter fits in with the policy of doing more for the poorer south and western hinterlands. That has been a characteristic of regional development since the late 1980s. If anything, the troubles in neighbouring Algeria will reinforce the determination of Tunisia's leaders to ensure that those who live in the poorer parts of the country do not feel left out of the slowly rising prosperity which characterises its coastal and richer farming provinces. The quiet revolution in the countryside can be attributed to four broad factors: The state has divested itself of a good half of the land it has held since French farms were 'nationalised' 30 years ago. The land contains some of Tunisia's most fertile soil and is let on leases of up to 25 years, either to Tunisians who are often agricultural engineers, or to large Tunisian and foreign firms. The best example of the latter is the domain of M'Raissa, which is being developed by Shell together with Tunisian banking and insurance groups. The result is a switch from a 'socialist' form of farming, which normally simply ensured that a given piece of land could feed those who worked it but little more, to a form of farming which seeks to increase production, pays serious attention to quality and requires a more educated workforce. The ultimate goal of such developments is the production and export of high-quality produce, anything from blood oranges to wine, from flowers to seedless grapes. The second factor is the freeing of input prices and the raising of producer prices. Since 1986, when reforms aimed at liberalising the running of the country's economy were introduced, the price of inputs, notably fertilisers, has increased by nearly three-quarters and that of water by roughly 10 per cent a year. The need to utilise resources more rationally is now widely understood. Complaints abound, however, about the bureaucratic ways of many of the 4,000 civil servants who sit in the sprawling Ministry of Agriculture in Tunis. Many Tunisians interested in farming consider that a re-organisation of the ministry is long overdue. A third factor is related to the efforts under way to distribute Tunisian products more widely in the European Union. Valiant efforts are being made by the private sector to package olive oil, dates and other fruit more attractively and to ensure steady high quality, both vital necessities when faced with international competition. Ways are being sought to lower transport costs, which are often high, to think of how best to create a 'Tunisia' label for certain products, to diversify from traditional markets, such as France. All these moves are forcing painful changes further up the prod- uction line. The production of wine provides a good example of change. In 1963, Tunisia produced 1.4m hectolitres of wine, 90 per cent of which was exported to reinforce French wines. By 1978 production had fallen to 300,000 hectolitres and the vines had grown old. More than one-third of the vines had been pulled up and no wine was exported. There was no incentive to improve quality as local drinkers or foreigners on package tours had no palate for fine wines. By the early 1980s, replanting started; a few years later new varieties were introduced, such as Cabernet Franc and Merlot. Production started to increase and now stands at around 450,000 hectolitres a year. New markets in Europe, most notably in Germany which accounts for 60 per cent of the value of wine exports, were being developed. The Office du Vin is also making efforts to modernise the methods of making wine and a new generation of bottles and labels is soon to hit the market. The value of exports remains a modest Dollars 9m annually but the industry accounts for 1.5m days of work every year. A fourth factor is of a more social nature: to try to make life on the land less harsh. This is vital to avoid a greater drift of population into already large cities, virtually all of which are situated on the coast. Also, there is the wider issue of preserving the environment, which the Tunisian authorities have taken to heart in recent years. The social stability of Tunisia commands that the income of the poorer north-west and central southern regions be improved and that those living in poorer areas do not feel left out of the coastal prosperity. Many jobs, notably in the bloated civil service and tourist industry pay relatively high incomes for work which is infinitely easier than tilling the land. The minimal daily farm wage is only TD6, though many skilled farmworkers earn far more, especially in the richer areas. Only 18 per cent of those who work on the land - and this includes an ever-growing number of women - are covered by the social security net, in sharp contrast to those who work in industry and the civil service. The challenge that the auth- orities face is one of improving the lot of those who live on the land and tying higher wages, wherever possible, to increases in productivity. To attract younger people (the average age of those who till the land is 55), they must offer induce- ments even before the results would justify them on strictly economic grounds. The fight to improve production, to enhance the quality of what is grown and gain export markets will, however, remain hampered by the ever-growing fragment- ation of property and the considerable confusion that surrounds title deeds. Such problems, however, are not susceptible of easy solution.</p>

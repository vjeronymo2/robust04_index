			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Report faults maths teaching Mathematics teaching for post-16 students in England and Wales is 'inadequate and incoherent' and planned reforms could worsen it, says a report published yesterday. The report for the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, by Mrs Alison Wolf of London University's Institute of Education, says the structure of education 'positively discourages students from making maths, science and engineering serious options for future study'. It does this by forcing choices on 16-year-olds, when they must 'rule out some choices, effectively for good'. Mrs Wolf also criticises the new general national vocational qualifications introduced this year to offer an alternative, more practical, route to higher education and training.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Certain sources and  media in Italy have used the U.S. planes' attack against the  Serb territory around Gorazde yesterday to broadcast false  reports on the wounding, and even the death, of General Ratko  Mladic, commander of the main headquarters of the Srpska  republic army.    TANJUG's reporter in Sarajevo spoke on the phone with  General  Mladic this morning, a fact that completely denies the  disinformation of the Italian media. At the same time, this  reveals the truth that all forms of special war are being waged  against the Serb nation and the Srpska republic. Such alleged  information aims at causing panic among members of the Srpska  republic army and destabilizing the overall situation in the  Srpska republic.</p>

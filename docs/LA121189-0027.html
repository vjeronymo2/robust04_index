			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESTRADA TO DEFEND WBA TITLE AGAINST SAN DIEGO'S SALUD  </P> <P> The Forum, better known for basketball and hockey, will present its ninth world  championship boxing match of the year tonight when Juan Jose (Dinamita) Estrada  of Tijuana defends his World Boxing Assn. junior featherweight title against  Jesus Salud of San Diego.  </P> <P> The bout, scheduled for 12 rounds, twice has been postponed because of a cut  lip Estrada suffered in training in October.  </P> <P> Estrada (36-7, 30 knockouts) is favored to make a fourth successful defense of  the title he won on a split decision over Bernardo Pinango last year. Since  then, he has stopped Takuya Muguruma and Jesus Poll and decisioned Luis  Mendoza.  </P> <P> Salud (31-3, 16 knockouts), the seventh-ranked contender at 122 pounds, was  born in the Philippines and began his career in Hawaii, where he won his first  18 fights. He is best known at the Forum for his 10th-round loss to Frankie  Duarte in a bloody slugfest three years ago.  </P> <P> The undercard includes a 12-rounder between Edgar Castro and Manuel Medina for  the vacant WBA intercontinental super-featherweight title. That bout begins at  7 p.m. and will be followed by the main event. ALLAN MALAMUD  </P></p>

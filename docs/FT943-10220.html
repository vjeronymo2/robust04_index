			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / DTI pulls another company into pyramid selling probe The Department of Trade and Industry is scrutinising another 'pyramid' company as part of its clamp-down on organisations supposedly structured in a way to offer investors money for nothing. Officials are investigating Powertag, a company linked to Quillpunch, which was placed in provisional liquidation on Thursday following a High Court petition from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. The DTI said yesterday: 'We are looking at Powertag urgently over the weekend to see what action we can take. We expect to have news next week.'

The most recent was the appointment on Thursday on 'public interest' grounds of provisional liquidators to Quillpunch, into which the assets of Alchemy Marketing and Alchemy (UK) had been transferred. Filings at Companies House show that Powertag was incorporated less than three weeks ago with a registered office in Sunderland. Its directors include Mr John Asquith and Mr Stephen Darwin, who give addresses in Doncaster, and who were both directors of Alchemy Marketing. The DTI said its officials were investigating a possible recent transfer of assets or customer information from Quillpunch to Powertag. Last month the DTI wound up a different company called 3T Publications, which operated a series of similar schemes and which traded at times as FPW or Frequency Programming World. Members were asked to pay monthly contributions of Pounds 38 or Pounds 70 and received commission payments for each additional person they recruited to the network. There are believed to have been at least 8,000 subscribers to both the FPW schemes and those operated by Alchemy, which was briefly renamed the Alchemy Foundation. Meanwhile, some members of the schemes offered by the companies yesterday maintained their loyalty and belief in the schemes and expressed frustration and concern at the DTI's actions. One said: 'The DTI has stopped my income which I survived on this year.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, March 26 (XINHUA) -- North China's port  city of Tianjin is experiencing sustained growth in exports with  a gross export value reaching 360 million U.S. dollars in the  first two months of this year, a sizzling 20.4 percent rise from  the same period in 1993.    And according to local economists, the surge will continue  in  the coming months. Total exports this year are expected to  reach 2.3 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of more than 20  percent over last year.    Figures from the municipal foreign trade and export  department show that the city's export growth has paralleled its  economic gains over the past three years.    The city has achieved a record export growth rate of 10  percent in the past three years from 1991. The gross export  volume in 1993 topped 1.94 billion U.S. dollars, more than  doubling the amount in 1978.    Of the goods exported, about 82 percent were industrial end-  products and 18 percent primary products; the products exported  by foreign-funded firms and private businesses also rose sharply.    And many of these products have already entered the world  market, spreading over 153 countries and regions throughout the  world.    About 55 percent of the city's exports last year went to  Hong  Kong, Japan and the United States, and exports to East European  countries and Russia have also been expanded over the past few  years.</p>

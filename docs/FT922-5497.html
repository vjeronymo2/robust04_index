			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Markets: Hard-hit insurers claw their way back - The Bottom Line THE SHARES of UK composite insurance companies, so-called because they underwrite a mixture of general and general life business, are back in favour among investors after 18 months in the doldrums. Or are they? Between January 1991 and March 1992, the prices of the five major composites slid downwards, underperforming the market by some 30 per cent. But in the four weeks following the general election, they outperformed the FT All-Share index by more than over 15 per cent, a record second only to the more politically sensitive water stocks. No one doubts that insurers, perhaps more than most sectors, have benefited from a general shift in mood in the post-electoral period, with the rise in the stock markets shoring up their balance sheets. But opinion in the London market is divided sharply. Bulls point to the clear signs that the companies are beginning to stem the large underwriting losses in the UK which sent the sector spinning into the red in 1990 and 1991. Premium increases introduced across the board over the past year or two are now beginning to have an effect on the bottom line as more and more policies are renewed at prices which are often 50 per cent higher. Tom Bennett, an analyst with Banque Paribas Capital Markets, believes rising profitability will fuel an upward movement in prices. Although there will be hiccups, the stocks will move upwards with the sharpest rises during the weeks in which companies report their annual and interim figures. Stressing the severity of the industry's recent difficulties, and the extent of the shake-out and withdrawal of capacity, he says: 'The earnings background is improving and will continue to improve for some considerable time.' Companies such as Royal Insurance and Guardian Royal Exchange, which have seen their balance sheets hit worst, have reduced the amount of insurance they underwrite and are now more selective about the type of business they undertake. Royal, Commercial Union and General Accident all showed reduced underwriting losses when they reported first quarter results earlier this month. CU, the most successful and best-managed company in the sector, has felt confident enough to raise capital on the markets. Two weeks ago, it was successful in placing a Pounds 100m preference share issue, the first significant capital-raising exercise by any general insurer since the early 1980s. On the other hand, some analysts are more cautious. Recently John Chester, of SG Warburg, warned that although the rising stock market would replenish the asset base and dividend-paying capacity of insurance companies, 'expectations of a massive trading improvement' were 'premature.' Chester says it is 'probably unwise' that concerns about the housing market have abated. Housing problems left Royal and Sun Alliance with heavy underwriting losses as a result of claims on mortgage indemnity policies. Bears suggest that the decline in the asset bases of the composites over the past two to three years will undermine significant long-term recovery. During the 1980s, composite insurers typically traded at a discount to net asset value, and it is suggested that the recent fall in prices may reflect a longer-term re-evaluation by the market. Although linking share prices to asset values is problematic because of difficulties in calculating the latter (analysts dispute how the asset values of the life insurance component of the composites should be assessed) more cautious observers believe that asset values are a more reliable guide to pricing than the upturn in the upturn in the insurance cycle. 'The stock market has not woken up yet to exactly how much money these companies have lost,' concluded one bear.</p>

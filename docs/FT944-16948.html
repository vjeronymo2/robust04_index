			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Observer: Stepping out A new star is about to take her bow in London's diplomatic round. Noemi Sanin, Colombia's new ambassador, is a conservative politician from Medelln who enlivened many a dreary Latin American summit in her last job as Colombia's foreign minister. The London posting, which she will take up after completing a course in English, is seen by some as just a stepping stone to her ultimate goal of becoming Colombia's president. So as well as being out to refurbish her country's image as a land of drug traffickers, she will be keen to have lots of interesting photo-opportunities beamed back to Bogota as evidence of her statesmanship. No doubt Tristan Garel-Jones, the former foreign office minister and ardent admirer of Ms Sanin and her country, can be counted on to make the right introductions.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Arms probe judge demands papers LORD Justice Scott yesterday demanded additional documents from the Ministry of Defence after it emerged that ministerial notes relevant to the arms-for-Iraq inquiry have not been made available. The absence of the notes was discovered by the judge as he questioned a senior MoD official about the approval of exporting defence-related machine tools to Iraq in apparent breach of the government's guidelines. The official, Mr Alan Barrett, referred to a memo which he had written in January 1988 justifying the export of the machine tools on the grounds of intelligence protection. He said it had a hand-written note of approval by the private secretary to the then defence minister Lord Trefgarne. In the copy of the memo which has been made available to the inquiry by the MoD the handwritten note is missing. In a sharp exchange with Mr Robert Keen, an MoD representative, the judge said he found the discovery of the missing note 'astonishing'. He said he thought the note was 'important' and asked that this and other relevant ministerial notes be produced if possible 'within 24 hours'. Mr Paul Regan said last night on behalf of the inquiry that the judge's comment on the missing note reflected the 'seriousness' with which he was treating the issue. It is the first time that the judge has complained in public about the withholding of information by a government department since the inquiry got under way in May. Last night Mr Keen was unable to explain why a document that had been copied 20 times had not included the Scott inquiry in its circulation. Earlier, Mr Barrett defended his advice to ministers justifying the export of machine tools in spite of intelligence warnings that they were going to be used for munitions manufacture. He said the inquiry was tending to judge events with the evidence of hindsight. The hearing continues today.</p>

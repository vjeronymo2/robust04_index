			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Mitsubishi makes attack on Big Three - Cars heighten US-Japanese tension; Detroit is derided for its refusal to face up to worldwide competition; Europe sets target for 1995 JAPANESE car makers operating in the US have launched an outspoken attack against the Big Three US vehicle producers, intensifying the bitter debate over Japanese car sales in the US. Mr Richard Recchia, executive vice-president and chief operating officer of Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America and a former Chrysler executive, said the difficulties faced by the US auto industry had been caused by its inability 'to change to meet world-wide competition'. Mr Recchia was responding to the attack on Japan led by Mr Lee Iacocca, chairman of Chrysler, at the end of last week. On his return from Tokyo, where the chairmen of the Big Three car makers - General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler - were part of the delegation accompanying President George Bush, Mr Iacocca accused Japan of 'predatory' trade practices and claimed that the Japanese had the US auto industry 'targeted'. In a speech to the Automotive News World Congress, Mr Recchia, said: 'It seems that when economic times are tough in the US, there is a latent ugliness in America that bubbles to the top. That ugliness very often becomes apparent not only in political rhetoric but also sometimes in business rhetoric.' Protectionist legislation is being proposed in the US Congress which would further restrict Japanese vehicle imports and impose curbs on vehicles built in Japanese plants in the US, so-called transplants. Mr Recchia claimed that the US auto industry had failed to take advantage of the period since 1982 when a voluntary limit was accepted for Japanese auto exports to the US. Instead of driving for increased market share and instead of taking advantage of the limited availability of products to the Japanese importers, US auto producers had pushed for increased prices and increased profits, he said. Combined profits of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, had risen from Dollars 6.2bn in 1983 to a peak of Dollars 11.2bn (Pounds 6.2bn) in 1988.</p>

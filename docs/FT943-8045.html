			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / When oil and politics don't mix: Problems western companies face in exploiting Russia's vast fuel reserves Mood swings are becoming occupational hazards among western oil industry executives in Moscow. All too often this year optimistic announcements of progress in assembling multi-billion-dollar deals to exploit Russia's oil reserves have been followed by bouts of anxiety as executives await the outcome of the latest twist in the political power struggle for control of Russia's oil, the country's economic lifeline. Last month, after three years of negotiation, a final draft of a long-awaited oil and gas law was shelved when President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin rejected key proposals by parliament on ownership and creating a legal framework for foreign investment. The government has also in the past few months delayed two other important reforms: the lifting of oil export quotas and the granting of preferential tax treatment to foreign joint ventures. Passage of the oil and gas bill, however, is seen by international oil companies as the key to unlocking some of the biggest western-backed projects proposed so far. These include a Dollars 10bn deal announced in June by a consortium led by Marathon, the US oil group, to develop oil and gas reserves off the Pacific island of Sakhalin, and a project headed by Texaco, one of the biggest US oil companies, to extract as much as 2bn barrels of oil from an area of the Russian Arctic. Publicly, both groups are still optimistic that the projects will eventually go ahead. But 'you no longer find the gung-ho enthusiasm of a couple years ago', according to Mr Daniel Yergin, author of the book Russia to 2010 and president of the consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Boston. Mr Yergin believes that not being in Russia is the biggest risk for many big international oil companies - because the country has almost 5 per cent of the world's proven oil reserves and many attractive exploration opportunities. But he says those companies which have taken the plunge find themselves in the midst of 'an incredible struggle over who will control the biggest prize: Russia's oil'. All of the west's biggest oil companies have considered doing business in Russia, although few have projects up and running. The struggle to gain a foothold comes at a time when the Russian oil industry is in the midst of a radical restructuring. Output has halved since 1988, when it peaked at 12.6m barrels a day. Recent figures from Rosneft, the state oil holding company, show the trend continuing, with output in the first five months of this year down 15 per cent on the same period in 1993. Signs of the collapse in production are evident in the country's main oil regions. At the petroleum processing plant in Fyodorovskoye, near Surgut in the heart of the Tyumen oil region, western Siberia, the machinery is processing a fifth of its output of eight years ago. But reduced production has not eased problems of pollution. A few kilometres down a bad road, pools of crude oil surround many wells - graphic evidence of poor practices in much of the industry. The names on the equipment at both the processing plant and at the wells are often French, German or American, a legacy of the heady days in the 1970s and 1980s when investment and foreign technology were funded by high-priced oil exports. But now world oil prices are relatively low and government finance for investment has dried up, making it harder to replace worn-out machinery. 'Each year we lose (the use of) about 2,000 wells,' says Mr Victor Deshura, chief engineer of Surgutneftegas, the area's main producer. 'And we don't replace most of them.' A report by the European Commission's energy centre in Tyumen says the sector's financial problems have been exacerbated by low domestic oil prices set by the Russian government, and delays in payments from refineries to producers. 'The present situation is such that the world's (former) number one producer of crude oil cannot draw the resources in currency from its oil production which would contribute to an overall improvement in the economy.' Many Russian producers are also deep in debt and all are creditors of companies or countries (former Soviet republics) which cannot pay them. Russian oil exports, however, have been maintained by redirecting abroad the surplus resulting from last year's 19 per cent collapse in domestic demand - an unprecedented contraction in peacetime. A sharp reduction in sales to former Soviet republics which lack the hard currency for Russian oil has also freed supplies for exports to the west. But although exports have been maintained at previous levels, the revenues raised have not been sufficient to offset the income lost from domestic sales. Moreover, in spite of being Russia's largest source of hard currency, the country's oil producers often cannot pay wages or fund essential social services in the oil regions. As if the financial problems were not enough, the industry is also at the centre of political battles between the weakened central government in Moscow and regional authorities. Those Russian republics most radical in their declarations of autonomy - even of independence - are the oil-producing areas of Chechnya, Tatarstan and Bashkorostan. Tyumen and the other oil regions have less political clout than the republics. Nonetheless they, too, are lobbying hard for the right to retain more of the hard currency earned by oil exports. At present the government, which still controls the transportation of all Russian oil, pays producers just a third of world prices. The problems of the industry have not deterred western companies from trying to carve out niches for themselves. But, in most cases, their plans have been beset by uncertainties, especially over political, legal and tax issues. None has been affected more than Elf Aquitaine, the French company. Its project in the Volgograd and Saratov regions has been stalled for three years by protracted negotiations with politicians; rivalries between local, regional and federal governments which are vying for control over the area's resources; and, at the federal level, by differences between the legislature, the government and the presidency. Big companies have also encountered strong resistance from government and oil company officials who resent foreign involvement in such a strategic industry. Mr Yergin notes that 'oil is different from, say, telecoms . . . it fuels nationalist passions'. The desire to avoid such conflicts and to bypass chronic bottlenecks in Russian export pipelines was an important reason for a string of deals earlier this year to develop virgin reserves on Russia's periphery. The logic was simple: western companies would undertake large, technically-demanding and capital-intensive projects which no Russian company could contemplate. The projects would be self-contained, with their own export terminals, and, in the case of the Sakhalin project, would be undertaken without a Russian partner. In return for boosting Russian production and government revenues, the companies hoped they would be left alone. But the backers of these projects still await the passage of the oil and gas law before committing significant investment. Optimists among Moscow's western oil community say the law could still be finalised by the end of this year. But others say it 'could as easily be 12 months after that'. Western oil companies may be able to take some comfort from the opportunities for foreigners opened up by the radical restructuring taking place in Russian oil companies, in spite of the political stalemate over a legislative framework. A number of production associations and refiners, which were previously kept apart by competing ministries, have merged to form three new companies comparable in size with some of the medium-sized western majors. Other similarly integrated companies are likely to follow. Their attitude towards foreign involvement and co-operation varies. One of the new companies, Surgutneftegaz, based in western Siberia, is most hostile. Lukoil, on the other hand, is expanding its foreign links. Investment bank CS First Boston has a 3 per cent stake in the company, and up to 10 per cent of Lukoil's shares are expected to be offered to international investors. It has also forged an alliance with Agip, the Italian oil company, to explore for oil outside Russia. It was the chance to gain control of large new reserves which attracted many western oil companies to Russia, however. Most of those active in the country are likely to remain, given the scale of the eventual prize. But until at least the oil and gas bill is passed, they will have to make do with offers of 'closer co-operation' or the chance to be a preferred foreign partner.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Tapping Russia's Oil Reserves Former Soviet Union Oil Production (Thousand barrels daily)                               1993                    1985  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Russia                       6,995                  10,925 Kazakhstan                     465                     455 Azerbaijan                     215                     265 Others                         300                     370 Total                        7,975                  12,020  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: BP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

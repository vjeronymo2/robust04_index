			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Chambers plan closer links - In a Nutshell London's 40 or so chambers of commerce, representing between 15,000 and 20,000 of the capital's businesses, have begun discussions which it is hoped will lead to closer links. London has three large chambers - in the City of London, Westminster and Croydon - and many very small ones. Most have no full-time staff and many are too small to provide a full range of services. 'The chambers in London are far too fragmented,' says Ronnie Jacobson, marketing manager for the London Chamber. 'If we can all talk with one voice we will be much more effective.' There are no plans for mergers of the chambers but they hope to work together on training and lobbying for members' interests. At the same time the Westminster Chamber is in an advanced stage of discussions with chambers in Camden, Kensington and Chelsea, and Hammersmith and Fulham to establish a Central London Chambers of Commerce.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Guatemala's chance not to 'shoot it out': Elections for a congress that is intended to help bring peace A former general accused of thousands of human rights abuses has emerged as the central figure in congressional elections in Guatemala on Sunday. The election is for a reduced congress of 80 members who will serve only until January 1996. But they will have to legislate on commitments made by the government and left-wing guerrillas who are hoping to sign a peace agreement to end 34 years of civil war. Leading the polls are two right-wing parties, the Partido de Avanzada Nacional (PAN), which has strong backing from much of the business community, and the Frente Republicano Guatemalteco (FRG), led by retired General Efrain Rios Montt, a former coup leader and rabid Christian fundamentalist whom human rights groups accuse of being responsible for thousands of political killings during his 18-month regime in 1982-83. The government, which has already begun to lobby prospective deputies, is hoping that the new congress, unlike its predecessor, will be more receptive to what is expected to be a heavy legislative load. But the election is also being seen as providing political parties with the opportunity to improve the abysmal reputation for venality and personal advancement that they currently enjoy. 'This is a last chance. If we don't make this work we'll have to shoot it out,' says Mr Jorge Skinner Klee, a veteran congressman who is standing for re-election. The PAN and the FRG are perceived as the parties least to blame for the political impasse which has characterised relations with the executive over the last year. While the rise of Mr Rios Montt has alarmed human rights groups, popular organisations and intellectuals, his campaign, which emphasises honesty and a tough stance on law and order, has struck a chord with Guatemalans who feel besieged by the high levels of crime and are sickened by apparently endemic institutional corruption. 'Every time somebody's car gets stolen, a girl gets raped or a bus gets held up, that's another vote for Rios Montt,' says Mr Skinner Klee. The fact that two mass graves, with remains of civilian victims of massacres carried out by the security forces during Mr Rios's regime, are being exhumed appears to have had no effect on the electorate. Supporters of the general admit that this is the beginning of a campaign for presidential elections in November 1995. His prospects then may hinge on whether his party gains a large representation in congress. 'If the FRG wins a landslide, obviously it will strengthen his chances,' says Mr Gustavo Porras, an analyst. The election was brought forward by 15 months as part of a compromise constitutional reform package agreed between the government and congress in November after President Ramiro de Leon failed to muster enough political support to force a clean-out of a corrupt congress. Mr De Leon, who says he has high hopes that he will be able to work amicably with the new congress, needs congressional approval before the end of September on a favourable deal struck with Paris Club creditors on rescheduled debt. The government is also keen to push through fiscal reforms, blocked by the current congress, which would strengthen sanctions for tax evasion, and are intended to increase Guatemala's tax take from 8 per cent to 10 per cent of GDP.</p>

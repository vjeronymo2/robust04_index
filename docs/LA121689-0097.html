			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO PLANS NEW DRIVE ON 'LA MORDIDA'  </P> <P> To meet complaints about widespread bribery within Mexico's officialdom,  Mexican diplomats in Los Angeles said Friday that telephone hot lines have been  established to handle grievances, particularly those involving bribery.  </P> <P> Mario Nunez Mariel, Mexico's acting consul general in Los Angeles, told  reporters that the hot lines in Mexico are part of President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari's determined effort to rid the country of la mordida -- the bribes that  officials insist on to conduct everyday business there.  </P> <P> "Bribery is a common practice all over the world, not just in Mexico," Nunez  Mariel said. "We're just trying to create a new national campaign against  corruption."  </P> <P> In addition to the hot lines, the government has produced nearly 7 million  booklets -- entitled "Fair Treatment Is Your Right" -- to explain what to do in  the event a bribe is sought. The booklets will be available at Mexican  consulates in the United States, at all ports of entry into Mexico and at  airports, bus stations and Mexican customs offices.  </P> <P> The program comes at a time when Mexicans, many of whom work illegally in this  country, are returning home for the holidays, flush with U.S. currency that the  struggling Mexican economy needs.  </P> <P> Salinas de Gortari is the latest in a succession of Mexican presidents to try  to combat corruption. His predecessor, Miguel de la Madrid, vowed a "moral  renovation" campaign against corruption, which resulted in highly publicized  prosecutions of Jorge Serrano Diaz, a former head of Mexico's oil monopoly, and  Arthur Durazo Moreno, the former police chief of Mexico City.  </P> <P> While both men were convicted and sentenced to prison terms, the most common  form of bribery, la mordida, apparently has continued without hindrance.  </P> <P> Mexican and non-Mexican citizens commonly complain that the country's customs  officials routinely ask for $5 to $20 to speed inspections at the U.S. border.  At checkpoints in the interior, officials ranging from Mexican federal highway  patrol officers to local magistrates reportedly demand bribes for uninterrupted  travel.  </P> <P> In some instances, Mexican officials acknowledge, radios, expensive clothing,  jewelry and other valuables are confiscated from Mexicans returning from the  United States because corrupt officials insist that these people do not have  proper documents to prove ownership.  </P> <P> "With this campaign, I hope this will now change," Nunez Mariel said.  </P> <P> Officials of the Mexican attorney general's office will staff the telephone hot  lines, officials said. In Mexico City, the number is 604-12-40. Elsewhere in  Mexico, the number is 91-800-00-148.  </P> <P> While officials in the Mexican Consulate expressed optimism about the new  effort, those outside waiting in long, winding lines near Olvera Street to get  visas laughed openly at the program's prospects.  </P> <P> In a contemptuous tone, Josefina Alvarez said, "The last time I went home to  Michoacan, I had to give those inspection liars a CD (compact disc player) to  get through."  </P></p>

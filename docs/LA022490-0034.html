			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> NRBQ IS SERIOUS ABOUT HAVING FUN  </P> <P> The English language gives most musicians credit for something they don't  really do: No matter what happens on a stage or in a studio, the operative verb  for music-making is "play."  </P> <P> NRBQ truly played Thursday night at the Coach House. The venerable bar-rockers  from the Northeast played the way kids play -- with delighted absorption in the  sheer fun of fooling around.  </P> <P> This is a band that has its priorities straight when it comes to play. In  Webster's New World Dictionary, the typical musical definitions of play rank  only sixth and seventh on the list of the word's possible meanings. NRBQ paid  heed to meanings 1 and 2: "To move lightly, rapidly, or erratically; flutter"  and "to amuse oneself, as by taking part in a game or sport."  </P> <P> While most bands are satisfied with playing a given style of music, NRBQ got  its kicks by playing with styles, the way kids play with Legos or Lincoln Logs.  A kid at play might figure, why just build your basic log cabin? Why not put a  skyscraper tower on it, or maybe a dome? Now wouldn't that be neat? In the same  way, NRBQ threw out pop music's zoning laws and architectural codes, just for  the fun of building something neat.  </P> <P> Terry Adams, NRBQ's keyboards player, would fashion your basic, time-honored  barrelhouse piano run and start dabbling around with the blueprints. How about  wiring that solid old edifice of standard boogie with some far-out, chromatic  free-jazz space music? Bet nobody's ever tried that before, huh? Bet nobody  else would even dare. One thing is certain: With his hyperactively weird stage  comportment and his ever-shifting looks of mischievous wonderment and  spaced-out befuddlement, Adams was the strangest, most watchable rock 'n' roll  piano player this side of Jerry Lee Lewis.  </P> <P> A similarly playful attitude inspired guitarist Al Anderson to repeatedly take  his beloved rockabilly runs on wide detours. Notes were bent and twisted and  skittered together in ways that Carl Perkins never imagined. After one country  guitar solo that he executed in the traditional, old-fashioned and sensible  way, full of bassy twang, Anderson came right back with a solo in which he took  bassy twang to sublimely ridiculous extremes. He fooled around with his  Telecaster's tuning keys until the notes got so low and growly that they  sounded like a grizzly bear waking up grumpy (come to think of it, with his  considerable height and girth and his comical squint and scowl, that's what Big  Al kind of resembles).  </P> <P> NRBQ used these toying techniques to play music ranging from the fine, catchy  pop of its fetching recent album, "Wild Weekend," to country howlers like  George Jones' "White Lightning." Several winsome ballads and a sweetly odd,  description-defying version of "Whistle While You Work" were thrown in for good  measure.  </P> <P> NRBQ resembles the Band in its ability to take roots-rock styles and sound both  authentic and fresh, rather than simply imitative. Like the Band, NRBQ's lineup  has been together so long, played so many roadhouses and developed such strong  skills that it has gone beyond tightness -- the grail of most groups -- to an  utter ease and looseness.  </P> <P> Actually, with Adams and Anderson veering hither and thither around the solid  center provided by drummer Tom Ardolino and bassist Joey Spampinato, NRBQ was  loose to the point of sloppiness. A murky sound mix added to the extremely  off-the-cuff feel of the performance. If NRBQ were to release a recording of  this show, they would have to call the album "The Sub-Basement Tapes."  </P> <P> But this basement was a funhouse from wall to wall, full of surprising  attractions. In a world that is far too tight, long may NRBQ unwind.  </P></p>

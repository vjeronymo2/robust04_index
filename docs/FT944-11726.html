			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Seton expands medical products side On the day it revealed a 27 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, Seton Healthcare is spending Pounds 24.6m to strengthen its medical products division. The expenditure is to be funded by a 1-for-3 rights issue at 285p to raise a net Pounds 28.5m. The balance will reduce borrowings from Pounds 15m to Pounds 11m and gearing from about 80 to about 50 per cent. The shares closed down 18p at 343p. Seton is acquiring for Pounds 13.8m cash a basket of over-the-counter medical brands from Napp, a private company. The brands include: five for the treatment of head lice; Paramol, the first strong analgesic to be allowed to be sold OTC since Nurofen; J Collis Browne's, a range of anti-diarrhoeal treatments; and four other assorted brands. Napp has warranted that its brands had operating profits of Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 1.4m) on sales of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.2m) for the eight months to August 31. For Pounds 5m cash, Seton is buying additional rights in perpetuity to the Betadine range of OTC infection control products. It already had the licence for the range on a royalties agreement of 15 per cent for the first five years, jumping to 25 for the next five. It is also acquiring for Pounds 5.8m cash, shares and loan notes, Brevet Hospital Products (UK), a maker of compression therapy products. In 1994 it made trading profits of Pounds 755,000 on sales of Pounds 2.43m. Seton's pre-tax profits for the six months to August 31 grew to Pounds 4.03m (Pounds 3.18m) on turnover up 18 per cent at Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 22.2m), with the UK accounting for 81 per cent (77 per cent) of that figure. Organic sales increased 11 per cent, with the balance of the rise coming from three acquisitions for Pounds 9.75m. The sports and leisure division made flat profits of Pounds 352,000 on turnover up at Pounds 3.35m (Pounds 2.55m). Earnings per share rose to 8.9p (7.3p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 2.2p (1.9p). COMMENT Seton has been quietly picking up UK OTC brands from the big boys, which are now concentrating on global brands. And it has proved - with the 1992 acquisition of Cupal - that it can absorb companies to its advantage. Its earnings record, at 17 per cent compound a year has been driven by acquisitions, but contains a healthy proportion of organic progress. In the current deal it has therefore stuck with what it knows: it has also pitched the rights price at a reasonable discount to make the decision easy for shareholders. Forecast pre-tax profits for the current year have been lifted to about Pounds 11m, giving earnings of 21p and a multiple of just over 16.</p>

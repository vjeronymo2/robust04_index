			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Elena Samper from the "Evening Information </F> Review" newscast]    [Text] Last year, when Army General Raul Castro, in an  interview granted to the newspaper EL SOL DE MEXICO, announced  the island's goal of having the most cost-effective Armed Forces  in the hemisphere, the Cuban military's efforts -- efforts the  military had been making for some time -- finally became public.    At the end of the eighties, the Defense Ministry's expenses  totaled hundreds of millions of pesos. A review of these  expenses paved the way for a reduction in costs after basic  steps were taken to update the military's financial system.  Measures were applied at all levels, thereby reorganizing the  budget system on the basis of charging for goods and services  provided or required by each unit.    Profitability, costs, control of resources, the struggle for  efficiency, and the policy of basing investments on profits are  part of the vocabulary that dominates the process now under way  within the FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces].    During a conversation with Colonel Harry Villegas of the  Western Army's political sector, I was able to understand more  profoundly how the armed institution's self-financing is being  achieved.    [Begin recording] [Villegas] Based on the principle that we  must be self-financed, [words indistinct] budget, there are two  basic roads to self-financing. One is a reduction in expenses,  and the second is money-making efforts. Money-making efforts  have been taking place in agricultural production; in commercial  activities, such as taking care of officers' homes, tourism, and  the sale of certain food supplies; and in various other  activities. All of these steps help reduce expenses.    Under this system, each one of these primary, agricultural  and commercial activities has its own account. These activities  are generating profits gradually. Once profits are realized, 60  percent go toward taxes which, in turn, remain in the Armed  Forces Ministry, but at a ministry level. Meanwhile, 12 percent  of these profits go to Social Security, and 5 percent -- as in  the case of commercial activities -- are distributed among those  taking part in earning the profits. The remaining profits go  into the unit chief's account, and these funds can be used for  new investments. They can be used to motivate individuals or to  resolve problems in the unit itself.    This represents very efficient financial control. Gradually,  both factors, when you see the overall picture, will reduce the  budget and will limit or reduce expenses.    [Samper] Therefore, you are saying that nowadays unit chiefs  must become multitalented men. They must be very knowledgeable  in several fields and in a number of specialties because they  can no longer simply rely on their military training, as they  have done up until now. Therefore, the unit chief must also  fulfill political duties and other specific duties.    [Villegas] They must be fully prepared.    [Samper] That is right, they must be fully prepared.  Currently, what new responsibilities and skills are required of  unit chiefs?    [Villegas] Currently, as you have been able to see, we  devote  ourselves to combat training. We are practically maintaining  the same level of combat training we previously had. In  addition to this, however, we must also guarantee our soldiers'  nourishment. [Word indistinct] is being guaranteed, and it is  being guaranteed in a qualitative fashion. We must control  conservation and maintenance of [word indistinct], which, as you  can see, this activity requires. We must take charge of  deployment. You have been able to observe that a high  percentage -- and, each time it will be higher -- of our combat  forces order arms [words indistinct].    Another skill required is that of an economist. We are not  talking about economists with degrees or economists [word  indistinct]; instead, they must have command of the economy.  They must know what a product costs, and not be content with a  product that represents a loss. At all times, they must know  what resources require investments, how to make investments, and  to truly control costs. They must truly oversee investments.    Of course, one must devote time to this. When all of these  qualities are taken into account, you will realize that our unit  chiefs must be well prepared. [end recording]    Cuba's FAR is on the road to self-financing, which, from an  economic viewpoint, translates into reduced dependency on the  state's overall budget. Moreover, it also translates into  greater defensive capabilities, maneuverability, and flexibility.</p>

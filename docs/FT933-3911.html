			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / European industry 'needs to change cost structure' EUROPEAN industry needs urgently to change its costs structure to compete internationally and preserve jobs, even though many thousands of jobs will go as a result of such a reappraisal. This was the message of the industrial relations chiefs of two leading European trans-national electronics companies, Philips and Siemens, to a Centre for European Policy Studies seminar on employment. Ms Regina Matthisen, international labour relations manager of Philips, argued that 'we have lived in Europe above our means for too long.' High wage and non-wage costs, inflexible and short working hours would drive European industry to relocate in areas such as eastern Europe and China, where costs were around a tenth or lower. Mr Uwe Liebig, international labour policy manager at Siemens, argued that with labour costs and working hours largely cemented in place by regulations, sacking workers was often European companies' only way out. 'Current laws are such that only jobs are freely disposable,' he said. Both cited now familiar figures showing most EC wage and social security costs high above Japanese and US levels, even though Mr Liebig demonstrated that productivity in Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Sweden remains well above levels in Japan and the US. Ms Matthisen argued that 'we cannot compete with these enormous differences in wage costs,' and called for a 'very high amount of flexibility' on wages, working time, switching of jobs, and in the introduction of much greater automation. A 'knowledge-intensive' industrial structure will be Europe's strength, she said, but warned that companies could still get high quality production out of low cost countries with sometimes lower education standards. Mr Liebig said Siemens was not considering shifting production out of Europe on any scale. But technological advance was lowering the work content of production, thereby doing away with semi-skilled jobs. At Siemens, these jobs were largely being replaced by more skilled jobs. Philips employs 240,000 world-wide, but has shed 170,000 jobs in the last 15 years, including 45,000 in the last three, Ms Matthisen said. Employment at Siemens, by contrast, has more than doubled since 1960 to 413,000 in 1992, but Mr Liebig said 'we shall have a little less than 400,000 employees worldwide' by the end of September. Officials from the European Commission, which is preparing a White Paper on the way out of the jobs crisis, said dismantling EC social protection was not the way forward.</p>

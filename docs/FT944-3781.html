			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / World Bank bid to aid Rwanda farming The World Bank has set up an initiative called Seeds of Hope, to try to restore agriculture in war-torn Rwanda and prevent large numbers of people dying from starvation. The Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.4m) programme represents only the third time the bank's farming arm has had to re-stock a country's seed banks from scratch. It previously contributed seeds to Vietnam and Cambodia. The bank's consultative group on international agricultural research has prepared seeds from its laboratories to replenish Rwanda's farming base. These are being sent to nurseries in neighbouring countries - such as Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Zaire and Kenya - where large volumes of seeds can be grown and taken overland to Rwandan farmers. The bank's agriculture consultative group has the largest collection in the world of genetic material from crops in the developing countries. It uses these seeds for breeding improved varieties, but they are also available in case of disaster. 'It's not the kind of programme we want to be doing because it is associated with a disaster, but it shows that agricultural research can make an important contribution in a crisis,' said Mr Ismail Serageldin, chairman of the bank's agriculture consultative group. Rwanda was virtually self-sufficient in food before the civil war, with 91 per cent of its population involved in farming. But 'granaries have been looted and burned, and seeds have been eaten by starving people throughout the country,' Mr Serageldin said. This year's unrest has led to a loss of 60 per cent of the country's harvest of cereals and pulse crops, and to the loss of 30 per cent of plantains (large bananas). Mr Serageldin reckons the destruction has been so great that many important local varieties of seeds have been wiped out. If the Rwandan farmers have no seeds to plant next year, they will face growing dependence on outside food aid. Rwandan farmers also need to be provided with seeds they had before which are suited to their soil and climate and which resist local pests and plant diseases. The consultative group will supply seeds for growing beans, sorghum, maize and root and tuber crops such as potato, sweet potato and cassava. Mr Serageldin believes that, if the seeds can be distributed to farmers in time for the three growing seasons next year, Rwanda's farm production can be set back on its feet. But after that it will take two to three years to rebuild the country's agricultural research capacity and outreach system. The World Bank now depends on the United Nations and volunteer groups to distribute the seeds within Rwanda as it does not have the capacity to transport them to farmers.</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Minnetonka May Look for Buyer: Bloomington, Minn.-based Minnetonka Corp., maker  of Calvin Klein cosmetics, says it may offer itself for sale to maximize value  for its shareholders. "Comparable high-margin, luxury product businesses are  commanding very high values in the private market," said Robert R. Taylor,  Minnetonka's chairman, chief executive and largest individual shareholder.  "This underscores our belief that it is in the best interests of our  shareholders to explore the sale of the company," he said. Analysts said  Minnetonka could be worth up to $465 million, or $22 to $25 a share.  </P></p>

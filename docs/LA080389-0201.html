			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEWS LEAK SOURCES WILL FACE PROSECUTION, ATTY. GEN. WARNS  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said today he would not prosecute reporters who  obtain news leaks about criminal investigations but would charge federal  officials who are their sources.  </P> <P> Thornburgh said a new policy of prosecuting officials who leak details of  criminal investigations for theft of government property does not include  charging reporters with aiding and abetting or receiving such information.  </P> <P> "The statute clearly calls for prosecution of those involved in misusing  sensitive information that comes to them in an official capacity," he said.  </P> <P> "Previous policy was not to use that authority. We have changed that because of  reasons I've stated more often than you want to hear," the attorney general  said at a news conference.  </P> <P> Accurate leaks "have a tendency to compromise ongoing investigations," he said.  "If they are inaccurate, they have a tendency to unjustifiably smear the  reputations of persons who are the subject of the leak."  </P> <P> The revision of the department's 11-year-old policy, intended to protect  whistle-blowers and reporters from prosecution, was announced Wednesday in  testimony submitted to Congress.  </P> <P> News reporters might be questioned about their sources in a grand jury, under  the policy, if the attorney general approves the subpoena. Attorneys general  historically have been reluctant to subpoena reporters -- often the only source  of information about news leaks.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Havana, 1 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Fidel Castro  government decided to suspend the traditional 1 May workers  parade and instead summoned the National Assembly of the  People's Government [ANPP] to discuss issues related to the  severe adjustment program to deal with the persistent economic  crisis. The unusual decision to suspend the parade was  announced Thursday by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the  Central Organization of the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), who  instead called for additional work shifts in order to ensure the  success of the sugar harvest, the country's main industry. The  summons to an extraordinary ANPP session was suggested this week  by Castro in a speech during the closing ceremony of a plenary  meeting of the CTC National Committee.    The colorful 1 May parade, to which Cuba would usually  invite  other countries' leftist political party leaders, was used by  the government as a virtual plebiscite of workers support for  the Cuban revolution. During a meeting with CTC leaders, Castro  pointed out on that date [1 May], "there would be no better  homage to workers" than the discussion by the ANPP deputies of  the proposals by the "workers parliament" to clean-up the  country's finances.    Included among the measures to be discussed during the  assembly are those dealing with a tax system, a moratorium on  subsidies to the consumption of goods and services, the closing  down of inefficient companies, price increases, as well as  cutting the state payroll.

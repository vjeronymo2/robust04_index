Six corrupt  elements were punished.    Wang Lixin was sentenced to death according to the law with  political rights deprived for life on charge of embezzlement.  He was executed recently in Bayannur League. Li Junping,  guilty of embezzlement, who surrendered to the police with a  tremendous amount of money, was leniently sentenced to death  with a two-year reprieve; and Liu Xirong and Xie Hailong was  sentenced to life imprisonment with political rights deprived  for life and 13-year imprisonment, respectively. Rui Liuyuan  and Jiang Liguo, who took bribes, were sentenced to life  imprisonment with political rights deprived for life and a  nine-year imprisonment, respectively.    Wang Lixin, former accountant of the savings bank of the  Wuyuan County agricultural bank in Bayannur League, embezzled  more than 210,000 yuan from the funds of the bank and the  savings of the bank depositors from February 1991 to May 1992.  He used the money for gambling and drugs and returned merely  some 30,000 yuan after the case was discovered, incurring a loss  of more than 170,000 yuan to the state. Li Junping, former  accountant of the Delingshan office of the Urad Middle and Rear  Joint Banner agricultural bank in Bayannur League, colluded with  jobless Liu Xirong and Xie Hailong to embezzle more than 860,000  yuan from the bank from December 1992 to April 1993 by means of  "receipts of postal money transfer of the region" he owned. He  surrendered himself to the police with 380,000 yuan of the  embezzlement money in June 1993 and returned all the money later  when the case was discovered. Rui Liuyuan, former deputy  director of the transportation section of the Baotou city  aluminum plant, took advantage of business ties with a certain  unit in Jiangsu Province to abuse power to sell 140 tonnes of  aluminum ingot with the approval of Jiang Liguo, deputy director  of the plant. He took bribes totaling 200,000 yuan, of which  155,000 yuan was taken by himself and 45,000 yuan given to  Jiang. In addition, Jiang also owned $20,000, whose sources  were not clear.    Wang Lixin, Xie Hailong, and Rui Liuyuan refused to accept  the first rule and lodged an appeal. After the trial of the  autonomous regional higher people's court, the appeal was  rejected and the original rule was maintained.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (1): Armani is crowned king of the designers - Have the catwalk shows gone crazy? Or are they leading the way with their headline-grabbing collections. Weekend FT asked the professionals how they rated the fashion world's leading lights. Avril Groom assesses the results of our special survey / Fashion for all seasons Has the fashion industry lost touch with the real world? Bare nipples, extraordinary designs and improbable frocks at the recent fashion shows for the autumn collections suggest that it has. Are the catwalk extravaganzas merely a chance to grab the headlines or is something more interesting at work? The FT attempted to throw light on these questions by asking a wide group of fashion professionals which of the top designers are most creative, the most relevant to the real world of commerce and which had the most staying power. Our survey showed that those well rated for creative talent tended also to score well for having commercial value, but there were revealing differences, as there were between the scores given by fashion editors compared with those by younger observers. And despite charges that designers are guilty of excess, ugliness, and decadent bids for publicity, our respondents gave the best designers consistently high scores. This may reflect the fact that the Paris shows were remarkably lively and well attended. We surveyed the people closest to the catwalk circus, from top international fashion editors to photographers. They were asked to rank each designer on a scale of 0-5 in each of the three categories. The results are shown in the table at the bottom of the page. We then averaged the scores in the individual categories to create a fourth, overall, category. The results were contrasted with the views of a group at the younger end of fashion - students at the Central St Martins College of Art and Design. The results show that the 1990s have brought a change in attitudes to fashion but not necessarily a diminution of interest in it. The dictatorship of the hemline was toppled long ago but in the late 1980s it was consumer-led status seeking that determined which designer, or style, was 'in' or 'out'. In the 1990s, individualism rules and the top-rated designers are those whose originality is far more significant than season-to-season changes. Cutting may be complex but the clothes are understated, allowing as much freedom of expression as possible. The recession has done much for the individualisation of fashion. Vivienne Westwood for one is convinced that, with less to spend, women want clothes that are 'very beautiful and individual enough to enhance the personality without a date or a label'. This is not to say that fashion no longer exists: it does and it can change quickly. Among fashion journalists, for example, current taste in the forward rows at catwalk shows is for droopy, romantic layers and tailoring, mainly in black. In the poll, the writers gave designers such as Ann Demeulemeester, Martin Margiela and John Galliano high placings, reflecting this. Yet the more influential among them are already wearing the new soft, short skirt. By next season there could be rows of exposed knees. Two names share the top positions in the FT survey's four categories: Giorgio Armani is voted top overall, for commercial success, and for long-term influence on the way in which 'ordinary women' dress; Vivienne Westwood comes top for creativity. Unlikely as it seems, these designers are two sides of the same individualist coin. Armani's designs are never extreme and his success (140 shops, a dozen ranges at different price-levels, Pounds 450m global turnover, a jet-set lifestyle and a Milanese palazzo) is based on wearability and desirability. But his understated tailoring and cool colours are designed to let the persona take over. 'Fashion is not about satisfying the aesthetic whims of a designer,' he says, 'but about interpreting the desires of the person who is going to wear it. Only this gives fashion a social role and credibility.' And he has never forgotten how to flatter. At the cutting edge, Westwood's purpose is to be extremely individual, to jolt fashion into new directions. The rest follow where she leads, though, like a giant liner, the industry takes a long time to turn. And she has suffered the fate of many British inventors, as others popularise and profit from her ideas. She still cycles around London but her Pounds 3m-plus turnover is increasing by 40 per cent a year. Westwood is quite clear on her position as a creator. This is to fly in the face of the 'so-called experts who think they know what the public want. 'In fashion this has created uniformity and disillusionment, so now there is a craving for originality.' She claims never to have underestimated the public. 'With no backer and just a small shop I had great freedom and I found that however unusual a design was, someone would buy it as long as it was beautiful. To be creative you first need technique, to cut in the best, simplest way that makes the cloth give expression to the body.' Other highly-regarded designers would share this concern for cut before commerce. Second overall is Jean-Paul Gaultier, the former enfant terrible best-known for Madonna's conical corsets but also a producer of lyrically ethnic collections. A master of individualism who pioneered showing clothes on non-professional models, his high commercial placing reflects his astute marketing of this approach in the current climate. Next come the Japanese trio of Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des Garcons who were already rugged individualists in the era of power dressing, when they were labelled 'avant-garde' and seen as somewhat impenetrable. Now Yamamoto, the most uncompromising of the three for the female figure but also the most understated, points the way ahead for the new generation, voted top by students and all under-30s. Pushing up from below are the rising stars, all minimalist and/or individualist - Belgian deconstructionists Martin Margiela and Ann Demeulemeester, Italian fabric innovator Romeo Gigli, the German Jil Sander whose immaculate suits give her a high commercial rating, and British near-couturier John Galliano. All this squeezes establishment designers into mediocre positions, despite high commercial ratings. The biggest indictment of older designers' inability to adjust is Karl Lagerfeld's 11th position for creativity, though fashion editors acknowledge the debt to his ideas by placing him second overall. Other ways of analysing the data show the divisions even more clearly. The young eschew designers of conventionally glamorous clothes, preferring the makers of plain, deconstructed shapes which rely on the wearer for their allure. This may give a clue to the reasons behind the fashion show debate. Most of those commenting are mature. A majority is male. For them, fashion really is the shock of the new. It appears strange because the premises on which it based, such as the cerebral approach of the Japanese, or the Belgians' interest in recycling and vintage clothes, are very different from the priorities of the established design-ers. The professionals and fashion students look beyond this. They know that no one will wear Westwood's bare breasts and bustles but that by next autumn her womanly silhouette of puffed shoulders and wider hips will have superseded waifdom as the real world's fashion icon.  ----------------------------------------- The top three designers in each category: Overall                          score  ----------------------------------------- 1.

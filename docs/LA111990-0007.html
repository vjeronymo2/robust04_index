			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INCOME TAX CHOICES  </P> <P> Robert Deville's suggestion (letter, Nov. 11) that the National Endowment for  the Arts be funded by a "checkoff box" on the federal income tax form is such a  good idea that I would like to expand on it. Why not have checkoff boxes for  all the major categories in the national budget? We could have boxes for the  Defense Department, the National Park Service, federal aid to education,  Medicare, federal law enforcement agencies, and so on.  </P> <P> That way, each taxpayer could be assured that his taxes went to government  functions he approved of.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the checkoff would also serve as a national referendum on the  budget. If money were spent only on those things the people are willing to be  taxed for, the budget would be automatically balanced, and the unseemly budget  battles between Congress and the White House would be eliminated.  </P> <P> DAVID DOAN, San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Clearing gas pipes for competition: Plans to open Britain's supply network to outside shippers ADENSELY-WORDED document released this month by British Gas outlining proposals for transporting gas along its pipeline network will form the basis for a more competitive gas market in the UK. If at first glance it appears an arcane paper, it could prove extremely important to the way competition develops. The discussion paper, which will be debated until the end of this month before publication of a price list in August, aims to simplify the existing transport pricing system. This largely relies on British Gas providing individual quotes to shippers which want to send rival gas down its pipelines. To date the company has supplied around 60,000 quotes to competitors. As part of British Gas's agreement with the Office of Fair Trading on creating more competition in the market, it will turn its gas-transport business into a separate subsidiary by the end of the year. When that happens, British Gas will have to negotiate with its own transport company on the same basis as its competitors. The regulators believe this is the only way to ensure the company does not discriminate against rivals. But rival suppliers claim the way British Gas has structured its pricing proposals is aimed at protecting parts of its business and making it more difficult for newcomers to compete. British Gas explains that its pricing suggestions seek to iron out differences in charges for transporting gas to different parts of the country. This means that under the new system the price for sending gas over long distances could fall, while transit over short distances could rise. In addition, the tariffs for transporting gas through the company's regional and local low-pressure grids - mostly for delivery to smaller customers and, eventually, to households when that section of the market is opened to competition in 1996 - are likely to rise moderately. Mr Alan Marshall, managing director of Agas, one of the UK's gas marketing companies, sees the potential rise in local tariffs as British Gas's way of protecting its margins in a sector of the market it is seeking to defend. The OFT has required British Gas to halve its share of the industrial market to 40 per cent by 1995. Some of its rivals believe it could achieve this by mainly relinquishing its high-volume, low-priced business rather than its smaller, more lucrative customers. However, British Gas has yet to work out the details of how to reduce its market share. Mr John Huggins, who heads British Gas's transport unit, says prices would probably rise slightly for local gas transit: 'We were probably under-recovering on the low-pressure grid under the existing system.' The most important effect on prices will be the overall rate of return that British Gas is allowed by its regulator, Ofgas, to make from the transport business. The company is allowed to make a 4.5 per cent return on transport, but Mr Cedric Brown, senior managing director, says: 'This is not an adequate ongoing rate of return.' He will be asking Sir James McKinnon, head of Ofgas, for permission to increase it, probably to between 5 per cent and 7 per cent. That is the return British Gas is believed to make on the rest of its domestic business. There is some support from the City for Mr Brown's view. Mr Peter Nicol, oil and gas industry analyst at SG Warburg, questions why the company, with its obligations to maintain a safe pipeline system, should receive a return less than that invested in index-linked gilts. However, Sir James points to the low-risk nature of the business for his belief that 4.5 per cent is a decent rate of return, and possibly too high. Another point of concern on pricing for companies such as Kinetica looking to build rival pipeline systems is British Gas's suggestion that it will lower transport tariffs over longer distances. That will make it less attractive for competitors to build pipelines and compete with the British Gas grid. Pricing is by far the largest concern of rival shippers which are still digesting the complex document of proposals. But the system for regulation of the transport business is also unclear and is to be decided between British Gas and Ofgas. Rival shippers will get a chance to put their views at a public meeting on April 27. Given the complex nature of the proposals and the important base they will provide for a newly competitive market, it promises to be a heated debate.</p>

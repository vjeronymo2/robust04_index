			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Enter the ghost of crises past Mr Norman Lamont is quite a young man, but last week he delivered an old man's Budget. It revived old policies, being just a little bit Keynesian (in appearance at least), though not enough to frighten the children. It ran into an old constraint, the PSBR, and got an old-fashioned response in the stock market. And it was haunted throughout by the ghosts of old-fashioned crises - balance of payments crises and sterling crises - which were supposed officially to have been laid; first when we floated sterling and again, with a stake through the heart, when we joined the ERM. You had not noticed these oddities? Then you are old fashioned, too, and perhaps rightly so. If worries about government borrowing are not simply a long-ago conditioned reflex, then they are revealing; they show that nobody really believes that we have achieved the brave new European world, in spite of the unshakeable commitment expressed on all sides; otherwise these worries are not rational at all. In one sense they are relatively new-fangled. There was a time when the PSBR was simply a memorandum item for the gilts market. The economically significant number is not the public sector borrowing requirement but the financial deficit - the PSFD. This largely forgotten set of initials shows how far the government is living within its means. It does not, that is to say, treat asset sales as a substitute for thrift. On that test, Mr Lamont is a good deal more improvident - or expansionary, if you believe that kind of arithmetic - than he has admitted, but still not improvident enough to revive the economy, let alone fears of inflation. The PSBR, which simply forecasts government demands on the credit market, became important (if ever it was) during the tragi-comedy of British broad-definition monetarism. Any public borrowing which is not funded adds to the broad money supply; QED. However, the attempt to control the broad money supply was a fiasco and was formally abandoned some years ago. If we were worrying about it still, as the Liverpool letter-writers do, we would be concerned about the fact that it is growing far too slowly. Here the PSBR is not a constraint but an opportunity; don't fund all the borrowing, and money growth improves. Indeed, Professor Tim Congdon argues that government spending which is fully funded has no effect on the economy at all - and we are still working on a full-funding rule in this country, as Mr Lamont reiterated. Funded borrowing should not, on the Congdon theory, affect markets either. That is debatable, but what is beyond question is that a rise in borrowing which is simply the result of falling revenues cannot be a stimulus. It means no more than that the government's spending, unlike that of the private sector, is not trimmed to match short-term fluctuations in income. If the markets believed Mr Lamont's claim that the budget is in medium-term balance, they should shrug off this year's borrowing with barely a thought, except for their faulty economic models. What about another old-fashioned idea - crowding out? The theory is that excessive government borrowing will force up the cost of private credit, and cramp the economy. This hardly makes sense in 1992. There is too little private credit demand, not too much. The collapse of commercial building alone is likely to cut borrowing by about as much as government borrowing is rising, as American Express has pointed out in an analysis. If we were still operating in a closed British market, government bonds would be the only good investment on offer in anything like an adequate quantity. But of course we are not operating in a closed market, and have not been for well over a decade. In the context of the world market, the British requirement is entirely dwarfed by the really big borrowers, led by the US, and the unexpected change in the PSBR, a matter of Pounds 4bn at most, is not even noticeable. So we come back to where we started. If you believe that Britain is a committed member of the ERM, and committed to the present exchange rate, then the Lamont Budget is a financial non-event, and all the ink spent on it nothing more than an attempt to fill the space reserved for what was expected to be a more interesting package. But what if you don't believe these things, even though everybody says that they are so? The man who gave voice to the unspoken worry which makes sense of the whole thing is Mr Christopher Lewinton, chairman and chief executive of TI, the engineering group. Just before Mr Lamont made his speech, Mr Lewinton called for a devaluation of sterling within the ERM. His aim, he said, was to enable the government to cut interest rates. The experience of other ERM members who have devalued suggests this would not work; devaluation makes a currency more suspect, not less. Indeed, so far as the markets believe that Mr Lewinton is speaking for other, though more tactful, industrialists, his speech alone could help to keep rates high. But the effect will be marginal, because the suspicion has always been there. It is in this context only that selling Pounds 3bn of new gilts (including refunding) every month for the next three years could be a problem. It is not insuperable; the US Treasury continues to borrow huge sums, the dollar has a dreadful record and none of the predicted crises have actually occurred. But don't expect British bond rates to come down much for a long time yet. And when that time does come, you may well see the problem defined away. It's not just that we may have a Labour government, which believes in productive public sector investment, and would like to exclude it from the present definition of the public deficit. Such a move would have the sanction of the EMU rules, which allow for 'excess' borrowing to finance investment. And then perhaps we could exorcise the ghosts whose rattling chains have been unsettling the markets, and start to analyse the things which really matter. The present rules suited past monetarists, and they suited Mrs Thatcher, who wanted to ensure that only privatised utilities could plan their investment outside Treasury constraints. But they never did make much sense.</p>

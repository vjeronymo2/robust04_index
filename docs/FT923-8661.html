			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Cruise liners steer clear of recession reefs: It is mainly plain sailing in a buoyant industry THE QE2 may have been holed at the weekend but the cruising holiday industry shows no signs of coming to grief. On Friday the ship hit an unidentified underwater obstacle off the US east coast and was last night heading under its own power to a dry dock in Boston for repairs. The QE2 is due for a complete refit in November so the stay in Boston will only be for emergency 'patching up' work. Members of the Department of Transport's Marine Accident Investigation Branch have flown out to join the US investigators into the incident. They will try to discover how the vessel hit a submerged object and began taking on water 10 miles off the Massachusetts coast late on Friday, at the end of a five-day round-trip cruise from New York to Nova Scotia. US Coastguards said there was a gash in the side of the ship three to six inches wide and 74ft long. The accident has meant the cancellation of two transatlantic crossings for the QE2, but Cunard said yesterday that the crossing scheduled for August 18 was expected to go ahead. The QE2 is the largest of seven cruise ships operated by Cunard, a subsidiary of Trafalgar House. The Trafalgar House share price has come under increased pressure in recent weeks. The QE2's mishap is not likely to make the market any happier about Trafalgar House, but any impact on the share price should be fleeting, as the liner will be out of service only for a short time. During the past few months there has been strong speculation that Trafalgar House would be happy to dispose of the Cunard shipping and hotel business, including the Ritz Hotel, if a satisfactory price could be achieved. Cunard has benefited from the increasing popularity in Britain of cruises as the market has expanded to take in a wider range of customers. The QE2 does well out of being the best known British cruise liner, and the only one to provide a more leisurely alternative to transatlantic flights. Lunn Poly, the tour operator, last week predicted that cruises would continue to increase in popularity, with fly-cruises dominating the market. It said: 'The introduction of more modern ships combined with huge investment in facilities on board means that cruising now appeals to a far wider age group than ever before.' Prices are still high enough to keep cruising mostly in the luxury holiday category, but a growth in shorter cruises of two to five days and some price cutting have extended cruising's appeal to a slightly younger market than the traditional wealthy pensioners. Packaging cruises with a flight or a few days on land has also broadened their appeal. The majority now start with a flight to a Mediterranean or Caribbean island so that holidaymakers take advantage of sunshine from the first day. A 14-day package including a Caribbean cruise and a week's car hire in Florida can cost as little as Pounds 795. The UK cruise market grew at about 5 per cent a year during the 1980s, and in 1990 about 186,000 Britons went on a cruise. North Americans are the core customers for most lines but about two thirds of Cunard passengers on Caribbean cruises are British. The Gulf war had a temporarily depressing effect on the market as Americans stayed away from Europe and the Mediterranean, but recovery now seems complete. Industry experts say there is still enormous potential for further growth and describe the cruise market, without a hint of irony, as 'buoyant'. In January P&amp;O, one of the largest cruise operators, indicated its optimism by ordering a new 'superliner' to be based in Europe. The Pounds 200m contract went to the German shipbuilders Meyer Werft, in Papenburg, and the ship is due to be delivered in April 1995. The exact appeal of a cruise holiday is hard to define. Since the 1920s a cruise has always been associated with luxury, and that remains valid for most ships today. Some travel industry insiders say the attraction is in the opportunity for complete relaxation, with no need to move from a deckchair to get a change of scene. Younger customers like being able to visit a number of islands in the course of a holiday without the hassle of getting from one to another. The security of a liner, where no strange food, unfamiliar currencies or beach pickpockets can disturb a holidaymaker, is also part of the appeal. Mr George Law, Cunard's marketing director for the UK and Europe, said the new, younger type of customer being targeted was likely to be aged about 45 and travelling without children. A large proportion of cruise passengers still tend to be retired, which has the effect of making cruising more recession-proof than other sectors of the tourist industry. Mr Keith Betton, of the Association of British Travel Agents, says that cruise operators might actually have benefited from the period of high interest rates, which tended to restrict spending on standard package holidays. He said: 'The sort of people who particularly like going on a cruise are maybe pensioners, very often people who have not got a mortgage, so they benefit from having interest earned rather than interest to pay.' The amount of repeat business has also been good news for operators. Once customers have tried a cruise holiday, they tend to come back. About half of the passengers on Cunard's two three-star ships, the Countess and the Princess, are new to cruising, but on the more luxurious ships the proportion drops to about 30 per cent.</p>

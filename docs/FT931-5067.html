			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Glaxo accused over Zantac GLAXO, Europe's biggest drugs group, has been accused by the US Food and Drug Administration of making false and misleading statements about Zantac, the world's best-selling medicine with annual sales of about Pounds 2bn The FDA says the company 'frequently suggests unapproved uses for Zantac and consistently makes comparative efficacy and safety claims that are not supported by adequate data'. It has asked Glaxo to write to all US doctors correcting the statements. The agency says Glaxo made misleading statements about the safety of Zantac, an ulcer treatment, compared with other drugs in its class, notably SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet and Merck's Pepcid. It also says Glaxo made unsubstantiated claims about the drug's effectiveness. The drug represents 45 per cent of Glaxo's turnover. Analysts believe annual US sales are about Dollars 1.4bn. Last month, Glaxo Inc, the UK group's American arm, said it disagreed with most of the FDA's claims. Dr Ernest Mario, the UK company's chief executive, said he would be very surprised if the company had to send out a letter to US practitioners. At that time, Dr Mario said he believed the move had been instigated by Glaxo's competitors. Zantac's sales during the six months to December 31 increased 14 per cent to Pounds 1.03bn. However, Glaxo Inc yesterday said it had met the FDA and was co-operating with the agency in the hope of settling the issue soon. Meanwhile it has complied with a request for the company to stop all aspects of its advertising and promotional activities that contain the contested claims. The company refused to confirm whether it would send the doctors' letter. Glaxo denied there was any serious risk of Zantac being withdrawn from the US. It said: 'We do not believe there is anything in this situation that cannot be settled in our discussions with the FDA and will keep this product from being available to US patients. The safety and effectiveness of Zantac have not been called into question.' It is not unusual for the FDA to oblige drugs companies to send letters to practitioners. Last week, Marion Merrell Dow, the US group, sent a letter about its anti-ulcer treatment Carafate.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Tory rightwing warns on tax rises THE GOVERNMENT could face a fresh backbench rebellion if Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, uses the Budget to extend value added tax without cutting public spending, the Thatcherite wing of the Conservative party has warned. In a blunt message to Mr Clarke the Conservative Way Forward pressure group yesterday warned that extending indirect taxation 'will not be accepted unless a sharp pruning knife is taken to public spending first'. The group, which counts ministers among its supporters, says in the summer issue of Forward, its quarterly magazine, that increasing direct taxation would be 'totally unthinkable'. The warning came as Lord Parkinson, the former cabinet minister who is chairman of Conservative Way Forward, serves notice that the civil war in the party is far from over by launching a vitriolic attack on Mr John Major's 'disunited' government. He writes in Forward that the government 'all too often fails to give even the impression of leadership' and laments 'a terrible 12 months'. Lord Parkinson says that what is now needed is a period of 'solid and stable' government. Disillusioned Conservative voters do not want 'a whole series of speeches from the prime minister setting out his philosophy'. Yesterday's warnings came amid mounting evidence that the strengthening recovery may be reducing pressure on Mr Clarke to consider significant new tax rises in the Budget on November 30. Such thinking was given a boost by this week's announcement that the public-sector deficit was a lower-than-expected Pounds 1.55bn in July. But Downing Street has so far preached caution, with neither it nor the Treasury yet prepared to revise downwards the government's forecast of a Pounds 50bn PSBR for the financial year. Also in Forward, Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, calls for spending on the welfare state to be cut by Pounds 20bn by 1997. Forward.

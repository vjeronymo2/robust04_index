In the six months to June Union made operating profits of Pounds 29.1m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 12m on sales of Pounds 584.3m. In the same period of 1991, the respective figures were profits Pounds 18m, losses Pounds 20.5m and Pounds 1.3bn.

Mr Robinson said the terms of a standstill agreement with 70 banks, owed Pounds 300m, had been agreed subject to conditions which were expected to be fulfilled imminently. The agreement will 'formalise' the company's refinancing through to December 1994 and will allow a continuation of the strategy of debt reduction, Mr Robinson said in a statement. All Union's bank's have signed the standstill agreement. Operating profits included a Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 14.9m) surplus on the disposal of fixed assets. Payment of dividends on the cumulative preference stocks are suspended for the foreseeable future.</p>

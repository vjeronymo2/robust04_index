			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN TO GET KEY TWA ROUTES FOR $515 MILLION;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: CARL C. ICAHN'S CARRIER ALSO MAKES ITS SECOND BID IN A MONTH FOR  AILING PAN AM -- THIS TIME FOR $375 MILLION.  </P> <P> Seeking to raise badly needed cash, Trans World Airlines said Sunday that it  had agreed to sell all of its London routes and other assets to American  Airlines for $515 million. Simultaneously, TWA made a new offer to acquire  ailing Pan American World Airways for $375 million.  </P> <P> The two moves further illustrate how weak U.S. airlines are getting weaker and  stronger carriers are taking advantage of it. Struggling TWA said it needs to  merge with Pan Am to help ensure both carriers' survival. And the sale to  American of some of TWA's most coveted routes will make American an even  stronger force internationally, while giving TWA cash to finance the Pan Am bid  and survive the economic downturn.  </P> <P> TWA had offered to buy Pan Am last month for $450 million, but the overture was  quickly rejected because Pan Am felt it could go it alone following an  agreement to sell its London routes to United Airlines.  </P> <P> In a letter delivered Sunday to Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett, TWA  Chairman Carl C. Icahn offered to enter into a definitive merger agreement with  Pan Am in which TWA would pay $1.50 per share in cash and $1 per share of  either a preferred stock or a promissory note.  </P> <P> A Pan Am spokesman said "the letter was received too late on Sunday, so there  is nothing we can say tonight."  </P> <P> In its earlier unsuccessful bid, TWA offered $1 in cash and $2 in stock or  notes for each share of Pan Am stock. Analysts were skeptical of the TWA  proposal because of the low cash offering.  </P> <P> In its deal with TWA, American agreed to buy for $445 million certain TWA  routes between London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports and six U.S. cities,  including Los Angeles. The routes agreement is subject to Department of  Transportation approval.  </P> <P> American also agreed to purchase from TWA for another $70 million a total of 40  landing slots and three gates at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and  some other facilities. American hopes the deal will enhance its competitive  position in Chicago, its second-largest domestic hub, where it now runs second  behind archrival United.  </P> <P> As part of the deal, TWA and American will mesh their frequent flier programs.  </P> <P> Dallas-Ft. Worth-based American said it planned to finance the transaction by  the sale of common stock in the first quarter of next year.  </P> <P> The TWA-American deal continues a trend whereby strong carriers are gaining "by  taking advantage of the current environment in which the financially ailing  carriers need to raise cash to maintain their viability," said Hans J.  Plickert, an airline analyst with the Transportation Group, an affiliate of  Paine Webber, the New York-based investment house.  </P> <P> But Plickert added that the current American-TWA deal and others like it might  provide cash transfusions to allow weaker carriers to survive.  </P> <P> "People have been predicting that some of the weaker carriers -- and TWA is one  of these -- will not survive," Plickert said. "Now their disappearance is not a  given."  </P> <P> Icahn said that while he was "reluctant" to part with the London routes, "over  the last two years earnings from these routes have seriously deteriorated."  Icahn said those earnings "will almost certainly continue to erode," thanks to  new competition brought on by United's recent agreement to buy Pan Am's London  routes.  </P> <P> Icahn said cash from the sale of the routes would "generate additional cash . .  . which will enable us to position ourselves for growth, despite these  extremely difficult times."  </P> <P> Icahn, who owns all but about 10% of TWA stock, said that in addition to the  Pan Am offer, he is continuing his talks with bankers and creditors to buy  bankrupt Eastern Airlines' Atlanta hub and its Miami maintenance base.  </P> <P> Most of the sale to American involves routes to London's Heathrow Airport, a  development bound to perpetuate a major controversy. Under bilateral agreements  between the United States and Great Britain, only TWA and Pan Am are  specifically mentioned as being allowed to use Heathrow, the major British  gateway to Europe.  </P> <P> Because Heathrow is so congested, the British have attempted not to transfer  the route authority there from one U.S. carrier to another. Instead, it has  insisted that any new routes go into Gatwick Airport. Gatwick, though closer to  downtown London, doesn't have as large a European feed. Talks on the subject  are under way between the two governments.  </P> <P> A similar situation exists in Pan Am's agreement to sell certain routes to  United Airlines for $290 million. Pan Am also sold United two Boeing 747  jetliners, making the entire transaction worth about $400 million.  </P> <P> In a statement issued late Sunday, American Chairman Robert L. Crandall said  the purchase "will enable us to become a more effective competitor on both  transatlantic and domestic routes."  </P> <P> American is fast becoming a vast global airline. It already had routes to Asia  and Europe, and earlier this year purchased Eastern Airlines' Latin American  routes. Recently it greatly expanded its operations to the Caribbean. American  has a fleet of 546 planes and operates 2,400 flights a day to 184 destinations  worldwide. It has 81,000 employees and another 500 planes on order or option.  </P> <P> An American spokesman said the announcement was made so late on Sunday because  the negotiations with the Icahn group "were not completed and signed until the  last minute."  </P> <P> In December, 1989, American had agreed to acquire the Chicago-London route from  TWA but that transaction has yet to be approved by the Transportation  Department. It is not known why it has been held up so long.  </P> <P> In the deal announced Sunday, American said it also will acquire TWA routes  between Heathrow and Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Newark and New York's  Kennedy International Airport. It also gives American Airlines routes between  Gatwick Airport and St. Louis and Baltimore-Washington.  </P></p>

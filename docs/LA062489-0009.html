			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S VETO OF MINIMUM WAGE  </P> <P> Whatever happened to "more gentler times" with all aspects of the  cost-of-living being up and our President vetoes the minimum wage, yet seeks a  tax cut for the higher-income earners?  </P> <P> Perhaps President Bush should spend more time fulfilling his campaign promise  to the American people.  </P> <P> It is deplorable to think that our present minimum wage cannot support a man  who has even one child, not to mention those who have two or more.  </P> <P> How are we to upgrade our influx of immigrants raising children here when they  can hardly feed them, or educate them when the time comes?  </P> <P> Those honest-working people looking for a chance for a better life are reduced  to slave labor. We have opened one door and closed the other door at the very  same time.  </P> <P> KAREN FLOWERS  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

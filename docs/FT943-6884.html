			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Charterers have only themselves to blame Sir, I refer to Charles Batchelor's article, 'Oil companies using older tankers' (August 23). Charterers of crude oil and product tankers have only themselves to blame if charter rates go through the roof over the next two to three years. Blind concentration on the 'bottom line' when negotiating with a surplus tanker constituency has driven shipowners to cut operating and safety standards to the minimum and postpone plans to build a replacement fleet. A widening gap separates the number of very large crude carriers reaching their 20th birthday by 1997 and new VLCC building contracts. Strong demand for large dry bulk carriers is filling up the berths that could be producing tankers, further delaying the date when new oil tonnage will be available. Companies like Exxon should be chartering for period new and modern tankers today not 'over the next two years'. Only this encouragement can fill the gap in availability that will otherwise drive freight rates upwards by several factors. Not that oil companies will lose. They will recoup all and more at the petrol pumps. That there has been no catastrophic oil spill since the Exxon Valdez is more a matter of chance than industry concern about the risks.

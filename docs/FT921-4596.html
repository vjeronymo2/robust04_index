			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Nigeria's case for help NIGERIA'S civilian politicians, preparing for the handover from military rule, should be heaving sighs of relief. General Ibrahim Babangida's decision to bite the bullet and float the naira may have saved a structural adjustment programme which was in serious trouble. A large devaluation would not have been a happy start to Nigeria's return to civilian rule next year. But what the president is up to is, as yet, impossible to decipher: a final thrust for reform; the last flail of a tired leader; or a clever ruse to fool the international financial community? Hope springs eternal, but experience counsels caution. The government's intention, of course, is that floating the naira, and so closing the widening gap between the official and market rates, will lead to an agreement with the IMF and a subsequent rescheduling of Nigeria's Dollars 30bn of external debt. The economic case for such relief is compelling. Nigeria's huge debt burden, with notional debt service payments consuming 60 per cent of export earnings, makes development impossible. The country desperately needs to free resources to invest in its crumbling infrastructure. Yet Nigeria's creditors should be sceptical. The exchange rate crisis reflects the weak government management of the past year. The exchange rate differential has grown because inflation has accelerated to an annual rate upwards of 30 per cent, fuelled by high domestic credit expansion to fund a growing budget deficit as public spending ran out of control. Tough controls There is no point in throwing more resources at Nigeria unless the government can prove that it is serious about reform once more. The exchange rate can only be prevented, when floated, from collapsing if this devaluation is combined with a tight monetary policy and tough controls on public spending. The governor of the central bank last week reaffirmed the federal government's commitment to 'fiscal restraint and public sector rationalisation', with expenditure to be targeted only on 'priority projects that can be satisfactorily completed by the end of 1992'. But promises are not enough. Until they are backed by a precise plan of action, the IMF and the creditors should bide their time. To be specific: are grandiose and economically unviable projects such as the Ajaokuta steel plant and the proposed aluminium smelter to be stopped; or will Nigeria's roads, telephones and schools crumble while oil revenues continue to prop up the politicians' pet projects? Is the fiscal base to be widened so that public spending can be met from taxes rather than by printing money; or will the government continue to subside domestic petrol at the absurd price of US 4 cents a litre, while turning a blind eye to large-scale smuggling of fuel to neighbouring countries and widespread evasion of customs duties? Internal monitoring Only when these questions have been answered satisfactorily should a new IMF agreement be signed. The truth is that the Babangida administration, which started so well when it launched its economic reform programme in 1986, has over the past 12 to 18 months given structural adjustment a bad name. His government must now show that the recent mismanagement and siphoning off of state funds is over. Nigeria desperately needs greater internal monitoring, as well as external scrutiny, of its economic affairs. Only then would Nigeria's creditors have reason to believe that debt relief will speed development and ease the suffering of Nigeria's citizens, rather than be dissipated by politicians. The forthcoming presidential elections may tempt the western creditors to offer a combination of debt reduction, debt rescheduling and new lending to encourage reform. But these should be offered only on the condition that the government can agree to, and keep to, tough conditions laid down in a new IMF agreement. Without fiscal discipline and closer monitoring, Nigeria's structural adjustment will fail, and the current misery of much of the population of Africa's largest, and the world's 13th poorest, country will continue.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: SPECTATORS AT THEIR KIDS' STRUGGLES  </P> <P> This was supposed to have been the most wonderful period of my life.  </P> <P> My grown kids are struggling for survival. All the advice I gave them and they  ignored is coming back to haunt them. They are getting an opportunity to  experience firsthand that man does not live by allowance alone.  </P> <P> So how come I feel so lousy?  </P> <P> All the time they were growing up, their father and I regaled them with  wonderful stories about how broke and deprived we were. We told them how their  father scrubbed post office floors at night to buy my engagement ring. We told  them how we took eight years to pay off a secondhand shag rug and how we were  married for five years before we owned a car. We made them sick they missed the  Depression.  </P> <P> Every time they asked for help, we told them we couldn't possibly deny them the  poverty they so richly deserved because it builds character.  </P> <P> The rhetoric was easy. Sitting by and watching is the hard part. I hate it.  </P> <P> I don't want them to sell velvet pictures from door to door. I don't want them  to buy gasoline $2 at a time. I don't want them to eat cold tacos from a doggy  bag.  </P> <P> I want . . . I want the birth without the pain. I want the pride without the  loneliness. I want the success without the sacrifice.  </P> <P> I want what I have no right to want. I want them to begin where we are ending  without asking or even knowing the price it took to get there.  </P> <P> Instead, I must sit like a spectator and watch the struggle they so desperately  need. For they are finding out things about themselves they have to know to  live out the rest of their lives.  </P> <P> It takes every bit of restraint I have to watch, say nothing, and remember . .  . someone did it for me.  </P></p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Survey of Aluminium (1): Scarcities may return - A deluge of metal from the vast, crumbling smelters of the former Soviet Union has sent western prices tumbling. But producers predict shortages in the west in the mid 1990s because of delays in building new smelting capacity and rising demand from car makers THERE MIGHT be a nasty shortage of aluminium from the mid-1990s onwards, because the industry has been forced to shelve many capacity expansion projects it will urgently need by then. This would be embarrassing for an industry which, though suffering short-term difficulties, is confident it has a bright future. Aluminium's recyclable value and light weight enable producers to promote it as a 'green' metal, a natural for the era in which we live. The industry also anticipates a big surge of demand from car makers, similar to the boost it received in the 1980s when beer and soft drinks producers moved to aluminium cans. Yet, Sumitomo Corporation of Japan, one of the world's biggest metals trading groups, estimated recently that an aluminium shortage might bite as early as 1995. It suggested that by then annual demand for the metal would outpace supply by 1.23m tonnes. Nearly 1m tonnes of new capacity is coming on stream this year and next but 'after that we can find no plans to increase output capacity,' Sumitomo pointed out. Mr Harry Helton, executive vice president, metals and raw materials, at Reynolds Metals, second-largest of the US aluminium groups, calculates the industry needs to build 13 new smelters costing about Dollars 1bn each by the year 2002 if it is to keep pace with the expected demand growth. But the industry is at present delaying work on new smelting capacity and 'this might lead to a very tight supply situation at the end of the 1990s'. He explains: 'We can't go to shareholders and ask for a new smelter until we can see a sustained upswing in the aluminium price.' The industry needs to see a sustained price of 80 cents to 85 cents a lb (Dollars 1,763 to Dollars 1,873 a tonne) before it could reasonably start investing again, he says. Last year aluminium on the London Metal Exchange averaged 59.1 cents a lb and in December the price reached its lowest level ever in real terms. It was then below 50 cents a lb at which point about 75 per cent of western world smelting capacity was operating below its cash cost of production. Half-way through October this year the average price so far in 1992 was only 57.86 cents and again it was dangerously near that all-time low. Plummeting prices have been caused mainly because the western industry has been engulfed by an unstoppable tidal wave of metal from the former Soviet Union. Last year, in its desperate search for foreign earnings, the Commonwealth of Independent States exported more than 1m tonnes of aluminium to the west - equivalent to the output of four modern smelters and a near 7 per cent overnight addition to the western supply of new metal. (During the 1980s the Soviet Union exported between 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes a year to the west.) Without the flood from the CIS the industry could have coped with international recession and would this year have faced only a modest supply surplus caused by stagnating demand. The industry reacted to the CIS flood by shutting western capacity either permanently or temporarily - 995,000 tonnes of it. There were permanent closures last year in Austria, Brazil, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy and Mexico totalling 372,000 tonnes. However, this year 900,000 tonnes of new annual capacity has started up. It could not be held back. Pechiney's new smelter in Dunkirk, France, was rushed into operation as quickly as possible because it has only a limited time to benefit from extremely low power prices from Electricite de France, which has a temporary power surplus. At the Alouette smelter in Quebec, where VAW Aluminium is technical manager, Mr Otto Niederhofer, president of VAW Aluminium Canada, says the consortium which owns the smelter considered holding back because of poor market conditions but this would have been too costly. Mr Bond Evans, president of Alumax which owns the Lauralco smelter in Quebec, says with some irony: 'The timing of Lauralco's start-up is unfortunate but four years ago, when we gave the go-ahead, it was difficult to forecast the failure of Communism and the break-up of the eastern block. Lauralco was a strategic move for the future and we don't look for a payback on any new smelter in less than seven years.' But, wherever possible, the industry has shelved most of its potential smelter projects. Venezuela, the lowest-cost aluminium producer, has suffered most from this trend. Three projects have been shelved, dashing the country's hopes of building its aluminium capacity to 1m tonnes by the end of the century. The industry has been battening down the hatches in other ways. Capital investment has been cut to the bone to save cash until prices improve. But many observers suggest prices will not improve until there are further substantial cuts in output. Mr David Morton, chairman of Alcan, told the US Aluminium Association last month that the industry's short term supply-demand imbalance could last several years if the logical response - taking out high-cost production capacity - was not forthcoming. Calling for immediate action, Mr Stewart Spector, author of the New York-based Spector Report, says: 'It looks as if the aluminium industry could self-destruct if producers take no action to cut production. The world economy for the most part has stalled. Over 900,000 tonnes of new primary aluminium ingot capacity will be fully operational in a few months. Ingot prices are falling. Aluminium producers seem to be on some other planet.' According to Mr Tony Bird, of the UK-based Anthony Bird Associates consultancy organisation, between 1.4m and 2m tonnes of present aluminium capacity do not have a long-term future. Most of these high-cost, 'problem' smelters are in Europe but there are also some in north west US. European executives suggest the situation is more complex than a study of costs would suggest. For example, Mr Jochen Schirner, chairman of VAW Aluminium's management board, admits that 'at present LME prices most smelters should close - but that is ridiculous'. He says that VAW's smelter on the Rhine is sizeable - 211,000 tonnes a year - and its power contract is 'not bad'. VAW's other three smelters are smaller, from 70,000 to 120,000 tonnes, but 'they are all good technically and environmentally. The two in north Germany have power contracts to 1995-96 and within that contract period they will continue.' Although it is fighting to conserve its cash, there is no sense of crisis in the industry as there was in the early 1980s after oil supply shocks sent the cost of energy soaring. As Mr Dag Flaa, chairman of the European Aluminium Association, points out, demand for aluminium last year reached a record 15.13m tonnes, a 3.6 per cent increase on the 1990 level. Ten years ago the industry was using only 80 per cent of capacity. Today the rate is 96 per cent. 'This is again a confirmation of aluminium's strong position and future potential.' The European association expects aluminium demand to resume a 3 per cent annual growth pattern when the recession ends - the same growth rate forecast by Sumitomo when preparing its previously-mentioned estimates for aluminium supply and demand in the mid-1990s. However, Reynolds' Mr Helton used a more-conservative 2 per cent in concluding 13 new smelters are needed by 2002. Aluminium sales are likely to ease back this year a little, particularly as even the weather has conspired against the industry. Unseasonably cool weather in the US cut cold drinks sales there and triggered a 3.9 per cent drop in shipments of aluminium for beverage cans. Aluminium also plays a solid role in building and construction, a market in recession for the past two years. The industry reckons there is still much future demand growth to come from packaging - most of the world has a long way to go to catch up with North America in this respect - and car makers. Recycling makes good commercial sense for the industry. It takes a great deal of energy to produce new aluminium but that energy is 'stored' so that it can take as little as 5 per cent of the original energy to recycle the metal. Also, the capital cost of a plant to re-melt aluminium is only about one tenth the cost of a primary smelter. There have been worries that aluminium's relatively high price and, more importantly, price volatility arising from trading on the London Metal Exchange, might dent its prospects in the automotive industry. However, the aluminium producers believe they have already solved that problem. For example, Mr Yale Brandt, vice chairman of Reynolds, says: 'We have told the auto companies that, if the volume of aluminium they want is high enough, we would make the metal available on a cost-related basis. But we must cover the cost of replacing capacity and other things.' Meanwhile, the industry can't wait to get moving out of recession. According to Mr Allen Born, chairman of Amax, 'the aluminium industry is gathering steam and heading for tighter market conditions in 1994 and 1995. That translates to a solid base of aluminium demand and higher prices for the long term.'</p>

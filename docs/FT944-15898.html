			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Sexual equality and the stockpot - A look at an association formed to promulgate Women Chefs and Restaurateurs The first, fondest and often longest-lasting memories of good food are often associated with women who cook. Perhaps mother's home-cooked lunches, grandmother's teatime baking treats or visits to the kitchen of that vanishing species, the domestic cook. In all cases the image is strong: women provide nourishing, comforting and satisfying food. It is an image that the restaurant industry has failed to perpetuate. Virtually since restaurants came into existence kitchens have been organised on hierarchical lines with limited opportunities for women. It was often argued that women could not lift heavy stockpots and kitchen equipment and needed too much time off to raise families. (There were exceptions. Elizabeth David wrote poetically of the food prepared by Madame Baraterro at the Hotel du Midi, Lamastre, and of the elegant and seemingly effortless cooking of La Mere Brazier, in Lyons.) At last attitudes are changing. The number of women in the restaurant industry has been increasing steadily and America's leading women chefs and restaurateurs have formed an international association to promote their cause. In San Francisco, I met two of the founders, Barbara Tropp, chef/proprietor of China Moon, and Joyce Goldstein, of Square One. Both run restaurants which are highly regarded and well-established. The first point that Tropp and Goldstein wanted to emphasise was that the association was not an antagonistic one. They believe, having run busy, successful restaurants for more than a decade, that the biggest problem the industry faces - staffing - cannot be overcome except by a concerted, more sympathetic, perhaps more intuitive approach. The industry has been expanding rapidly. So how, when working under constant pressure in shifts incompatible with social and family life, can new staff be trained, encouraged and kept? Tropp and Goldstein think restaurants must make themselves more welcoming to young women and make chefs more aware of sexual equality. As an example, Goldstein cited a chef she worked with closely. His cooking could not be faulted but his attitude towards female chefs of equal status was such that he upset the entire brigade, male and female. While the association plans to foster better industrial relations and encourage new recruits it also has a hard, commercial edge. On its board sit several women who have created their own culinary empires in the tough restaurant world: Barbara Lazaroff, who designed the Wolfgang Puck restaurants; Anne Rosenzweig, of Arcadia, New York and Elka Gilmore, chef/proprietor of Elka and Liberte in San Francisco. Potential members on the opposite side of the Atlantic include: Ghislaine Arabian, a Michelin-starred chef at Ledoyen, Paris; Gunn Eriksen of the Altnaharrie Inn, Scotland; and Sonya Kidney, who has made the Marsh Goose in the Cotswolds so successful. The association holds seminars to make prospective female chefs and restaurateurs more aware of the financial problems they will face. Both Goldstein and Tropp confessed to mistakes they hoped others would avoid. 'Next to the restaurant at Square One,' Goldstein explained, 'we used to run a sandwich shop. It was busy all day, fun - everyone enjoyed it. Then after three years I sat down and analysed the figures. I realised that in spite of all the hard work, this shop made nothing. Not a cent. We closed it immediately and converted the area into a larger bar and a private dining area which is more profitable and provides a specific service to our customers.' The initial idea for forming the association came to Tropp in 1991 after she had been invited to join 11 other female chefs to cook at the Lincoln Centre, New York. Although thrilled to be there she vowed that this would be the last time that female chefs would be treated as 'frilly bloomers on a laundry line'. For Tropp, an invaluable insight into the economics of her business came when she was married. 'I realised that my former working life - 12 hours a day, seven days a week - would not be compatible with a lasting marriage. At the time, my restaurant was open lunch and dinner and I decided that the only solution was to close for lunch. This led to a 50 per cent reduction in the payroll but, to my surprise, only a 20 per cent reduction in revenue. And, naturally, it has meant a much more relaxed chef.' Seminars have already borne fruit. In Austin, Texas, recently, 85 women gathered to hear a panel discussion on 'Women, Motivation and Mentors in the Restaurant Industry'. In the audience was a mother and her new baby. The mother, a former pastry chef, had thought of leaving the industry but, armed with information and support from the association, decided to open her own cafe - aided by her mother. Given the international recognition that so many female chefs around the world have earned it is unlikely that future women chefs will be treated as a phenomenon. They are more likely to follow the example of George Lang, proprietor of Cafe des Artistes in Manhattan. Having resuscitated Gundel, Budapest's legendary restaurant, he has now renovated Bagolyvar (Owl's Castle) with Emma Tomos, who was taught to cook by her mother and grandmother, as chef and a staff of 25 women.

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ON PLAYER'S DEATH TELLS A TOUCHING STORY  </P> <P> People touch you in many ways. Mike Downey does it with words.  </P> <P> Had Bobby Satterfield not died, I'd probably never have heard of the substitute  Notre Dame halfback. I read of his passing in the next morning's paper. It was  too bad; not much more.  </P> <P> In Sunday morning's paper, Downey put it in perspective. His story brought  tears. Suddenly I felt the loss of someone . . . and I'm not Irish, Catholic or  black.  </P> <P> It was great human interest. I, too, hope they can win one for Bobby  Satterfield someday.  </P> <P> JACK ISRAEL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental trade calms down ahead of holidays TRADING calmed down ahead of Christmas but the underlying mood remained positive, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT went into the holiday period slightly firmer but activity was subdued. The DAX index, which had earlier seen a day's low of 1,517.63, recovered to close 3.38 higher at 1,526.95. Turnover fell to DM2.7bn from DM4bn. Corporate news was limited to a report that Allianz had taken a 10 per cent stake in Veba: the insurer put on DM5 to DM1,960 and the utility rose 10 pfg to DM361.10. Among the banks, Deutsche rose DM6.70 to DM644.60 and Bayerische Vereinsbank gained DM5.40 to DM419.40. MILAN rose in the wake of Tuesday's cut in interest rates and the Comit index put on 8.91 to 437.87. Turnover was estimated at well below Tuesday's heavy L208bn as dealers were unwilling to open fresh positions ahead of the Christmas holiday. The bourse reopens on Monday. Fiat rose L150 to L3,930 and Montedison was up L51 to L1,133 but traders noted a slight easing in prices of industrial shares after hours. Insurers reinforced the gains made so far this week. Generali rose L1,105 to L28,715. After the close, Consob said that shares in Germany's Commerzbank will be listed on the Milan bourse from Monday. PARIS eased on profit-taking at the close of the December trading account and the CAC 40 index lost 3.26 to 1,821.11 in turnover of FFr2.8bn. Among active stocks, Alcatel eased FFr3 to FFr676 and Suez fell FFr4.30 to FFr250.50. Lyonnaise des Eaux put on FFr14.10 or 3 per cent to FFr482.50. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index improved 1.0 to 106.6 and there were few features in a quiet market. Among major stocks, Nedlloyd and Unilever both gained Fl 1.10 to Fl 30.80 and Fl 191.80 respectively while Elsevier slipped Fl 1 to Fl 120.50. BRUSSELS closed weaker on profit-taking with the Bel-20 index down 5.91 at 1,135.65 in turnover of some BFr754bn. SGB was the day's most active stock, falling BFr50 to BFr1,840 but Cie Maritime Belge gained BFr60 or 4 per cent to BFr1,490 after the European Commission imposed a smaller-than-expected anti-trust fine on the company. ZURICH improved on interest in banks and insurers and the SMI index gained 4.9 to 2,061.4. MADRID lost ground with the general index falling 1.68 to 218.14. Santander lost Pta125 or 2.7 per cent to Pta4,520 on news that it might be prosecuted for tax fraud. STOCKHOLM closed higher but off its intraday highs, and the Affarsvarlden general index put on 2.3 to 916.9. The banking and financial sector bucked the trend by dropping 2.4 per cent on worries about the fresh crisis in the banking sector. Late on Tuesday it emerged that state-owned Nordbanken would need an additional SKr24bn in state support. VIENNA's ATX index rose 12.88 or 1.7 per cent to 752.31. Among actives, OMV improved Sch18 or 3 per cent to Sch620. ISTANBUL improved further with the 75-share index gaining 18.42 to 4,094.02 in turnover of some TL280bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 23                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1071.80    1073.68    1073.90    1074.01 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1156.99    1156.54    1157.70    1158.21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1074.29    1073.74    1073.25    1073.60 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1157.89    1156.79    1154.62    1154.31  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Dec 22    Dec 21    Dec 18    Dec 17    Dec 16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1072.92   1059.21   1050.25   1034.41   1036.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1157.60   1145.44   1136.56   1119.02   1117.67  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1074.74; 200 - 1159.28 Low/day: 100 - 1071.35  200 - 1153.99  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

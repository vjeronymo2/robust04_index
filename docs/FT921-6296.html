			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Letter: Banks pushing debt exposure on to trade creditors Sir, Bad debts suffered by UK banks are much discussed at present, but little comment is directed towards the subtle shifting of the banks' role towards trade creditors. Many businesses are suffering a progressive reduction in borrowing facilities from their bankers, as the poorer results roll in from the recession, and the bankers' confidence evaporates. This is often accompanied by informal advice from the bank to 'lean on your suppliers'. Having no option the business does so, creating a knock-on effect on its hapless trade creditors. The process stops when a supplier with sufficient equity, or adequate bank facilities, is reached in the payment chain. The result? Banks with reduced exposure to 'risky' businesses, and their lending more confined to companies with less risk attaching. The bad debt risk has been shifted to trade creditors which only discover the problem too late to do much about it. If the banks look like having a bad debt problem now, wait for industry's problem in the coming year] It seems wrong that in passing this problem to trade creditors, the banks will not accept a pro rata shift of their security to match.

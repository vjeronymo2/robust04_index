			<p>BFN     [Text] The political council of Russia's Democratic Choice  party led by Yegor Gaydar declared on Monday that it is going to  urge President Boris Yeltsin to dismiss the Director of the  Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey Stepashin, if the  latter refuses to disavow his statement that he is "for the  violation of human rights, if the person in question is a  gangster or a criminal."    The chief of the public relations center of the service  Aleksandr Mikhailov said that when Stepashin spoke of the  violation of human rights at a conference at the office of the  Prosecutor General on June 23 he meant the violation of the  right "to kill, rob and rape" assumed by criminals.    According to Mikhailov, the attitude of Stepashin who was  the  head of a parliamentary committee investigating KGB activities  in 1991 is clear and definite: To combat crime a solid legal  basis should be built and law enforcement bodies should act  accordingly. The head of the PR center said that in implementing  the presidential decree counterintelligence intends to base its  actions on such legal grounds.</p>

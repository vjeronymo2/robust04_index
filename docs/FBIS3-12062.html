			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi] </F>   [Text] U.S. Under Secretary of Trade Jeffrey Garten on 28  March will meet President Itamar Franco and several ministers to  promote the interests of U.S. enterprises, particularly those in  the areas of telecommunications, intellectual property rights,  and supplying equipment for the Sivan/Sipam project for  monitoring the Amazonas -- whose deadline for presentation of  financial proposals by the international community expires on 5  April.    Garten, who will arrive in Brazil on 27 March, on 28 March  will meet Strategic Affairs Secretary Mario Cesar Flores, who  runs the Sivan project; President Franco; the ministers of  industry, commerce, and tourism, and science and technology; and  Jose Arthur Denot Medeiros, Itamaraty's official in charge of  economic affairs.    The objective of Garten's visit -- he also will visit Sao  Paulo to meet entrepreneurs and then will leave for Argentina  and Chile -- is to promote U.S. enterprises' interests within  the framework of the large emerging markets, like those in the  countries he will visit.    Garten's visit will be made after that of U.S. Vice  President  Al Gore, who reiterated to Communications Minister Djalma Moraes  his country's concern over the alleged difficulties that U.S.  telecommunications and informatics enterprises face when trying  to enter the Brazilian market. Garten's visit also will be made  within the framework of a recent exchange of letters between  Science and Technology Minister Jose Israel Vargas and U.S.  Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, who complained about alleged  restrictions in the Brazilian telecommunications market.    Garten recently provoked a diplomatic incident when he made  negative references to Brazil.    The Brazilian Embassy in the United States immediately sent  a  letter to Garten expressing "surprise" over his statements,  because the next day the World Bank announced that "Brazil has  made significant progress in his commercial reform."    Garten recently announced that the United States is  designing  a new commercial strategy aimed at 10 specific developing  countries: Brazil, China, Mexico, Indonesia, India, the Republic  of Korea, Argentina, South Africa, Poland, and Turkey.    According to Garten, the new commercial policy with those  countries, which are grouped under the label of "big emerging  markets," [preceding three words in English] was designed in  proportion to their economies, to their capacity to expand over  neighboring economies, and to their potential for U.S. exports.  Garten recently said that within the next few years, most of the  U.S. commercial expansion will come from the emerging economies,  even if Europe and Japan remain the U.S.' main commercial  partners. U.S. exports to those countries amounted to $102  billion in 1992, one-fourth of U.S. exports.</p>

			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: BAA BAA can afford to observe Dan-Air's struggle for survival from the comfortable position of a near-monopoly supplier. It is unlikely that Dan-Air attracts many passengers who would otherwise not fly, as Laker Airlines did in the 1970s, so there is not much of a threat to overall air traffic volumes. Dan-Air's charter commitments could be met by other carriers, and most would fly from BAA airports. Some scheduled landing slots at Gatwick might remain unfilled - as happened following the collapse of Air Europe - but the busy routes would be snapped up. There is limited risk of a bad debt charge, even if the worst does come to the worst. The loss of Gatwick's second largest customer would dent hopes of developing that airport into a serious hub for scheduled business travel. Gatwick has been losing out to Heathrow since air traffic control restrictions were liberalised last year, as yesterday's traffic figures show. Annual growth at Heathrow is 6 per cent, against 2 per cent at Gatwick. But since charges are higher at Heathrow, why should BAA care? Perhaps because another failure at Gatwick would have a knock-on effect on Stansted, London's third airport, which is still some way from break-even. It looks increasingly as though the Pounds 400m recently invested there will take longer than expected to produce a return.</p>

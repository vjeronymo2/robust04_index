			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 5 KYODO -- A private defense advisory  panel to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will likely present a new  concept for defense buildup, replacing the current concept of  the Cold War period, panel sources said Sunday [5 June].    The nine-member panel, established by Hata's predecessor  Morihiro Hosokawa earlier this year, is scheduled to offer  recommendations to Hata by summer for a revision of the national  defense program outline, which has served as Japan's basic  defense policy since 1976.    A panel member, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said  that the current concept should be changed following the end of  the Cold War era because the concept still assumes large-scale  disputes between the United States and the former Soviet Union.    The group so far has discussed post-Cold War developments  around the world and the military situation surrounding Japan.    The panel is going to present an assessment of international  situations that the world has changed from the U.S.-Soviet  confrontation to a new international order where complex threats  spread.    The sources said that the planned new concept will pledge to  maintain defense capability improvements based on the U.S.-Japan  security pact.    They said the new concept will not aim at specific threats  to  Japan. The new concept will also urge readiness for regional  conflicts, terrorist attacks and cooperation for U.N.  peacekeeping operation, the sources said.    Observers said a new concept will demand a thorough review  of  the current level of Self-Defense Forces strength and formation.    Based on the panel's recommendations, defense policies,  including Japan's future role in U.N.-led peacekeeping  operations, will likely be revised in time for inclusion in the  Defense Agency's budget requests for fiscal 1995.</p>

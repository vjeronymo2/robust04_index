			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister has said that India has suggested  continuation of dialogue with Pakistan to resolve all  outstanding issues, but the continued Pakistan support for  terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir is complicating the process of  establishing good neighborly relations. Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao  made this observation when the visiting foreign minister of  Yemen, Mr. Muhammad Salim Basindwah, called on him in New Delhi  yesterday. The prime minister expressed appreciation for  Yemen's understanding of India's vital concerns.</p>

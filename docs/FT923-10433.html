			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / People: Swiss first to Black Bob Rudi Mueller, UBS executive vice president Europe and chairman and chief executive of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, has wasted no time in hiring the services of outgoing British Steel chairman Sir Robert Scholey (above) who retired after yesterday's agm - at the age of 70 after 47 years in the industry. Sir Robert's appointment as a group adviser comes from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London but he will also be working with the parent bank, Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich. He joins Sir George Blunden, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, who is also an adviser. 'The attraction for us is in his contacts across Continental Europe - in industry, government and the European Commission' says Mueller, suggesting that his role in 'one of the most sensitive industries in the world' has given him a particularly unusual accumulation of experience. Meanwhile Mueller dismisses any suggestion that the arrival of 'Black Bob' - notorious for his tough rationalisations, notably this year the closure of the Ravenscraig steel plant - might unsettle UBS staff. 'I do the Black Bob duty here' says the UBS P &amp; D boss. ***** Brian Kent, who has combined the role of chairman and chief executive of Staveley Industries for the past four years, has appointed Roy Hitchens from BOC to take over as chief executive from October. Kent, who says he was never totally happy combining the two roles, will be 61 years old in September, and intends to remain full-time for just another twelve months, and thereafter function as a non-executive chairman. Currently managing directer of the UK gases division of BOC, Hitchens, 51, has also been involved for 13 years in BOC's international health care division. Kent says that the 'mental map' Hitchens has formed - which also includes experience in process and mechanical services contracting at Matthew Hall and process engineering at GEC - prepares him well for Staveley's three lines of business: minerals, measurement, and mechanical and electrical services. While Staveley reported its first fall (by 13 per cent) in pre-tax profits for nine years during the financial year ending March 31 1992, Kent says the balance sheet is very strong, giving Hitchens six months to get to know the business before deciding on what Staveley's next strategic move is to be. ***** More fresh blood at British Rail. Just a day after announcing that former Rank Xerox (UK) man Iain Livingston is to head its total quality management programme, BR has hired another outsider, Gerald O'Keane, to take charge of the Pounds 1.5bn annual spend on equipment, materials and services. O'Keane, 43, is currently manager of marketing logistics for GE (US) Medical Systems in Paris. He takes over as BR's director of procurement and materials management at a key moment: two weeks ago the corporation announced tough new rules for its 27,000 suppliers, requiring them to achieve specific standards of safety, quality and reliability. ***** Roger Little, md of Waterford Wedgwood Australia, is appointed group sales director and joins the board of WATERFORD WEDGWOOD UK; he succeeds Hugh Gledhill who has retired. ***** David Lovett, president of Blue Circle America Inc, is appointed a director of BLUE CIRCLE INDUSTRIES. ***** Tony Stanworth, personnel director of Superdrug, has been appointed personnel director of B&amp;Q.

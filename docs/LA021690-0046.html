			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Search for Meaning: In John Frame's newest batch of miniature carved comedic  dramas, the soul's search for meaning continues. The small dioramas are  impeccably crafted and the tiny Punchinello-type figures captivating.  </P> <P> Part puppet, part spectral effigy, each effortlessly mimes its part in the  silent theater of Frame's constructions.  </P> <P> But this time around the scenarios and the figures venture outside the safety  of fine craft and Renaissance Italian art into less civilized, more archetypal  ground. Playing off found objects and unmanipulated natural materials, several  figures are left raw, like stick dolls, with only hands or faces developed for  stark contrast. In "My Sebastian/If I Fade," the juxtaposition between the  delicately carved, hole-riddled saint spiked with a woodsman's wedge in his  voice box and the two crude wood spirits haunting the tree branch he's tied to  sets up a fascinating narrative about faith, death and nature's primal forces.  </P> <P> In sharp contrast with Frame's heavy ruminations are Mieke Gelley's delicate,  abstract color field washes that mix printmaking and watercolor on one image.  Technically inviting and sensuously colored, they hint at botanical  associations but don't push the innuendo anywhere. Most interesting are the  blocks of dense color crushed into thin translucent paper. Here the vague  watery blots and spare organic forms seem importantly solid against the  yellowish, rose water atmospheres. (Jan Turner Gallery, 8000 Melrose Ave., to  March 3.) SUVAN GEER  </P></p>

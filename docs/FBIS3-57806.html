			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [First part of a two-part interview with President Suleyman </F> Demirel by Ilnur Cevik and Ismet Imset in Ankara on 21 December]    [Text] Ismet G. Imset: Mr. President, you had a statement  related to the military trials procedure, and this is the item  on Turkey's agenda now. Especially when you were being elected  prime minister and when you were in government, you were talking  continuously of a vocal Turkey, of a transparent Turkey. There  was the Paris Charter and international human rights on Turkey's  agenda then, but it appears now that the priorities of Turkey  have changed in a very serious way. You also have a speech  which is in nature supporting the trial of civilians in military  courts. Is there a change of opinion on these issues?    President Suleyman Demirel: How mistakenly you understand  the issue. Of course, you have the right to understand some  things in the way you like, but to understand this issue in this  way is very wrong. What I said is this: Turkey is a  constitutional state. A constitutional state is not a state you  can create out of your mind every morning. It is a state which  has been created and linked to principles. These principles are  approved by the people. A constitutional state is also a  democratic state. And democracy has no certain model. It is  made up of rules, concepts and institutions. Of course, we  cannot think of a substandard democracy. The issue is something  in which certain rules are protected. Democracy is an  institution which respects, creates and lives human rights,  which guarantees the rights with regard to humans. These are  all written in the Declaration of Human Rights.    There is talk of a judicial state, this is also within  democracy. A judicial state is this: A person cannot be held  responsible for a crime he has not committed. And if someone is  being held as a suspect related to a crime, he is innocent until  a decision is passed that he is guilty. A person cannot be  forced into proving his own guilt. This is something to be done  by he who is alleging the crime.    There are laws in Turkey. Yes, these laws may be in  violation of the Constitution as well. Your Constitution may  not fit as much as you like with the principles of democracy.  Until you can fit your Constitution to democratic principles  and until you can fit your laws to the Constitution, you will  have to abide by them. If you don't, there will be chaos in the  country. You will act according to them. For instance, what  will you do? If you insult military service, this will fall  under Turkish Penal Code Article 155. In other words, insulting  military service is a crime. That is the law. Now, if such a  crime has been committed, what will be done? The Military Penal  Code says the Chief of Staff court has jurisdiction over such  cases. Now you cannot accept that insulting military service is  a requirement of democracy. If you do, you will find no one  supporting you. This is a state. Can a state be without  soldiers? Can a state allow its soldiers to be insulted? The  military administration is different than the soldier. Soldiers  are the most important element of a country. We don't mean  militarism, we mean soldiers, soldiers. No one would allow his  state to be insulted, and no state would allow its soldiers to  be insulted. No state would allow holy things to be insulted.    According to our laws, you cannot insult the prophet or  religion. It is not possible to accept that such (insults) are  democracy. It is chaos.    You may say this: In such a case, the case should be heard  not by a military court but by a civilian court. You can also  struggle for this. It's okay. But since today's law is like  this, you will have to abide by it. If it is at military  courts, there is the issue of military judges. Military justice  in Turkey is a part of the Constitution, and it is clear which  issues military justice has jurisdiction over. Military judges  do not receive directives from the chief of staff or commanders.  In the past we confronted military judges on many occasions and  they acted with conscience. I, as head of the state, am in a  position to evaluate all institutions of the state. What I say  is this: Don't be afraid of military judges, they don't act  according to orders, they act according to whatever justice  requires. This is the issue: Come and if you don't want such  issues to go to military court, say it is enough for them to go  to civilian courts and I will also support this.    This is why I say that what I have said was misunderstood.  Is there any mistake in my views?    Imset: But there is one thing: According to military  judge Sever, who made a statement reported by the ANATOLIA NEWS  AGENCY, no military prosecutor can open an investigation on his  own and to do so, he must receive orders from a supreme  authority within the hierarchical chain. This is how the recent  investigation was launched. In other words, it happened after  direct orders from the chief of staff commander.    Demirel: Just stop there. I want to say this. The justice  minister can tell civilian prosecutors to investigate certain  cases. The justice minister cannot, however, say anything to the  judge. Do you know what a prosecutor is? A prosecutor is the  cog between the state and court. It is the duty of  administrators to tell the prosecutor to do his duty if he is  not doing his duty. But it is not the duty of administrators to  tell the judge what to do.    Imset: I was talking in a more general perspective. We all  know the era in which you were banned from politics, and the  promises you made when you were being elected and after you came  to power as prime minister. We often now refer to the books  containing your remarks for a more open Turkey, a more civilian  country. But in the past three months alone there have been  cases launched with regard to around 60 crimes of opinion.  People are being investigated for writing books or articles.  You were a political leader then with many goals and you are  now the president. It appears to us that the priorities have  seriously changed, that we are moving towards an authoritarian  rule but there is a civilian administration as window dressing.    Demirel: This is so wrong, I am surprised at how you reached  these conclusions. I return to this: Turkey has laws, and  until they are changed you will abide by them. And, in these  laws, there are a lot of things which I don't like and I don't  want or agree with. I am against many articles of this  Constitution including temporary Article 15. But until these  change I have to abide with them. But there is something else  in Turkey: Are the ways to seek one's rights not completely  open in Turkey? They are. And, you may not agree with crimes  which the laws regard as a crime. But if the law sees them as a  crime today, there is nothing else you can do. There have been  changes in the Turkish Penal Code, which appeared as the CMUK  (Judicial Trial Procedures Law). In Parliament there is a legal  reform. There is a press law. There are many things. Whatever  we have said, these have been put into writing and placed in  front of Parliament. It has been two years since we said these.  For six months of these two years, I have been here (the  presidency). Where in the world have democratic reforms been  carried out and completed in one and a half years? I believe  the criticism that Turkey could not adapt itself to the Paris  Charter is a bit merciless.    Ilnur Cevik: But, sir, there is something else. We see that  Turkey has not even been able to catch up with the developments  in East Europe.    Demirel: Come on now, these are empty words, Ilnur. What  couldn't it catch up with? Don't put down Turkey that much.  Just go and see Poland. In Poland someone steals even the  embassy's car which has flags on it. Just go and see Poland.  What couldn't Turkey catch up with? There is no one on its  streets, don't give so much credit to East Europe. You cannot  get anywhere by putting down Turkey every day.    Cevik: You accept that the democracy in Turkey is not a  substandard democracy?    Demirel: Let me tell you the reasons. Is there an elected  Parliament in Turkey?    Cevik: Yes    Demirel: Is the Parliament bench open?    Cevik: Yes.    Demirel: Is there a free judiciary in Turkey.    Cevik: Yes.    Demirel: There is, there is. Of course, there is. Then, is  there a free press in Turkey?    Cevik: err, yes.    Demirel: Don't do that. You are insulting everyone from  morning to night! You are insulting everyone, everyone!  Including even the state. Is there? Yes, there is. Don't  shake your head. There is.    Cevik: Well you say there is... but we don't see it.    Demirel: How can't you see it? You live in it. Is there  anyone who interferes in your newspaper? Is there anyone who  says anything for writing this.    Cevik: But we don't insult anyone.    Demirel: There are those who do. Does anyone interfere with  them? Or does anyone say anything for writing this way or the  other? No.    Cevik: There is, selectively.    Demirel: No there isn't.    Imset: The last OZGUR GUNDEM incident can be shown as an  example. Whatever it writes -- and we have greatly opposed what  it has written -- there have been serious illegalities in the  case against OZGUR GUNDEM. This is, of course, in the nature of  a warning. I don't know where in the world the chief of staff  calls all owners and editors of newspapers, projects articles on  the walls and says don't write things like this? Or teaches  journalists how they should write their stories?    Demirel: Whoever calls you, don't go... If you go, don't  write what they are saying. No one is saying anything to you.  Don't go and don't write what they are doing.    The OZGUR GUNDEM case, on the other hand, is not such a  simple incident. Yesterday, I asked the Istanbul governor for  information on OZGUR GUNDEM. If this place is a newspaper, can  a newspaper have the right to assist an organization which is  carrying out murders in Turkey, sabotage in Turkey? It has  nothing to do with journalism. This is the claim. The claim of  the administration, of the governor and the security center as  well as the prosecutor. What is this? A judiciary state. What  would someone facing an accusation do? He would go and defend  himself.    Imset: And, of course sir, the questions we are reflecting  here are not only the views we share but also the questions  which have surfaced from embassies, mainly Western embassies, we  have spoken to. I believe you too will be receiving reports on  these from your own security offices. The first is that in the  coming two months, there will be certain campaigns with the aim  of cornering Turkey on human rights. Campaigns in America, in  France and elsewhere. In a way, our questions aim at learning  where Turkey is.    Demirel: But you will do great injustice to Turkey. In  other words, ambassadors based in Turkey may say this or that.  But Turkey has its own administration. Turkey is not connected  to them. I am not asking you why you are asking these  questions. But everyone must speak correctly. Tell me what  aspects of democracy exist in other countries which do not exist  in Turkey. Be it England or France, what is there which does  not exist in Turkey? This is what I would ask those  ambassadors. There is nothing there which does not exist here.  The state's governors have their doors open wide, the judges,  the prosecutors, Parliament have their doors open wide. All  doors for complaints are open. All ways to seek rights are  open. What else should the state do?    What is the part which is not liked about Turkey? It is a  judiciary state. What else should we do? We have neither  turned back on democratization nor from our promises. (Demirel  takes out a list of PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] massacres).  Give this list to those who are looking for human rights. On  June 13, 1993, a group of 150-200 bandits attacked military  units in Silopi and six infantry soldiers were killed. Two  officers and 11 soldiers were wounded. On June 29, about  400-500 bandits attacked the Siirt Pervariz, Igneli gendarmerie  station. One petty officer and 11 soldiers were martyred. On  July 2, 1993, a group of bandits attacked the Mardin Dargecit  Celik station, and in the clash, one sergeant and 15 soldiers  were martyred. They are also human beings. Should this happen?  No one is doing anything to these people. Look, I will confront  the world with this piece of paper.    Imset: But Mr. President, in that case it means that no  matter what is said by military and political circles about  measures being taken against terrorism, there is a backlash to  Turkey's anti-terrorism policy, doesn't it?    Demirel: Don't you have anything to say against these  people? Those who carry out the attacks.    Imset: Yes sir. We continuously condemn such attacks.    Demirel: You condemn them but you don't say anything to  those who are carrying them out. I mean, these attacks don't  concern you too much. These are not what you are looking for.  What you are looking for is something abstract: Let there be  democracy in Turkey. There is democracy in Turkey! I tell you,  whatever exists in France exists in Turkey. You take an  isolated case and without going into the isolated case, you  start dressing it up!    Imset: Now, I've got some figures. In 1992, in 12 months,  the number of armed incidents was 1,920 and the number of  civilians killed was 618. In a period of 10 months in 1993  during which announcements were made that the backbone of the  PKK had been broken, there were 3,900 incidents and 1,200  civilians killed. There is an increase of exactly 100 percent.    Demirel: What does this prove?    Imset: That's exactly what I wanted to ask sir. Where does  our policy stand against terrorism? What has Turkey achieved  against terrorism? Where is our success?    Demirel: (Showing a map of "greater Kurdistan.") It is here.  This is the state they want to create. For this they have come  and taken hold of the mountains of Turkey. These are the  mountains. In this piece of land, the state wants to throw them  out. And, between the bandits and state the struggle is  continuing and so many people are dying. What are you  questioning here?    Imset: Exactly the style of struggle sir. For instance, the  Lice incidents...    Demirel: My dear brother, what should the state do? Should  the state say here this is your land and stop the struggle?    Imset: When we take the Lice incident as an example, and you  would remember what happened in Sirnak in August 1992. Now we  are reconstructing Lice because the PKK carried out a brief  attack and security forces later opened fire on Lice--according  to the people and a parliamentary commission--and Lice was  pulled to the ground. Now it is natural for the people to side  with the terrorists. This is our own point of argument, and we  are not saying the state should sit at the same table with the  bandits or terrorists. If, for instance, there are villages or  hamlets which have to be depopulated for the sake of security,  the people should be compensated and shown where they should go.  Or else, they end up on the mountains and/or join the militia  in the cities. And, this is not what we say. This is what we  are told by the commanders and police directors in the region.    Demirel: Instead of telling you this they should tell it to  their superior officers.    Cevik: They cannot tell their superiors sir. Or, even if  they do, it doesn't reach you.    Demirel: Could this happen. What does that mean? Are you  more important than the state that the information does not  reach us? We have all information here.    Cevik: Does this kind of information reach you?    Demirel: Most of this information is wrong. What you are  hearing is wrong. Where did the state pull Lice to the ground?  They shot the state's general in Lice. The soldiers were under  fire from all directions. What should the soldiers do? They  were under fire from all fronts. Your picture does not contain  this side. In other words, should we allow the state's soldier  to be fired upon from all sides?    I created Lice. An earthquake pulled it to the ground and I  made it. Again I have said go and repair the damaged parts.  What should the state do? This is what I don't understand.    The state's general is fired upon but you do nothing. When  three houses are struck in Lice you portray this as  anti-democratic or reason for the people to go on their side.  But a general is martyred and you don't even feel for him.    Imset: Sir, we are especially sorry for the killing of  someone like Bahtiyar pasha, who took a moderate view with  regard to the issue. We are even more sorry that pashas and  other people who have moderate views on the problem are dying.    Demirel: Do you and Ilnur know about this incident in Turkey  while no one else does?    Imset: But we write and we get information...    Cevik: In the past three years or so, the Southeastern  problem has turned into a Southeastern and Eastern problem.  Unfortunately, the PKK has also become effective in the Eastern  provinces as well. What do you think of this?    Demirel: Personally, I do not believe in anything like this.  There is nothing like the Eastern problem. There is the  Southeastern problem and in 10 provinces of the Southeast there  are incidents. The state, as a constitutional solution, has  declared emergency rule in this region and is keeping it in  practice. The state exists in every corner of this land. In  every corner. And, 160,000 soldiers, police and gendarmerie are  here to clean these bandits out of this part of Turkey and to  put justice and a normal regime in force.    Cevik: Under these circumstances, of course elections in  March will easily be held in the Southeast because security will  be maintained.    Demirel: Yes, there is security in the Southeast today.  There is security everywhere. Does the state not have a  prosecutor in Beytussebap? It does. The region you are talking  about is not a liberated zone. Is the state not in Cukurca? It  is.    Cevik: We are not saying the region is liberated zone.    Demirel: You sound like it. Say it or not, I'm saying it's  not a liberated zone. How could it be that the Southeastern  problem became an Eastern and Southeastern problem in three  years? If it had been, the state would have declared emergency  law in Kars, Erzurum, Igdir and Agri. There are many incidents  here. This is a bandit incident. The Turkish Republic is doing  what any state faced with such problems would do. Yes, your  other question.    Cevik: Sir, since the elections can also be held, it means  there is no problem in the Southeast...    Demirel: There is a problem in the Southeast. A problem of  bandits. And the state is trying to overcome this.    Imset: Sir, could you please clarify the bandit problem for  us. For instance, the chief of staff refers to a limited civil  war, the national intelligence talks about a limited uprising.  We are getting various theories from various levels of the  state. Because we are working on this issue, we have also the  chance of seeing some reports and commenting on them.    How do we separate banditry from the others? As far as I'm  aware, banditry is cited in the Turkish Constitution as reason  to declare martial law in Turkey. Is there a link between the  two? In other words are the soldiers, or rather the  hard-liners, especially using this word to later implement the  Constitution. [as published] Official figures say the bandits  number some 10,000 and Ahmet Corekci pasha has a statement that  there are 375,000 sympathizers. When we put all of these  together, how do you describe banditry, terrorism and uprising?    Demirel: We describe it this way: On July 18, 1993 a group  of people--let's call them people, not bandits--who came to the  Islam district Sundurlu field in Bahcesaray, Van, massacred 24  citizens and wounded one citizen. What are these? These are  bandits.    Imset: What I mean is that we use the word banditry but we  are faced with an organized "enemy."    Demirel: On July 7, people who attacked military units in  Catak killed eight soldiers and four village guards. This is  banditry. Leave theory and everything aside. If such activities  are being carried out, the Turkish Constitution says that in the  case of spreading violence and public order being hindered in an  important way, emergency law will be declared.    What else should there be? So much has happened in a year.  The name of this is violence. There is nothing like a civilian  solution or military solution here. Could it be that a  country's constitution has covered everything but the security  of its people and borders?    Imset: Thus comes emergency law and the second step is  martial law...    Demirel: The second step is martial law and the third is  full mobilization.    Imset: This is what concerns us. A position in which we  cannot avoid all of these steps.    Demirel: But this is the state. The state has put these as  measures. If the conditions continue like this and if the state  cannot resolve this issue with emergency rule--which it will--  martial law will come and the other conditions will come as well.</p>

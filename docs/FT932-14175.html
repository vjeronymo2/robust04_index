			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: NationsBank result lifted by one-time benefit NATIONSBANK, the large south-eastern regional banking group formed in 1991 by the merger of C &amp; S Sovran and NCNB, yesterday unveiled a 55 per cent jump in first-quarter 1993 net profits, to Dollars 481m, or Dollars 1.89 a share. The results were inflated by a one-time Dollars 200m benefit stemming from accounting changes. NationsBank, the fourth largest US banking group, disclosed that its non-performing assets totalled Dollars 1.92bn at the end of the first quarter, equivalent to 2.53 per cent of total loans, leases and foreclosed property, and about 29 per cent below the non-performing level a year ago. Bad debt provisions totalled Dollars 1.57bn, down from Dollars 1.66bn a year ago. Provisions taken in the quarter were Dollars 120m, less than half the Dollars 265m taken in the first quarter of 1992. Net interest income was Dollars 1.098bn, up from Dollars 1.012bn a year ago. Non-interest income was Dollars 481m, against Dollars 471m. NationsBank, which owns Panmure Gordon, the UK stockbroker, said its Tier One ratio of capital to assets was 7.61 per cent compared to 7.17 per cent a year ago. Mr Hugh McColl, chairman of NationsBank, said he was particularly encouraged that credit quality improved and the loan portfolio grew in a generally weak economic environment. In New England, Shawmut National, a regional bank, said its net income in the first quarter was Dollars 36.3m, down from Dollars 43.3m a year ago. The bank said this was due to lower securities gains and to charges taken in relation to property loans, branch closures and staff reductions. Banc One, the growing Ohio-based bank, said it agreed to acquire FirsTier Financial, a bank with Dollars 3bn of assets that was based in Omaha, Nebraska. Banc One, which has Dollars 70bn of assets, said it would acquire the Omaha bank in a stock swap valued at Dollars 712m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The appearance of contradictions within the National  Front for Change and Democracy, FNCD, is normal, said  Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul during an interview with the  information service of the Research and Action Center for  Development [Centre de Recherches et d'Actions pour le  Developpment, CRAD]. A copy of this interview reached the  Haitian press agency.    After admitting that there has been a weakening of the front  in the Chamber of Deputies, Paul asserted that dialogue could  resolve the conflicts that have arisen within the front, to  avoid social explosion [corrects himself] sorry, total  explosion. He added that divergences within the FNCD are the  product of circumstance, and could be easily resolved. In his  opinion, the proposal voted as a resolution in the Lower Chamber  must be analyzed and tailored to the stance expressed by  President Aristide, whose views must be taken into account in  order to reach a compromise.    Paul explained that FNCD's stance has not changed since 16  February, when it rejected the appointment of a puppet prime  minister. In conclusion, Paul invites all sectors to express  unity so the solution to the crisis does not come exclusively  from the United Nations or the four countries called, Friends of  Haiti.</p>

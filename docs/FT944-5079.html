			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Modernising India still hobbled by old divide: Mass education and the media have failed to stop a surge in caste-awareness The death of 120 demonstrators demanding Indian government recognition for their caste last month has come as a grim reminder of the grip of caste consciousness on Indian society. The victims, including 30 children, were trampled when about 40,000 protestors from the Gowari caste clashed with police in Nagpur, in the western state of Maharashtra. They had gathered to demand their caste should be added to an ever-growing list of 'economically- and socially-backward communities' entitled to preferential access to government jobs and college places. Because of the tragedy, they got their way: the next day the Maharashtra state government acceded to their demands in an effort to quell the Gowaris' anger. As India struggles to liberalise and modernise its economy, it is paradoxically passing regulations which encourage caste-based social divisions. Neither the growth of mass education, nor the relaying of modern values through radio and satellite television have been able to stop a noticeable upsurge in caste-awareness. The danger is that the government will be distracted by the needs to buy off more and more caste-based communities to the detriment of social peace and economic efficiency. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, has warned that without faster economic growth India could be condemned to divisive arguments about sharing out the pie. The roots of caste in India go back at least 2,000 years. The common explanation is that caste differences deepened when pale-skinned Aryans invaded India from the north and came to dominate darker-skinned local inhabitants, who were pushed south. A hierarchy emerged with brahmins (priests) and kshatriyas (warrior-landowners) at the top followed by vaishyas (merchants) and shudras (craftsmen). This left an underclass of labourers, who later became known as untouchables. Each level is subdivided into thousands of local communities, whose members support each other and tend to inter-marry. Although rapid urbanisation since independence has caused a blurring of caste divides in the cities, they persist even at the English-speaking university-educated pinnacle of society. Every Sunday, the Times of India, like other newspapers, lists hundreds of marriage advertisements arranged by caste, in which among the many attributes required of the ideal bride is 'a wheatish complexion', that is, fair skin. People from backward castes face invidious choices. They can accept their divinely-ordained lot, as most have done for generations. Or they can try to pass themselves off as upper caste in the hope of a good marriage, at the risk of discovery. Or they can do the opposite - exaggerate the degree of their backwardness to secure extra points in the complex and corruption-ridden affirmative action programmes which recognise no less than six different levels of 'backwardness'. 'Backward caste' protests are almost as old as caste itself, particularly in the south, where the low caste people are most numerous, forming up to 75 per cent of the Hindu population compared with a national average of about 52 per cent. Also the early arrival of Christian missionaries in the south helped to promote demands for equality and for positive discrimination. The cause of the 'backward castes' was taken up in earnest by Dr BR Ambedkar, an untouchable who rose to be a minister in independent India's first government. His crusade failed to remove caste prejudice but it did secure a constitutional commitment for 22.5 per cent of government jobs and college places to be reserved for untouchables, the lowest of the low. The quotas have since been expanded beyond the dreams of their original authors, notably in 1990 when the government awarded special treatment to a further 27 per cent of the Hindu population - the so-called 'other backward classes.' Even though the Supreme Court then capped the total reservation at 50 per cent, politicians have bent the rules to win support from lower caste voters. Last year, the southern state of Tamil Nadu set a 69 per cent quota. Neighbouring Karnataka this year went for 73 per cent. At the same time, the lower castes have steadily shed their deference for the ruling Congress (I) party, which has dominated Indian politics since independence, and organised their own parties. They first seized local assemblies in the south in the 1960s in Tamil Nadu and are now making inroads in the north. Their biggest recent success has been in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state and cradle of its politics, where a combine of lower caste parties took power last year. While these political gains have turned individual low caste leaders into well-known figures, they have yet to bring much benefit to their poverty-stricken followers. For example, although the 22.5 per cent quotas for the lowest castes has been in place since the 1950s, the actual share of government jobs is less than 10 per cent. Mr Manuhara Prasad, director of the Ambedkar Foundation, a low caste lobbying organisation, says: 'We are a ritualistic democracy not a real democracy.' So far, no low caste party has succeeded on the national stage. Linguistic and cultural differences limit their appeal. But their local power has undermined support for Congress. So Congress leaders have been forced to strike more and more political deals with lower caste leaders - exchanging tacit support in state elections for similar backing in general elections. This has worked up to a point. But the result has been a sharpening of quarrels over quotas. In a country with a rapidly expanding population and only modest economic growth, that has proved to be dangerous.</p>

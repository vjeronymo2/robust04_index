			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Welcome for Swissair plan to cut jobs and consider merger SWISS stock market analysts have welcomed announcements by Swissair at the weekend that it would eliminate 1,000 jobs, slightly more than 5 per cent of its workforce, by the end of next year, and consider merging with Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) or Austrian Airlines. 'It is a sign that they are really dealing with their structural problems,' said Mr Dominique Bertrand, an analyst at Swiss Bank Corporation. In the view of many, Swissair has too small a national customer base to be a global airline and too big a base to be a niche operator. Its personnel costs, 40 per cent of total costs, are much higher than those of most competitors. The airline has been trying hard to cut costs, even shifting some labour-intensive activities to Bombay. Earlier this year, it made 400 administrative staff in Switzerland redundant. It has also formed alliances with SAS and Austrian Airlines in Europe and with Delta Airlines and Singapore Airlines for intercontinental services in a bid to cut costs by sharing facilities. But Mr Otto Loepfe, the airline's chief executive, said at the weekend that all this was not enough in the current depressed environment. Swissair will suffer a large loss on operations for the third year in a row this year, recording a net profit thanks only to sales of assets, mainly old aircraft. Mr Loepfe said that the airline might merge with SAS and/or Austrian Airlines. 'That is the direction things are going,' he said, although he cautioned that it would not happen quickly. Laws would have to be changed first. Swiss law, for example, requires that roughly 20 per cent of Swissair shares be held by Swiss state bodies. They now hold 20.4 per cent.</p>

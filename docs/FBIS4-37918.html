			<p>BFN     ["Above the Red Line" column by Fawzi Ibrahim: "The Central  Bank and a Balanced Behavior of the Exchange Rate"]    [Text] In their daily transactions, money brokers and  traders  have resorted to a serious course of action that greatly harms  the national economy since the monetary authorities have fixed  the exchange rate of foreign currencies, particularly the  exchange rate of the U.S. dollar. The dollar's exchange rate  was set at 445 dinars against the dollar at licensed currency  shops and companies and at 425 dinars at government and private  banks. Thus, all transactions are carried out on the basis of  this rate of exchange. But, what actually takes place has  nothing to do with this exchange rate as the money brokers and  traders continue to devise ways and methods to harm the national  economy. The money brokers are adopting rates of exchange that  exceed the fixed rates by 10 to 25 percent. This shows how  harmful this is to national economy. The monetary authorities  will be unable to readjust the declared rates of exchange with  the actual rate the money dealers adopt. To be able to carry  out such a readjustment, the monetary authorities are called  upon to either float or rectify the rate of exchange. Such a  step will enable the rate of exchange to be controlled. This  will also ensure that many of those who were dealing with money  brokers in the licensed or unlicensed currency shops and  companies will now deal with the government and private banks.  It is impossible to have different rates of exchange. The best  rate of exchange is always offered by the private sector banks.  This will make many of those who deal with currency or those  who transfer their foreign currency savings go to private  currency shops instead of the banks as the difference will be  great and may reach 50 dinar for every dollar. Such a decision  will further stabilize the money market and will benefit the  national economy instead of benefiting the many clandestine and  unlicensed currency shops and companies whose number exceeds by  far that of licensed ones. At the same time, such a decision  will make it possible to account for the transactions in the  money markets for budget and taxation purposes, it will check  any sharp drop of the rate of exchange in the parallel markets,  and it will establish a sound behavior pattern for the rate of  exchange that will be in line with the economic circumstances.  Restrictions and too many regulations sometimes have a negative  impact on the national economy. This is what actually takes  place in the money market, in addition to the factors from  outside. Many hostile parties outside Iraq resort to means and  methods to influence the money brokers and traders. This  actually took place. Some Kurdish agents resorted to tempting  means to influence the exchange rate. Unfortunately, some of the  money brokers and speculators fell under the spell of these  gangs, which are hostile to the homeland and the people and  which seek to harm the economy. They have renounced their  patriotism and ethics and have become hirelings who implement  enemy schemes to harm the national economy and exhaust its  resources to have the Iraqi people suffer from the embargo and  dampen their morale. The executive authorities cannot remain a  bystander and apply a laissez-faire doctrine. No one accepts  such a doctrine.</p>

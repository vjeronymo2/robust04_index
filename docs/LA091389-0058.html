			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS RETAIN MILK PANEL DESPITE CONFLICT CHARGES  </P> <P> Los Angeles County's obscure Milk Commission will remain in business, despite  charges that it is a captive of the lone company it regulates, the Board of  Supervisors decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> Supervisors rejected a recommendation by the county's chief administrative  officer to do away with the commission, whose sole mission is to oversee the  production, distribution and sale of raw milk.  </P> <P> Chief Administrative Officer Richard B. Dixon recommended that the state, which  regulates pasteurized milk, take over the commission's duties. He complained  that the six-member commission relies exclusively on the lone company it  regulates -- Stueve Brothers Farms -- for financial support and warned that  such a cozy relationship compromises the panel.  </P> <P> A Stueve Brothers spokesman said the dairy pays between $30,000 and $50,000 a  year to support the commission's activities. Most of that money goes for  testing but there is no requirement for public disclosure of exactly how funds  are spent, Dixon said.  </P> <P> Also, commission members receive $25 a meeting, paid by Stueve Brothers.  </P> <P> Last May, Dixon was ordered to look into the commission after a Bay Area judge,  in an unrelated case, called the county commission a "captive" of the dairy.  </P> <P> Dixon also questioned whether Los Angeles County should, through a quirk in  state law, continue to regulate a dairy that is located in San Bernardino  County and monitor raw milk that is sold statewide.  </P> <P> The commission was created in 1968 when raw milk dairies were located in Los  Angeles County.  </P> <P> Stueve Brothers Farms claims to be the state's largest raw milk dairy,  producing 8,000 to 10,000 gallons per day.  </P> <P> "There are presently no established rules or regulations governing operations  of the commission, or the manner by which the members are to be compensated,"  Dixon said.  </P> <P> But Supervisor Pete Schabarum argued, "To have someone insinuate that for $25  they're in the hip pocket of the dairy is absolutely ridiculous."  </P> <P> The supervisors' vote came after a personal appeal from 71-year-old Harold  Stueve, owner of the dairy, who warned that a state takeover of the  commission's duties would bring an end to raw milk sales in California.  </P> <P> Supervisor Mike Antonovich expressed similar concerns, saying that consumers'  "freedom of choice" was at issue.  </P> <P> In a related matter, the board deadlocked 2 to 2 on a recommendation by Dixon  to ask the state Fair Political Practices Commission to look into Milk  Commission Chairman Paul M. Fleiss' work as a paid consultant to an attorney  for the raw milk producer. The matter will be decided when Supervisor Kenneth  Hahn, who has been ill, resumes his board duties.  </P> <P> The board nonetheless ordered the chief administrative officer to draft  standards for the operation of the commission.  </P></p>

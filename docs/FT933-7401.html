			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Program buying lifts blue-chip stocks Wall Street AFTER TRADING most of the day in negative territory, a burst of late program buying allowed blue-chip stocks to end at new highs yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.35 at 3,615.48. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended down 0.44 at 455.99, while the Amex composite finished up 0.74 at 448.70, and the Nasdaq composite up 0.47 at 730.95. Trading volume on the NYSE was 277m. After three consecutive days of record-breaking gains, the Dow took a breather, opening lower across the board in light trading. Dealers attributed the early declines to profit-taking, and to selling related to the monthly expiration of stock index options. Sentiment was also undermined by the behaviour of the bond market. Treasury prices, which rose steadily all week, pushing yields to new historic lows in the process, reversed course yesterday. However, stocks rebounded late in the day as more options-related trading, this time program buying, helped the market end on a firm note. Stocks that had been in demand mid-week ran into profit-taking - Philip Morris fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 50 1/4 , Coca-Cola slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 43 1/2 , Pepsico fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 1/8 , and American Brands dropped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 32 5/8 . Selected pharmaceutical stocks suffered a similar fate, but other were in strong demand. Bristol-Myers Squibb fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 56 3/8 , and Merck eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 32 3/4 , while Pfizer added Dollars 1 at Dollars 64 1/8 and Johnson &amp; Johnson firmed Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 41. General Electric rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 98 5/8 in volume of 1.5m shares after confirming that it will shed more than 4,000 jobs. Fisher-Price soared Dollars 9 3/8 to Dollars 33 in reaction to Thursday's late announcement that it is being taken over by Mattel in a Dollars 1.1bn stock swap. The news left Mattel up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 27 1/8 . Hasbro, which now has a rival of comparable size in the toy industry, fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 . Dr Pepper/Seven-Up jumped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 19 after Cadbury Schweppes, the UK confectionery and soft drinks group, bought Prudential Insurance's stake for Dollars 231.3m, upping its stake in the US soft-drinks group from 5.7 per cent to 25.9 per cent. Cadbury ADRs, traded on the Nasdaq market, fell Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 29 3/4. Elsewhere on the Nasdaq, leading technology stocks were mostly firmer. Borland International rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19, Microsoft added Dollars 2 at Dollars 76 1/4, Dell Computer firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 19 1/2 and Apple Computer rose Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 28. Canada TORONTO posted a small gain in moderate trading. According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index gained 7.59 points to 4,077.18, up 63 points on the week. Advances led declines 409 to 328, trading volume was 52.444m shares and trading value was CDollars 523.6m.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER;  </P> <P> 'FORUM' OFFERS VISION OF A 'NEW VAUDEVILLE' OF '90S  </P> <P> Des McAnuff gets a laugh out of his own assertion that the revival of "A Funny  Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," which begins Friday at the Orange  County Performing Arts Center for 13 performances, represents the "new  vaudeville" of the '90s.  </P> <P> A case could be made for the idea, he said, relaxing one morning last week in  faded jeans and an orange T-shirt at the La Jolla Playhouse office behind the  Mandell Weiss Theatre, where the acclaimed revival has just ended a six-week  run.  </P> <P> But McAnuff -- who staged the production and who is the artistic director of  the Playhouse -- would rather not take the idea too far, considering how  pretentious it might sound.  </P> <P> After all, how could he describe the new vaudeville? As post-modern shtick? The  mere phrase seems ridiculous -- not unlike the term "comedic kinetics," which  the show's slapstick and clown coach, Jeff Gordon, has applied in jest to the  circus-style antics that he developed for this "Forum."  </P> <P> "We borrowed shtick freely," said McAnuff, "from Gleason, from Berle, from  Belushi. There are a lot of influences. The new vaudevillians plug into all the  old burlesque. Some of the shtick goes back to the Borscht Belt and some of it  goes all the way back to Plautus, including jokes."  </P> <P> Still, this production has an unabashed physical exuberance emblematic of the  new vaudeville that never appeared in any of "Forum's" previous revivals on or  off Broadway. Pratfalls, for instance, are turned into pitfalls. In fact, the  acrobatic use of the orchestra pit has become a signature of sorts,  demonstrating the length to which McAnuff and his cohorts will go for a gag.  </P> <P> Nor does their showmanship end there. In his ambition to resurrect and  re-examine what he calls "an American musical classic," McAnuff has revamped  everything from the orchestrations to the choreography, while also revising  entire song-and-dance numbers.  </P> <P> That takes chutzpah -- even for someone with McAnuff's record, which includes  developing "Big River" at La Jolla and winning a Tony Award for directing it on  Broadway in 1985.  </P> <P> The original "Forum" did just fine in George Abbott's 1962 staging. It ran for  967 performances and won six Tony Awards, including best musical. Why fix what  wasn't broken?  </P> <P> Besides, "Forum" isn't simply any old hit farce written by Burt Shevelove and  Larry Gelbart. It happens to be the first show for which Steven Sondheim, the  reigning genius of today's musical stage, wrote both the score and lyrics.  </P> <P> "I planned to have it reorchestrated right from the beginning," McAnuff said,  "because if you don't you are more or less forced to ape the original. I wanted  to start fresh. I didn't want to be stuck with choices that were already made  for me.  </P> <P> "The first thing I did was call Steven and tell him I was going to do this. I  asked if he had any objections to my having new orchestrations done. And he  said no. Actually, he seemed to be delighted."  </P> <P> Bruce Coughlin's new orchestrations -- not to be confused with new arrangements  -- entailed the creation of "three to four times more incidental music" than  originally used, McAnuff explained. It not only meant feeding in thematic  elements from the songs to cover changes in the action, it also meant melding  differences between the music for the original production and the major  Broadway revival of 1972.  </P> <P> In one instance, the new orchestration restored a full song-and-dance variation  of "The House of Marcus Lycus," which had been used by Abbott simply as a dance  break. In another instance, "The Echo Song" -- intended for Abbott's original  production but never staged -- was put back in and its replacement ("That'll  Show 'Em") taken out.  </P> <P> Despite such meticulous efforts, and capital costs of nearly $600,000 by  McAnuff's rough estimate, neither the La Jolla Playhouse nor the Center --  which is co-financing the revival as an equal partner -- expects this "Forum"  to tour beyond their two venues.  </P> <P> "We said from the beginning we were going to take it to (the Center in) Costa  Mesa and that was all," McAnuff noted. "There has been interest in the show,  but I really have no idea whether anything will happen. The producers who are  most likely to do something with it haven't come to see it yet.  </P> <P> "If anything does happen, it would have to be a remount. And I doubt that any  tour would go out immediately after Orange County. Frankly, my biggest ambition  with this piece would be to put it on tape or film at the Center. But I don't  think that will be done."  </P> <P> The urge to document the revival goes back to the 1966 "Forum" movie starring  Zero Mostel, who also starred in the Broadway original. That dull Hollywood  version essentially ruined the show for a whole generation of theatergoers,  McAnuff contended. So he hopes this "Forum" will serve at least as a local  corrective.  </P> <P> Indeed, McAnuff has no doubt that the combination of Sondheim's most accessible  score and the Plautus-based story -- involving several farcical Roman  characters but chiefly a slave trying to obtain his freedom -- places "Forum"  among "the 10 best book musicals of the American theater." His other picks  include "My Fair Lady" and "Guys and Dolls," ("the two greatest"), "Sweeny  Todd" and "West Side Story" ("even with its flawed book"), "A Chorus Line"  ("the only dance musical to survive as dramatic literature") and "Oklahoma"  ("not a personal favorite").  </P> <P> As for the so-called spectacle shows of the '80s -- such as "Cats," "The  Phantom of the Opera" and all the British musicals -- McAnuff is less  impressed. "I think the jury is still out on them," he said. "I don't think  'Les Miz' has a terribly strong score, for instance, though I do think Trevor  Nunn's staging is brilliant."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he maintains that the basic problem with the current musical theater  is not a lack of material but "not enough places to develop it." And not enough  people with the know-how.  </P> <P> "There are maybe a few people around," he said. "It's just not like the old  days in New York when you had all these guys working within eight blocks of  each other near 42nd Street. Everybody was there -- orchestrators, copyists, a  whole industry."  </P> <P> Like everyone else, McAnuff points to the exorbitant costs of mounting musicals  as a major reason for the decline. But he also notes that a change in popular  musical taste -- specifically the arrival of rock 'n' roll during the '50s --  was crucial as well. "Until that time Broadway and pop music were the same  thing," he said. "Then the split took place, and it has never been bridged."  </P> <P> Some small steps toward closing the gap have been taken with the Eurorock  musical, he believes, but "theater people are snobbish about welcoming rockers  in, as if there's some mystique about writing theater music."  </P> <P> In any case, top-draw rock musicians are not beating on the doors for entry,  although McAnuff does get occasional calls from their agents. Between records  and concerts, rockers have more lucrative outlets for their work than the  theater.  </P> <P>  "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" opens Friday at 8 p.m. and  continues through Aug. 26 at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town  Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $16 to $38. Information: (714) 556-2787.  </P> <P> </P></p>

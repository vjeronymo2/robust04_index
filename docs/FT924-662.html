			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Heseltine rebuffs pit restart calls MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, rebuffed calls yesterday for mining to resume at 10 coal mines facing immediate shutdown - in spite of the High Court ruling this week that the closure plan had been carried out unlawfully. He said the court had been concerned about the 'independence of the consultation process that is under way'. British Coal, which is considering whether to appeal against the judgment, said there was no requirement to resume production at the 10 pits. Mr Heseltine's embarrassment continued as backbench Conservative MPs made clear that the government could not afford further mishaps in its energy review, on which the future of 31 pits depends. Sir Rhodes Boyson, Tory MP for Brent North, said: 'The government's reaction to the High Court judgment on the closure-threatened pits must centre on the need, at a time of heavy and increasing unemployment, to save all viable mining jobs.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, joined Labour calls for the trade and industry secretary's resignation, saying that the court ruling went to the heart of Mr Major's approach to government. 'After 14 years in power, the Conservatives are perverting the very system which made their power possible,' Mr Ashdown said. Labour, which is pressing for the 10 pits facing immediate closure to be included in the government review, said it was winning the battle for public support. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, delivered to Downing Street a 600,000-name petition calling for the pit closure programme to be reversed. British Coal said it was considering how to comply with a High Court requirement that greater independence be given to the procedures for assessing pits before shutdown. It said 5,460 miners had applied for redundancy since October 13, receiving average compensation of Pounds 25,000 each. But the redundancy rate is slowing, and unions hope this week's ruling will stop it altogether. Mr Mark Stephens, solicitor for the National Union of Mineworkers, said Mr Heseltine had 'made a fatal mistake by his incredibly high-handed behaviour'. His refusal to allow mining to resume at the 10 most threatened pits was 'close to contempt of court'. The 113 miners at Betws colliery, south Wales, the only one of the 10 still producing coal, will today work their final shift before the holiday break, but now hope to resume work in the new year. Mr Mike Reynolds, NUM lodge secretary, said the High Court decision had given the colliery 'a further breathing space to prove this is a viable pit'.</p>

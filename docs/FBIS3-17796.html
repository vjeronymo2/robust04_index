Speaking before the  newly elected parliament Tuesday, he said society expected the  new legislature to ensure further development and strengthening  of the state in the interests of all its citizens, regardless of  their origin or faith.    Snegur pointed out that various political forces had  appeared  on Moldova's political scene after the collapse of totalitarian  rule. At the moment, they are divided into supporters of  strengthening Moldova's statehood and independence, supporters  of the unification with Romania and supporters of the republic's  return to a reborn empire.    In the meantime, the Moldovan people firmly supported  Moldova's development as an independent democratic state at the  sociological poll on 6 March, Snegur said. The outcomes of the  poll must be law for everyone, he said pointing out that "a  state cannot be built on the basis of an idea which splits and  polarizes society."    Snegur pointed to the top priority of such goals as the  adoption of a new constitution, preservation of Moldova's  territorial integrity, resolution of the issues of Transdniester  and Gagauz-populated areas, democratization of society and  enhancing economic reforms.    Snegur also proposed a special law be adopted against  insulting Moldova as a state.</p>

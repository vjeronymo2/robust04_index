			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / The Palestinian Economy: Lure of contracting bonanza - Westerners jockey for position THE occupied territories may seem an unpromising location for western companies to expect the beginnings of a Middle East contracting bonanza. Yet that is the gleam in the eye of a number of western and Israeli businessmen. It is certainly the outlook of those prepared to take a long view, not just of the prospects for engineering and construction contracts in the territories but also of the wider regional opportunities that may follow. The immediate focus of attention is the programme in the West Bank and Gaza being prepared by the World Bank in consultation with Israel, the Palestinians and potential Arab and western donor countries. According to a confidential draft report by the Bank, this should involve a Dollars 1.35bn (Pounds 870m) public works programme over the next five years. If its assumptions are correct, the Palestinian authority expected to take over initially in Gaza and Jericho will soon be offering opportunities to international contractors in road-building (the Bank estimates Dollars 330m is needed up to 1998), power (Dollars 350m) and water and sewage treatment (Dollars 280m). When the period of interim self-rule is up, there will be potential for more ambitious schemes such as upgrading power generation for the territories (Dollars 600m), possibly along with moves to integrate the regional electricity grid. Among western governments and companies - especially European ones - the jockeying for commercial advantage has already begun. Western governments have agreed to work on feasibility studies for projects in particular sectors and these sometimes coincide with a search for commercial spinoffs. Italy is working on ground water and waste disposal projects that could yield business for its engineering concerns; France is pursuing the transport sector, with an eye to road and rail projects for its hungry construction and railway companies such as Alsthom Atlantique. This pattern - whereby western countries contribute expertise in exchange for contracts - will almost certainly continue as wider regional opportunities open up. The World Bank, Middle Eastern governments, and Arab and Israeli businessmen have in recent months been working up a more far-reaching blueprint for regional co-operation which could eventually revolutionise prospects for business in the Levant. At its most ambitious, this could involve projects which still seem to belong in the realm of fantasy, such as a canal jointly run by Israel and Jordan linking the Red Sea with the (lower-altitude) Dead Sea and generating hydroelectric power to run a giant water desalination plant. Discussed at the multilateral talks Jordan is so keen for a new source of water that it wants to get on with it even before a peace deal with Israel is signed. Whether or not it stands a chance of becoming reality, western companies are beginning to factor the broad possibilities into their equations. In many cases, their initial jumping-off point is Israel, already undergoing something of an infrastructure boom. The Jewish state will in any case be linked to the Palestinian entity in a free trade zone if the World Bank and other donors have their way, so it too stands to benefit from an upswing in activity in the West Bank and Gaza. The Israeli government is dangling the prospect of business in the territories and in Israel as a carrot to lure European and other countries into providing financial support. During his Brussels meeting last week with Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, foreign minister Shimon Peres suggested that EC member states might care to encourage their companies to invest in or trade with the region by providing them with generous credit guarantees. In Tel Aviv, the Israeli Federation of Chambers of Commerce is receiving unprecedented international attention, as companies hitherto deterred by the secondary Arab boycott - which seeks to penalise those who do business with Israel - scout for opportunities. Two months ago, it hosted the first ever delegation to Israel from the Keidanren business organisation of Japan, whose companies have long shunned Israel. Mr Dan Gillerman, the federation's ebullient president, points to other straws in the wind: French companies are actively pursuing a contract to build a new railway between Eilat and Tel Aviv, a link that could eventually become the nucleus of a bigger regional railway between Riyadh and Damascus; Siemens of Germany is looking into the potential for linking regional electricity grids - a lucrative project that would also save Israel and its neighbours billions of dollars by eliminating waste; Mr Gillerman has been discreetly extending his tentacles into the Arab world, meeting regularly with Palestinian and Gulf Arab businessmen. His goal: to create a private sector 'Middle East fund', a consortium of Arab, Israeli and other financial institutions that would provide seed money for infrastructure projects such as toll roads.</p>

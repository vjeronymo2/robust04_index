			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The breakaway white-supremacist wing of South Africa's Afrikaners has  fragmented further with the formation of a neo-fascist movement to fight for a  white homeland. The Afrikaner Liberation Movement was founded in Pretoria by  three disaffected leaders and about 100 former members of Eugene Terre  Blanche's paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance Movement. The founders, who  recently failed to oust Terre Blanche, said they will "liberate the Afrikaner  nation from foreign domination through the creation of a separate homeland."  The group is the latest in a string of far-right organizations that oppose  President Pieter W. Botha's limited reforms of apartheid.  </P></p>

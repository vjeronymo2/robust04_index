			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Late surge by shoppers dispels sluggish mood Shoppers have been out on the high streets and in the retail centres with growing enthusiasm over the last two weeks, in contrast to predictions of gloomy Christmas trading. The pattern has varied but the evidence points to what Mr George McDonald, manager of the Eldon Square shopping centre in Newcastle, called 'a late thrust'. Yesterday afternoon he said that the number of shoppers was rising: 'It's stronger at this point than in the last two or three days and it's still building.' In London Mr David Elliott, merchandise director at Selfridges department store, said: 'We have had a brilliant Thursday and a brilliant week.' At Brent Cross in north London, Mrs Mary Cullen, the marketing manager, said: 'We would normally see around 250,000 people a week but this week there have been 300,000 to 400,000.' Transax, which provides a cheque guarantee service to 48,000 UK retailers, has noted the build-up. In the four weeks to last weekend, the value of cheques it guaranteed was 2.8 per cent higher than in 1993, this week the value has been growing at 3 per cent a day. Steady increases in business have been particularly marked at the newer regional shopping centres. At Meadowhall in Sheffield the number of visitors rose 14.7 per cent between mid-September and mid-December, while last Saturday was a record day. The number of visitors at Merry Hill in the west Midlands during the Christmas trading period has been 5 per cent higher than in 1993 and they have spent 14 per cent more. At MetroCentre, Gateshead, there has been a 15 per cent rise in the number of visitors. Smaller centres also claimed to have bucked the sluggish trade trend. 'We have found it an exceptional Christmas with most retailers trading up to 30 per cent better than last year,' said Mr Colin Antrobus, manager of the Regent Arcade in Cheltenham. People were waiting two hours to see Father Christmas. In Manchester, city centre trading has been less dramatic. At the Arndale centre there have been 8 per cent more shoppers than last year but retailers are cautious about whether turnover is level or a little higher. Sunday trading provided cheering news. Ms Jackie Prosser, marketing manager at the Arndale, said: 'There has definitely been more business, not a thinner spread of what was there already.' Ms Lesley March, marketing manager at Merry Hill, said: 'Sunday trading has been brilliant for us. There's never been a bad weekend.' She added that Sunday trading now accounted for 16 per cent of turnover. Reporting by Paul Cheeseright, Roland Adburgham, Neil Buckley, Stewart Dalby, Ian Hamilton Fazey and Chris Tighe.

			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Poles find trade figures add up to a debt puzzle A CONTROVERSY over the real state of Poland's trade has underlined the problems of making economic decisions on the basis of doubtful and often contradictory statistics. Questions were raised last week when the Foreign Trade Ministry issued figures, based on customs data, which pointed to a Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) deficit last year. These contradicted earlier figures, collated by the National Bank and seized on by the government as proof of Poland's strong economic performance, which showed a surplus of Dollars 512m. The trade ministry's figures, published by the central statistical office, valued exports at Dollars 12.9bn, or Dollars 1.1bn less than the central bank. Imports at Dollars 15.5bn were Dollars 2bn lower than the National Bank stated. The two sets of figures are always slightly different, as the central bank charts actual trade payments worth over Dollars 10,000 made through 38 banks, while the statistical office reports on physical movement of goods across frontiers, paid in cash or on credit. But the discrepancy this time is so large as to raise doubts about Poland's capacity to run a trade surplus large enough to meet its foreign debt service obligations, which rise sharply from 1994. This week Mr Andrzej Topinski, a former deputy head of the central bank, sought to limit the damage by arguing that the trade ministry's figures reflected problems with managing a new customs form rather than actual trade. To complicate matters further, statistics from the OECD countries, which now account for nearly two thirds of Poland's foreign trade, show a Dollars 1bn deficit in the first eight months of last year. Figures for trade with the European Community show a Dollars 600m Polish deficit with the Twelve for the first nine months.</p>

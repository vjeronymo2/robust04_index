Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 5 (CNA) -- Reports that Beijing is  planning to establish special investment areas along the coast  of Mainland China exclusively for Taiwan investors have drawn  mixed reactions here.    Vice Economic Affairs Minister Chang Shih-chien said  Saturday  [5 March] that the government hopes the project is a success,  but he expressed his doubts that the project would be completed  given the current economic capability of Mainland China.    Yang stressed that the Taipei Government's policy toward the  mainland will not be affected by any moves Beijing will take,  saying trade ties across the Taiwan Strait are currently  regulated by the National Unification Guidelines and the  statutes governing relations between peoples of the Taiwan area  and the mainland area.    Under both laws, Taiwan investors are currently prohibited  from making direct investments in Mainland China. Unofficial  statistics, however, show that Taiwan investors have channeled  more than US$10 billion into the mainland.    Richard Wu, president of the Council for Industrial and  Commercial Development, hailed the Beijing proposal as a  goodwill response to increasing mainland investments by Taiwan  manufacturers.    The establishment of such investment areas should help win  tax incentives for Taiwan investors, Wu noted.    Huang Nan-tu, president of the Wei Chuan Group, warned  domestic manufacturers to beware of any hidden political  intentions, but also admitted that the proposed investment zones  would benefit Taiwan investors.    The planned special investment areas are expected to have  better factory infrastructure than the mainland's existing  plants, many of which lack peripheral facilities including power  supplies and means of transportation, Huang said.    Domestic investors, however, should take into account their  different needs and make cautious assessments before deciding to  enter into the special investment areas, he pointed out.    Moreover, he stressed, Taiwan investors must pay attention  to  Beijing's political intentions in such an initiative.    The Hong Kong-based WEN WEI PO on Friday cited Beijing  sources as reporting that the mainland will give the green light  in the near future to the establishment of several Taiwan  traders' investment areas on the mainland's coastal region in a  new bid to attract more investments from Taiwan.    The sources said the plan is consistent with calls by  paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to boost Cross-Strait trade  exchanges and help curb calls for Taiwan independence, the  newspaper reported.</p>

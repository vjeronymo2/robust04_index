			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Norway plans big budget deficit NORWAY'S minority Labour government yesterday unveiled a draft 1993 budget proposing a record NKr49.2bn (Pounds 5bn) deficit. The budget relies heavily on oil revenues to finance the welfare state, despite a shaky outlook for the economy. The deficit is NKr8bn greater than last year. The budget includes cuts in some price subsidies, saving NKr730m; and defence cuts of NKr540m. Overall spending in 1993 would rise 5.4 per cent to NKr371bn while income rises 3.5 per cent to NKr322bn. Norway's net borrowing requirement will rise to NKr58bn in 1993 from a forecast NKr41bn in 1992. The government is proposing to cut the dividend paid by Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, to NKr1.25bn in 1993 from NKr1.4bn set for 1992. Daily average oil and gas production is forecast to rise sharply to 2.3m barrels in 1996 from 1.9m in 1991. The increased output will boost revenue from the petroleum sector by 14.4 per cent, or NKr4.25bn to NKr33.82bn in 1993, based on an oil price of NKr127 a barrel. Economic growth is put at only 1.5 per cent in 1993, compared with an estimated 2.5 per cent this year. The budget was criticised for lacking measures to stimulate growth.</p>

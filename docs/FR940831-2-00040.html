The letter sets forth interim policies regarding two contract clauses that are prescribed by the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation. The letter sets forth a statement of policy with regard to the terms of engagement that should be a condition of any authorization to a current or former management and operating contractor to engage a law firm to defend a lawsuit. The letter also sets forth policies for a contracting officer's consideration in determining whether particular litigation costs are reasonable and therefore allowable.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The effective dates are set forth in the interim Acquisition Letter.

In connection with these facilities, there is a substantial amount of litigation against which the Department may elect to defend itself or authorize the contractor to defend. The standard provisions of management and operating contracts allow contracting officers to authorize contractors to engage lawyers to defend lawsuits, subject to such conditions as the contracting officers deem appropriate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  48 CFR 970.5204&hyph;31. The standard provisions of management and operating contracts also authorize contracting officers to determine whether the costs charged are reasonable and therefore allowable when allocable to contract work.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  48 CFR 970.5204&hyph;13.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recently, the Department has experienced unacceptably high litigation costs from management and operating contractors in connection with the defense of lawsuits where the Department has elected to have the contractor engage lawyers to conduct the litigation. Moreover, contracting officers dealing with these costs have differed in their approaches to determining whether a litigation cost is reasonable. The Department has an urgent need to provide for a more uniform approach by contracting officers to such costs and to stem payment of unreasonable expenses. This need is particularly compelling in light of the substantial dollar amounts at stake and the Department's budgetary situation. In view of the foregoing, the Department has issued the Acquisition Letter set forth below as an interim policy, the effective dates of which are set forth below. The Department will receive and consider public comment prior to issuing a final version of this Acquisition Letter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of the policy are largely self-explanatory. They are based on past experience of the contractors, the Department of Energy, and other federal agencies (including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Resolution Trust Corporation) in managing and controlling litigation costs throughout the Nation, and should provide a reasonable decisionmaking framework for contracting officers without being unnecessarily constraining. If any of the provisions of the policy would be unreasonable as applied, contracting officers have discretion to depart from the policy based upon particular facts and circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is seeking public comment on the interim Acquisition Letter in order to give the public, including those persons who are affected by the policies, an opportunity to comment on the interim Letter before it is finalized.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on August 26, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Richard H.

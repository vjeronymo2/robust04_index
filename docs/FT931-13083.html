			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report New York arabica COFFEE prices tumbled in early trading yesterday on pessimism over this week's International Coffee Organisation talks in London. The continued chart-based selling in New York sparked further sharp losses in the London robusta market, where the March contract touched a three-month low of Dollars 850 a tonne. Dealers said that London had held up comparatively well in view of the extent of losses in the US. Both markets remain heavily oversold with the potential to stage short-term rallies. BASE METAL trading on the LME was mostly routine, and prices ended broadly lower. COPPER reversed a dip below the Dollars 2,220-a-tonne floor of the current Dollars 10 range for three-month metal, closing unchanged at Dollars 2,228. Analysts said the current formation on the charts suggested that any eventual break-out would be sharp. LEAD prices fell to 5 3/4 -year lows in sterling, but the decline largely reflected currency factors, with the dollar equivalent little changed. Compiled from Reuters</p>

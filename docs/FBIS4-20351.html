			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by He Po-shih: "Foreign Businessmen Are Troubled by </F> the Mainland's New Tax System"]    [Text] By adopting the new tax system, the Chinese  mainland is expected to increase its tax revenues by  approximately 30 billion yuan, but foreign businessmen who have  made investments on the mainland are troubled by this measure.    In this round of reform of the tax system, under the flag of  equitable tax burdens and the gradual achievement of tax  equality between domestically funded and foreign-funded  enterprises, not only have taxes on foreign-funded enterprises  been increased, but those enterprises have also come to be  required to pay several additional taxes. Just the new taxes on  foreign-funded enterprises include: the land appreciation tax,  urban maintenance and construction tax, vehicle and vessel use  tax, securities trading tax, and consumption tax. Taxes of which  rates have been raised or raised in disguise include value added  tax, business tax, real estate tax, and urban land use tax.  <H5>  Real Estate Businesses Are Faced With an Increasingly </H5> Difficult Situation    Since the middle of 1993, the real estate industry cooled  down across the mainland because of the impacts of the  tightening of the money supply and macroeconomic regulation and  control measures on the mainland. According to statistics of the  Construction Ministry, in January-October 1993, for the country  as a whole the rate of growth in the completion of investment in  commercial buildings declined by 10 percentage points from last  year; the rate of growth in the floor space of newly started  buildings declined by 15 percent; sales of commercial buildings  declined by 9.6 percentage points; and forward prices for  buildings on the real estate market declined by approximately 20  percent. The per mu price of land fell from 1.8 million yuan to  200,000 yuan in some cities in southern China. Foreign  businessmen who had invested in the real estate industry on the  mainland were already having a very difficult time.    Nevertheless, the Provisional Regulations on the Land  Appreciation Tax of the People's Republic of China which came  into effect on 1 January 1994 levy the land appreciation tax on  all enterprises and individuals conducting transfers of use  rights to state land and buildings and other things affixed to  the land and receiving incomes from the transactions, including  domestic and foreign investors. Thus, the new tax law is  similarly applicable to domestic and foreign real estate  developers, investors, speculators, and ultimate customers. This  means that developers must pay the appreciation tax before  transferring buildings, and that when individuals buy or sell  buildings, it is necessary to pay the appreciation tax each time  real estate is transferred.    The minimum rate of the land appreciation tax is 30 percent,  and the maximum rate is 60 percent. According to calculations,  under the situation where the new land appreciation tax is  levied by the mainland, a foreign businessman who has made less  than 500,000 yuan from investing in real estate development  would have to pay 265,500 yuan in land appreciation and  foreign-funded enterprise income taxes, resulting in an  effective tax rate of 53.1 percent. If the income is between  510,000 and 1 million yuan, the effective tax rate would be  56.45 percent; if the income is between 1.01 million and 4  million yuan, the effective tax rate would be a high as 67.34  percent.    According to Shen Yu-wen, a partner of the On Wing  Accounting  Firm of Hong Kong, real estate projects accounted for a large  proportion of the over $100 billion to be invested by foreign  businessmen under contracts signed last year. Procedures for  real estate transfers on the mainland are laborious, and  economic bearing capacity is limited; thus the secondary real  estate market is immature in the first place. In addition, the  tax system will adversely affect foreign investment on the  mainland. Also, recently many foreign businesses have invested  in public construction such as light railway, subway, highway,  and bridge construction, and have thereby acquired some land as  a compensation for the inadequate returns on their investments.  After the implementation of the new tax system, returns on their  land properties will decline by at least over 30 percent. After  the imposition of the new appreciation tax, as investors must  pay the appreciation tax before transferring buildings and have  to the pay appreciation tax each time real property is  transferred, and as in addition to paying the appreciation tax  individuals also have to pay the individual income tax when  buying or selling buildings, there will doubtless be adverse  effects on foreign investment on the mainland.  <H5>  Tax Increase Results in Increased Tax Burdens on Foreign </H5> Businessmen    According to an informed source on the mainland, the basic  idea directing the adoption of the new tax system in 1994 was to  gradually increase the proportion of tax revenues to GNP and to  raise the share of central fiscal revenues in all fiscal  revenues through the reform of the tax system. Through the  implementation of the new tax system, the mainland is estimated  to increase its tax revenues by approximately 30 billion yuan  annually.    In recent years the mainland has been having a fiscal  deficit  every year; the number of officials of all levels has swollen to  over 30 million. Each year such items as dinners at public  expense, expenditures on meetings and investigation missions  abroad, and vehicle purchases at public expense would each cost  over or nearly 100 billion yuan. The huge deficits can only made  up through tax increases. Thus the new tax system and the reform  of the tax system are carried out just for the purpose of  increasing taxes; they are just the center's efforts to get more  from tax revenues.    In the previous few years, in order to attract foreign  capital, the mainland applied a preferential tax policy  characterized by three-year reductions and four-year exemptions  to foreign-funded enterprises. But under the new tax system,  unifying income taxes on domestically funded and foreign-funded  enterprises will be considered. Under the new tax system the  turnover tax has been divided into the value added tax,  consumption tax, and business tax, which will be applicable  uniformly to domestically funded enterprises and foreign-funded  enterprises; the uniform industry and commerce tax levied on  foreign-funded enterprises will be abolished; the basic rate of  the post-reform value added tax is proposed to be 16 percent. As  pointed out, when the value added tax is levied on  foreign-funded enterprises, there will be some changes in tax  burdens. With regard to the existing uniform industry and  commerce tax, the tax burden resulting from approximately 40  percent of the tax items is equal to that resulting from the  turnover tax levied on domestically funded enterprises; the  burden resulting from approximately 30 percent of the items is  slightly higher than that levied on domestically funded  enterprises; and the burden resulting from nearly 30 percent of  the tax items is slightly lower than that resulting from the  turnover tax levied on domestically funded enterprises.    Furthermore, quite a few of the newly instituted taxes will  affect foreign businessmen. For example, it is stipulated that  foreign-funded enterprises which previously did not have to pay  the urban maintenance and construction tax should become that  tax's new payers, with a tax rate of 0.5-1 percent being applied  to them. A securities trading tax will be levied on trading in  Type B stocks, and the basic tax rate has been proposed to be 3  percent, which will be applied to both sides of trading and  allowed to float upward by 10 percent at the maximum. The urban  real estate tax and vehicle- and vessel-use license tax levied  on foreign-funded enterprises and foreign nationals will be  abolished, and the real estate tax and vehicle and vessel use  tax will be levied in a uniform manner. The relevant tax rates  and tax amounts which are too low at present will be  appropriately raised.    The principles on implementing the new tax system also  stipulate that except for the uniform tax breaks provided for by  tax laws, no tax breaks should be given to enterprises, sectors,  or regions of any kind, including special economic zones as  specifically pointed out. This amounts to declaring that the  preferential tax policies which regions of the mainland have  promised foreign businessmen when trying to attract investment  will become legally invalid.  <H5>  The Minimum Income Level for Payers of the Individual Income </H5> Tax Is Too Low While the Individual Income Tax Rates Are Too High    A foreign employee of a foreign-funded enterprise on the  mainland complained to me that the minimum income level for  payers of the individual income tax was too low while the tax  rates were too high, that furthermore the tax must be paid with  foreign exchange, and that the situation was really not right.    According to a source, with regard to the effective  deduction  standards relating to the individual income tax under the new  tax system, the amount of monthly deduction is proposed to be  800 yuan on the basis of the general living expense standard on  the mainland. With regard to individual income tax rates,  incomes are divided into two categories, "wage and salary  incomes," and "production and business incomes"; an  excess-amount progressive rate of 5-45 percent will be applied  to the former, and an excess-amount progressive rate of 5-35  percent will be applied to the latter. The tax burden level is  largely similar to that of the enterprise income tax. Because of  vigorous calls made by many foreign employees, the mainland will  make foreign nationals eligible for additional deductions after  the imposition of the uniform individual income tax on Chinese  and foreign nationals, and is planning to increase a foreign  national's monthly deduction to 4,000 yuan.    In addition the mainland is also planning to institute an  inheritance tax and gift tax, and will impose inheritance and  gift taxes on overseas Chinese and people from Hong Kong and  Macao; the relevant draft documents have been submitted to the  State Council.    The consumption tax instituted under the new tax system will  also affect foreign businessmen. As pointed out, the consumption  tax will be applied to: some luxury, high-grade consumer goods,  some consumer goods in the nonrenewable resource category, some  oversupplied products which need to be restricted for a period  of time in order to support the adjustment of the product mix,  and products which will cause substantially less tax burdens  after the institution of the value added tax. It is  preliminarily planned that the consumption tax will be levied on  20 commodities, including mainly cigarettes, alcohol, cosmetics,  jewelry, air conditioners, refrigerators, color television sets,  videocassette recorders, motorcycles, cars, gasoline, diesel  fuel, and fireworks; in the future adjustment and control will  be carried out in accordance with the demands of the state's  macroeconomic policy and in view of changes in consumption  structure.  <H5>  Strengthening Mechanisms So As To Impose Severe Punishments </H5> on Tax Evasion    The mainland was previously called a paradise of tax evasion  and avoidance for foreign businesses, and the low tax rates and  the lax tax collection system were one of the reasons why many  foreign businesses vied with each other in making investments on  the mainland. However, after the implementation of the new tax  system, the situation will be greatly changed.    --A tax report system will be established across the  mainland. After the establishment of the tax report system,  economic penalties will be imposed on those who fail to report  on schedule, and a failure to report truthfully will be  considered an act of tax evasion and will be sternly punished in  accordance with the law.    --The establishment of a system of strict tax examination.  The main force of taxation agencies on the mainland will turn  into being engaged in routine and priority tax examinations; a  tax-collection and -management situation characterized by the  combining of reporting, agent service, and examination is to be  created, and as a supporting measure, the method of imposing  heavy penalties on tax evasion will be used.    --To meet the demands of the implementation of the separate  taxation system, two systems of tax collection agencies  responsible for collecting central and local taxes respectively  will be established.    --Except for the tax breaks provided for by tax laws,  governments at various levels may no longer grant tax breaks,  neither may taxation agencies, fiscal agencies, or other  agencies.    --The building of the legal system governing taxation will  be  enhanced; efforts to complete the process of making tax laws and  regulations will be accelerated; and a mechanism of having  tax-related legislation, adjudication, and law enforcement be  independent of one another and constrain one another will be  gradually established.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Observer: Rampant Talk about the boast of heraldry. On its members' behalf, Britain's Federation of Small Businesses is urging government to provide a practical shield against the bankruptcies it says are occurring at the rate of one every six minutes. On its own behalf, it is taking up a purely symbolic shield in the form of a coat of arms. The design - by former federation chairman Bernard Juby, a keen historian and genealogist who has traced his family history back several centuries - is claimed to epitomise many of the qualities of small-business owners. Two animals figure prominently. One is a hard-working beaver. The other, a badger, represents not only the federation's lobbying on behalf of its members, but also the badgering of same by bureaucrats in their turn. The pair of them support a shield depicting one quarter of the union flag, to mark the 25 per cent of the British workforce employed by small businesses and the similar share of the gross national product they generate. Meanwhile more obviously symbolic bees buzz around. The arms are completed by the federation's motto which, given its latest complaining, has a somewhat quizzical ring. Nihil fortus - semper eadem, it goes, 'We are the strongest, and will never change'.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Wind of change blows up on the Clyde Mr James McColl, executive chairman of Clyde Blowers, has ambitions. 'We aim to be a hyper-growth company in the next five years, and build a big engineering group based in Scotland." Despite having had a quote since the late 1950s, Clydebank-based Clyde Blowers is not a familiar name in financial circles. But its shares have risen 76 per cent this year to peak recently at 605p. In the year to August 31 its turnover jumped from Pounds 4.6m to Pounds 7.4m and it returned to profit. Clyde Blowers is a long-established producer of equipment for cleaning soot caused by coal and oil from boilers. It is one of the main concerns in a niche market and has customers worldwide. However, it was stagnating until early last year when Mr Ted Wilson, the 87-year-old chairman, retired and the Wilson family sold 29.9 per cent of the company for Pounds 900,000 to Mr McColl, an engineer with company doctor experience. 'It was like walking into a museum,' says Mr McColl, who is 40. 'The company was reactive and did not seek customers or orders for spares.' Profits had been invested in a Pounds 2m shares portfolio. 'But I bought 50 years of experience.' He swiftly shed 50 of the 120-strong workforce, improved manufacturing efficiency, found new orders and increased sales of spares. New equipment sales were up 30 per cent this year. In April Clyde Blowers bought Brighton-based Sturtevant Engineering, a maker of pressurised pneumatic conveying equipment which removes such things as ash. Clyde Blowers spent only Pounds 336,000 but gained a company with Pounds 5m of turnover and a strong order book. In August it took over Boiler Products Engineering, a Belgium-based subsidiary of GEC-Alsthom, also in boiler cleaning. The Pounds 3m deal was financed with a Pounds 3.6m rights issue. It gave Clyde Blowers more access to the francophone boiler market and made the group the biggest independent boiler cleaning equipment maker in Europe. The recent results suggest that Clyde Blowers has returned to financial health. Although it still made an operating loss of Pounds 268,000, Mr McColl says the loss was down to Pounds 64,000 in the second half, and included the cost of setting up a Pounds 200,000 head office operation. The operating losses were wiped out by a Pounds 473,000 profit on the sale of the remains of the investment portfolio, producing pre-tax profits Pounds 205,000 (against a loss of Pounds 141,000). Mr McColl says its current turnover was equivalent to Pounds 15m on an annualised basis, and that orders are strong. Now the new head office staff is looking at acquisition targets in the UK, the Continent and the US to complement organic growth in boiler cleaning and pressurised pneumatic equipment. 'There are fantastic opportunities and we are in a wonderful position with cash and no borrowings,' says Mr McColl.</p>

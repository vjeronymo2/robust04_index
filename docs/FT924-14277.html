			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / A party at war and peace with itself: Conservatives close their conference with the prime minister's renewed commitment to economic goals - Ivo Dawnay hears the voices of the Tories'noisy minority A VISUAL metaphor for what has been one of the least successfully stage-managed Conservative conferences came even before the prime minister had made his triumphant entrance yesterday. Three times, the boisterous element in the Brighton centre attempted to loop the hall with a 360-degree 'Mexican wave.' At first, delegates on three sides of the hall rose and returned to their seats, only for the 'wave' to dash against the stiff upper lips on the platform. The second try penetrated the platform's back row as grandees such as Lord Howe, dutifully, if improbably, embraced the spirit of the terraces. At the final attempt, the whole cabinet - Lamont, Hurd et al - ditched the last vestiges of their dignity and, arms raised like surrendering squaddies, paid ritual obeisance to the populist tide on the conference floor. Throughout the week, two observations on the modern Conservative party became common currency around the hotel bars. The first - touched on by Mr Major's claim that 'Labour and the Liberals are utterly irrelevant' - is that the Tory conference now combines both the government and its opposition. At its high point during Lord Tebbit's peasants' revolt on Tuesday afternoon, a good half of the packed conference hall looked ready to defy the leadership, before Mr Douglas Hurd's headmasterly speech reminded them where their duty lay. The second observation, also alluded to by Mr Major in his speech yesterday, is that what for Labour is a vice, for the Tories is a virtue. It is only proper, this argument goes, that as Britain grows to resemble the de facto one-party states of Japan and Italy, natural checks and balances should emerge to force the party leadership to heed its grassroots. Opinions differ as to how much that is true. As tempers have flared over Europe and the exchange rate mechanism this week, veterans have recalled similar fervour in the past over Rhodesia and capital punishment. This week, it was the noisy minority, not the silent majority, that made its presence most strongly felt. What is more, it demonstrated an articulacy and range of opinion many claimed never to have witnessed before. As ever, there was plenty of the traditional wishful, not to say sloppy, thinking like the woman who argued both for a 5-point interest rate cut and an independent Bank of England. But others claimed that the economic debate showed an unprecedented degree of sophistication, both in diagnosis and cure. One senior Fleet Street economic commentator observed with genuine, if patronising, surprise: 'I think it is the first time I have ever heard a delegate from the floor at a Tory conference talking sensibly about monetary aggregates.' Some party activists say the new economic literacy is a direct legacy of the the Thatcher years - an evolution of the battles between 'wets' and 'dries' on to the A-level curriculum of the relative merits of fixed and floating exchange rates. Others say that the battles over the economy are for the most part simply the continuation of the Maastricht civil war by other means. But that is to ignore the Conservatives' old constituency of small business people for whom European issues are firmly secondary to the more pressing question of interest rates. But while the majority of Tory conferencegoers may still be loyalists of the non-combative, envelope-stuffing tendency, the Brighton hall also demonstrated the growing readiness of highly politicised younger party members to have a go at the leadership. While the bulk of those were Thatcherite, it was also notable that at fringe meetings some of the louder heckling came from a newly vociferous pro-Maastricht grouping. The fractiousness of the 1992 Brighton conference owed much to the vulnerability of a Conservative government in the depths of recession and battered by the Black Wednesday debacle. But its message carried little real comfort for Labour. Labour's Blackpool conference was remarkable in its refusal to mourn a fourth successive election defeat. But the overriding mood was contemplative and a trifle bemused. By contrast, the grand Conservative coalition of City slickers and blue-rinsed matrons, tweedy fogies and snappy-suited yuppies was energised by the heady, high-octane stimulus of proximity to politicians in power.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kay Nehm, the new federal public prosecutor, </F> by Alfred Merta, Friedemann Weckbach-Mara, and Barbara Schmid;  place and date not given: "More Police on Our Streets!"]    [Text] [BILD AM SONNTAG] Four years after the GDR  collapsed, there are still Stasi spies being unmasked and  charged. Does this still make sense?    [Nehm] We are currently investigating the cases of some 800  "Western German" suspects. This is not just a matter of  criminal investigations, but we also have to be aware that spies  who have not yet been unmasked can easily be blackmailed by  foreign intelligence services, especially in the long run. We  have to prevent them from becoming spies again.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Are you still investigating the case of  Karl Wienand, former group manager of the Social Democratic  Party of Germany?    [Nehm] With the investigations now mostly completed, we will  decide in the near future whether we will have to bring charges  against him.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Following events in Bad Kleinen, do you  fear fresh terror attacks by the RAF [Red Army Faction]?    [Nehm] At the moment there are intense discussions going on  within the RAF on whether they should change their objectives  and renounce violence. If the "hardliners" get their way over  the next few weeks, attacks cannot be ruled out.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Do you have any hot leads in the arson  attack on the Luebeck synagogue?    [Nehm] We are currently investigating some 250 leads. If we  persevere, I expect that we will be able to clarify the matter  and bring those guilty of the Luebeck attack to trial.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] More severe laws are frequently being  called for, both for political extremism and for ordinary  crimes. Do we need these?    [Nehm] In some fields we would need clearer laws rather than  more severe ones -- laws that the judiciary can handle more  easily. Let me give you an example from the narcotics law. In  this context it is important whether a suspect possesses a  "larger amount" of drugs. The practical interpretion of this  term inevitably causes problems.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Do you want to allow this "great bugging  campaign" so that the police can listen in to new crimes being  discussed?    [Nehm] That is a matter on which the politicians will have  to decide. People tend to expect too much from the great  bugging campaign. The chances of success are frequently  overestimated.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Many people feel that they are no longer  safe in this country. Especially in the cities, many old people  and women no longer dare go out at night. Burglaries and thefts  are hardly ever solved....    [Nehm] You have to differentiate between the number of  crimes actually committed and the rather subjective feeling of  safety. Of course, it is bad if there is a general feeling of  threat. The police have to counteract this by showing their  presence. They have to be more visible in public. There  should, for instance, be more police patrols on foot.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Does this mean more policemen?    [Nehm] It is not necessarily the number that counts, but  their training. Also, routine and administrative jobs must be  taken away from the police. But the citizens must also do their  share. Many burglaries could be prevented if apartments were  better protected. People should carefully list and photograph  valuable items to make searching for stolen goods easier for the  police. I am in favor of establishing a criminal proceedings  register. Every criminal offense would have to be listed  centrally, and we would no longer investigate each individual  burglary by itself, but we would see whether there is a series  of offences and whether suspects are operating on a  supra-regional basis. This would make criminal investigations  much more efficient.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] What do you think of the suggestion of  using the Bundeswehr for internal security?    [Nehm] This is not possible under existing laws. But I do  not see any danger to the existence and security of the FRG that  would make an amendment to the constitution necessary. Crime  prevention does not require this either.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Should blackmail be a punishable offense  for politicians as it is for civil servants?    [Nehm] It would make sense if blackmail were punishable in  the case of politicians. This would help the population's sense  of justice, and also the reputation of parliaments.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Is the Federal Office of Criminal  Investigations [BKA], your most important investigating  authority, fully operational again after the slip-ups of Bad  Kleinen?    [Nehm] There has certainly been some irritation. The BKA  has grown quite fast in terms of staffing. This must  necessarily result in problems. I think that the office could  be streamlined in many areas. Basically, we have complete trust  in the BKA, which is indeed our most important investigating  authority.    [BILD AM SONNTAG] Before being appointed public prosecutor  you were a judge in the 4th Senate at the Federal High Court of  Justice. This court is also in charge of the road traffic law,  and you are considered an expert in this field. Are you in  favor of changing the blood alcohol limit and of a general speed  limit?    [Nehm] Introducing a 0.5 per mille alcohol limit throughout  Germany would have been the right compromise after unification.  The higher the alcohol content, the lower the rate of reaction.  This has not only been scientifically proven, but it also makes  sense to any nonspecialist. That is why I consider the  introduction of a 0.5 per mille limit to be necessary and  sensible in the interest of all road users. As far as the speed  limit is concerned, there is no doubt: A general speed limit  would increase the capacity of our roads and make traffic run  more smoothly.</p>

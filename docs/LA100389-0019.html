			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> In a major policy reversal, Britain's opposition Labor Party dropped its  once-cherished policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament. At its annual  conference, the party voted to adopt a new platform that would commit a Labor  government to scrapping Britain's nuclear weapons only in a negotiated arms  deal. Ditching the non-nuclear doctrine, a factor in Labor's successive defeats  by Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher since the party lost power in  1979, is part of a major policy overhaul.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu </F> at his office in the Central Government Building in Seoul, by  Hwang Chae-hong, TONG-A ILBO senior political affairs desk  reporter -- date not given]    [Text] The North Korean nuclear problem, which once drove  the Korean peninsula into an extreme pitch of tension, now faces  a phase of negotiations. A preliminary contact for a  North-South summit is to be held on 28 June at Panmunjom and a  third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks will be held in  Geneva early next month.    Although the people consider such an abrupt change in the  situation fortunate, they can hardly conceal their suspicion.  North Korea showed a drastic change in its attitude so as to  curve around sanctions directed against it by the UN Security  Council into dialogue. Nevertheless, people are becoming more  concerned about whether or not the North Korean nuclear problem  will be solved peacefully through such an atmosphere of dialogue.    As for the issue regarding a North-South summit toward which  the government was somewhat hasty, will the top leaders of the  North and the South actually sit together for the first time  since the nation was divided? To what degree will the summit,  when realized, contribute to removing factors increasing  tensions on the Korean peninsula? These are questions the  people are concerned about.    Since the new government came to office, Foreign Minister  Han  Sung-chu has taken the initiative of leading government policy  on the North Korean nuclear problem. This reporter met with  Foreign Minister Han in his office.    [Reporter Hwang Chae-hong] Since former U.S. President  Carter visited North Korea, the North Korean nuclear issue has  made a drastic turn from a phase of sanctions to that of  dialogue. Both affirmative and negative assessments about  Carter's visit to North Korea are seen even in the United  States. What is our government's overall evaluation of his  visit?    [Minister Han Sung-chu] North Korea proposed a North-South  summit and revealed the will to freeze nuclear development  through former U.S. President Carter. Following this, North  Korea agreed on a preliminary contact for a North-South summit,  and confirmed its will to freeze nuclear development through a  diplomatic channel. This being the case, our government feels  that Mr. Carter's visit laid the foundation for a third round of  North Korea-U.S. talks and provided a chance for a solution to  the North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue. However, the  sincerity of North Korea's will to implement what it pledged is  more important. Thus, the government will watch how the  situation develops with keen interest and make efforts to solve  the North Korean nuclear problem.    [Hwang] What is your assessment of the reasons behind North  Korea's prompt acceptance of the proposal for a preliminary  contact on a North-South summit after having been passive in the  past?    [Minister Han] It seems that North Korea wanted to turn the  situation in which sanctions against itself were discussed on a  full scale, to a phase of dialogue. North Korea also indicated  its sincerity by confirming the message it sent through Mr.  Carter.    [Hwang] Can we then say that North Korea yielded because of  the sanctions discussed by the UN Security Council against  itself?    [Minister Han] Instead of using the word, "yield," which is  partly related to the implementation of sanctions, we may say  that North Korea was prompted by the necessity to turn the phase  of sanctions into that of dialogue. [end Minister Han]    Minister Han expressed his faith that we should view  North-South relations from the standpoint that what is  advantageous to North Korea is not always disadvantageous to us.  Thus, he stressed that the recent change in North Korean  attitude should not be viewed as "yielding" in an inevitable  situation.    [Hwang] What is your opinion on the possibility of a  North-South summit?    [Minister Han] It is higher than ever before. Judging from  its response to our proposal for a preliminary contact, the  North Korean side's motivation for realizing a North-South  summit seems to be very great.    [Hwang] We believe that if a summit is held, the North  Korean nuclear issue, the issue of reuniting families separated  between the North and the South, expansion of exchanges between  people, and a historic conclusion of the Korean war, can be  discussed at the summit. Which does the government plan on  giving priority?    [Minister Han] The government has decided to push the summit  ahead without any conditions. Therefore, we will not clearly  designate any agenda items in advance. In view of the prevailing  situation, elimination of tensions created by the nuclear  problem, improvement of North-South relations, expansion of  cooperation, and some other issues may be broadly discussed,  thus seeking methods for laying a foundation for reunification  in the end.    Since the joint denuclearization declaration and the  basic agreement were already adopted by the North and the South,  the nuclear issue and improvement of relations may serve as a  basis for discussion. [end Minister Han]    Minister Han is deeply involved in the government's  decisionmaking as a full member of the Unification and Security  Policy Coordination Council. He answered questions on the  North-South summit very cautiously. Concerning the prospect for  success of the summit, he stressed that the meeting between the  two sides itself is of epoch-making significance. Thus, the  result of the talks should not be evaluated in black-and-white  terms, but the meeting itself should be given significance.  Thus, if the two sides agree on even general matters, such as  subsequent talks, a promise to cooperate with each other in the  future, and so forth, the atmosphere of dialogue will be  significantly improved.    [Hwang] Let us turn the topic to a third round of North  Korean-U.S. talks. The United States announced that it will hold  a third round of high-level talks with North Korea early next  month. What are the targets that both the United States and the  ROK will pursue at the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks?    [Minister Han] The third round of talks will be focused on  totally eliminating suspicion of North Korea's nuclear  development. The ROK and U.S. position is that security and  various other political and economic issues that have been  previously raised by North Korea can be broadly discussed if the  North Korean nuclear problem is completely solved.    [Hwang] It was learned, however, that the United States has  abandoned efforts to examine North Korea's past nuclear  activities, and in return, has demanded that North Korea freeze  its nuclear development. As a result, people now doubt that  there is agreement in views between the ROK and the United  States. Is this true, Mr. Minister?    [Minister Han] It is the firm position of the ROK and the  United States that transparency of the past, present, and future  nuclear activities of North Korea should be ensured by all means  for a complete solution to the North Korean nuclear problem.    It is true, however, that there was a debate on whether the  issue of verification of past activities should be a  precondition for a third round of North Korean-U.S. talks or be  discussed during the talks. From the tactical point of view,  both the ROK and the United States agreed on resumption of North  Korean-U.S. dialogue by making North Korea promise to freeze its  nuclear development, which is urgently required, and on a  thoroughgoing discussion of the issue of verifying its past  nuclear activities during the third round of North Korean-U.S.  talks. Thus, there is no difference in views between the two  countries. [end Minister Han]    Minister Han stressed that the North Korean nuclear problem,  which started due to suspicion of North Korea's past nuclear  activities and the UN Security Council began to discuss  sanctions due to the suspicion of North Korean past nuclear  activities, has not been removed. Therefore, the act of  abandoning verification of the past is the same as abandoning  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty itself. This being the case,  not only the ROK and the United States, but also the  international community will never overlook North Korea's past  nuclear activities.    [Hwang] As North Korea unilaterally replaced fuel rods  in the five-megawatt reactor, some people wonder if there are  technical means to assure North Korea's past nuclear  transparency. Do you think special inspections [tukpyol sachal]  on undeclared facilities could thoroughly verify past nuclear  activities?    [Minister Han] Past nuclear activities could be verified if  North Korea actively cooperates by accepting special inspections  of the two undeclared facilities, which North Korea insists are  military facilities, and by correctly reporting the quantity of  extracted plutonium. We will continue to exert efforts in  various ways so that North Korea shows a positive attitude in  resolving this issue through the third round of North  Korean-U.S. talks.    [Hwang] North Korea has insisted that the nuclear issue and  the improvement of North Korean-U.S. relations should be  resolved in a package deal at the third round of North  Korean-U.S. talks. How do you plan to respond to this?    [Minister Han] North Korea's package solution proposes a  simultaneous exchange of all the issues related to North Korea's  nuclear suspicion. The problem with the proposal is that North  Korea is bargaining its obligations as a member of the  international community and obligations in North-South  relations. North Korea has made it difficult to resolve the  issue in a phased manner by binding the prerequisite obligations  and fundamental obligations in one bundle. We will exert a wide  range of efforts to resolve the issue through dialogue,  including the improvement of North Korean-U.S. relations under  the precondition of the resolution of the nuclear issue, while  creating the circumstances for North Korea to fulfill its  inspection obligations.    [Hwang] The Democratic Liberal Party recently urged the  government to reconsider the declaration on the denuclearization  of the Korean peninsula if North Korea delays the assurance of  nuclear transparency. What is the government's position  regarding public opinion urging nuclear independence and the  reconsideration of the declaration on the denuclearization?    [Minister Han] The government has consistently adhered to  the earnest implementation of the joint declaration on the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula because the  implementation of the denuclearization declaration is the basis  for achieving nuclear-free peace and order on the Korean  peninsula, as well as in Northeast Asia and the entire world.  It is true that people are saying that the joint declaration on  denuclearization is useless when suspicion of North Korea's  nuclear weapons development is escalating. The government's  position on the compliance of the denuclearization declaration  remains unchanged. Under the principle of the parties concerned  in the North and the South, North Korea should respond to our  efforts to implement the denuclearization declaration, including  mutual inspection [sangho sachal], before it is too late. [end  Minister Han]    Although the government has been criticized for alternating  between hard-line and moderate policies on the North Korean  nuclear issue, Minister Han has adhered to the "resolution  through negotiations" theory and insisted on seeking peaceful  resolutions through dialogue and negotiations since the  beginning of the nuclear issue. Asked if the government's  policy on the North Korean nuclear issue has not been based on  national consensus, Minister Han said it is very difficult  because "public opinion is distinctively divided and one policy  is criticized both as hard-line and moderate." How the North  Korean nuclear issue develops should depend on the result of the  North-South summit talks and the third round of North  Korean-U.S. talks.</p>

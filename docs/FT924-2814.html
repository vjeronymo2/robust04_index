			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Greece warns partners over Macedonia GREECE angrily warned its EC partners yesterday that it would reject any effort at the summit to recognise the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, Reuter reports from Athens. 'We will veto EC recognition,' said a government spokesman. 'Our position is clear. The republic must drop the term Macedonia from its name. All our partners accepted this stand at the June summit.' The dispute between Athens and Skopje, the Macedonian capital, has raised tensions along the Greek border. The spokesman said Greece warned that any deviation from the EC declaration that the term Macedonia must be dropped would mean a crippling split in EC policy on Yugoslavia.</p>

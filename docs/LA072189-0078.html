			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Large Apple Crop Forecast: Rebounding from bad weather in 1987 and the Alar  controversy last year, the nation's apple growers are producing the  second-largest crop in history, according to the Agriculture Department. USDA  said the nation's 20,000 growers will harvest 230.8 million 42-pound boxes of  apples this fall, about 5% more than last year's 218 million boxes. Prices and  sales in 1988 were lower because of the Alar scare. The 1989 forecast is well  below the 1987 record crop of 255.9 million boxes, which suffered extensive  weather damage and brought prices below the cost of production.  </P></p>

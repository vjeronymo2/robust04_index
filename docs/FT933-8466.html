			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / Acquittal clouds future of BCCI case: Altman case raises fundamental questions about bank fraud THE acquittal on Saturday of Mr Robert Altman was a serious blow to the prosecutors who have been toiling for years on the case from the office of Mr Robert Morgenthau, the respected Manhattan district attorney who has led the world in tackling the corruption at BCCI. The development also raises fundamental questions for US law enforcement officials that are both specific and general in the BCCI case. First, there is the issue of where to go from here on BCCI. Then there is the broader matter of how bank regulators and prosecutors can best tackle international bank fraud when it transcends national boundaries. The joint indictment 13 months ago of Mr Altman and of Mr Clark Clifford, the former US defence secretary, was the high-water mark in the campaign to prosecute those suspected of involvement in BCCI's 20-year history of fraud and deception. In the US the leadership on BCCI came from Mr Morgenthau, partly because the Bush administration's Department of Justice had been noticeably lethargic on the case. The 86-year-old Mr Clifford has been able to avoid trial thus far on the grounds that he is too ill to come to court. Charges against him have been deferred, and few in Washington expect him ever to go to trial. Separate charges against both Mr Clifford and Mr Altman were lodged in Washington, but these too might be dropped as a result of the New York acquittal. A number of the key BCCI figures who have been indicted in the US, including Mr Sweleh Naqvi, the former BCCI chief executive, are meanwhile in Abu Dhabi or other places beyond the reach of the US. It is thus unclear, aside from appealing against the Altman conviction, how Mr Morgenthau's office will proceed from here. There is a real risk that those BCCI officials involved in the more shocking acts of corruption will ultimately escape trial anywhere. In broader terms, the Altman acquittal highlights the difficulty of policing the international financial markets when no single regulator is in charge of monitoring specific institutions. After the BCCI trial's collapse in New York, the next important international banking scandal to find its way to US courts will be the trial next month of Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former manager of the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). The BNL case is very different, however. Mr Drogoul is accused of defrauding the US government and BNL's Rome head office by making more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) of improper loans to Iraq. The difference, however, is that Mr Drogoul, joined by investigators in the US Congress and the Italian parliament, has claimed the Atlanta loans were secretly countenanced by the US and Italian governments as part of the tilt towards Mr Saddam Hussein.</p>

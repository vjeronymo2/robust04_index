			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLANNING FOR UNIVERSITY HOUSE  </P> <P> In response to a Nov. 11 editorial concerning UC Irvine's plans for a  University House ("UCI Mustn't Forget the Animals' Homes"), I would like to  emphasize the level of detail that went into the planning for this project and  outline the approval process involved.  </P> <P> Consulting biologists worked in cooperation with university faculty and staff  to study and map the site in great detail.  </P> <P> This information was used to develop a site plan which avoids a majority of the  sensitive habitat and incorporates detailed mitigation measures for restoring  and monitoring the few areas that would be affected.  </P> <P> After review by a faculty and staff planning committee, the plans will be  submitted to the University of California Regents for approval. The regents  will consider the project based on our studies and on the environmental impact  report prepared for the campus' Long-Range Development Plan. This report, which  includes a comprehensive study of all biological habitat on campus, adequately  describes the impact of this project.  </P> <P> We at UCI, the only University of California campus without a University House  on campus, are committed to protecting the environment. We are also satisfied  the project will have minimal impact on the area. Preparing yet another  environmental report would be redundant and would not provide any new  information.  </P> <P> J.W. PELTASON, Chancellor, UC Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / EU leaders choose Santer as the next Brussels president: Luxembourg PM to succeed Delors despite misgivings of MEPs European Union leaders last night settled on Mr Jacques Santer, the prime minister of Luxembourg, as a compromise choice to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. Mr Santer, a 57-year-old Christian Democrat, was approved by consensus at a special summit in Brussels, despite misgivings in the European Parliament and lingering resentment about the UK veto last month of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian premier and one-time favourite. At a news conference, Mr Santer stressed that he had not sought the job of president, but felt obliged to come forward as a compromise candidate. 'Just because someone comes from a small country, that does not mean they cannot become a big president,' he said. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, a friend of Mr Santer's for 20 years, said his appointment would not halt the process of European integration laid down by the Maastricht treaty. 'We see no majority in the EU for stopping or going back.' Mr John Major, UK prime minister, described Mr Santer as a wise choice who was committed to free trade, free markets, decentralisation and enlargement of the Union. 'He is well able to reconcile the conflicting views around the European table.' The appointment of the low-profile Luxembourger who has served as prime minister since 1984 confirms the recent trend toward devolving power from the Commission in Brussels to the member states - a process underlined by Mr Kohl who said he did not see a centralised European state emerging in future. During his five-year term, Mr Santer will nevertheless have an important role to play in preparing for the 1996 Maastricht review conference, consolidating the enlargement of the Union to the Nordic and Alpine states and laying the groundwork for European monetary union and expansion of membership to the new democracies of Central Europe. Mr Santer is the second Luxembourger to rise to the top executive post. Mr Gaston Thorn, the former prime minister of the Grand Duchy, preceded Mr Delors between 1980 and 1984. A finance expert, Mr Santer played a useful role in preparing the 1986 European Single Act and the 1991 Maastricht treaty. His elevation marks the end of a dramatic contest to succeed Mr Delors, who started as a relatively little known international politician, but who became the driving force behind the Single European Act, the European Economic Area and the project of the Maastricht treaty to create a single European currency by the end of the century. Mr Santer emerged as a compromise after better-known potential candidates were either blocked or declined to come forward. Germany, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, called yesterday's special summit to break the deadlock and avoid a crisis with the European Parliament, which under the Maastricht treaty has the power to block the appointment. Mr Kohl courted leading MEPs before the summit and at the news conference he stressed on several occasions the importance of the parliament as an institution alongside the member states and Commission. As a result, MEPs seem unlikely to exercise a veto at their inaugural session in Strasbourg next week, but they may complain about the selection process. Mr Dehaene raised this issue before the summit, criticising the UK veto as bad for Europe and warning that the EU could not operate on the basis of vetoes. 'This will certainly leave marks . . . it is not about bilateral or personal relations, but about the functioning of the Union.' Brussels' beguiling new Burgermeister, Page 8</p>

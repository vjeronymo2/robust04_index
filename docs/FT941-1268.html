			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: OOIL steams ahead to bolster balance sheet - A look at the shipping group's turnround as a full set of results is announced The shipping crisis of the mid-1980s claimed two of the industry's biggest names in Asia: Sanko of Japan, and Orient Overseas Holdings of Hong Kong. In Japan, Sanko was placed in receivership and was eventually dismembered. The collapse of the company ruined Mr Toshio Komoto, its founder and senior Liberal Democratic Party politician. Today, the other casualty of the shipping crisis, now known as Orient Overseas International Limited (OOIL), reports its first set of full results since a series of corporate reorganisations which were occasioned by its near insolvency in 1985. OOIL is expected to report much improved profitability on the USDollars 8m it made in 1992. But the aspect of the company's operations which executives are keen to highlight is the strength of OOIL's balance sheet - at the end of 1993 it had USDollars 480m in cash and investments - and the coherence of its business strategy for container shipping. OOIL was a classic example of John Maynard Keynes's dictum that if you owe a bank Pounds 10,000 you had a problem but if you owe it Pounds 1m then it has the problem. At the time of crisis in 1985 OOIL's predecessor and the Tung family, its controlling shareholders, owed the banks nearly USDollars 2.5bn. To save the company Mr C. H. Tung, scion of the family fortune and OOIL's chairman, called in debts and wrote some IOUs. Hongkong and Shanghai Bank advanced the company HKDollars 1bn in credit; the Chinese government advanced it USDollars 100m, an enormous sum for a developing country and an indication of just how valuable an asset Beijing perceived the Tung family to be. The price of reorganisation was high. The Tung family - much as Hong Kong entrepreneurs still do - had run their private interests and public obligations in tandem. In 1985 the interlocking structure that bankers encountered was extremely complicated. Only recently has the company reorganised itself in such a way that bankers and investors understand who owned what. Today the overlap between OOIL and the Tung family - which owns more than 50 per cent of the company - is limited to sharing the same offices in Wan Chai and the use of a container terminal at the port of Kaoshiung in Taiwan. On the issue of conflicts of interest, Mr Simon Brough, the company's chief financial officer, is firm. 'There are no inter-company loans and nor would the board permit it,' he says. 'I'm not aware of what the private side does and nor am I interested.' His pride and joy is the state of OOIL's finances, about which he enthuses: 'We have one the strongest balance sheets in the industry and one of the most liquid,' he says. For a company which was nearly undone because of the state of its finances, this is clearly an achievement. Mr Brough says OOIL has a policy of maintaining at least USDollars 200m in liquid assets. But the health of the company's finances is just one aspect of the pitch OOIL wants to make to investors. It believes it has a good management story to tell as well. At the beginning of the 1990s OOIL embraced the concept of total quality management and, according to Mr Tung, it has enabled OOIL to climb into the first division of container operators in the world. 'We are very quality conscious,' says Mr Tung. 'In our business if you make a mistake in documentation it reverberates around the world. So if you do things right the first time, you save a lot of money.' He speaks in the language of the modern manager. He talks of 'critical success factors' in business, of being 'customer focused', and of doing things 'right the first time'. His embrace of western management technique has been well received among knowledgeable managers in Hong Kong. According to one senior Hong Kong businessman who knows the company well: 'CH runs OOIL in a modern democratic western style.' Says Mr Tung: 'I try to emphasise the importance of team play. All sorts of nationalities work for us and work very well together. We consider ourselves a Hong Kong-based multinational.' People are one of the 'critical success factors' Mr Tung likes to talk about. Another is 'quality' in the delivery of the services OOIL provides. This has become particularly important as the company has sought to lift its game in the international cargo transportation business. This has involved providing what Mr Stanley Shen, general manager of quality assurance, calls 'third-party logistics support' to customers, such as support for just-in-time inventory control, better information and distribution. In this context the company is particularly pleased with its American President Lines (APL) alliance. It has joined with APL to provide 'shuttle' services across the Pacific. This has enabled the two to pool resources and target higher value cargoes. To bolster its position in container cargo transport, OOIL earlier this month said it had placed a USDollars 500m order for six container vessels, each with the capacity to carry 4,950 20ft containers. The ships - to be delivered from the second half of next year until the first quarter of 1996 - will be funded 20 per cent from internal resources and 80 per cent by borrowings. The new ships will replace older vessels in OOIL's 25-ship fleet, a fleet which currently has an average age of 13 years. Mr Tung believes his company is on the verge of a new beginning. 'It seems to be a business permanently incapable of doing well,' he says. 'But there are some shippers which make a 15 per cent return on shareholders' funds even in difficult years. It all comes down to how you organise yourself to do it. I think we can.'</p>

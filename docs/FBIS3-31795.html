A new defense minister of  Herceg-Bosna was appointed at the first session of the  Presidential Council, the body which took over all duties of the  president of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Zdenko Vranjes  reporting for Croatian radio.    [Vranjes] Vladimir Soljic has been appointed new defense  minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Former Minister  Perica Jukic will remain one of the deputy prime ministers.  Zeljko Obradovic has also been appointed new minister for land  management and construction.    At the session in Mostar the Presidential Council decided to  form an expert group to solve the Mostar situation. The group  will nominate a team to take part in negotiations within the  framework defined by the conclusions drawn up at the session of  the Chamber of Deputies in Livno, whereby Mostar is the capital  of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. The Council accepted in  principle the UN peace forces' request for their command for the  southwestern sector to be stationed in the territory of  Herceg-Bosna.    Presidential Council President Kresimir Zubak informed  Council members about the course of the peace negotiations in  Geneva and Frankfurt. Zubak had the following to say on the  results of the latest Muslim-Croat agreements on a confederation  of the Croat and Muslim parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina with the  Republic of Croatia:    [Begin Zubak recording] We agreed on several issues. First,  we agree that it is possible, and perhaps even desirable for the  interests of both peoples, to organize Bosnia-Herzegovina as a  union of the Croat and Muslim -- that is, Bosniak Muslims --  nations. We agree on that. We agree that we can organize that  union, which will meet the rights and interests of both nations.  We also agree that the state union should be formed as a  composite state union. These are the principles.    We analyzed the principles in greater detail, but we have  not  yet reached accord on certain issues. Therefore, it is too  early to speak about these things. But an important step is  that both sides have decided that such a union is possible, that  it is in the interests of both nations, that it must have a  special relationship with the Republic of Croatia, and that the  union must be set up so as to respect the national criterion in  the internal organization of the state. That means that  Bosnia-Herzegovina would be reorganized on the principle that  there will be two or more federal units that will be set up by  honoring first of all the national criterion as one of the  criteria. [end recording]    [Vranjes] The command of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council]  Vitez Brigade today reported that until 0400 last night, the  Muslim army had shelled the center of the town of Vitez and all  surrounding areas using mortar and howitzer shells of various  calibers. The shelling of Vitez by the Muslim army this morning  is only the continuation of yesterday's shelling when three  civilians were wounded, including a five-year-old girl who  luckily sustained only slight wounds. The shelling caused huge  material damage to residential and industrial facilities.  [passage omitted]</p>

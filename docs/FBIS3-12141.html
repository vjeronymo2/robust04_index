The massacre may harm the Palestinian Israeli  peace talks. It illustrates the need to place the status of holy  Jerusalem on the agenda of the Palestinian-Israeli talks.    The horrendous slaughter of Palestinian worshippers led the  Israelis to seal off the West Bank and Gaza and sent angry  Palestinians marching into the streets. Ironically, more  Palestinians were shot and killed by the Israeli army trying to  quell Palestinian demonstrations.    The shocking incident in which hundreds of worshipers were  injured brought a cascade of protests from international  circles, with many observers expressing fears that the  slaughter, and the resulting anger among the Palestinians, would  undercut peace efforts in the region. The Israeli Government  ought to take all the blame for the attack on Palestinian  worshippers in the Ibrahimi mosque.    Egypt, a country that has a historic role in the region and  that has been actively involved in the peace process, has  strongly denounced the massacre in Hebron on the West Bank.    Commenting on the atrocity, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  stressed the need to combat terrorism, a scourge that has spread  in numerous societies of variant religions and political  doctrines. Musa said the massacre underscores the need to  safeguard Palestinian, not just Israeli, security. Security  claims, he said, are not the exclusive prerogative of Israel.  Musa said that in view of the incident's ugliness and its grave  implications for the peace process in the Middle East, Egypt  will take part in any UN Security Council meeting convened at  the request of Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat. 'Arafat has  called for immediate international action to protect the  Palestinians in the occupied territories.    It seems that the urgency of the Palestinian, Arab, and  international reaction has alerted the Israeli Government to the  hideousness of the carnage. A senior Israeli official made a  statement saying that the Israeli settlers would be wrong to  think that such acts could obstruct the peace talks. Indeed, he  said, the Israeli Government has no option but to accelerate the  peace process, even if this involves further concessions to the  Palestinian side.    The incident demonstrates the drawbacks of Israel's policy  on  settlements. The incident should make Israel carefully consider  removing the Israeli settlements from the Palestinian  territories so that the peace process might remain on the right  track.    What particularly distressed the international community is  that such atrocities inflicted by the Israelis on the  Palestinians may lead sections of the Palestinian community to  lose interest in talks with the Israelis under the current  conditions, that is, as long as Israeli settlements and settlers  are part of the deal.    To conclude, let us state that Egypt, eager to maintain the  peace momentum in the region, is holding intensive contacts with  various sides to preserve a climate conducive to talks and  eventually to peace in the region.</p>

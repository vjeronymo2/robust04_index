			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 Jun (MENA) -- Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas, recently appointed head of the government in Aden,  said that Sanaa has not abided by the cease-fire decision and  continued its attack on Aden this morning, indiscriminately  bombarding the southern residential areas.    At a news conference held in Cairo at noon today, al-'Attas  played a recording of a message by Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih intercepted by the military command in Aden. In  his message, President Salih instructed northern forces to  advance toward the south, continue fighting, and disregard the  UN Security Council cease-fire resolution, claiming that the  Yemeni war is an internal issue.    Al-'Attas said that the people in Aden have joined the army  to check northern aggression. He stressed that the north cannot  settle military operations in its favor for several reasons,  including the geographical vastness of south Yemen.    In his news conference, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas said while  Aden announced its readiness to receive the fact-finding mission  and to facilitate its task for the sake of establishing peace in  Yemen and resorting to dialogue in lieu of war and fighting,  Sanaa refused to heed the UN Security Council resolution and the  advice of the Arab leaders led by President Husni Mubarak,  United Arab Emirates [UAE] President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan al  Nuhayyan, Saudi King Fahd Bin- 'Abd-al-'Aziz, and Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad.    Al-'Attas continued by saying that Sanaa has repeatedly  declared its conditional acceptance of a cease-fire, but it has  revoked this acceptance, using false excuses. These  contradictory stands are adopted by Sanaa's various military,  tribal, and extremist religious elements, al-'Attas added.    Al-'Attas pointed out that the military situation in Yemen  has witnessed a serious flare up over the past 48 hours when  Sanaa used all its destructive weapons, including missiles and  long-range heavy artillery. He noted that residential areas and  utilities have become targets of missiles, warplanes, and  artillery.    He said that the bombardment and burning of the Aden  refinery  is the biggest crime yet, and has shaken the Arab and  international world. He said that the population of al-Dali',  Radfan, Lahij, al-Hiswah, al-Burayqah, al-Waht, Aden, and  Khormaksar had to flee their homes lest they be used as human  shields by what he calls the northern invading soldiers.    Abu-Bakr al-'Attas went on to say in his news conference  that  the northern soldiers have been misguided by the extremist  Islamic groups led by those who claim to be religious such as  'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Uns, and  'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Dulaymi. He said that these men, who are also  teachers of the jurisprudence in Islam, issued a fatwa in the  name of 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Dulaymi, a member of the Yemeni Reform  Grouping which is a partner in the government coalition. The  fatwa notes that the cease-fire is taboo, the killing of the  inhabitants of Aden and the south, who are defending their  rights, is permissible, and that the southern areas are  considered booty.    Al-'Attas added that the world has witnessed the extent of  the damage to coffee plantations in al-Dali' and Radfan and the  wiping out of entire villages in the districts of Subayhi,  Lahij, Shabwah, Abyan, and the outskirts of al-Hutah and Aden.  He said that residential areas in Zinjibar, al-Hutah,  Khormaksar, and Dar al-Amir have become "ghost towns."    He explained that the wounded are filling the hospitals and  that Arab and foreign journalists have relayed images of the  unprecedented crimes perpetrated against the south. He said he  reviewed the details of this military escalation and what he  described as "a war of extermination and total destruction"  during his meetings with President Husni Mubarak, UAE President  Shaykh Zayid Sultan, Saudi and Kuwaiti officials, and the Arab  League secretary general.    Al-'Attas pointed out that Sanaa persistently refuses all  appeals to stop the war, and is dropping missiles on the heads  of the citizens in various southern areas, and ruining the  national economy under the pretext of maintaining the country's  unity. He added that Sanaa is trying to maintain unity over  lakes of blood and piles of corpses of innocent citizens of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] who are holding steadfast  against the aggression.    Regarding the prospect of international recognition of the  DRY, al-'Attas said that this is not the crucial issue now, the  important thing is to end hostilities and to stop the bloodshed  prior to negotiations with the northern leaders over an agenda.    Al-'Attas remarked that the Yemeni union was slaughtered by  the current fighting. He pointed out that the Yemeni people,  despite all this, still believe in the cause of unity but in  another form that is based on mutual understanding and dialogue,  not on guns and bullets.    He said that the people in south Yemen are open-minded and  willing to discuss matters and many issues can be negotiated  after the fighting stops.    Al-'Attas welcomed the dispatch of a UN observer force as a  first step toward attaining peace and stability in the country.    He repeated his accusations that Iraq and Sudan are sending  supplies and reinforcements to the northern forces.    Al-'Attas' news conference was attended by 'Abdallah  al-Asnaj, recently appointed DRY deputy prime minister and  foreign minister; Planning Minister Muhsin Muhammad Bin-Farid;  and Transport and Communications Minister Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Accord reached in Hyundai dispute LABOUR and management at Hyundai Motor reached a tentative wage accord at dawn yesterday as several thousand riot police gathered outside the company's plant ready to suppress a month-long strike. The 11th-hour agreement, which is expected to be approved by the 20,000-member workforce tomorrow, is seen as breaking the back of the labour dispute that has disrupted South Korea's largest industrial group. Hyundai Motor is the biggest of the nine Hyundai companies now engaged in some form of industrial action. The government on Tuesday ordered that Hyundai Motor workers immediately suspend their action or face a confrontion with 10,000 riot police deployed to the car facility in the southeastern city of Ulsan. With the government's threat to use force, labour and management quickly reached a compromise settlement. The company trade union agreed to accept a 4.73 wage increase instead of the 16.5 pay rise it had been seeking. In return, the company increased fringe benefits, including special allowances, higher bonuses, and housing subsidies, and more holidays. Meanwhile, 1,000 police conducted a raid on the facilities of Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry in Changwon to oust 400 workers who had barricaded themselves inside the plant for the past three days. The government said the raid was justified because the company is a defence contractor, whose employees are forbidden by law to strike. Although the new civilian government of Mr Kim Young-sam has promised to improve labour relations, it said its use of emergency powers to end the strike was necessary because the dispute threatened national economic recovery. The dispute has reduced GNP growth by 0.17 per cent and cut exports by 0.32 per cent for 1993, according to the Bank of Korea, the central bank. Hyundai estimates sales losses at Hyundai Motor, the country's leading motor vehicle maker, amount to Won390bn (Pounds 325m), followed by Won78bn at Hyundai Precision &amp; Industry and Won69bn at Hyundai Heavy Industries, its shipbuilding unit.</p>

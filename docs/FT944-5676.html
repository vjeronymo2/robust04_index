			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Technology: Tobacco's holy grail - A look at the lure of the smokeless cigarette There are two big problems with cigarette smoking: it damages the smoker's health and it annoys those who dislike passive smoking. Could a smokeless cigarette be the answer? In 1988 RJ Reynolds Tobacco, US maker of Camel and other cigarette brands, came up with a smokeless cigarette called Premier. RJ Reynolds test-marketed it for several months before resigning itself to the fact that it had unleashed one of the biggest new product flops in US corporate history. Yet RJ Reynolds - like so many smokers - does not give up easily. Last weekend, it emerged that the company had been experimenting with another non-smoking cigarette, this time called Eclipse. According to one report, RJ Reynolds was planning to launch the brand next year. The commercial logic for such a product has bewitched cigarette makers for years. Clearly, if a cigarette could be invented that satisfied users without threatening their health or irritating other people, it would have vast money-making potential. With that in mind, RJ Reynolds spent Dollars 325m (Pounds 210m) developing and marketing its earlier non-smoking cigarette, only to see it fail. In its new incarnation, RJ Reynolds's smokeless cigarette looks and feels much the same as an ordinary cigarette; it even contains tobacco. But at the lighted end, the first half inch or so of the cigarette consists of a piece of carbon in a fibreglass shell. When the cigarette is lit, the charcoal burns at around the same temperature as an ordinary cigarette. But because the charcoal is separated from the rest of the cigarette by a heat barrier, the tobacco does not ignite. Air heated by the charcoal is drawn through into the body of the cigarette and mingles with the tobacco without burning it. All cigarette tobacco contains small amounts of glycerine to keep it moist, but in Eclipse, the proportion of glycerine has been lifted to more than 50 per cent. As a result, when the hot air passes through the tobacco and glycerine mixture, the glycerine gradually vaporises and carries tobacco flavours, nicotine and tar to the smoker. Apart from its construction, Eclipse has several quirks. One is that it does not burn down: instead, it lasts as long as the carbon tip keeps burning, which is about the same amount of time as a conventional cigarette. It does not produce ash, does not give off any smoke from the lit end and does not stain fingers, teeth or furnishings. From a health point of view, RJ Reynolds says each Eclipse cigarette produces between 1mg and 3mg of tar and between 0.1mg and 0.2mg of nicotine, compared with up to 20mg of tar and up to 1.7mg of nicotine for a full flavour cigarette. Significantly, however, there are several brands of ultra light cigarette already on the market with tar and nicotine yields at least as low as this, so Eclipse has little new to offer on this score. Its stronger selling point seems to be the lack of smoke. RJ Reynolds says the vapour given off by the cigarettes is almost, but not completely, odourless. When exhaled, it looks like someone's breath in cool air and disappears almost instantly. Someone walking into a room where people were smoking Eclipse would probably be able to detect only a faint aroma. The trouble is, most of this could have been said of the Premier cigarette too. Like Eclipse, Premier worked by emitting a vapour instead of smoke. Air drawn through the cigarette passed through a burning carbon tip at the lighted end, then went through an aluminium capsule in the body of the cigarette containing beads of glycerine impregnated with tobacco flavourings. The glycerine beads vaporised and carried the tobacco flavour through cooling filters to the smoker. Premier flopped because smokers thought it lacked flavour, and what they could taste, they did not like. There was also a strong resistance to the look and feel of the cigarette: smokers said it burned too hot and they did not like the fact that it did not burn down. RJ Reynolds says it is still not 100 per cent cent happy with Eclipse and is not even certain it will launch it. However, it says it is getting good enough feedback from marketing tests to indicate that smokers would welcome a reduced second-hand smoke cigarette if it tasted at least as good as their existing brand. Many industry analysts are sceptical. 'Part of the allure of smoking is the smoke,' says one. 'If the product doesn't taste good and you don't get that smoking sensation, it isn't going to work.' Yet times have changed since the ill-fated launch of Premier. Second-hand smoke is a much bigger issue than five years ago. In the US, pressure on smokers is mounting by the day: smoking is increasingly outlawed in public places, and there are many situations where it is not tolerated even where it is lawful. A smokeless cigarette could not be lit in an area where smoking was banned, but it could prove acceptable at, for example, a dinner table surrounded by non-smokers. So a cigarette like Eclipse might at least hope to find a market niche among smokers who found themselves faced with lighting up a smokeless cigarette or nothing at all. RJ Reynolds says: 'It is not for everybody. No cigarette is for everybody: that is why there are some 400 brands of cigarette in the US now. But the reduced second-hand smoke cigarette is an option, and no other manufacturer has got anything on the market like it.'</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWNOUT WAS A DOUBLE BLOW TO RAIDERS;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: WITH TIM BROWN HEALTHY, THEY WILL BE STRONGER ON OFFENSE AND KICK  RETURNS.  </P> <P> Tim Brown fields the punt, cuts to his left and takes off down the sideline,  thrusting his hands into the air to celebrate as he crosses the goal line.  </P> <P> After watching Brown accelerate on the practice field, you'd hardly know that  he tore two ligaments in his left knee while returning a kickoff in the  Raiders' 1989 season opener 10 months ago.  </P> <P> As Brown lay on the field waiting to be carted off, his future flashed before  his eyes. "I think the first night was the most difficult night for me," he  said. "After that I said, 'Hey, I've got my degree from Notre Dame, and I know  I can work. I'm not going to be making the kind of money I'm making out here  playing football, but I know I'm going to be doing something.' I tried to take  a positive outlook."  </P> <P> But still there were doubts:  </P> <P>  -- Would the injury rob him of the speed that enabled him to win the Heisman  Trophy in 1987?  </P> <P>  -- Would he still be able to make the slashing moves that made him one of the  NFL's kickoff- and punt-return leaders in 1988?  </P> <P> "The only thing I was really worried about was being able to cut," Brown said.  "I can play this game a little bit slower, but not being able to cut was going  to cause a big problem. But I started being able to make cuts in late January,  and once I realized I could cut, my confidence started to grow."  </P> <P> Brown injured his medial collateral ligament and the posterior cruciate  ligament in his left knee. He ripped the medial collateral ligament off the  bone. This is the ligament that allows the knee to perform split-second cuts.  Actually, Brown may have been fortunate that he tore it from the bone, rather  than snapped it, because doctors were able to reattach the ligament.  </P> <P> After spending two weeks in a cast and four weeks in a brace, Brown began  rehabilitation to rebuild his knee muscles. He pushed himself as hard in  training as he works during games.  </P> <P> "When I was going through it all, I was thinking that I wanted to be able to  get back to the point where one day when I have kids, I can play with them,"  Brown said. "You never think you'll be able to get back on the field, but it's  just amazing how time can heal all things.  </P> <P> "My speed's not the same as what it was, but that's the only thing I think I'm  missing -- my overall speed. But you hardly get a chance to show it out here on  the field because everything's so fast. You hardly ever get to run the 40 or 50  yards that will show your speed."  </P> <P> Raider Coach Art Shell marvels at Brown's comeback.  </P> <P> "Tim looks good," Shell said. "You'd never know the guy was hurt. He's running  like he never had an injury. He worked his butt off to get back to where he is  now. It will be a big plus for our football team if he's healthy."  </P> <P> Brown's teammates also are impressed by his comeback.  </P> <P> "For a guy that blew apart his knee last year, he's bounced back tremendously,"  Raider quarterback Jay Schroeder said. "I think a lot has to do with what he  does in the off-season. He's very dedicated and he works hard. And I think it's  proof because he's come out here and it doesn't look like he's missed a step.  He's running right there along with everyone out here."  </P> <P> The sixth player selected in the 1988 NFL draft, Brown's performance as a  rookie justified the $2.7-million, four-year contract the Raiders gave him.  </P> <P> After acquiring wide receiver Willie Gault from Chicago, there was speculation  that the Raiders would trade Brown to the Washington Redskins for Schroeder,  but they kept Brown.  </P> <P> This was a wise move because Brown got off to an extraordinary start, returning  his first kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown in the Raiders' 1988 opener against  the San Diego Chargers. It was the fourth-longest kickoff return in team  history and the first for a touchdown by a Raider since Derrick Jensen did it  in 1980.  </P> <P> Brown averaged 26.8 yards to lead the NFL in kickoff returns on his way to the  Pro Bowl. He also led the AFC in punt returns and was the leading Raider  receiver with 43 catches.  </P> <P> He broke Gale Sayers' NFL record for most total yards by a rookie with 2,317,  compiling 1,098 yards on kickoff returns, 444 on punt returns, 725 on pass  receptions and 50 on runs from scrimmage.  </P> <P> The Raiders clearly missed Brown's explosive returns last season. Stefon Adams,  who returned kickoffs in place of Brown, ranked next to last in the AFC.  </P> <P> Although Brown will return punts this season, he may be finished with kickoffs.  </P> <P> "I don't want to say I'm done with kickoff returns for good because I don't  want something to whip me," Brown said. "So I'm going to go back and give it  one more shot, but it probably won't be this year.  </P> <P> "I still love (returning kickoffs). That's the most exciting part of the game  -- to see a guy catch a kickoff and go the length of the field. I don't think  you can ask any more than that."  </P> <P> Although wide receiver Mervyn Fernandez did a nice job of filling in for Brown  last season, catching 57 passes for 1,069 yards and nine touchdowns to lead the  team, he was the Raiders' only intermediate pass receiver.  </P> <P> With Brown back, the Raiders have another receiver capable of catching passes  over the middle.  </P> <P> "You always like to think that the team misses you," Brown said. "And I think  there were situations last year where people said, 'Damn, I wish Tim was in on  that play.' "  </P> <P> Schroeder agreed, saying: "We missed Tim Brown a lot. He's a big factor in any  football game, not only for his return capabilities, but because he's a  big-play receiver. He's a guy that you can dump a two-yard route to who can  turn it into 60 yards. There was no question that there were certain things we  couldn't do last season because we didn't have Tim Brown."  </P> <P> Brown came to training camp listed behind Fernandez on the Raider depth chart.  </P> <P> "I'm approaching this year the same way as I approached my rookie year," Brown  said. "I'm coming in as the second receiver behind Mervyn, and whatever they  ask me to do, I'm going to do it.  </P> <P> "There's probably a little pressure because you're not out there every down,  and whenever you get out there you've got to show yourself. But I'm not out  here to prove anything to Mr. (Al) Davis. Mr. Davis knows I can play football.  I don't have anything to prove. Hey, I had a great rookie year. It would be  different if I had played the whole year last year and fumbled every time I  touched the ball, but that's not the situation. I don't have to prove anything  to anyone but myself."  </P> <P> Assistant coach Fred Biletnikoff, a Hall of Fame receiver, said Brown will  improve the Raider passing game this season.  </P> <P> "He looks absolutely great," Biletnikoff said. "He's got his speed and  quickness back, and he's catching the ball really well. I think he's been a big  surprise to everyone. He's made a remarkable comeback.  </P> <P> "We missed him a lot last year. He would have been the difference for us in a  lot of instances in two or three games."  </P> <P> The Raiders hope Brown will make a difference as they try to return to the NFL  playoffs for the first time since 1985.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> Cornerback Terry McDaniel suffered a strained hamstring in practice Thursday,  but the injury isn't believed to be serious. . . . Tight end Mike Dyal, who  held out for three days, signed a two-year contract for about $260,000 a  season. . . . There were no developments in contract talks with the six  unsigned players -- quarterback Steve Beuerlein, tailback Marcus Allen,  fullback Steve Smith, cornerback Mike Haynes, safety Vann McElroy and defensive  end Greg Townsend.  </P></p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall outlines reorganisation of Pacific JUPITER Tyndall Merlin, the fund manager for Pacific Horizon Investment Trust, yesterday announced plans to reorganise the trust's capital structure. Jupiter Tyndall amassed a stake of 25.1 per cent of Pacific Horizons's warrants, which it used to block offers from Martin Currie Pacific investment trust, the latest of which was last week allowed to lapse. The reorganisation would involve issuing zero coupon convertible unsecured loan stock (Culs) in place of nine tenths of the existing ordinary share capital. A subsidiary of Pacific Horizon would then be set up which could tender for up to 60 per cent of the loan stock issued at a price equivalent to 90 per cent of the adjusted net asset value per share of the company. Warrant terms would also be amended so that one warrant upon exercise, could be exchanged for one ordinary share and nine zero Culs. This structure would narrow the discount between Pacific Horizon's share price and its net asset value per share. The shares added 1p to 23p yesterday, the warrants 1p to 10p. Jupiter Tyndall intends to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of Pacific Horizon to consider the reconstruction plans. It will also seek to appoint new directors and seek the resignations of certain existing directors. The board had unanimously recommended the Martin Currie offer in a statement made at the beginning of this month, which also expressed concern at the effect Jupiter Tyndall's management functions could have on its independence.</p>

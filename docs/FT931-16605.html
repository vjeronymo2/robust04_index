Mr Bush, apparently determined to 'leave the desk clean' when he turns over the presidency to Governor Bill Clinton on January 20, has been pushing to meet the January 15 deadline he last month set with British Prime Minister John Major for final resolution of the most important issues. After signing the Start 2 nuclear arms accord in Russia at the weekend, the president stopped off in Paris to discuss the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade with French President Francois Mitterrand.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Okinawa Municipal Assembly (with Heiwa Yaga as  speaker) called an extraordinary session at 1800 [0900 GMT] on  the afternoon of 4 April at which members unanimously adopted a  resolution and a statement of opinions strongly protesting to  U.S. military authorities about the U.S. Air Force F-15 fighter  crash in the morning.    An assembly delegation is scheduled to present these  documents to the U.S. Forces Okinawa Area Coordinator, the Naha  Defense Facilities Administration Bureau, the prefectural  governor, and the prefectural assembly speaker on the morning of  5 April.    The resolution and statement of opinions point out: "The  Kadena ammunition dump is located near the accident site, and in  neighboring areas there are also stock farms, recreation  centers, and villages. As a single mistake could have resulted  in a disaster involving citizens, it was a serious shock to our  people and they are now uneasy."    As well as criticizing the U.S. military for its deficient  maintenance and management of military aircraft, the documents  reiterate the people's great anger.    "Okinawa city residents have been compelled to coexist with  the largest U.S. military base in the Far East. And as far as  they are concerned, they feel this accident vividly demonstrates  their fears that inevitably result from the existence of  military bases."    Touching on previous accidents, as well as the fact that  military aircraft regularly fly over residential areas, the  documents state "our people are continually exposed to the  danger of being deprived of their lives and property."    Therefore, while strongly demanding that measures be taken  to  prevent any further accidents, the assembly wants the cause of  the accident be publicized for prefectural residents as soon as  possible, maintenance work on all aircraft strengthened, and a  ban on aircraft flying until proper maintenance work is ensured.</p>

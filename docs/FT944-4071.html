			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (6): Prospects for next year 'promising'  -Offices / 1995 is beginning to look like a good bet for recovery Recovery in the UK's office markets has been promised almost every year since the economy collapsed. Cynics might say forecasters are bound to get it right some time, but 1995 is beginning to look like a good bet. As the economy creeps back to growth, occupiers are beginning to take extra space or are switching to better quality buildings because they believe prices are about to rise. In fact, some regions have already seen rents increase on well-located new buildings. The Midlands and south, for example, recorded 3 per cent rises over the past 12 months, says Erdman Lewis. Scotland and Wales are even more buoyant, with increases of 8 and 10 per cent respectively. But this has to be put in perspective. Offices are cheaper in real terms than for the past 30 years, and less than 45 per cent of levels set at the height of the 1973 boom. They were almost bound to stop falling as company profits recovered and service employment bounced back. The huge surplus of space is beginning to dwindle, and some regional centres are running out of modern buildings. Chesterton calculated a mid-summer vacancy rate of 11.4 per cent in regional centres compared with 13.8 per cent 12 months earlier. The number of investment deals also rose by 28 per cent in the same period. There is even talk of developers 'poised' to restart speculative building, but with 86m sq ft on the drawing board and funding hard to winkle out of banks or institutions, most are likely to wait for pre-lets - or at least an extended period of rental growth. The longer they wait, however, the more potential margins are eroded by rising building costs. The main factor in their favour is that most empty space on the market is second-hand, a good deal of which will probably never be let. Tenants take obsolete premises when rents are soaring and space is scarce, but not when they can force desperate landlords into giving them new offices almost as cheaply. This complex picture resolves into a 'promising' prospect for the industry over the next 12 to 18 months, says property consultant Healey &amp; Baker. 'Oversupply is bound to subdue the recovery in rent levels but for modern space the balance between supply and demand points clearly to positive real growth in 1995,' says the consultant in its current Prime Research report. Secondary space shows little of that promise, however, requiring a massive increase in demand to restore some kind of balance. It would help if owners thought more seriously about switching to other uses. Residential conversions are becoming almost commonplace in London but the value gap between housing and offices has not yet persuaded owners in the regions to follow suit. Fears are rising that lack of new development may damage some regional centres. Shortages in Leeds have pushed up rents by Pounds 1 a sq ft to Pounds 18.50 this year and investor interest has hardened prime yields from 6.5 per cent down to 5.75 per cent, says Richard Ellis. But unless some of the 1.9m sq ft of planned space begins soon, the city could lose tenants to rivals centres, says Richard Ellis Leeds director Mike Hartley. Developers appear to have moved more quickly in Birmingham, where more than 1m sq ft could emerge over the next couple of years to meet shortages which have held headline rents at 20 a sq ft. Four important schemes have also started in Manchester, where top headline rents are Pounds 21 a sq ft. More than Pounds 80m also went into 10 investment deals in the first half of the year, says Richard Ellis, but like most cities, deals are being held back more by lack of product than desire to invest. Commitment by leading tenants to take space in centres such as Glasgow and Edinburgh may improve matters next year, but only by reducing stock even further to around a year's supply, says Healey &amp; Baker. Cardiff has seen some of the most marked rent increases in the UK, helping push Welsh rates up by 3.3 per cent this year because of infrastructure improvements. They still stand well below Bristol, despite a 25 per cent drop in rents here since 1991. And the gap could widen again, adds H &amp; B, as rents take off again in the next 12 months. Leicester and Nottingham have made the East Midlands the UK's fastest growing region over the past six months, with rent rises of 4.7 per cent.</p>

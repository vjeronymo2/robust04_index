This news caused anger among the Serb fighters in the area  of  Benkovac who wanted to retaliate by attacking Croatian troops  because of this barbarism. As ISKRA has learned from the Serb  Krajina army liaison officer, Mladen Kalapac, the Serb side  immediately reacted by demanding an immediate halt to the  torching of the Serb villages.    UN Protection Force representatives promised they would most  urgently get involved in preventing the torching of the villages  of Kasic and Islam Grcki.</p>

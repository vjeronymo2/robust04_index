			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lourdes Edith Rudino] </F>   [Text] The Prosecutor General's Office (PGR) has decided  not to take legal action against Agriculture and Hydraulic  Resources (SARH) Secretary Carlos Hank Gonzalez and his private  secretary Juan Carlos Gomez Aranda because there is no evidence  of the crimes alleged by the National Action Party (PAN) a few  days ago.    Last night, Gonzalez himself reported that the charges  against him are baseless because the only evidence offered by  PAN was a photocopy of what is supposed to be a card belonging  to Gomez Aranda. He said, however, that the document is only a  blurred copy, which is no evidence whatsoever.    Gonzalez had previously been supported by the Institutional  Revolutionary Party (PRI) through Fernando Ortiz Aranda,  president of the National Executive Committee, who said there  was no evidence that he had misused SARH funds or equipment to  support PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo. The PRI  leader referred to the charges against the SARH secretary as "an  action seeking political sensationalism for electoral purposes."    The PGR said that, according to preliminary investigation  No.  2979/94, lodged at table 45 of the Special Prosecutor's Office  for Crimes Committed by Public Servants [Fiscalia Especial de  Delitos Cometidos por Servidores Publicos] and filed as case No.  41/II/94, the Federal Attorney General's Office decided that  there is no basis to the charges other than PAN's accusations,  which makes the case "weak and unsubstantiated."    At a news conference, Gonzalez said Gomez Aranda did, in  fact, work in support of Zedillo's candidacy, but did so outside  his eight hours of SARH work and that the supplies were from  Gomez Aranda's private office where certain communications  originated. He said the report was simply an instrument to try  to belittle "some people, basically me, and to see whether the  embarrassment would generate a conflict within the PRI."  Gonzales added that attempts were made to divide the party, but  "they did not manage to and will not be able to."    Gonzalez explained that the funds used to pay for the  pro-Zedillo advertisement that appeared in 10 Mexico City  newspapers were from his personal funds and funds from five  other persons, whom he did not wish to identify and who, as a  group of friends, decided to invite 51 other persons to sign the  advertisement.    Gonzalez said he had handed over as evidence in his defense  a  copy of check No. 222 from his personal account at the National  Bank of Mexico (Banamex) for 236,144 pesos made out to Ferrer  Publicity, the firm that contracted the advertisement.    He said he is not interested in countersuing the PAN,  because  "I do not like wasting time." He emphasized the difference  between his role as a private citizen and his work as a public  official, which does not prevent him from lending political  support. Gonzalez added he will continue to support his party  and candidate all his life. Even though the news conference  lasted only 20 minutes, Gonzalez appeared nervous with  reporters' questions.</p>

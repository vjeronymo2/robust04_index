			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 1 (YONHAP) -- North Korean leader Kim  Il-song is expected to visit China in May, a diplomatic source  here said on Sunday.    China had invited Kim to talk with him about the North  Korean  nuclear problem and ways for China to help North Korea which is  suffering from economic difficulties, according to the source.    He quoted Chinese Premier Li Peng as having said to South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam during his visit to China in last  March that China had asked for Kim Il-song's visit to China.    But North Korea judged that it is untimely for Kim Il-song  to  visit China shortly after South Korean President Kim visited  Beijing, Li was quoted as saying.    Li expected that the North Korean president would visit  China  in an appropriate time.    The source said, "the Chinese Government recently sent a  senior military official to Pyongyang to persuade on North  Korean officials to give up alleged nuclear development. I  understand that Kim Il- song's visit to China is being pushed  for in this context."    Meanwhile, China asked South Korea to postpone the visit of  Mun Chung-su, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Liberal  Party (DLP), to China because of the Kim Il-song's visit, the  source said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Conservative Party [CP] in the Cape has demanded  that APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army] be declared a  banned organization with immediate effect. The party says in a  statement that APLA and Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation;  ANC military wing] members who seek asylum in Transkei after  committing acts of terror should be arrested by the South  African Police. The party denounced negotiations between the  government and the ANC [African National Congress] and PAC  [Pan-Africanist Congress] and called for action against the two  organizations.    In a separate statement the CP appealed to whites to stop  using trains as, according to it, the security situation on the  railways has deteriorated to such an extent that whites are no  longer safe while using the service. The CP's chief spokesman  on transport, Mr. Joseph Chiole, said that whites who were  compelled to use rail transport should arm themselves and not  travel alone.</p>

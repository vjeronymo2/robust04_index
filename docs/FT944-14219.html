			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: New York The US bond market is settling back into the gloomy conviction that the Federal Reserve is going to raise rates, possibly very shortly. Last week's data on the domestic economy were too strong for comfort and in the background is a factor which could prove just as decisive, the ominous slide of the dollar. Last week, the dollar dipped below DM1.50 for the first time this year, having started at DM1.74 in January. Against the yen it is now decisively below the Y100 mark, sliding last week as low as Y97. While the Fed disclaims any specific exchange rate targets, it must be getting close to deciding that enough is enough. That apart, the big figure this week is US third-quarter GDP on Friday. A fall is expected from 4.1 per cent annualised growth in the second quarter to around 2.8 per cent. This would still represent growth of over 4 per cent year-on-year. A danger signal could be the strength of consumer spending, given the level of retail sales and the rise in employment. There should be further guidance on this on Tuesday, with the figures on consumer confidence. Other figures due are the employers' cost index on Tuesday, durable goods orders on Wednesday and money supply data on Thursday. The general picture, the market fears, could be of economic strength asking to be curbed.</p>

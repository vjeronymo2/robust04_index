			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Erik Derijcke, secretary of state for </F> development aid, by Didier Grogna; place and date not given:  "Derijcke: `Alternate Development Cooperation'" -- first five  paragraphs are L'ECHO introduction]    [Excerpts] Erik Derijcke was able to assess in Rwanda the  full extent of the path which still has to be covered before the  democratization movements are accompanied by real development in  the poorest countries. At present, cooperation boils down to  humanitarian aid in many cases. It is aid for survival, but not  development aid.    In many situations, the problems encountered are also not  limited to national borders. While accompanying Foreign  Minister Willy Claes to Kigali, the secretary of state for  development aid had the opportunity to reaffirm that Belgium is  the state which grants most aid to Rwanda. In these conditions,  our country has the right to give a clear message: Things must  change.    For Derijcke, the institutional vacuum prevailing in Rwanda  as in other countries prevents action worthy of the name.  "Without an interlocutor, you can give immediate aid to the  populations but you cannot do anything else," the secretary of  state explained.    With a few weeks to go before the negotiations on the second  financial section of Lome, Erik Derijcke gave us his impression  on the state of this convention and the lines which Belgium  intends to follow in acting in the cooperation sphere. In  short: Agriculture, education, and health will be the  spearheads of an approach which is more regional, more  integrated, and longer term. In addition, the populations, and  particularly the women, will have to be involved in the plans.    For Erik Derijcke, the most difficult thing is to make the  populations understand the cooperation policy. "We must try to  bridge the gap between problems and policy," he said as a  preamble.    [Grogna] Does Europe have the means of pursuing an effective  cooperation policy?    [Derijcke] I think that the means exist. The European  Development Fund (FED) is by far the biggest fund in the world.  Belgium alone contributes some 3 billion Belgian francs [BFr] to  it. It is undoubtedly possible to do a great deal with such  resources. There is also the Center for Industrial Development,  which provides aid to entrepreneurs wishing to try a venture in  the ACP [African, Caribbean, and Pacific] countries. But these  are bodies which are perhaps not working at full stretch.  [passage omitted]    [Grogna] Africa is lagging behind. Is this not the result of  the policy pursued for 30 years by the former colonists?    [Derijcke] Africa's weakness probably stems from responses  which we have had for 30 years. I admit we made mistakes during  decolonization which was aimed, primarily, at maintaining the  advantages of the former colonists. But I reject statements  that the Africans are our brothers. After 30 years, I think it  is old-fashioned and pointless. This is a tone of dependence  which does not encourage the Africans to make efforts for their  development.    In Asia or Latin America, this policy of dependence did not  exist and the opposition movements developed sooner. Today,  these parts of the world are reaping the rewards of that.    [Grogna] Africa's geographical situation has also had a  negative impact...    [Derijcke] The geopolitical situation was devastating for  sub-Saharan Africa. The countries were divided into two camps,  between the West and the East, thus creating greater dependence.  Then, when the Berlin Wall fell, most of these countries were  left out.    The European countries have always tried to dominate the  African countries which are now paying the price of our mistakes.    To realize this, you just have to look at what is happening  in the countries in the CFA franc area. That was another form  of domination. Today, these 13 states are faced with reality  and are suffering as a result.    What Belgium has done in Central Africa was also the result  of this policy. When cooperation was halted, Zaire was  receiving BFr3 billion per year, of which 2 billion were for  Belgian aid workers alone. That was not very sensible when  hundreds of African students were coming out of our  universities. It would have been better to help them to use  their knowledge.    In general, neocolonialism has had many negative  consequences.    [Grogna] At present, we should probably compensate and help  the populations....    [Derijcke] We are trying. But it is very difficult to  convince a certain African political class to think differently.  The whole tragedy of Lome lies in the fact that we are talking  with a political class which rejects change and not with the  populations.    I am convinced that development should call for joint  responsibility. It must be put back into its cultural context.  This is the success of Asia where cooperation is entirely  different because the leaders know what they want. In Africa,  we have always said what we wanted for them.    [Grogna] Do you think that opinion is ready to change in  Belgium?    [Derijcke] I think so. In the Belgian Parliament too,  because it is composed of a class of deputies who no longer have  very close ties with the former colonies. But, to ensure that  the debate on joint responsibility, complementarity, and  consistency succeeds, the main development bodies must think the  same thing.    It is only when these big multilateral institutions bring  about a responsible aid policy that we will be able to succeed.    I think it would be a complete illusion to think that  Belgium  could single-handedly bring about economic recovery in Rwanda,  or Burundi, or Zaire. We must work in a complementary way. This  is the most fundamental debate which I tried to introduce at the  European level during the Belgian presidency.    [Grogna] Are the other countries prepared to follow your  lead?    [Derijcke] I have observed a change of thinking. There are  different strategies within the European Council of Ministers.  On the one hand there are countries which do not have much of a  colonial past like Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and  Belgium -- a group which will be strengthened by the countries  which will join the Union. This group runs counter to the two  big powers. Britain tries to sublimate its cooperation policy  by a nonpolicy. Its recent adventure with the supply of arms to  Malaysia is significant at this level. Finally, the French have  great problems. Even for such a powerful country it is  impossible to try to solve the economic problems in the CFA  franc area countries single-handedly. The political change in  the thinking of the French politicians is significant. They are  obliged to call on their partners.    [Grogna] This collaboration probably also would enable  better  use to be made of financial resources.    [Derijcke] Indeed we do need international cooperation to  avoid paying for the same problems several times over. Economic  destabilization and industrial backwardness lead to political  destabilization. As a result, we have to intervene with  humanitarian aid, take part in the demobilization of the army,  and think of cooperation. When that does not succeed, we have  to intervene with emergency aid. It would be more useful to  follow the same paths to achieve the same objectives. [passage  omitted]    [Grogna] There is sometimes an impression that Belgium is  currently moving toward the regions which it knows least well,  like Southeast Asia, at the expense of Africa. Even if you  refuse to talk of historical ties, we have expertise in those  countries. Would it not be more effective to concentrate on them?    [Derijcke] Contrary to a widespread idea, Belgium has not  abandoned Africa. More than 80 percent of our aid is still  devoted to it. Belgium is the biggest per capita provider of  aid to Africa.    Our presence on the other continents is more limited. In  Latin America, we devote our attentions to three countries  (Ecuador, Bolivia, and Suriname) where we are achieving good  results. In Asia, we have strongly reduced our aid to Indonesia  and Thailand, but we have started cooperation with countries of  the future like Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. We are also  resuming cooperation with the Philippines -- a country which is  making great efforts and which is important for our small- and  medium-sized enterprises.    [Grogna] Is it not a mistake to associate democracy and  human  rights with development? The Asian countries are not models of  democracy and yet they are developing.    [Derijcke] I have worked a great deal at the European level  for the integration of human rights in cooperation policies. I  attach importance to the problem of respecting human rights.  However, the problem of democratization is less clear. In my  view, if there is a desire to improve the existing situation,  that is important in itself. In Indonesia, we received an  outright rejection of our human rights policy.    [Grogna] Do you think human rights are the key to  development?    [Derijcke] It is impossible to pursue an honorable policy if  there is not stability and peace.    [Grogna] Is Belgium accepted in the community of big nations  in the cooperation sphere?    [Derijcke] Absolutely. Unlike some big states, nobody is  afraid of Belgium. In addition, we have considerable resources.  We are in demand everywhere. Our African experience is  recognized. In Asia, our policy in the sphere of energy,  health, education...interests many countries.    States in which we had no presence are calling on us. Mali,  Burkina-Faso, Benin, and Togo are asking to cooperate with us.  In this region, we are working on the basis of integrated  cooperation.    [Grogna] What does that mean?    [Derijcke] These are countries which experience the same  problems. We are trying to help them in the same way. It is  important to realize that many cannot overcome their problems  unless they try to solve their problems in cooperation with  their neighbors.    You just have to look at the example of Rwanda and Burundi.  They are now dependent on international aid. But their future  probably will depend on integrated development with Uganda,  Tanzania, and southeastern Zaire.    The economic integration of the southern African countries  (Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi) is a success which should  lead other regions to consider this solution.    [Grogna] We are calmly approaching the negotiation of the  second financial section of the Lome Convention. What is your  attitude to these countries?    [Derijcke] Three essential points must be highlighted.    We will insist on including the reference to human rights in  Article 5 of the Convention. This is a priority, especially  because we are stricter in cooperation with non-ACP countries  than with countries which are members of the Convention.    In addition, we want to administer the payments more  efficiently. We want to help the poorest countries but not  without results. We will therefore be stricter and will only  pay when there are real opportunities to use the resources.    We must also plan in a more rational way and urge a degree  of  economic discipline. We must revitalize the economies, taking  account also of the GATT results: To help the Africans to  export in this new world order of trade. That is why we must  organize basic production more effectively and revive exports.  The nongovernmental organizations are afraid of this policy,  fearing that the Africans will be swamped by our imported  products. Belgium does not intend to end its food aid (to which  75 percent of our aid is devoted), but we must also prepare  Africa to take part in world trade. I do not want it to  continue to be treated as a powerless continent.    [Grogna] Do you think that the ACP countries are prepared to  agree to discuss a reorganization of the convention?    [Derijcke] This is probably the biggest problem. However, I  think we must have discussions to achieve progress.  Unfortunately, the ACP countries are not asking questions, are  not making their ideas heard.    [Grogna] This probably shows that the political class has  not  changed much in recent years.    [Derijcke] Indeed. The political class is often isolated, it  does not even understand the population's needs. Whether you  like it or not, development toward democratization is necessary.  This will take time. We know that and we do not want to hurry  anything. We are just waiting for positive signs, the  establishment of bases for discussion. We do not want elections  at any cost in all the countries. Elections are the culmination  of a long process. We are just asking the countries to start  the process.    [Grogna] Do you believe in the future of the ACP? Is it not  a term which is now meaningless?    [Derijcke] The term comes from the former colonies, but no  longer means anything. I would like to play down the notion of  the ACP. The African, Caribbean, and Pacific countries are  totally different. However, I do not want to call into question  the Lome Convention in which I firmly believe: It is a superb  tool which has enormous resources. It must change, while  safeguarding the idea of it.    [Grogna] Aside from human rights, what are the priorities  for  ensuring that bilateral cooperation functions well in general?    [Derijcke] Our bilateral cooperation stands up well.  However, I would still like to develop along several lines:  Fewer countries and better specialization; changing our  university cooperation (reducing the number of African students  in our country and investing in quality education in their  countries to prevent cultural disaffection); imparting new  dynamism to our aid workers and reducing their presence in a  single country, where they eventually forget their mission....    [Grogna] Will Belgium have a presence in Zaire?    [Derijcke] If a government worthy of the name is installed,  we will be present. This does not mean we are now no longer  doing anything. We are virtually the only country giving them  aid. In 15 months, Belgium has paid out some BFr750 million for  Zaire.    [Grogna] Does the institutional vacuum not present a  problem?    [Derijcke] It presented a problem but the law now enables me  to work directly with the Higher Council of the Republic.</p>

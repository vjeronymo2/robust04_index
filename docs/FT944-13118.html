			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese output surge seen China's aluminium production would grow by nearly 50 per cent by the year 2000, at which time it should have caught up with the country's booming consumption of the metal, Mr Henglong Li, a director of the China National Non-ferrous Metals Industry Corporation, said in Atlanta yesterday. However China's production of alumina (aluminium oxide) would not be able to keep pace with this growth and imports would continue at a high level. Last year China produced 1.8m tonnes of alumina and imported 970,000 tonnes, said Mr Li. In the first half of this year imports probably reached more than 1m tonnes. Speaking at Alumitech '94, Mr Li said China's aluminium output last year was 1.22m tonnes while consumption, after many years of growing at an annual rate of 10 per cent, was 1.35m. He pointed out that to reach its production target China would have to increase aluminium smelting capacity by about 100,000 tonnes a year until the year 2000. Present firm plans included expanding annual capacity at the Qingtongxia smelter from 100,000 tonnes to 220,000 and at the Baiyan smelter from 50,000 to 100,000. Mr Li said his group also hoped to build a new smelter with annual capacity of 125,000 or 250,000 tonnes, together with a coal-fired power station, at Shanxi.</p>

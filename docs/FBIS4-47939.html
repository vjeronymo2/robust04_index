			<p>BFN     [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] has asked the IEC  [Independent Electoral Commission] chairman, Mr. Justice Johan  Kriegler, for an immediate police investigation into allegations  of massive cheating at the IEC Headquarters in Johannesburg.  The IFP said that there was increasing evidence of fraud to  boost the ANC's votes. The party said it had received  information from IEC officials alleging that the officials at  headquarters had cheated with the results, until Mr. Piet  Collaigne of the IEC was called in to stop the practice.    The IFP also alleged that two card carrying ANC members  employed by the IEC had asked the commission to declare the  election in KwaZulu-Natal null and void. The IEC has denied the  allegations, calling them false and defamatory. The IFP was  asked to make any information it had available to the IEC and  the police immediately.</p>

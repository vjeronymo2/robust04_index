			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, June 21 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb authorities  blocked humanitarian and UN convoys from entering Sarajevo last  weekend in retaliation for the Bosnian Army's offensive in the  northeastern part of the country, a UN spokesman said Tuesday  [21 June]. Major Rob Annink, spokesman for the UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) said all Serb checkpoints into Sarajevo,  especially those leading to central Bosnia, were shut down from  Friday to Monday. He said the measure did not completely  isolate the Bosnian capital as the UN can fly in supplies and  convoys have been using a mountain route that leads to the city  since March. But Annink added that the Serb move was deemed  serious enough for Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the  commander of UN troops in Bosnia, to take up the matter Tuesday  with the special UN envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi.    Rose has also called for a high-level meeting between  Bosnia's Serbs and Moslems Saturday to try and shore up an  uneasy 11-day-old ceasefire that is showing signs of fraying.    The Serbs and Moslems have been locked in heavy fighting for  five days near northeastern Mount Ozren which overlooks the  region of Doboj, Ribnica and Gradaca.    Annink said UN observers deployed in the region have set up  a  radar to pinpoint the origin of the shelling. He said the UN  had registered a threefold increase in ceasefire violations in  and around Sarajevo in the last 24 hours, with one Bosnian Army  soldier reported dead.    Meanwhile General Andre Soubirou, the commander of UN troops  in Sarajevo, told reporters Tuesday that Serb troops were  probably responsible for sniper shots over the weekend that left  one person dead and three others injured in the capital. He  said the shooting was apparently a reminder by the Serbs that  despite a ceasefire imposed on the capital in February under the  threat of a NATO strike, they still could control the city.</p>

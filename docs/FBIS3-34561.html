He said that the  threats made by the outlaws will not frighten the police organs,  which have decided to confront and chase them firmly and  decisively everywhere and at all times.    In his meeting with the press delegation accompanying the  Austrian president, who is presently visiting Cairo, the  Egyptian interior minister said that the security organs always  have the initiative and are completely ready to confront the  remnants of terrorism. He noted that the perpetrators of the  incidents carried out by terrorists have been arrested and many  crimes that were planned have been foiled.    Al-Alfi also noted that a large quantity of weapons and  equipment were used in these operations, stressing that the  crimes being perpetrated now are a reaction meant only to prove  that they still exist. He added: We have complete information  about them.    In reply to a question about the countries that support and  sponsor the terrorist groups, the interior minister said that a  number of countries are supporting and sponsoring the terrorists  but he refused to divulge these countries' names, saying that  there are diplomatic contacts to sign security agreements on the  extradition of these elements.    The Egyptian interior minister denied what the human rights  report said about torture in Egyptian prisons. He stressed that  Egypt is a state where the rule of law prevails, which has an  ancient civilization, and which is among the leading countries  that care about human rights inside and outside prisons. He  said that these criminals inflict injuries on themselves as part  of a plan to terrorize the police commands and officers. He  noted that the human rights report was only concerned with the  protection of defendants but did not mention the victims of  their operations. He added that the perpetrators of many crimes  had been apprehended and found to have weapons and explosives  and were brought to trial, while many policemen had been killed  in defense of innocent citizens, legitimacy, and law and order.    Hasan al-Alfi stressed that cases of torture in Egypt, the  state where the rule of law prevails, are not closed because of  the statute of limitations. He said: If there are individual  mistakes or excesses in the application of the law, then those  making these mistakes and excesses are brought to account and  punished in accordance with the law.    Hasan al-Alfi described the terrorist organizations as gangs  that violate the teachings and tenets of religion, adding that  the crimes solved confirm that the police are in control.    In reply to a question about the terrorists' names and  leaders, the interior minister said that the terrorist groups'  leaders are abroad and are known to the security organs. They  also recruit people in the country in the name of religion,  which is innocent of them.    The minister stressed that these groups' objective is to  ruin  development and stability in Egypt, adding that these terrorist  groups do not exist in Egypt alone but that many countries are  targeted by terrorism.    On the nationality of these terrorist elements, he said that  they are Egyptians and their leaders abroad are recruiting some  Egyptians and non-Egyptian under false and baseless pretexts.    In reply to another question about the possibility of having  a dialogue with the terrorist groups, the interior minister  rejected the idea of a dialogue with these terrorists groups.  He asked: A dialogue with whom? With criminals? A dialogue  with gangs?    He added that a dialogue with them is rejected because they  are not Muslims and have no official, constitutional, or legal  status and they are dealt with according to the law. He  stressed his intention to continue to liquidate these elements  and to bring them to court.    Hasan al-Alfi said that there are no religiously based  parties in Egypt and that no organization or society that is  based on religion and practices political activity is recognized.    The interior minister appealed to the foreign press to  convey  the true picture of the situation in Egypt and to expose these  terrorist groups' practices.</p>

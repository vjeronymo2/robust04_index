			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Palestinian curbs 'hurt Israel' ISRAEL'S treasury forecast yesterday that a closure imposed on the occupied territories two months ago is slowing Israeli economic growth in 1993 and accelerating inflation. It said the closure, limiting the number of Palestinians from the territories allowed to work in Israel, had mostly hurt building and farming sectors. The treasury report, given to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's cabinet on Sunday, predicts the closure will slow economic growth by 0.5 to 1 percentage point while boosting annual inflation by 2 to 3 percentage points. For the moment, however, the economic strictures are confined to the Palestinians. At Rafiah's fruit and vegetable market in the Gaza strip, dozens of boxes of loquats and peaches have been slowly spoiling for a week. 'There are no buyers because there is no money. And there is no money because nobody in Gaza can work these days,' says one of the market stallholders. Introduced following the killings of 15 Israelis by Palestinians in March, the closure was initially welcomed by some Palestinians. Israel, they reasoned, was, in effect, returning to its pre-1967 borders, acknowledging that it could not guarantee its own security. Surely withdrawal could not now be far away. But two months on, harsh economic reality has replaced such thinking. Before the closure, about 130,000 Palestinians from the occupied territories crossed the checkpoints daily to jobs in building, agriculture and industry inside Israel. Today, only about 45,000 have permits. The rest are jobless and, after Sunday's Israeli cabinet rejection of proposals to award them unemployment pay, increasingly short of cash. Palestinian economists told Mr Ilter Turkmen, the visiting commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works agency, last week that they estimated the closure was costing them Dollars 5m a day in lost wages and other side-effects. 'And with their depressed economy,' noted Mr Turkmen, 'that is a huge sum.' Sunday's cabinet meeting did approve the allocation of Shk30m (Pounds 7m) to create 20,000 jobs in the territories in the next two months. But even assuming that many jobs can be created so quickly, this would leave another 65,000 Palestinians out of work as a direct result of the closure. Mr Rabin is apparently so delighted by the marked reduction in Palestinian attacks on Israelis since the closure began that he would like to maintain it for weeks if not months to come. But the policy is facing growing opposition from a variety of sources. The UN secretary general, the UNRWA commissioner-general, the president of the International Red Cross and the US State Department have all in recent days urged Israel to ease conditions in the territories. The Israeli security forces too, are expressing the concern at the 'pressure cooker' atmosphere building up among jobless, impoverished, frustrated Palestinians.</p>

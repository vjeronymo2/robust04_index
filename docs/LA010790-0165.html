			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> BACKCOURT LEADS PISTONS OVER KNICKS  </P> <P> Joe Dumars scored 29 points and Isiah Thomas added 20 as the Detroit Pistons  defeated the New York Knicks, 117-106, Saturday night at Auburn Hills, Mich.  </P> <P> It was the Pistons' fifth consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Dumars, who scored 10 points in the fourth quarter, had five points during a  15-5 run that put away the Knicks. Dumars also made 13 of 13 free throws.  </P> <P> Patrick Ewing scored 29 points for the Knicks. He scored 20 points in the first  half, but appeared to tire in the fourth quarter when he scored only three.  </P> <P> The win lifted the Pistons to within percentage points of the Chicago Bulls for  first place in the Central Division.  </P> <P> "We got great support from a lot of people," Detroit Coach Chuck Daly said.  "Any time you beat New York, you do a lot of things well offensively and  defensively. We needed the win."  </P> <P> The victory was Detroit's ninth in 10 games and gave the Pistons a 22-11  record. That's the same record they had after 33 games last season, when they  posted the best record in the league and won their first NBA title.  </P> <P> The Knicks had won 10 of their last 11 and four consecutive on the road.  </P> <P> "We got our tails kicked," Knick Coach Stu Jackson said. "They played well and  we played well in spots. Down at the end, their defense was better than ours.  They're a very physical team."  </P> <P> Utah 123, Denver 120 -- Karl Malone capped a 48-point performance with a  three-point play with eight seconds left in overtime to lead the Jazz at  Denver.  </P> <P> Malone made a layup off John Stockton's 15th assist and was fouled by Eddie  Hughes. Malone added the free throw, giving Utah a 123-120 lead, and Todd  Lichti missed a desperation three-point shot for Denver.  </P> <P> Trailing 120-115, Denver tied the score on two free throws by Lichti and a  three-point basket by Hughes with 1:02 remaining.  </P> <P> Walter Davis scored 36 points and Fat Lever added 19 for Denver. It was the  Nuggets' second loss in 14 home games.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 118, Chicago 111 -- Jack Sikma scored 21 points and led a  third-quarter surge to snap the Bucks' eight-game losing streak against Central  Division rivals.  </P> <P> The Bucks' victory was their first at home over the Bulls since February 1987.  Alvin Robertson, Jeff Grayer and Ricky Pierce had 18 points apiece for the  Bucks.  </P> <P> Michael Jordan led the Bulls with 35 points and Bill Cartwright added 18.  Jordan twisted a knee with three minutes left in the first quarter. He iced it  for four minutes, returned, and finished the first half with 13 points,  although he was limping noticeably when he left the court at halftime.  </P> <P> Charlotte 117, Indiana 111 -- The Hornets, playing at home, beat a team with a  winning record for the first time this season, leaving Pacers Coach Dick  Versace to vent the frustration of four consecutive losses at referee Hank  Armstrong at the end of the game.  </P> <P> Versace had to be restrained by one of his players, LaSalle Thompson.  </P> <P> San Antonio 109, Minnesota 96 -- David Robinson, Terry Cummings and Willie  Anderson scored 22 points each as the Spurs, leaders of the Midwest Division,  matched last season's victory total.  </P> <P> The Spurs are 21-7 with 3 1/2 months left in the season after finishing a  franchise-worst 21-61 last season.  </P> <P> With the Spurs leading, 80-75, Robinson put the game away with nine consecutive  points. He had 15 in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves' Scott Roth led all  scorers with 24 points and Tony Campbell added 20.  </P> <P> The Spurs led, 56-40, at halftime as Caldwell Jones contributed eight points  and three blocked shots. The second one gave Jones 1,500 career blocked shots.  Jones, 39, is the oldest player in the NBA. He finished with 11 points in 25  minutes.  </P> <P> Houston 124, Philadelphia 119 -- Akeem Olajuwon had 29 points and 15 rebounds  and his three-point play with 22 seconds left in overtime sparked the Rockets  at Houston.  </P> <P> Buck Johnson scored a career-high 28 points, Otis Thorpe had 22 and Sleepy  Floyd added 19 and a career-high 19 assists for the Rockets.  </P> <P> Atlanta 105, New Jersey 96 -- Moses Malone led the Hawks with 26 points and 12  rebounds, hitting 12 of 12 from the free-throw line, to hand the visiting Nets  their fifth consecutive loss.  </P> <P> John Long, playing his first game for the Hawks after signing a 10-day  contract, hit a layup to start the winning rally with 11:24 to play, and  Alexander Volkov converted a three-point play to put the Hawks in front for  good.  </P> <P> Cleveland 123, Orlando 112 -- Rookie Chucky Brown scored a season-high 30  points and Steve Kerr scored all of his career-high 19 in the fourth quarter at  Orlando.  </P> <P> Brown, a second-round pick from North Carolina State, hit 12 of 17 shots to  finish nearly 24 points over his average.  </P> <P> Kerr topped his previous career high of 15 points by hitting five three-point  baskets and four free throws in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Orlando has lost 16 of 18 games.  </P> <P> Seattle 120, Phoenix 110 -- Xavier McDaniel scored 10 of his 29 points in the  fourth quarter as the SuperSonics won at home.  </P> <P> Seattle won for the second time in three games with guard Avery Johnson in the  lineup. Johnson, replacing Nate McMillan, had 11 assists.  </P> <P> Portland 124, Sacramento 121 -- The visiting Trail Blazers, using Terry  Porter's 25 points, spoiled Dick Motta's debut as the Kings' coach.  </P> <P> Two three-point baskets by Vinny Del Negro in the final eight seconds weren't  enough for the Kings to overtake the Trail Blazers. Wayman Tisdale scored 30  points, and Danny Ainge and Kenny Smith each added 23 for the Kings.  </P></p>

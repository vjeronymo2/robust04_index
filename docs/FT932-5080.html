			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Second division stars The story of London equities is a tale of two markets. Having watched the FT-SE 100 index first rally and then close down on the week, the overriding impression - in line with the mood in government - is one of drift. Yet the FT-SE 250 hit a new high on Wednesday, continuing its steady progress since sterling's devaluation in September. The excitement generated by Mr George Soros' investment in commercial property certainly contributed to the record. With the exception of the largest, Land Securities, property companies are clustered in the Midcap. The composition of the FT-SE 100 has equally contributed to its malaise. Pharmaceutical stocks, which account for 10 per cent of the index now Zeneca has been split from ICI, continue to act as a dead weight. The recent poor performance of water companies ahead of next year's regulatory review has also damped spirits. But that is not a full explanation. Having been presented with Pounds 7bn by way of rights and new issues this year, institutional cash flow is looking even more stretched. The stream of enhanced scrip dividends has hardly helped in that regard. With cash flowing into unit trusts at a rate not seen since 1987, not all is gloom. Since equity income and growth funds took the largest portions of April's Pounds 955m cash inflow, the higher yielding and recovery stocks of the Midcap might be expected to benefit. With deposit rates so low, private investors' enthusiasm for equities is understandable. But the flagging fortunes of the FT-SE 100 underline that such support is no substitute for an improvement in the fundamentals.</p>

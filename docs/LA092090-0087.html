			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A VIEW OF L.A.;  </P> <P> ART: L.A. CITY PLANNER TURNS FROM ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS TO  PHOTOGRAPHY THAT CAPTURES THE URBAN SCENE.  </P> <P> Gurdon Miller pulled out the large black-and-white photos that sometimes keep  him up until 3 in the morning -- images of barren downtown streets,  graffiti-loaded warehouses, telephone poles and parked cars.  </P> <P> "I think it's beautiful," he said of one image of an abandoned laundry  building. His words poured out anxiously, rapidly: "I'm not kidding. I really  think it's beautiful."  </P> <P> For Miller, 45, a Los Angeles city planner and Sierra Madre resident, the  photos are the culmination of more than 25 years of exploring what he calls the  "built environment," or the Earth as modified by human action.  </P> <P> The photos also represent his entry into the world of art photography. In  April, Miller was one of three photographers selected to display their work at  the Los Angeles Arts Council's "Catch a Rising Artist" art auction at the Bel  Age Hotel in West Hollywood. He hopes to parlay that exposure into  representation at a gallery and recognition of the uniqueness of his vision and  product.  </P> <P> "What I'm doing with a picture is sort of analogous to atonal structures (in  music), in the sense that the structure is important and the composition is  important," Miller said. "There aren't 10 photographers in Los Angeles who are  taking better (pictures) than this in terms of the camera, film, development  and knowledge."  </P> <P> The urban emphasis of his photos seems paradoxical for Miller, with his hiker's  attire of faded work shirts and khaki pants, his tree house-like home in Sierra  Madre Canyon, his work on Sierra Madre's hillside development ordinance, and  his memberships in the Wilderness Society and Sierra Club.  </P> <P> Yet it is a natural outgrowth of artistic pursuits that began in his youth in  the San Gabriel Valley. Miller grew up in El Monte and painted practically  nonstop from childhood. So engrossed was he in painting, he said, that after  his family had gone to bed at night, he would snap on his bedroom closet light  and surreptitiously paint all night inside the closet.  </P> <P> During his high school years, his realistic landscapes and watercolored  pen-and-ink sketches sold easily "because they were pretty and people liked  them," he said.  </P> <P> But when he saw the huge, Abstract Expressionist canvases of American artist  Clyfford Still, he was overwhelmed.  </P> <P> "It was the beginning of changing the way I see things," he said.  </P> <P> Miller studied Abstract Expressionism while obtaining an art degree at UC  Berkeley and continued to paint abstract canvases while working as a city  planner. But as he took photos for his planning jobs, he realized that he could  create with photography the shapes he was abstracting from landscapes.  </P> <P> "Why bother (with painting), when you can go straight to the source?" Miller  said. "As a painter I was always trying to explain to people why I had no  content or why the content was so rarefied."  </P> <P> Largely self-taught as a photographer, Miller uses the zone system pioneered by  Ansel Adams, in which different objects to be photographed are measured by a  light meter to arrive at an exposure that will deliver the broadest range of  lights and darks. But where Adams used the techniques to produce stunningly  beautiful landscapes, Miller employs them to catch the sometimes ungainly  shapes of the urban environment.  </P> <P> A photo like "Friendship Store," taken in Little Tokyo, may seem to be a random  shot of an empty street. But Miller explained that it is dense with  compositional elements, such as the contrast of a white, square sign against  the dark, recessed squares of the building's windows; the parallel shapes of  windowpanes and glass brick, and the satisfyingly rough texture of brick.  </P> <P> "Just as with an Abstract Expressionist painting, your eye dances around," he  said.  </P> <P> Miller is equally passionate about the techniques he employs to produce his  photos. For years, he used a 35-millimeter camera and took thousands of slides  of buildings and city streets, incorporating some of them into slide shows that  he occasionally presents to other city planners.  </P> <P> But only rarely did he produce a photo that he considered aesthetically  pleasing. So, he switched to the bulky view camera he now uses to obtain  sharper images and produce large pictures, measuring up to 16 by 20 inches.  </P> <P> Taking such photos is a painstaking process, Miller said. He will spend an hour  setting up his camera on the tripod, finding the view he wants, metering the  shot and, finally, waiting for the wind to stop blowing and the street to clear  of people and cars so that he can snap the 15-second exposure.  </P> <P> After a day of such activity, he will have about six photos, perhaps one of  which he will find satisfactory. Next comes another six hours of developing his  images in his bathroom/darkroom.  </P> <P> "It's a compulsion," Miller admitted, adding that he couldn't continue without  the emotional support of his wife and the income from his job as a planner.  </P> <P> "I'm doing it because finally, at the age of 45, I have sufficient belief in  the worthiness of the work and the strength of character to pull it off," he  said. "I don't have to make any compromises."  </P></p>

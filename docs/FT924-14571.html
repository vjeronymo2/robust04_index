			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Management: Out to lunch but only when the in-tray is empty  -Louise Kehoe concludes the series on power entertaining / Silicon Valley In Silicon Valley the first question is: 'Do you do lunch?' Note that there is no mention of eating. Doing lunch means meeting people in a restaurant at or before the noon hour. Food plays a secondary role. The most common response is negative. 'I try to avoid it,' says Mathew Schmitt, a public relations specialist. 'It is just not very productive in my experience.' His view is widely shared among 'the Valley's' high-tech types. If you accept the premise that California is a trend setter, the business lunch is on the way out. So too, it appears, is the 'power breakfast', one of the region's most unfortunate innovations. Business breakfasts are still marginally more popular than lunch. But whereas a couple of years ago it was common to receive invitations to meet at 7.30am over bran muffins and coffee, today most high-tech types prefer to head straight for the office and conduct a conversation by phone. The prevailing view is that if you have time to go out to lunch, you probably are not working hard enough, or you don't have enough important work to do. Many simply regard 'off-site' lunches as an interruption, to be tolerated only when it is expected of them by important foreign, or East Coast, visitors. Yet throughout Silicon Valley, 'working lunches' are the norm, whether for members of a company team or as an opportunity to talk business with potential partners. These meals are usually catered and range from the casual 'box lunch' - a sandwich, fruit salad and a cookie - to a more substantial buffet meal with perhaps chicken and wild rice, fruit salad, always cookies, and soda or coffee. Senior managers, especially, prefer to 'eat in', but visitors should not expect a plush executive dining room. Your host may even skip the food in his enthusiasm for describing the latest technological wizardry and fingering the flip charts. Intel executives like to show off the company's new headquarters cafeteria, open from 6.30 to 8.30 for breakfast and again at lunch time. At Sun Microsystems you can expect a can of Diet Coke (no glass) and a salad served at the executive's desk. Hewlett-Packard provides a nice spread of 'make-your-own sandwich' ingredients. When they do venture beyond their office buildings, Silicon Valley types choose 'California cuisine' - lots of imaginative salads, crispy vegetables, chicken or fish with hardly any red meat in sight. Everything, it seems, is served with sun-dried tomatoes. One such eatery that is a favourite with Apple Computer employees is 'Sport City' in Cupertino, where the staples are salad with iced tea or lemonade. After work they may return for a glass of chardonnay, but heavy drinking is definitely not fashionable. You have not really 'arrived' in Silicon Valley, however, until you have partaken of the offerings of a 'roach coach', one of the silver-sided vans that make daily tours of office parks selling suspect burritos, heart-clogging hot dogs and slightly stale sandwiches to hungry inmates. This is where you will find the founders of fledgling Silicon Valley start-up ventures. The challenge is to figure out which ones among them will eventually be building company canteens.</p>

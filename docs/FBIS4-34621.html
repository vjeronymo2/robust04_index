			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Norys Aguirre, president of the </F> Venezuelan Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund,  Fogade, by Alfredo Pena at the Venevision studio in Caracas on  the "Talking With Alfredo Pena" program -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Pena] Media polls--and you  most probably have seen a few of them--indicate that the people  are complaining--justifiably in my opinion--that the government  has lied--I do not know whether deliberately or for emotional  reasons. After the Banco Latino intervention and the banks began  to receive aid, the chief of state and all others under him said  that there would be no bank interventions. The [word indistinct]  said this. We should be able to trust the word of the chief of  state, of his finance minister, and of other high-ranking  officials. Look at what is happening now. What do you have to  say about this?    [Aguirre] Good evening, Mr. Pena. Thank you very much for  inviting me to this program. I would add the name of Fogade  [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] President Norys  Aguirre to the list you mentioned, because I said the same  thing; that there would be no other interventions. I think,  however, that after the program to aid banks was instituted on  25 January, the authorities had the best intention and the firm  determination of not ordering other interventions, because of  the dramatic and traumatic effects that they have on depositors,  especially on the creditors of the institution involved.    We tried to rehabilitate these institutions, we tried to  cover their losses through the guarantees fund, and we tried to  keep them open. We started an analysis of the situation to study  alternatives due to the magnitude of the losses [perdidas de  balance] that we detected and based on the inspections and  subsequent reports filed by the Bank Superintendency, due to the  operational losses accumulated by these institutions in the past  six months, and due to the deterioration caused by deposit  withdrawals--which did not stop despite all our statements and  the efforts we made in the past two weeks. We discussed what to  do with the institutions to avoid an intervention.    An intervention process is not something done gradually.  [sentence as heard] It must be evaluated, thought over. We did  that for two weeks. Although we said that there would be no more  interventions, we had to make this decision along with the  commissioner [not further identified]--who was invited to all  these working meetings--in which we worked as a team, as  Venezuelans who seek to solve this problem. We had to make this  decision.    [Pena] You have just reminded us that you said this very  same thing when you were appointed to Fogade. You repeated those  same words a few days ago, and they are recorded in Fogade's  minutes. The media also reported on what you said. You said that  meetings were held to discuss the recapitalization of the banks  and to make changes in the boards of directors. You said that if  the former owners do not have the money to recapitalize the  banks, that you would recapitalize them but never (?save them).  What does this mean?    [Aguirre] The meetings were scheduled by the General Bank  Superintendency--they began on 2 March--and were suspended when  I was appointed. At that time we had a problem; we did not know  exactly how much the losses amounted to and the deadline for the  meetings were not met. This being the case, those meetings could  be contested or be subject to lawsuits. Therefore, it was not  necessary to do this. The General Bank Superintendency ordered  the meetings. Except for the Maracaibo meeting, which was held  on 2 June, the meetings were held between 23 and 25 May.  However, by late May, the directorate began to review the  reports presented by the appointed boards--and who did an  excellent job in only one week--we realized the situation was so  bad that we asked the General Bank Superintendency for an urgent  working meeting with the superior council to study the assets  situation. In addition to the legal problems this could entail,  Fogade had decided not to cover the losses in light of the huge  amounts this represented.    [Pena] You decided not to cover the losses because [words  indistinct]?    [Aguirre] No. We attended the meetings and made offers  without having in-depth knowledge of the situation.    [Pena] How could you offer to recapitalize those  institutions  without having in-depth knowledge of the situation?    [Aguirre] Because there was a legal requirement we had to  meet in light of some contracts signed in January.    [Pena] According to statements made by the president of the  Superior Court for the Protection of Public Property, the court  is going to investigate public officials who participated in  that process. Those officials are: the president of the Central  Bank, the president of Fogade, and the superintendent of banks.  I believe the Superior Court for the Protection of Public  Property is doing the right thing because to allegedly protect  the depositors, you have released more than 500 billion  bolivares. These 500 billion bolivares belong to those who are  working on this program with us and to those who are listening  to us. The Comptroller Law is very clear in this regard. All  those who handle state money must account for it. This means  that the court can investigate you. Someone has to account for  that huge amount of money that has caused inflation and hunger  among the people.    [Aguirre] That is right. All those who handle money must  account for it. Not only state money; this also applies to the  private sector. We have a comptroller and we have officials that  we must account to for all that we do. I agree that an  investigation should be conducted. When I was appointed in early  May, late April, I asked the Office of the Comptroller to help  me. I want the Office of the Comptroller to guide me through  this. I do not know all the laws and requirements, therefore I  need the help of the special organizations. I do believe that  all of us who have had something to do with this process, since  25 January when we began providing financial aid to the Bank of  Maracaibo, will have to account for what we have done.    You said that 504 billion bolivars were disbursed and that  this money belongs to you and all those who are here. I agree  with you completely. It belongs to all the Venezuelan people and  that is why I have always said that the financial aid program,  as implemented, had to end. This is why Fogade, and Norys  Aguirre in particular, felt this program had to end as soon as  possible.    [Pena] On the other hand, it has been said in the  Venezuelan legislature and courts that funds have been diverted.  We are talking about money that was supposedly meant for  depositors but which had a different destination, funds that  were transferred to be exchanged for dollars, or funds that were  improperly used. If that is the case, who is responsible for the  use of funds that belonged to Venezuelans, or for the operations  carried out by the quote, bank owners, unquote, or for any other  money transfer? Who had control over them, or did they not have  to answer to anyone?    [Aguirre] As soon as subsidies [auxilios] are distributed, a  document must be issued under oath. Each time the required funds  [requerimientos] were delivered, a document was issued under  oath explaining the origin and use of the funds, the amounts  requested, how it would be used, and who received the money. We  are currently investigating the cases when this was not done or  when someone gave false information. There is a court supported  by experts from the Superintendency of Banks, the Central Bank,  and the Judicial Technical Police [PTJ].    The Superintendency of Banks is wholly responsible for the  supervision process. I believe it is important to understand the  role played by each of the parties involved. Fogade was created  to protect depositors, to protect and guarantee the stability of  the financial system, and to act as a liquidator in cases  approved by the Superintendent of Banks. The Superintendency of  Banks is in charge of overseeing, controlling, and supervising  all activities of the financial system. Fogade delivered and  implemented the program of financial assistance. The  Superintendency of Banks subsequently evaluated and supervised  all activities. That is why there is a judge now, and we must  let the judge do his job. The judge has announced certain  measures. If another judge is appointed, as I have read in the  press, he will also do his job. They are the ones who must  determine who is responsible.    [Pena] Today's edition of EL UNIVERSAL contained an article  by Gustavo Gomez Lopez in which he states that the intervention  of his institution was conducted without any type of financial  assistance, that they were barely given a chance to breathe,  that criminal charges were filed against them, and that 83  arrest warrants were issued against the bank. He said that the  same thing will happen with these eight banks. That is what  Gomez Lopez said today in EL UNIVERSAL. What are your comments?    [Aguirre] It is difficult for me to give my opinion. First,  I  have not read the article completely, and second, I was not  involved in the intervention of Banco Latino. I do not know how  the intervention process was conducted. I can say that as a  result of the Banco Latino crisis, and to protect and guarantee  the stability of the financial system, when depositors began  withdrawing their funds from the banks in Maracaibo and in  Barinas, which were the first two affected, there could not be  interventions or closures at other banks because it would have  been harmful and created instability. That is why the financial  assistance plan was implemented. The problem with this plan was  its duration. The financial assistance plan--as it was  created--was supposed to last one or two weeks at the most.  Unfortunately, and as we are all aware, due to the many external  and internal factors affecting each of the parties involved in  this problem, the final solution was postponed.    [Pena] The government seems to have lost ground in the most  important area: credibility. President Caldera, as you well  know, promised to stabilize the bolivar. In the first three  months of his administration, however, the bolivar has been  devalued 60 percent. He also promised to eliminate the zero  coupon. The zero coupon today has reached 60 billion bolivares.  If the average interest rate is 60 percent, the Central Bank  will have to pay those banks more than 300 billion bolivares in  interest. We do not know where it will come from. Although he  promised to curb inflation, inflation this year could surpass  100 percent if things remain the way they are. Right? In  addition, with these subsidies and with the law that will be  implemented now for 400 billion bolivares, we will have a  deficit in the GNP of 17 percent. In any country on earth, that  is called hyperinflation. A few days ago we were told that  interest rates would go down, but interest rates are again at  almost 80 percent. How can we believe government representatives  who say one thing but do another?    [Aguirre] I believe the president is the person who, with  his authority and credibility, informed us of the country's  situation. On 2 February he announced his government's plan.  People understood there was not going to be a change of control  because the situation stabilized. I think the way in which  conditions evolved made us take other measures. The government  has worked hard to stabilize fiscal accounts. The objective of  this public credit law is to meet depositors' needs and end  financial subsidies once and for all, subsidies that were taking  us back to that [word indistinct] path you mentioned. I think  the Bank Superintendency Superior Council members made their  decision taking into account the country and the fact that we  could not continue with the subsidy program. We would have  reached rates in excess of the 80 percent you mentioned, even  three-digit inflation rates.    [Pena] Do you think that what has been happening here is  typical of Venezuela and perhaps of the Third World? People  hear rumors in the streets, but the government says they are  lies. Take the banks as an example. People started withdrawing  money and dealt a heavy blow to the more than $3 billion in  reserves. The allegedly financially sound banks took the other  funds. Since they allegedly did not have a place to deposit  those funds, they were resold to the Central Bank of Venezuela  at higher prices. That is what the commissioner called the  perverse cycle, which is still alive and well. These banks went  so far as to attempt to penalize pubic officials who, by taking  precautionary measures, wanted to withdraw these funds from the  banks to avoid what happened yesterday at the Metropolitan Bank  and other banks, where people were about to rob them because  their payrolls [nominas] could not be paid. These officials who  were withdrawing the funds from the banks wanted to protect  their workers. The economic team and the team that supervises  the financial market made public statements saying that public  officials would not be allowed to withdraw money from these  banks.    [Aguirre] Fifty percent of the money deposited in these  banks  belong to 90 percent of the depositors. When those people start  being paid next week--and I know this is a big effort--they will  get some respite, because we will begin implementing our payment  program. That is why the Bank Superintendency, Fogade, and the  Finance Ministry are hurriedly working to keep the schedule of  payments announced by the Finance Ministry and Fogade. We must  pay them because they are not responsible for this crisis.    Let me go back to the beginning of your question when you  said there is a perverse cycle, as the commissioner mentioned.  You are exactly right. That is what we are trying to end, and it  ended on 13 June. The cycle no longer exists because it already  ended.    [Pena] It just ended?    [Aguirre] Yes, it just ended.    [Pena] In ended after the Venezuelan economy bled for three  months due to this perverse cycle.    [Aguirre] We want these deposits to remain in the  institutions. Deposits must remain there because if there are  any problems with the financial system or liquidity, it is one  of the state's functions to help the institution, to adopt  pertinent measures, to replace administrators, and to impose  sanctions. The government must do all this the first day. It  should not have to wait five months. I cannot argue this issue  with you. I am totally convinced that this situation should have  ended within the first week or the first 15 days.    [Pena] As for the guarantees, you have insisted that they  fail to back loans. It has even been said that in addition to  Venezuelans' wearing a tax necklace, we will be lucky if we  recover 30 or 40 percent of those 500,000 or 800,000 [not  further specified]. We do not know what it will amount to. We do  not know if there are inflated assets, and we do not know if we  were given bad portfolios. We were paid with securities and  portfolios which could be bad. It seems the only thing that  could be useful are T-bills and other state securities. The  truth, Dr. Aguirre, is that we do not know what the rest of  these securities are.    [Aguirre] The state has received about 405 billion [currency  not specified] worth of physical inventories taken by Fogade. Of  that 405 billion, some 8 or 10 billion were received in  securities and stock from some companies, stock that was  estimated at its par value, I should say. We have yet to  determine if these companies are profitable, viable companies.  We do not know if within the group of financial institutions  involved in the intervention--some 59 companies--there are  institutions that can be immediately turned around to ensure  continued production. We have received about 800 billion  bolivares worth of properties. Someone said the other day in a  local newspaper that a property received by Fogade at its book  value of 120 million bolivares must be worth much more than  that. We all know it is worth much more.    [Pena] It is worth less. The thing is, inflation is  gobbling us up.    [Aguirre] No. It is worth much less.    [Pena] You get a building for 30 [number as heard, currency  not specified], at real prices. It is not worth 30, but they  offer it for 30. It is really worth 10 and they paid the price  to hand it over to Fogade. Of course, in six months time, they  will want to invoke the same argument they presented before  [words indistinct]. That is: Everything I transferred is worth a  fortune now. Of course, because the currency has devaluated, and  what with the current devaluation rate things are terrible.    The main issue, madam, is that you said and affirmed you are  going to pay these people their money.    [Aguirre] Up to 4 million bolivares.    [Pena] Up to 4 million. I understand there was a meeting  yesterday between Luis Alfaro Ucero and Treasury Minister Julio  Sosa Rodriguez. Alfaro Ucero told him: We can help you get the  Public Credit Bill approved. We need to know, however, what you  are going to do. Are you going to nationalize the banking system  or what are you going to do? I ask you that same question.  Alfaro Ucero was clear in warning: If you do not tell us what  you plan to do, then we cannot support you and the Public Credit  Bill will not be approved. Are you planning to nationalize the  banks? Are you going to reorganize the system? What are you  really going to do? No one really knows.    [Aguirre] I think they do. That is the role....    [Pena, interrupting] Are you going to nationalize?    [Aguirre] Heavens no. Excuse me, but I think it has already  been said. I think there has been effective information. That is  the General Bank Superintendency's job. It is not my place to  comment on their responsibilities and what the Superintendency  is doing. However, as a member of the High Commission and a  participant in the discussions and the work sessions we have  held, I can say the General Bank Superintendency is working with  the rest of the financial system. As you may well know, all of  the local banks must file an adjustment plan by 30 June. It is  the 15th [date as heard] today, so there are still 15 days for  the banks to present their plan. According to the new General  Banking Law, these plans must be studied, discussed by the  Superintendency and the banks, and put into effect on 1 July.    [Pena] Why did you dance around? They closed the Banco  Latino  for 85 days. There were several suicides, demonstrations, and  violence in the streets of Caracas and other cities around the  country. Following the 85 days of torture and sadism against the  savings accounts holders, you decide to reopen it. You put a 10  million ceiling. You imposed no limitations on the banks being  bailed out. You said: We are going to protect the account  holders. But anyone could withdraw however much he wanted. I  understood that protecting the savings accounts meant up to 10  million. In the United States the ceiling is $100,000, as it is  anywhere in the civilized world, except here. Here it was take  as much as you can. Up to now we have given out 500 billion  bolivares. You let these others pull out however much they  wanted for three months. Meanwhile you discriminated against the  Banco Latino account holders, who you forced to capitalize and  limited to 10 million. Now, you seem to have thought over the  matter and limited withdrawals to 4 million. Still, those who  did not comply with Fogade's conditions were allowed to take  everything they wanted. Is that fair, Ms. Aguirre?    [Aguirre] [sighs] That is why, when Fogade holds its general  assembly, it will study the possibility of increasing the  guarantee limits to 10 million bolivares. There is one specific  thing that cannot be hidden. The Banco Latino savings account  holders were allowed up to 10 million bolivares, based on a  special transitory law or a temporary provision of the emergency  banking law. The account holders were paid every penny within  five months. Now we have said the limit is 4 million bolivares.    [Pena] Was it possible to do that from the beginning?    [Aguirre] From the very first days of May, when I....    [Pena, interrupting] Why not limit the others as you did  with  the Banco Latino?    [Aguirre] The limit is in effect.    [Pena] Why was the limit not imposed on the other affected  banks, as you did with Banco Latino, from the very first day?    [Aguirre] That is what we did following our decision on 13  June. I cannot judge what was done as of 25 January.    [Pena] Allow me one last question. President Caldera said  he would not hesitate to sign currency exchange controls.  Judging from the way things look now, I would say we are closer  to that decision than when he said he would not hesitate.  Inflation is higher and reserves are dwindling. I hope you give  a lot of thought to what you plan to do about that. It is a  decision the president must make and only he knows what he will  decide. He has enough experience at this, and I hope we do not  go back to the days of the Differential Exchange System, which  was a monster I hope never returns. It was used to extort  private enterprise, particularly the media. The politicians, led  by President Lusinchi, got rich with it. There was a Chinese  individual implicated in this, who was so glorified that they  are going to make a movie about him. Everyone else came out  smelling like roses, while Venezuela was left impoverished.    Along with the banks, you are now the owners of media  corporations, investment funds, resorts, hotels, and much more.  Now we have a government that preaches that it is going to  privatize things, while it is becoming the owner of an enormous  piece of the economy.    [Aguirre] The state has not become a proprietor of its own  choosing. I believe the government's policy and philosophy is to  privatize and be able to deal with its own responsibilities and  the things the government team is trying to do.    We have also established, and we have said this, that  independent of who does the privatization--be it the Investment  Fund, Fogade, or salvage companies--the important thing is that  the state be able to sell all these assets in accordance with  established sale plans without further harming the economy. You  cannot sell.... [pauses] I cannot put 79 billion bolivares in  property on sale today because I would drown the real estate  market. This has to be planned.    [Pena] But there have to be many international banks  interested in purchasing those banks.    [Aguirre] There are banks interested. But we also have other  assets that were put up to guarantee the financial aid.    [Pena] But I am talking about the banks.    [Aguirre] There are eight banks and there are banks  interested.    [Pena] Local banks?    [Aguirre] Foreign banks. But the foreign banks must study  the  banks before they buy. You just do not buy for the sake of  buying; you have to know what it is you are buying. Venezuela,  through Fogade, will have to issue a letter of intent. This is  done in every country of the world.    [Pena] When bankers are making a profit they do not remember  us, but when they report losses, we are the ones who lose.    [Aguirre] That is why the state is trying to establish who  is  responsible.    [Pena] I hope so because I have seen nothing that the state  is doing. I have not seen the state filing suits against those  people.    [Aguirre] Well you will....    [Pena interrupting] Excuse me, Dr. Aguirre. I have heard you  say that the courts are responsible for determining the guilty  party. However, it is the responsibility of the state to present  charges. The state did not consult the Venezuelan people when it  used our money. A referendum was not held before using 800  billion bolivares or before raising inflation to almost 100  percent. Since the state handled the matter as it did, then it  should accuse the guilty parties in court. They should be in  jail.    [Aguirre] Fogade appointed its administrators at the  meetings, people that we removed from where they were working  and who sacrificed much to help the state. As soon as they gave  us their report and as soon as we received the report from the  General Bank Superintendency, Fogade and the government ordered  the intervention. Fogade and the government are willing to  determine who was responsible and become the accuser if  necessary. If there was poor management and if there was fraud,  we will become the accusers of all those administrators.    [Pena] Thank you Fogade President Dr. Norys Aguirre.</p>

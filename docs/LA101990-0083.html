			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> USC;  </P> <P> THIS POSITION ISN'T ALWAYS A SNAP  </P> <P> After botching the exchange between center and quarterback only once last  season, USC has fumbled the snap seven times in its last two games.  </P> <P> Six times, the center was sophomore Titus Tuiasosopo, a 6-foot-2, 275-pound  reserve who probably would be moved into the starting lineup ahead of redshirt  freshman David Apolskis if he could master the fundamental requirement of the  position.  </P> <P> "His blocking, his leadership, his toughness have been excellent," Coach Larry  Smith said. "But you can't play with a center who can't get the snap up."  </P> <P> Only two Pac-10 players, Greg Lewis of Washington and Anthony Wallace of  California, have better per-game rushing averages than USC tailbacks Ricky  Ervins and Mazio Royster, but neither Ervins nor Royster is included among the  conference leaders because neither has played in 75% of the Trojans' games.  </P> <P> Ervins averaged 95 yards a game before spraining an ankle in USC's fourth game  against Ohio State. He hasn't played since, having given way to Royster, who  didn't play in the Trojans' first two games, but has since averaged 95.8 yards.  </P> <P> Royster's average includes this line from the Washington game: one carry,  minus-two yards. Since Ervins was injured, he has averaged 128.3 yards a game.  JERRY CROWE  </P></p>

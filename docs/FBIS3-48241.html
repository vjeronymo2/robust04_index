			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Jan. 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and  Indonesia Saturday signed an investment guarantee agreement  [IGA] to encourage the private sectors of both countries to  optimise the huge potential available in economic and industrial  cooperation.    The agreement on promotion and protection of investments was  signed by Malaysian Minister of International Trade and Industry  Rafidah Aziz and Indonesian Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs  Susilo Sudarman, who is defence and security minister.    Speaking to reporters after the signing ceremony, Rafidah  urged the Malaysian and Indonesian private sectors to follow up  with joint ventures to exploit the vast economic opportunities  available in the two countries.    Rafidah, who is here for a two-day visit, also called on  entrepreneurs of the two countries to synergise their capacity  to invest in third countries which are opening up their  economies like Cambodia, Vietnam, and the People's Republic of  China.    She said they had developed the capacity in fields like  electronics, oil, and gas engineering and by combining their  resources they could strongly bid for tenders in third countries.    Susilo, describing the agreement as timely, said the  Indonesian Government was looking forward to more joint ventures  between Indonesian and Malaysian businessmen, especially with  the implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).    Rafidah said ASEAN had already signed an umbrella IGA in  1987, but this bilateral agreement showed that the two  governments were serious in forging greater cooperation between  their private sectors.    She said trade between the two countries and the awareness  of  trade opportunities among their businessmen in both countries  were increasing, but they should be more aggressive as the trade  base was still small in proportion to the potentials.    Total trade between the two countries had increased from  U.S.  $199 million worth in 1985 to U.S. $1.139 billion in 1992, but  it only accounted for 1.4 percent of Malaysia's total global  trade, she added.    Indonesia's investment in Malaysia up to December 1992 stood  at U.S. $1.28 billion, but out of 800 investment projects  approved last year, only three were Indonesian.    Malaysia's investment in Indonesia now stood at U.S. $166  million in 32 projects, mainly in wood industry, food, metal,  and textiles.    Rafidah Friday held talks with Trade Minister Billy Yudono  on  bilateral, regional, and global trade matters and with Minister  of Research and Technology B.J. Habibie on cooperation in  aerospace industry.    Earlier Saturday, she held discussions with Minister of  Industry Tungky Aribowo on, among others, bilateral trade  relations and the forthcoming informal meeting of ASEAN economic  ministers in Kuala Lumpur on April 22.</p>

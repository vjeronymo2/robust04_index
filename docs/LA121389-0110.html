			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Degradable Plastic Boycott Sought: "Don't get Glad, get mad," two national  environmental groups declared as they called for a boycott of plastic products  being marketed as degradable. In a joint report, "Degradable Plastics: the  Wrong Answer to the Right Question," the Environmental Defense Fund and  Environmental Action contend that Hefty and Glad trash bags and Nappies and  Tender Care diapers, among other products made from the new plastics, claim  environmental benefits that "are either nonexistent or have yet to be  demonstrated." But the groups' chief objection is that the degradables will  cripple fledgling attempts to recycle traditional plastic products.  </P></p>

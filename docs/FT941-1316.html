			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Strong second half helps lift CIA to Pounds 4.3m CIA Group, the UK's largest independent media buyer, announced pre-tax profits up by 17 per cent from Pounds 3.65m to Pounds 4.28m for the year to December 31 1993, following a strong upturn in business during the second half. The group is recommending a 2-for-1 scrip issue 'in order to improve share marketability'. CIA's share price has increased about fivefold since it came to the market in 1989. Yesterday the shares closed unchanged at 390p. Turnover increased by 21 per cent from Pounds 235m to Pounds 285m, although new business gains were down from Pounds 76m to Pounds 69m. The group said there had been strong growth of business from existing clients and client losses were lower than for many years. Mr Chris Ingram, chairman and chief executive, said he expected growth of between 5 and 6 per cent in clients' media budgets in 1994. This year would see faltering recovery in the UK and continuing recession in mainland Europe, he said. The group expects to continue building its European network and increasing the number of joint ventures during the year. The fall in interest rates meant a drop in investment income - down from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 916,000. Earnings per share increased by 18 per cent from 15.72p to 18.54p. A proposed final dividend of 3.68p makes a total of 5.14p, also up 18 per cent.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Saburov, deputy prime minister of </F> the Crimean Government, by KRYMSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent I.  Dyakov; place and date not given; under the rubric "Exclusive  Interview": "Yevgeniy Saburov: Agreement With Russia Signed"]    [Text] Negotiations were held between government  delegations of Russia and Crimea in Moscow. On returning to  Simferopol from the Russian capital, Ye.F. Saburov, deputy prime  minister of the Crimean Government, answered our correspondent's  questions.    [Dyakov] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, what news did you bring from  Moscow?    [Saburov] As a result of the just-completed negotiations,  the  parties signed a Russian-Crimean framework intergovernmental  trade and economic agreement. This document defines the  boundaries within which Russia and Crimea undertake to develop  mutually profitable business relations. We speak here of trade  and economic ties. We will create the most favorable conditions  for entities engaged in economic activities.    Within the framework of this agreement, agencies and  enterprises will be able to enter into economic contracts  between themselves. This will lead to an expansion of  Russian-Crimean trade. For us, relations with our Russian  partners are very important. Thanks to a strengthening of these  ties, we will be able to speed up the implementation of economic  reforms.    [Dyakov] But the ties also existed in the past. Why was it  necessary to formalize them in an agreement?    [Saburov] It is true that Crimea is linked with Russia by a  myriad invisible threads. After the disintegration of the Soviet  Union, however, economic relations became more complicated. A  new and rather difficult situation emerged. Customs and other  artificial barriers arose between Crimea and Russia. Simply  talking about removing these barriers cannot solve the problem.  Thanks to these agreements, relations with Russia have been  elevated to a new, higher level. The two governments undertook  an obligation to facilitate the expansion of cooperation in  every way.    [Dyakov] Apparently, the framework agreement is to be  followed by concrete steps in bringing Crimea and Russia closer  together in the economic sense, is it not?    [Saburov] Some steps already have been taken to fill the  outlined framework with concrete content. For instance, Russia  had a limit on how much cash could be taken out of the country,  including to Crimea. It was set at 500,000 rubles [R]. Too  little for vacationers at current prices. Now this amount has  been increased to R1.4 million. This is extremely important for  Crimea. In the summer we expect millions of Russians to come and  vacation here. They will be able to spend their pocket  money--the R1.4 million--on our goods and services. The Crimean  budget will get an infusion. In short, the benefit is obvious.    In addition, the Russian Government made the decision to  subsidize vouchers to Crimean resorts. The corresponding  expenses will be carried by insurance funds and trade unions.  Thanks to this, our sanitariums, room-and-board facilities, and  recreation homes will not be empty...    [Dyakov] How will the agreement affect the development of  Crimean industry?    [Saburov] Most tangibly. We will define the volume of  Crimean  products to be shipped to Russia with reduced customs  formalities. We have conducted negotiations on the issues of  transportation and communications. Russian Government leaders  treated with understanding our difficulties and requests. We  count on the closest cooperation with our partners in the  brotherly country.    [Dyakov] Who conducted the negotiations on the Russian side?    [Saburov] The head of government, V.S. Chernomyrdin. At the  signing of the agreement he emphasized that nothing now stands  in the way of concrete contracts between Russian and Crimean  enterprises. He urged an intensification of this work, bringing  into its orbit broad circles of interested parties. The  agreement was signed by Russia's Deputy Prime Minister S.M.  Shakhray and myself.    [Dyakov] Were these long negotiations?    [Saburov] They began under the previous Crimean leadership,  but at some stage ground to a halt. Now we have been able to  bring them to a successful conclusion.    [Dyakov] When may the results of the negotiations have an  effect in overcoming the economic crisis in Crimea?    [Saburov] Unfortunately, not right away. The economy has a  very strong inertia. But there will definitely be positive  results. Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin suggested, for  instance, that we start thinking now of Crimea's preparations  for the winter and the fuel and energy supply. We are supposed  to sign contracts for exports of our products to Russia, which  should give a boost to our industrial production.    [Dyakov] For many Crimean enterprises, as well as Russian  ones, the problem of mutual nonpayments is practically  unsurmountable. Have you been able to resolve it?    [Saburov] We touched upon this issue in the course of  negotiations. We resolved to clear financial channels between  Russian and Crimean enterprises. Then mutual payments for  products shipped will flow through them unimpeded. We will keep  under supervision the implementation of concrete measures in  this respect. This is what we agreed on with the Russians. In  short, we see this agreement as a door that has opened between  Russia and Crimea. I am confident that it will always remain  open.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Portuguese President Mario Soares said in an  interview that he will be pleading with Jonas Savimbi to accept  a cease-fire compromise proposed by Angolan President Jose  Eduardo dos Santos. Mario Soares stated that he took the  opportunity at the Pretoria ceremony, where some 50 heads of  state and the UN secretary general were gathered, to debate a  number of international policy issues, particularly the urgent  need for peace in southern Africa. He also stated that the  urgency of a cease-fire in Angola was the main theme of talks he  held with Butrus-Ghali and Presidents Joaquim Chissano and  Eduardo dos Santos. In brief, President Soares' line of  thought, shared by all those he spoke to, is that South Africa's  example of a transition agreement based on a national unity  government formula will have to be followed in Maputo and in  Luanda. It was on the basis of these talks that Soares will be  contacting Savimbi to further the Angolan peace effort.</p>

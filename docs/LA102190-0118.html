			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> INSURANCE REFORM JUST TIP OF BANKING ICEBERG  </P> <P> Deposit insurance reform has become a big issue as Congress searches for  solutions to the savings and loan crisis and addresses concerns about the  financial strength of our nation's banks. But it would be a mistake to deal  with deposit insurance and ignore other fundamental issues.  </P> <P> Here are three simple ideas we ought to keep in mind:  </P> <P> * We need to resist the temptation, as understandable as it may be, to go for  the quick fix. It won't work and most likely will result in even higher costs  and higher risks down the road.  </P> <P> We should address not only the condition of our insurance fund but a lot of  other pressures that have built up over the past two decades as our financial  markets have undergone a jarring transformation. This, to me, calls for a  comprehensive plan, one that addresses not only the symptoms but the underlying  causes as well.  </P> <P> In this regard, it is useful to note that during the past 12 years we have seen  no fewer than eight landmark financial reform acts passed into law. We had two  major banking bills in 1978, one in 1980, two more in 1982, one in 1983,  another in 1987 and, finally, last year's Financial Institutions Reform,  Recovery and Enforcement Act.  </P> <P> Despite this prodigious range of legislative attention, pressures at the core  remain. This is because all the legislation taken together has still not  addressed the fundamental structural weaknesses in the system.  </P> <P> The weaknesses stem from the unnatural separation of the securities business  from banking under the Glass-Steagall Act. And they arise from the Douglas  Amendment and the McFadden Act, which have blocked the emergence of truly  national banks that are scaled to the size and diversity of the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> * Second, and along much the same lines, we should work hard to prevent the  S&amp;L crisis from placing on the back burner once again the very pressing  challenge of broad and comprehensive structural reform.  </P> <P> As Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman noted in recent  testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, the S&amp;L crisis is "a  financial disaster of major proportions." But, as he also pointed out, "the  S&amp;L crisis and the difficulties facing the banking industry should not be  confused."  </P> <P> I heartily agree. Vastly different issues brought on the thrift crisis. A  different earnings dynamic. An obsolete concentration on housing finance.  Capital standards that were practically non-existent. Extremely permissive  accounting standards. Inadequate limits on loans to a single borrower. Very  relaxed regulatory supervision.  </P> <P> My concern is that the thrift crisis provides an all too convenient rationale  for standing still in terms of broad reform and opting instead for something  quick and immediate. That might be fun, but it wouldn't be constructive.  </P> <P> * Third, we need to do something meaningful about the concept of Too Big to  Fail. The costs of continuing this policy are too high. So are the risks.  </P> <P> In this regard, I support an American Bankers Assn. proposal that would provide  full deposit insurance coverage for accounts up to $100,000, with higher  amounts handled by a rolling scale based on historic recovery rates.  </P> <P> That said, however, I hope that in the United States we can also begin  addressing the issue not only in terms of Too Big to Fail but in terms of Too  Strong to Fail. We need banks that are large enough, diverse enough and strong  enough so that their soundness isn't an issue.  </P> <P> We need to create an environment in this country that will improve bank  profitability, attract new capital, allow for a greater diversification of risk  and facilitate orderly and efficient consolidation within the banking industry.  </P> <P> Ron Chernow, author of "The House of Morgan," recently wrote an op-ed piece in  the Wall Street Journal that made a pertinent and provocative point:  </P> <P> "For 20 years now, our commercial banks have courted disaster. Unless we assume  that all commercial bankers are dunces, we must suspect some deep, systemic  flaw behind this flirtation with danger."  </P> <P> The title of the essay expresses succinctly the spirit I've been trying to  convey: "Don't Punish the Banks, Liberate Them."  </P> <P> These thoughts add up to a single overriding recommendation: namely, that we  not view the issue of deposit insurance reform in isolation.  </P> <P> We need to address the total challenge. We need to link the insurance issue  with the equally pressing need to fundamentally reform our entire financial  structure.  </P> <P> Unlike in other countries, the very structure of the U.S. banking system does  not provide sufficient opportunities for an individual institution to diversify  its risks geographically.  </P> <P> One result is that in the past few years we watched as nine of the 10 largest  banks in Texas went through some form of supervisory action. A regional  economic downturn quickly became a banking disaster.  </P> <P> I can tell you from my experience with it that the one large Texas bank that  was acquired without official involvement was in trouble for one reason and one  reason alone: It was locked in Texas.  </P> <P> Even if we had a deposit insurance system that imposed market discipline, how  could we expect people in that state to impose it when they and their banks are  geographically captive? What were their alternatives, other than outside the  banking system?  </P> <P> The same thing happened in the Farm Belt, and the same thing is happening in  New England.  </P> <P> Our banks are equally stymied when it comes to trying to diversify our sources  of revenue. We are inhibited in attempting to follow our corporate clients'  shifting financing patterns into the primary capital market, and we are kept  from meeting the full rational array of consumer banking needs.  </P> <P> With this erosion in the value of a commercial banking franchise, how can we  expect the banking industry to attract the risk capital so necessary for a  sound and stable system? Capital, it is useful to note, imposes the greatest  market discipline, and, once obtained, presents the primary protection for  depositors as well as the FDIC fund.  </P> <P> Moreover, the discipline of capital has been strengthened by the Basel Accord,  the product of multilateral cooperation that could form the model for  developing international standards with respect to deposit insurance.  </P> <P> But capital cannot be forced into the banking business; it must be attracted  in. More formulas and more speeches about capital only frighten the market and  make investors run for cover.  </P> <P> What is needed in this country is a financial structure that will allow banks  to diversify risks, serve their customers better and lower their costs by being  able to consolidate into larger companies. When banks can do that, capital will  be attracted into the industry and our financial system will be truly safe and  sound.  </P> <P> In conclusion, I see deposit insurance reform as part of a far larger set of  challenges. Perhaps FDIC chief Seidman said it best recently in testimony  before the House when he referred to "the structural obstacles to the  maintenance of a healthy banking system."  </P> <P> "To be effective," he said, "deposit insurance reform must embrace these  structural problems. Deposit insurance reforms that do not deal with the  structural problems will produce few lasting improvements in the deposit  insurance system and will not materially reduce the ultimate exposure of the  taxpayer to difficulties among banks and thrifts. The purpose of deposit  insurance reform should not be to hold together an antiquated banking  industry."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Prokopenko: "Have We Started To Live </F> Better?"]    [Text] Let he who says we have not be the first to cast a  stone at me. Previously, in pre-perestroyka times, any news of  another price increase was seen as almost a nationwide tragedy.  But now we even make jokes about it: If they assure us that  prices will not rise that is the first sign that another leap is  imminent. Is that not evidence of mounting optimism?    Therefore the news of the New Year "gifts" from the subway  workers (a subway trip will cost 50 rubles as of 1 January) and  from the municipal employees and communications workers  (telephone payments have increased threefold) was received as a  stable sign of a market economy making itself felt.    Moreover, the statisticians see a positive sign in this  response. For instance, a poll of 1,000 Russians held on New  Year's Eve by the institute of comparative social studies showed  that for the first time in the past three years the majority of  those polled believe that the quality of their food intake has  not deteriorated, that life last year, although it did not  improve, did, in their opinion, stabilize somewhat.    The number of "pessimists" believing that the situation has  become worse declined to a record level -- 57 percent (71  percent in 1992). Probably they have swelled the numbers of  those who believe that life has not changed. And their numbers  have increased by one third, reaching 29 percent. The cohort of  optimists, whose lives improved last year, has increased by a  whole 2 percent. They number 13 percent. As we can see, we  have no problems with the growth of optimism.    Incidentally, there is no unity either in the economists'  camp. Thus, some believe that the multiple increase in prices on  the consumer market, inflation, the ruble which has decreased in  values tens of times over, and the overwhelming production slump  have made Russians' lives considerably worse. But others,  including Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar, assert that despite  everything their fellow citizens' prosperity has increased  tenfold. It is true that they rely not on the opinion of these  fellow citizens but on specific figures: Whereas in 1991  Russians' average wages in hard currency equivalent were $7, the  figure now is $70.    I remember the nostalgic words of a woman of my  acquaintance:  "I want 1982 and my 120 rubles wages!..." Probably there is  something this woman fails to understand.    Meanwhile, happy New Year and happy new prices!</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL REVIEW / SCOTT MILLER;  </P> <P> PLAYOFFS WILL SAY SO LONG TO BYES IN THE FIRST ROUND  </P> <P> First-round byes will be eliminated in next year's San Diego Section football,  baseball and girls' volleyball playoffs because each sport will increase its  number of playoff participants from 12 teams to 16.  </P> <P> The San Diego Section Coordinating Council voted for the increase last week  after a recommendation from the Playoff Committee.  </P> <P> "There was some concern about loss of momentum (as the playoffs started)," said  Kendall Webb, San Diego Section commissioner. "Some teams had to wait longer  than they wanted to before playing."  </P> <P> John Shacklett, who coached the Morse football team to the 3-A championship  last fall, agreed.  </P> <P> "I don't like that week layoff," Shacklett said. "You don't need it. Plus, this  gives a few more teams the opportunity to play in the playoffs. We've been  playing a 16-team format with 12 teams anyway."  </P> <P> There will be no extra time involved because the increase in teams simply means  the elimination of first-round byes rather than added dates. But it will mean  some extra money to the schools who would have had byes. The section allows  schools that play host to first-round football and volleyball playoff games and  the first and second rounds in basketball to keep the profits (the policy for  basketball is different because there are more rounds).  </P> <P> An ad hoc committee chaired by Frank Cranley, superintendent of the Imperial  school district, is coming up with specific proposals regarding sports violence  in the section.  </P> <P> The committee is creating codes of ethics and conduct with specific penalties  for violators.  </P> <P> There were several outbreaks of violence this year in San Diego, most notably a  15-minute bench-clearing brawl during the 3-A baseball championship game  between Mt. Carmel and Helix.  </P> <P> "The brawl in the 3-A championship game was illustrative of a problem that is  growing larger and larger," Webb said.  </P> <P> Webb said the proposals probably will be discussed at the Board of Managers  meeting Tuesday, refined, sent to the leagues for review and then be  implemented at the first Board of Managers meeting for the 1989-90 school year  next October.  </P> <P> Mt. Carmel and Patrick Henry were the local winners in last week's major league  baseball free agent draft. Mt. Carmel had five current and former players  drafted, Patrick Henry four.  </P> <P> From Mt. Carmel: Miah Bradbury (Philadelphia), John Tejcek (Oakland), Dan  Rumsey (San Francisco), Marcus Lee (Houston) and Kevin Lofthus (Oakland).  Tejcek and Lee played on Mt. Carmel's 3-A championship team this year.  </P> <P> Patrick Henry's contributions: Kasey McKeon (Detroit), Cory Powell (Montreal),  Kevin Tahan (St. Louis) and Mike Romberg (Montreal). All graduated previously.  </P> <P> Freshman Chris Riley led Madison to a second-place finish in the Southern  California high school team golf championships. Madison, the San Diego Section  team champion, shot a team total 389 and finished one shot behind West  Bakersfield at the Bakersfield Country Club.  </P> <P> Riley finished sixth in the individual championship with a five-over par 149  for two rounds. He was the highest finishing boy from the section; Chris  Stewart of Valhalla was seventh at 152. Madison has never won the tournament  since it was started in 1971, but also finished second in 1972 and 1973.  </P> <P> Coaching carrousel: Grossmont softball Coach Steve Sutton, a 15-year veteran at  the school, will coach varsity football and softball at Santee's West Hills  High School. The school opened just two years ago with a freshman class and now  will start varsity competition in the Grossmont 2-A League with its first  junior class.  </P> <P> Tim Oder, Fallbrook track and field coach, has resigned after seven years as  head coach.  </P> <P> Both are leaving as champions. Fallbrook won the section boys' track and field  championship this year, and Grossmont won its first section softball title.  </P></p>

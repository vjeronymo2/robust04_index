			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Accounting for the exploitation of natural resources WHAT HAS made the idea of 'sustainable development' so appealing, writes Ms Frances Cairncross of the Economist, is 'the fact that the phrase implies so many different things to different people. Every environmentally aware politician is in favour of it, a sure sign that they do not understand what it means.'(1) The Brundtland commission defined sustainable development as 'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'.(2) This definition does not make one much wiser. It implies maintenance of the capital stock. But what is the relevant capital stock, how is it to be measured and to what extent can some parts of it be substituted for other parts? These are questions more of value than of fact. But they already have practical implications, amongst them being the attempts to incorporate natural resources into national accounts. As Mr Chris Bryant and Mr Paul Cook of the UK's Central Statistical Office, demonstrate in a recent article, conceptual and practical problems bedevil the effort. (3) National accounts measure economic exchange. They do not measure welfare. They also fail to measure the economist's concept of income, defined by a Nobel-laureate economist, the late Sir John Hicks, as the most that might be consumed forever. Hicksian income is similar to 'sustainable development', although those concerned with the latter would put particular emphasis on the natural resource component of the capital stock. In one particular area, the depletion of marketed natural resources, environmentalists and economists have similar objections to conventional national accounts. Both agree that output of products like oil is overestimated, since reserves will give out and income cease. A study by Washington's World Resources Institute has calculated that Indonesia's measured gross domestic product would be markedly reduced by proper estimates of depletion. This particular study used two ways of calculating depletion, shown as 'depreciation' and 'excess profit' in the chart, which reports the CSO's attempt to apply such methods to the UK's oil and gas production. Though different in detail, both methods deduct the proportion of the industry's profits attributable to sale of natural resources, as opposed to that attributable to use of man-made capital in their extraction. The value of the natural resources themselves is, in effect, deducted from GDP, the argument being that the sale of resources is not itself production. Yet the cash obtained from selling the family silver can be invested to generate an income. Accordingly, the World Bank has published a study recommending an alternative, Hicksian approach. 'User cost', also shown for the UK in the chart, is the amount that would need to be invested to maintain in perpetuity an income equal to the difference between the value of oil and gas output and user cost. The 'user cost' method gives rather smaller estimates of what needs to be deducted from gross output than 'depreciation' and 'excess profits', because it counts part of the surplus over the cost of production as a sustainable income. Even adjusting measured output of marketed non-renewable resources is contentious, it appears, never mind valuing the use of non-marketed natural resources like the atmosphere. Yet the adjustments amount to billions of pounds in the case of the UK. Much more work on environmental adjustments to national accounts can be expected, but will statisticians ever reach generally accepted conclusions?

Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force.  Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNITED STATES

Statistics for Germany apply only to western Germany. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA. Retail sales volume: data from national government sources except Japan and Italy (value series deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales except France and Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department stores only). Industrial production: data from national government sources. Includes mining, manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan (mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US - help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies. Composite leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical fluctuations in which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general economic activity.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

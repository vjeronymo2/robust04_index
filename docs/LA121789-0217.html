			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIBOROUGH BRIDGE'S KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR;  </P> <P> COMMUTING: AL COSGROVE, WHO DRIVES A TOW TRUCK, SAVES MANY A STRANDED MOTORIST.  </P> <P> Al Cosgrove, who drives a tow truck for the Triborough Bridge, is a very  understanding person. He says so himself.  </P> <P> "I'm very communicable," he says. "I can deal with any kind of people. It's  very unique to have that kind of rationality about yourself." And to a lot of  people whose cars have stalled out in "Roadway One" -- the fast lane of the  Triborough Bridge -- Cosgrove is a regular knight in shining armor.  </P> <P> Cosgrove, who has the job title of assistant bridge maintainer, is strong and  tough-looking, but he is easy to target as a nice guy. He has a lot of boyish  facial hair that doesn't quite make it as a beard, and, although he is black,  he has the almond-shaped eyes of an Asian.  </P> <P> Cosgrove grew up in Queens ("in the same neighborhood as Bernard King and his  brother Albert King" -- both pro basketball players), and now he lives in the  Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. He has been working for the Triborough  Bridge and Tunnel Authority, at the main office on Randalls Island, for 13  years, starting off as a custodian.  </P> <P> "The union and Triborough were kind enough to give me a chance to, you know,  pick myself up," he said. "They allowed me to go to school. I went to New York  City Technical College for a period of time, and, you know, accumulated enough  knowledge to take the test. To get this job it's a pretty hard test you have to  pass. It's not about driving trucks; it's on the multitrade skills --  carpentry, plumbing, being an electrician, a mechanic. I did a lot of studying,  and I passed. I wanted this job."  </P> <P> The first thing Cosgrove does on his shift, which usually begins at 11 at night  and ends (unless there's a major accident or the weather is awful, in which  case Cosgrove is obliged to work overtime) at 7 in the morning, is set up those  tall orange rubber cones that help funnel the morning rush-hour traffic into  and out of the toll booths. Now, he zigzagged back and forth, carrying four or  five cones at a time, setting them about 10 yards apart. On windy winter nights  this particular part of his job can be torture, he says. Tonight was wet but it  wasn't all that windy; it was the kind of night during which Cosgrove expects  to get a few calls.  </P> <P> "A lot of people think with a little rain they can move real fast. But that's  the most dangerous time on any roadway, 'cause, see, a little bit of rain with  mostly oil makes it extra slippery out there. When it's a lot of rain, people  are prepared mentally to slow down. In the wintertime, we get a lot of cars  that stall out. A nice day we don't see many vehicles."  </P> <P> Aside from all the different things that can happen to cars, occasionally  Cosgrove has to help psychiatric patients from the Manhattan State Hospital on  Randalls Island who have at times wandered on the bridge and into traffic.  </P> <P> Another tricky, dangerous thing that comes up every now and then is that dogs  get loose in the traffic.  </P> <P> Some nights Cosgrove doesn't get any calls at all. Then he takes care of his  routine responsibilities, or maybe he chauffeurs Triborough employees on or off  the bridge, or maybe he'll just drive around to make sure everything is OK.  </P> <P> "One of the main scary parts of this job is cars on fire," Cosgrove said. "We  get a lot of fires -- well, not a lot, but summertime, that's mostly when we  get fires. In the summertime. Every time I see a major fire, there's a little  voice in me that says, 'I hope this thing don't blow.' One time I had a fire --  this is when I first started. A blazing fire. And I said, "Holy boy, what am I  going to do with this thing?' But I got there with my hose and sprayed it out.  And after I did that, the car was really, really hot, but I didn't realize that  because once you see the fire gone, you don't imagine heat any longer. And when  I went to hook the car up to tow it, I burned my right hand. I said, 'Holy boy,  now how am I going to tow this car?' Then I went with my left hand, and I  burned both hands." Cosgrove sighed and laughed.  </P> <P> After he finished up with the cones, Cosgrove and a sergeant from the toll  plaza replaced the heavy-duty metal boxes (they call them "vaults") in which  the fares are collected with empty ones. Then he went to get coffee to go, as  he usually does, from a Twin Donut in Astoria, and came back to drink it in a  lounge near the toll plaza that the toll-booth attendants use during their  breaks. An older man, who had his own special chair situated squarely in front  of the TV, fiddled with the reception. Cosgrove's walkie-talkie began to  crackle. Cosgrove said things into it, like "This is the wrecker, come in," and  "Roger," and "ten-four." Then he turned, and with a trace of urgency in his  voice he said, "We got a call."  </P> <P> As it turned out, a van had blown some sort of gasket; the short, surly man to  whom the van belonged already had help on the way, and in the meantime didn't  want any assistance from Cosgrove and the Triborough authority.  </P> <P> Cosgrove drove around some more. He took some accident reports to the 25th  Precinct in Harlem, and to the 40th Precinct in the South Bronx, and then he  got back on the bridge and parked behind the tolls in the calm slip stream of  traffic and sat for a while in the cab and finished his coffee, which by now  was pretty cold.  </P> <P> Except for the low drone of traffic, it was quiet. The rain had stopped. The  clouds that shrouded Manhattan were fuzzy and luminous. Across the East River,  the city looked like a painted backdrop in a Broadway musical.  </P> <P> "So far it's a quiet night," Cosgrove said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "On the Threshold of a New Stage] </F>   [Text] Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will meet today in Cairo to put the final  touches to the agreement on implementing the Declaration of  Principles. All evidence indicates that the few issues left for  the Palestinian and Israeli leaderships will be resolved,  allowing for the agreement to be signed tomorrow as scheduled.    With the signing of the agreement, heavy responsibilities  and  burdens will be placed on the shoulders of the Palestinians.  These are epitomized by the powers and authorities that will be  transferred to the Palestinians in the Palestinian transitional  rule area and by the management of their own affairs in various  spheres. This is an extremely difficult task, requiring a great  deal of awareness and maturity, in addition to scientific,  management, and technical expertise and skills.    The Palestinians definitely do not suffer from a shortage of  capabilities and expertise to run their own affairs and manage  various aspects of their lives. Now that they are facing the  first challenges of assuming certain security and management  powers and authorities in the self-rule area, in addition to  other powers that will be handed over to them in the West Bank,  they realize well the heavy responsibilities and duties placed  on their shoulders and are aware of the dangers and  repercussions that might stem from their performance during the  stage they are about to enter.    No one can doubt the ability of the Palestinian people to  pass the next test and overcome the coming crucial challenges.  The process of a full century of struggle to obtain national  rights and the ensuing experience and sacrifices have taught the  Palestinians the meaning of affiliation to society.  Undoubtedly, the apprehension and anticipation dominating the  feelings of the Palestinians at this time will disappear with  the beginning of serious work to construct the expected entity.  This construction must take place within the framework of  sincere national affiliation and of placing the supreme interest  above any other consideration, as well as of dialogue and mutual  respect of opinions, the supremacy of objective and rational  concepts, and the proper democratic spirit.    In brief, with their wisdom and efforts and by being open to  the world around them, the Palestinians are able to silence the  skeptical voices that are rising now, especially from the  Israeli side, and which are betting in advance on the  Palestinians' inability to cope with the task that will be  handed over to them. Certainly, the task is not easy, but the  issue concerns the Palestinian people's continuing march, which  must move forward regardless of the cost, effort, and sacrifices.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Major's UN police force move gains more support BRITAIN'S proposal for the United Nations to send its own police units to northern Iraq to protect Kurdish refugees and replace 9,000 allied troops on duty there appeared to be gathering further support within the world body last night. Diplomats said a letter from Mr Major was delivered to Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the UN secretary-general, who discussed the plan with Sir David Hannay, Britain's UN representative, and US and French delegates. Although there was no official reaction from the secretary-general's office, a UN source said he saw merit in the proposal and felt it could be carried out possibly without need for a formal Security Council resolution. Western diplomats again emphasised their view that the secretary general had adequate authority to deploy UN civilian police in the area, to where an estimated 20,000 Kurdish refugees are returning every day. Nevertheless, the Soviet Union and China, the other permanent members of the Security Council, have been brought into the consultations. They were described as 'not negative' in their initial reactions. 'They are still thinking about it and we can take some encouragement from that,' a western delegate said. The west was said not to be worried by Iraqi objections, since Baghdad had changed its mind in the past, notably in agreeing eventually to allow the setting up of Kurdish safe havens. In northern Iraq, Kurdish refugees, started streaming home to the security zone carved around Zakho by allied western troops after peshmerga guerrillas took down roadblocks and let the refugees pass. The UN ran up its flag across from the first allied camp near Zakho, 10km from the border, establishing a regular presence alongside and separate from that of the allied troops. Many of the refugees arriving back in their home area passed the blue-and-white allied tent city and straight to the houses they had abandoned over the past two months. Allied commanders said that despite the UN presence any handover to the UN was still a long way off. The UN sanctions committee met yesterday but failed to take a decision on a request by Iraq for the unfreezing of about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) of assets, mainly in the UK, the US, Japan and Switzerland, and on the application by the Iraqis for the easing of the sanctions so that they might sell oil to the value of Dollars 945m and spend the proceeds on food and medicines. The committee has scheduled another meeting for Friday. The committee, comprising all 15 council members, operates on the basis of consensus and officials said neither request could survive the current strong objections of a number of members.

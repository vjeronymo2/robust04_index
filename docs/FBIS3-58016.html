Full membership, which would create new  rifts between the Central and East European states and the CIS  republics, could not be in the interests of all involved, the  foreign minister said in his annual survey of foreign policy on  Friday.    A fundamental decision is to be announced in Brussels,  Kinkel  announced. Bringing the states of Central and East Europe  closer to Western institutions is a top priority of German  foreign policy. After taking over the presidency of the European  Union on 1 July 1994, Bonn will work hard on the early  conclusion of a cooperation agreement with Russia. This would  bring Moscow into increasingly close partnership.</p>

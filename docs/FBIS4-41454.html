			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Nikolayev: "Route to Europe Lies Via the </F> Island of Corfu: President Boris Yeltsin Signs Agreement with  EU Today"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin arrived on the Greek island of Corfu  yesterday. He will be taking part in the ceremonial signing of  the Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian  Federation and the European Union, which will be held here today.    Although there was no official announcement of President  Boris Yeltsin's trip until the last few days, the world public  had begun talking about it long ago. And preparation for the  Russian guest's arrival was already in full swing on Corfu  itself in the runup to the top-level EU Council session. Among  other things, the Greek government asked the super-rich shipping  magnate Yannis Latsis to put his luxurious yacht, the  Alexandros, at our president's disposal during his stay. The  yacht was recently used by former U.S. President George Bush  when vacationing in Greece.    It is clear therefore why the special services team which  has  arrived from Moscow includes divers. Representatives of the  special services of other countries are also here. Thousands of  Greek policemen have been brought in to prevent any possibility  of terrorism or sabotage.    However, all the manifold detail of the conference  preparation, which is filling the press, does not prevent the  public from seeing the main reason for the Russian president's  trip to this distant island. He is to sign the Agreement on  Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and  the EU, to cover the next 10 years. Without going into the  detail of the almost 100-page package of documents connected  with the agreement, it is important to stress that they cover  virtually all spheres of collaboration with the EU -- economic,  political, and cultural.    These include the arrangements governing the trade in goods.  This is perhaps the most "painful" issue. It has been resolved  that the two parties will grant each other most-favored nation  status. The EU does not henceforth regard the Russian  Federation as a country with a planned economy but recognizes it  as a transitional economy. The agreement envisages the  development of cooperation in the basic sectors of the economy,  the liberalization of the movement of capital and current  payments, rules of competition, the harmonization of legislation  in the economic sphere, and much else besides.    Generally speaking, the document to be signed by Boris  Yeltsin lays down the principles for the free movement of goods,  capital, and services between the parties, on which basis  gradual integration of the economies of Russia and the EU will  take place. This should provide a healthy economic basis which  mutually opens markets and makes it possible to create  conditions favorable to the activity of companies and firms and  a climate conducive to investment.    We are thus talking about an all-embracing accord, a  document  which is not only extensive but very far-reaching. It will  certainly considerably help Russia to assume the place  appropriate to a great power in the world arena.    According to Boris Yeltsin, his visit will be exceptionally  useful to the Russian economy. He has described the signing of  the agreement as the first tactical move whereby our country  "arrives in Europe." Henceforth, he said, discriminatory  measures against Russia "whereby we have not been given quotas  for the export of goods are overcome." It can be said right  now, he stressed, that the new parameters of cooperation and  partnership will make it possible to increase exports to  European countries. The president added that the transitional  nature of the Russian economy had still not been acknowledged in  the United States. Barriers to Russian goods had not therefore  been abolished there yet.    The EU Council will be examining a host of problems. After  the signing of the agreement with Russia, for example, the  ceremonial accession of Austria, Norway, Finland, and Sweden to  the Union will take place. And yesterday evening the EU  countries' leaders organized a dinner with the Russian  Federation president at which topical international problems  were discussed.    The session will also sum up the results of the Greek  representative's six-month chairmanship of the Union. His place  will be taken by the representative of Germany.</p>

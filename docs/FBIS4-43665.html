			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Howard Davies, director general of the </F> Confederation of British Industry: "Industry's Advice to  Europe"]    [Text] Next week is a crucial one for the EC. The  outcomes of the social affairs council meeting on Wednesday [22  June], and the Corfu heads of government summit at the weekend  will show whether Europe's policymaking institutions are capable  of meeting the needs of European business, and of Europe's 18  million unemployed.    On Wednesday the Commission will once again ask social  affairs ministers of the 11 (excluding Britain) to agree the  European Committee, nee works council directive. (Like  companies in trouble, this directive changes its name quite  frequently.) It is unanimously opposed by Europe's employers,  on the ground that it will not, as it purports to do, improve  information and consultation procedures. Rather, it will impose  a rigid bureaucratic structure on a range of diverse practices  across Europe, which, by and large, work well.    David Hunt will be sent to mix the ouzos while this item is  discussed, but there are signs that the other ministers are not  as united as they once were, now that they have registered the  strength of business opinion. The Portuguese and Italian  governments are openly doubtful about the wisdom of going  forward, and the French have suggested a more leisurely progress.    UNICE, the European employers' body to which the CBI  [Confederation of British Industry] belongs, has put forward a  compromise. The social affairs council should pass an outline  directive requiring large, Europe-wide companies to agree  information and consultation procedures with their workforces,  where they do not already have them, but without specifying any  particular structures. In five years' time, the Commission  should review the position. If then many companies have still  failed to agree a consultation mechanism with their employees,  the Commission would be justified in proposing minimum  requirements.    Commissioner Padraig Flynn should advise the Council that  that is the best way forward. It will avoid a damaging row with  employers, for whom this is a touchstone by which to judge the  Community's social policy. He should also tell the ministers  that the consultations on his Green Paper have achieved no  consensus in favour of another ambitious social action  programme, so that the White Paper he brings forward shortly  will be a modest document, focusing on areas in which progress  across Europe is very mixed (such as equal opportunities).    A radical new social action programme would, of course, be  quite inconsistent with the Delors White Paper of last December.  Indeed, some of us have been puzzled by the relationship  between Jacques Delors's White Paper and the Flynn Green Paper,  which seem to differ in a lot more than colour.    The heads of government meeting should make it clear that  the  Delors' paper is predominant. And the summit should concentrate  on pushing forward some useful initiatives which have emerged  from discussions of it. Specifically, the heads of government  should endorse the proposal for a business-led group to review  the scope for deregulation. It should be an independent body,  able to publish its evidence and proposals. The Commission  would prefer a creature of its own to do the job; that would be  a mistake.    The summit should also endorse the conclusions of the "high  level group" set up under Commissioner Martin Bangemann on what  is mysteriously known as "European information society." Their  report, to which Peter Bonfield of ICL [International Computers  Limited] and Peter Davis of Reed Elsevier -- the British  representatives on the group -- have contributed a lot is a good  one. It endorses the principle of market liberalisation of  telecommunications across Europe, sketches out the exciting  possibilities thrown up by information superhighways and  describes a modest but important role for the Community,  focusing on creating the right regulatory environment.    The report does not support the case for Commission-directed  investment. Indeed, the Corfu summit would do well to bury the  "union bonds" idea in the sand. It is not relevant to the  European information society and should not be needed to promote  trans- European networks, the subject of a second working group  under Commissioner Henning Christopherson, which has not yet  reported.    Lastly, of course, the summit should address the leadership  question. There is no doubt that, on their merits, both Sir  Leon Brittan and Peter Sutherland are very strong candidates to  succeed Jacques Delors. But we are told that Jean-Luc Dehaene  or Ruud Lubbers is more likely to secure majority backing  (though the French may now feel that Jimmy Goldsmith would do  less damage in Brussels than in France).    Whoever is chosen should be told to take a bottle of retsina  and the OECD jobs study to the nearest taverna before he begins  to speak about Europe's new social agenda.</p>

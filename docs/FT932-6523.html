			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / How the news travelled from Grimsby to London IT SEEMS fitting that Norman Lamont's mum should steal the prime minister's thunder on the day her son was sacrificed to appease the government's critics. By noon yesterday, reshuffle speculation had reached fever-pitch, sterling was buoyant and the odds on the Conservatives winning the next general election were about to be shortened Behind the scenes on this day of high drama, Downing Street was engaged in the sort of news management operation that it once handled with its eyes shut. Then, at 12:06, the news flashed across news agency screens: Mrs Irene Lamont, 82, had told the Grimsby Evening Telegraph that her son had called to say he had resigned as chancellor. Mrs Lamont told the Telegraph: 'For the past three years they have given Norman a rough ride.' It was always going to be messy, but when the news from Grimsby broke, any notion that the bloodletting was going to be smoothly managed, let alone painless, quickly evaporated. The day had started with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, telling Mr Major to stop dithering. As if by prearrangement, Downing Street instantly obliged, serving notice that 'limited' changes at 'all levels' of government were to be made. No names were given, but it later emerged that Mr Major had decided about a week ago that yesterday would be the day. Trenchcoated reporters abandoned the Commons where a debate on the UK poultry industry was among the main attractions and charged through the Whitsun drizzle to Number 10. Behind the famous black door, Mr Lamont had already heard the bad news. He was not seen entering Number 10, only leaving Number 11. Only history will confirm if he used the connecting doors between these famous addresses to get the sack. A flow of ministerial Rovers, summoned to the headmaster's study by a series of early morning telephone calls, then began. The sprightliest hacks were in time to see Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, ushered into Mr Major's presence. Game over, reporters concluded. Cuddly Ken had been anointed as a chancellor with the common touch. Just before 10am, Mr Michael Howard, leading rightwing contender for Mr Lamont's job, arrived. The waters were muddied further when Mr Lamont entered Number 11 saying he had 'never felt better'. Significantly, however, Mr Clarke had never looked better when he emerged at 10.10am and waved obligingly to camera. A succession of lesser lights - Mrs Gillian Shephard, Mr David Hunt and Mr John Redwood - shuttled in and out to the accompaniment of the brass band in nearby Horseguards Parade. As the afternoon wore on, Mr Lamont was spotted glumly leaving the Treasury. Downing Street said Mr Lamont had departed without the customary courtesy of a letter to the prime minister. His parting shot was a terse statement faxed across later. Mr Lamont was then reported shopping at Harrods.</p>

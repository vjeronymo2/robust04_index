			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Cheam Cheam Group, the south London water supplier, increased pre-tax profits by 40 per cent in the six months to the end of September, from Pounds 1.41m to Pounds 1.98m. Turnover was 13 per cent higher at Pounds 7.75m (Pounds 6.85m). Earnings per share came out at 21.6p (15.2p) and the interim dividend is raised from 4p to 4.7p. Mr Andrew Kennedy, chairman, said the company had not felt able to justify a reduction in the permitted increase of 8.5 per cent in setting water charges for 1993-94 as requested by Ofwat. The board did agree not to make use of the 1 per cent previously abated in 1992-93 while retaining the option of recovering it in 1994-95.</p>

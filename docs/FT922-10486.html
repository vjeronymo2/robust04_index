			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: FNB increases income 20.5% FIRST National Bank (FNB), South Africa's third-largest bank, lifted net income by 20.5 per cent to R187.8m (Dollars 65.2m) in the six months to end-March on the back of asset growth of 18 per cent, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg. The bank recorded a 26.9 per cent increase in net interest income, to R920.6m, and a 21.8 per cent rise in the bad debt charge, to R160.5m. Mr Barry Swart, managing director, said the interest performance was due to the bank's focus on profitable business. The 27 per cent rise in net interest income came from a 20.6 per cent rise in advances. Other operating income was 21 per cent higher at R645.4m, but was overshadowed by a 23.1 per cent rise in other operating expenses.</p>

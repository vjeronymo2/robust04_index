"Our forces are based at the same positions of  Sala Krau, 10 kilometers (six miles) north of Pailin, and  Samlot, 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Pailin, and along Road  10," General Chum Chheang told AFP.    "We did not move our forces up because of the king's appeal  recently that we and the NADK (Khmer Rouge) must stop fighting.  So our forces are waiting for the order from the government,"  the general said in Phnom Penh. "I strongly believe that the  Royal Cambodian Armed Forces have sufficient capability to  capture Pailin if there is the order from the government," he  added. [passage omitted]    Khieu Samphan, the nominal leader of the Marxist Khmer  Rouge,  issued a statement from his jungle base on Tuesday, accepting  the monarch's proposal. [passage omitted]    But Chum Chheang cast doubt on Khieu Samphan's statement.  The  Khmer Rouge leader "never rejects the king's proposals, but he  always practices the opposite," Chum Chheang said. "He always  says this and does the other way."    Cambodian forces began first serious moves to take Pailin,  some 300 kilometers (185 miles) northwest of Phnom Penh, last  Saturday when they captured Sala Krau and Samlot and began  advancing along Road 10.    In addition to the three-pronged assault, an elite unit of  200 paratroops was stationed to the west of Pailin to cut off  any retreat of the Khmer Rouge across the border with Thailand,  some 10 kilometers (six miles) away. [passage omitted]    There had been unconfirmed reports that government forces  had  begun shelling Pailin with long range artillery, but Chum  Chheang denied this. "I did not receive any report from the  front line as saying government troops have started shelling,"  he said.    The general also denied Khmer Rouge accusations that the  Cambodian government would buy guns with the money provided by  the International Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia,  which began Thursday in Tokyo. "This is not true," Chum Chheang  said. "We can not take development aid to buy guns." [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Training charity to be relaunched: GrandMet will provide Pounds 50,000 a year for ethnic campaign Fullemploy, the charity which catered for the training of ethnic minorities before it collapsed under debts three years ago, is to be relaunched today. The charity was founded 20 years ago to develop training centres in the inner cities as part of an attempt to address higher than average unemployment among ethnic minorities. It had government funding of Pounds 1m a year at its peak and backing from the corporate sector. Fullemploy embarked on an ambitious expansion programme through its trading arm. By the end of the 1980s it was involved in a number of activities including publishing and campaigning. It was hit by the resignations of two chief executives in quick succession and government cuts in funding for employment training schemes. Fullemploy went into liquidation in early 1991. Today's relaunch comes after two years of work by GrandMet Trust, a charitable organisation funded by Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks company, which bought the assets from the liquidators after an approach by the charity's former management. GrandMet Trust has merged Fullemploy's training centres with its own, combined some of its other functions with the Urban Trust, and absorbed the accounting and personnel functions. The rescue package has cost GrandMet Trust about Pounds 150,000, with another Pounds 120,000 coming from Home Office grants. Mr Geoffrey Bush, group community relations director at GrandMet, said Fullemploy had been over-extended. What will emerge is a consultancy service called Project Fullemploy, with a staff of six, housed in the Truman Brewery, in the east end of London, which is home to several GrandMet charities. Its emphasis will be on helping to develop specialist training and employment-creating programmes for organisations with special attention to equal opportunities. Another important role will be to help foster a business ethos in the black community. Mr Joel O'Loughlin, director of Project Fullemploy said: 'The reasons Fullemploy started have not gone away. Black unemployment remains higher than ever but we are taking a different route to addressing the same problem.' GrandMet Trust is to fund the organisation through a Pounds 50,000 annual grant for the next three years and provide free office space and accountancy support. British Gas, Shell and Morgan Grenfell are making donations. The government is to provide support this year.</p>

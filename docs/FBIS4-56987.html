			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fabiola Vecchionacce from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] President Rafael Caldera attended an event held to  celebrate the 50th anniversary of Fedecamaras [Venezuelan  Federation of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and  Industry]. President Rafael Caldera criticized price increases  of certain products as well as profiteering in the sale of  dollars, which are acts of corruption that should be fought.  That was part of Caldera's speech during the celebration of the  50th anniversary of Fedecamaras. President Caldera pointed out  that all sectors of society must join Solidarity's efforts so it  can make progress.    Caldera also talked about the importance of opening up  opportunities for foreign investment by providing greater legal  guarantees. He said private and public corruption must be  fought. Let us listen to excerpts of what Caldera said.    [Begin Caldera recording] We have seen how the prices of  certain products have been increased. The Venezuelan people are  undoubtedly being hurt by this. It is an act of corruption that  we have to fight. We know that [words indistinct]. That is why  an atmosphere such as this, with a spirit of friendship and of  solidarity, can lead us to expect that we can all make an  effort. Just as the Venezuelan private sector condemns a  government official who steals the people's money through public  works that are built, it should also condemn a private sector  member, who buys dollars to resell them for an undue profit.  [end recording]    In addition, President Caldera agreed with Fedecamaras  President Edgar Romero Navas that the fight against inflation  must not be stopped because, according to Romero Navas, the  country requires a series of changes. Romero Navas also said  coherence and compromise are needed in the executive cabinet.  He said our business and political criteria on the handling of  the country's resources should also be taken into account.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK calls for African peacekeeping body Britain yesterday called for a fresh international effort to bring peace to Africa through a regional peace-keeping organisation based on the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said the UK wanted to work with South Africa and other African countries to 'turn the tide' against violence and war on the continent. Mr Major announced the initiative during an historic address to an informal joint sitting of parliament at the beginning of the first official visit to South Africa by a British prime minister since 1960. Earlier, he met South African President Nelson Mandela for talks on rebuilding the two countries' traditionally close relationship, which was weakened during South Africa's international isolation under the former whites-only government. Officials said the talks were conducted in 'an atmosphere of great warmth', suggesting that the ANC-led government of national unity has forgiven Britain for its less than enthusiastic endorsement of sanctions against the former regime. Mr Major urged South Africa to join the international community in bringing prosperity to the whole of Africa by helping to pre-empt outbreaks of violence, rather than trying to limit trouble after it had started. 'An entirely new effort at preventive diplomacy is long overdue. With our friends in Africa . . . Britain wants to develop new mechanisms to head off conflicts before they become unstoppable,' he said. 'We have in mind, for example, setting up regional peacekeeping cells. We need more people trained to mediate and act as peace brokers. We would not need a cumbersome bureaucracy, but a tight and properly resourced infrastructure in Africa.' The British proposals will be spelled out in more detail to the United Nations next week by Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, who has long sought a bigger role for pre-emptive mediation in international peacekeeping efforts. However, officials said the plan was intended to build on a recent resolution by the Organisation of African Unity calling for better conflict resolution procedures on the continent. They said the initiative was not intended to involve large numbers of troops, although the final shape of the peacekeeping force was likely to be determined by the UN and the OAU.</p>

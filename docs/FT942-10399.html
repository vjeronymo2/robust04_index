			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / IMF releases privatisation funds Peru's government can spend up to Dollars 876m from its privatisation programme on social and capital investment projects this year, according to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, Reuter reports from Lima. A letter of intent, published in the official gazette and due to be signed soon, lays out the 1994 targets for Peru's economic programme under a three-year extended fund facility which the government signed with the IMF in March 1993. Inflation will be reduced to between 15 and 20 per cent, gross domestic product will grow between 4 and 5 per cent and net international reserves will rise by Dollars 151m, it said. 'The government will deepen structural reforms to improve efficiency and increase national savings, laying the base for sustained growth and balance-of-payments viability,' the letter said.</p>

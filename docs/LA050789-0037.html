			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBSERVATORIES  </P> <P> Reading Paul Grossberg's letter, I must concur with his "observations" on the  famous observatory.  </P> <P> When we moved here 17 years ago we were delighted to be living so close and  made the trip, coming away with the same disappointment. Ten years later we  tried again, hoping to find some improvement in the public relations of this  facility. How can we inspire some effort to enlighten the visitors, especially  children, on what an observatory means to astronomers and how it operates?  </P> <P> MELBA WALLACK  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

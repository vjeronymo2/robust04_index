			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS WANT TO BE PARTNERS BUT NOT 'YES MEN' TO WEST;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: GORBACHEV PLEDGES COOPERATION WITH THE U.S. AND ITS ALLIES. BUT HE  RESISTS A ME-TOO POLICY.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged a new relationship of cooperation  with the United States and its Western allies Monday, but he immediately made  clear that for Moscow it will not be a me-too partnership.  </P> <P> Declaring the Persian Gulf crisis a "grave test" for those framing the new  international order, Gorbachev nevertheless refused to give President Bush an  immediate go-ahead for the use of military force to oust Iraq from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Although Bush pressed Gorbachev hard to endorse a new U.N. Security Council  resolution authorizing the use of force in the gulf, the Soviet president  called instead for further efforts to secure a political resolution of the  crisis.  </P> <P> "I think we all need patience," Gorbachev said as the two leaders, who are  attending the summit-level Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe,  began a lengthy dinner meeting that focused on the gulf crisis. If he was not  ready to sign on to Bush's timetable during the opening day of the Paris  summit, Gorbachev also kept his options open for the future.  </P> <P> "That does not mean that we are going to relax or retreat," Gorbachev  immediately added. "No, we are going to demand (Iraq's withdrawal) in a very  resolute way.  </P> <P> "And the fact that we are working together -- not only the Soviet Union and the  United States, but the United Nations and the whole world are acting together  -- allows me to expect that in this very difficult crisis a solution will be  found. And we will not waste time."  </P> <P> The point that Gorbachev made emphatically to Bush, according to senior Soviet  officials, was that the time had not yet come for war -- and thus, a new U.N.  resolution authorizing the use of force was premature, even as a threat.  </P> <P> "We believe that the united front the world has taken in opposing Iraq's  aggression is proving effective and that, fully enforced, the sanctions that  the U.N. has imposed will work," a Gorbachev adviser said earlier Monday. "We  have not exhausted the political means at our disposal, and we must use every  such possibility before we contemplate the use of force. . . .  </P> <P> "We believe that this crisis not only challenges the peaceful world order that  we see emerging here in Europe, between the East and the West and between the  Soviet Union and the United States, but that it is important -- very important  -- for the crisis to be resolved politically in order to incorporate this  approach in the pattern of international relations."  </P> <P> Asked whether the Soviet Union would veto a U.N. resolution authorizing the use  of force, a senior Gorbachev aide told a news conference, "No, we would discuss  it."  </P> <P> Vadim V. Zagladin, one of Gorbachev's foreign policy advisers, said, "This  question does not really stand before us because we have not exhausted the  political and economic measures that are available. We have many possibilities,  many ideas, and we will continue on the political path."  </P> <P> In taking this approach, Gorbachev is creating problems for Bush. But he is  carefully positioning the Soviet Union in its new relationship with the United  States and the West, believing that the crisis and its outcome will not only  test the new world order but also shape it.  </P> <P> "Our unity in condemning (Iraq's aggression) and our shared concern over the  outcome of the crisis are indicative of a radical shift in our mind-set and the  perception of the goals and means available in world politics," Gorbachev told  the CSCE gathering. "Any armed attack, wherever it may occur, now serves to  close our ranks rather than divide us further.  </P> <P> "In urging the aggressor's withdrawal from Kuwait, we are defending the hope  millions of people have begun to pin on the ability of the international  community to cope with exceptionally sharp conflicts. Otherwise, much of what  we have accomplished in the past few years would be in jeopardy."  </P> <P> Gorbachev told the conference that "today the Soviet Union and the United  States no longer act as adversaries but as partners." But he also made clear  that Moscow brings to that partnership its own perceptions, analyses and  approaches.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is looking for dialogue based on what Gorbachev calls "common  human values" and is seeking cooperation based on equality.  </P> <P> "We are prepared to cooperate, but we will not be led," another senior Soviet  official said Monday, referring both to the U.S.-Soviet discussions on the gulf  crisis and the evolving relationship. "The Bush Administration may be  misreading us on this. We are not the classic ally, we are not subservient, we  are not yes men. We want to be partners, and we do have our own ideas and  principles."  </P> <P> Under Gorbachev, the Soviet Union has adopted a foreign policy based on the  peaceful resolution, if possible, of all conflicts based on what Moscow calls  "a balance of interests."  </P> <P> From the outset of the gulf crisis in August, Moscow has condemned Iraq's  seizure of Kuwait and supported Washington in the mobilization of the  international community against the action. Its assistance was essential in  securing United Nations sanctions against Iraq.  </P> <P> But at the same time, Moscow has insisted that every effort be made to find a  political solution based on Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait; the restoration of  Kuwaiti sovereignty and independence, and then perhaps a settlement of Iraq's  grievances against Kuwait.  </P> <P> Zagladin said the Soviet Union believes that the disastrous consequences of a  full-scale war in the Persian Gulf have not been fully assessed by the United  States.  </P> <P> The conflict would have "a potentially catastrophic impact" throughout the  Middle East, he told a news conference, and would result in a new Arab-Israeli  war. "The economic impact would be even larger, reaching from London to New  York to Tokyo to Frankfurt . . . and even, in ecological terms, the use of  chemical weapons and the destruction of the oil fields should not be  underestimated."  </P> <P> THE SUMMIT -AT-A-GLANCE  </P> <P> Leaders representing 34 countries in the CSCE were on hand in Paris on Monday  for the start of a three-day summit billed as an epic event that will set the  stage for cooperation in post-Cold War Europe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE CONFERENCE HISTORY  </P> <P> The present-day CSCE has its roots in the 1975 signing of the Helsinki Final  Act, which aimed to foster improved relations within the European community.  The agreement touched upon issues of security and formed a basis for  collaboration in humanitarian, economic, scientific and environmental fields.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAJOR AGENDA ITEMS  </P> <P> The signing of agreements to reduce non-nuclear forces in Europe and to commit  NATO and the Warsaw Pact to closer cooperation.  </P> <P> Institutionalization of the CSCE, setting up a small secretariat in Prague, a  center in Vienna for the prevention of conflict and an office in Warsaw to help  monitor elections.  </P> <P> A proposal that the heads of member states meet at least once every two years,  their foreign ministers annually.  </P> <P> France is proposing creation of a conciliation process to resolve differences  between member states regarding ethnic minorities.  </P></p>

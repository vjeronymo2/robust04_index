			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the assessment section of the Strategy EPA proposes that Agency program offices all use standard sediment toxicity test methods and chemical-specific sediment quality criteria to determine whether sediments are contaminated. Actions that EPA will take to develop a national inventory of sites and sources of sediment contamination (the National Sediment Inventory) are described in the assessment section of the proposed Strategy. The National Sediment Inventory will be used by EPA to target sites for contaminated sediment assessment, prevention, and remediation. These assessment actions will enable EPA to focus on cleaning up the most contaminated waterbodies, and ensuring that further sediment contamination is prevented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's plan to stop sediment contaminants from reaching the environment is described in the prevention section of the proposed Strategy. In order to regulate the use of pesticides and toxic substances that accumulate in sediment, EPA proposes the use of acute sediment toxicity tests to support registration of chemicals under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act. In the prevention section of the Strategy EPA also proposes: developing effluent guidelines for industries that discharge sediment contaminants in significant amounts; using pollution prevention policies to reduce or eliminate sediment contamination resulting from noncompliance with permits; preparing guidelines for design of new chemicals to reduce bioavailability and partitioning of toxic chemicals to sediment; and implementing point and nonpoint source controls that will protect sediment quality. EPA's prevention actions will stop further contamination of sediment and reduce ecological and human health risks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the remediation section of the Strategy EPA proposes using multiple statutes to require contaminated sediment remediation by parties responsible for pollution. These statutes include the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Rivers and Harbors Act, and the Oil Pollution Act. EPA states in the proposed Strategy, however, that the Agency will not proceed with a clean-up if a combination of pollution prevention and source controls will allow the sediments to recover naturally in an acceptable period of time. EPA's remediation actions will clean up existing sediment contamination that adversely affects the Nation's waterbodies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the dredged material management section of the proposed Strategy, EPA discusses the development of technical guidance regarding dredged material testing, dredged material disposal site selection, and disposal alternatives. EPA actions described in the proposed Strategy will ensure continued disposal of dredged material in an environmentally sound manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the research section of the Strategy, EPA proposes a program of investigative research that is needed to: develop and validate new chemical-specific sediment criteria and other sediment assessment methods; improve EPA's understanding of the transfer of sediment contaminants through the food chain; and develop and evaluate a range of technologies for remediating contaminated sediments. EPA's proposed research program will support improved assessment, prevention, and remediation of contaminated sediment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The outreach section of the proposed Strategy describes actions that EPA will take to demonstrate, through public involvement, the Agency's commitment to, and accountability for, sediment management efforts. EPA will produce, and make available to the public, regular status reports on sediment management activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Next Steps Toward Implementation of a Federal Agency Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA will begin to track activities of the Agency's program offices as they implement the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy. However, EPA envisions that this internal strategy will also be the keystone of a much larger Federal Government strategy for the management of contaminated sediment. The Water Resources Development Act of 1992 (WRDA 92) requires a National Contaminated Sediment Task Force to advise the Federal Government on the extent and severity of sediment contamination; sediment restoration methods and technologies; prevention and source control measures; and long-term disposal sites for contaminated dredged material. The EPA Administrator and the Secretary of the Army will convene the Task Force and submit the Agency's Strategy to the Task Force for use in developing a Federal agency contaminated sediment management strategy. The Task Force can build upon EPA's coordinated research program, the research of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other Federal agencies to improve methodologies for measuring ecological and human health risks from contaminated sediment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's National Sediment Inventory is a repository of sediment monitoring data generated by Federal agencies to identify contaminated sediment sites. This data base can be used by Federal, State, and local agencies to focus their pollution prevention and remediation efforts on the worst sites of sediment contamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy addresses coordination of EPA Regional and Headquarters roles in the management of dredged material, and describes ongoing regulatory development activities related to dredged material management.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Strategy will help facilitate the coordination of dredged material management activities among Federal agencies and nongovernmental organizations. Coordination of dredged material management activities has been called for in the May 1994 options paper drafted by the Federal Interagency Working Group on the Dredging Process. The Working Group was convened by the Secretary of Transportation in the Fall of 1993. The Group has held a series of outreach sessions throughout the country to solicit ideas on improving the dredging process. The Working Group identified a number of options to improve the dredging process. Some of these options include: enhanced research and monitoring to improve dredged material disposal decisionmaking, identification of opportunities to control sources of sediment contaminants, and effective education and communication with the public on the risks and impacts associated with dredged material disposal. The proposed Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy addresses all of these issues. It describes a plan for research on interpretation of bioaccumulation and chronic toxicity tests and dredged material disposal site assessment. It provides a plan for identification and control of sources of sediment contaminants. It also proposes effective ways of interacting with the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Investment losses push Hibernian in the red Hibernian Group, the third largest insurance company in the Irish Republic, reported a pre-tax loss of IPounds 6.24m (Pounds 6.2m) for the first six months of 1994, against restated profits of IPounds 31.5m. The result was after realised and unrealised investment losses of IPounds 18.1m (gains of IPounds 21.2m). Operating profits were 15 per cent ahead at IPounds 11.8m (IPounds 10.2m). After a tax credit of IPounds 2.67m (IPounds 11.6m debit) losses per share emerged at 7p against earnings of 38.9p. The interim dividend is raised by 9 per cent to 2.5p (2.3p). Hibernian, which earns more than 80 per cent of its non-life income in Ireland, saw general insurance profits rise by 7 per cent to IPounds 9.4m (IPounds 8.8m), largely reflecting an improved underwriting performance. Underwriting losses were cut to IPounds 7m (IPounds 8.46m) - mainly because of the effect of past premium rate increases - and helped offset a reduction in income from investments to IPounds 16.4m (IPounds 17.3m). Premium income increased by 8 per cent to IPounds 108.9m. Operating profits from life assurance and pensions business increased by 67 per cent to IPounds 2.42m (IPounds 1.45m). New annual premiums increased by 43 per cent to IPounds 5.3m, with Hibernian increasing its market share. Single premium sales amounted to IPounds 19.1m, compared with IPounds 35.1m. Last year single premium business was boosted by sales of guaranteed bonds. The group said that 'severe volatility' in world stock markets during the first half of 1994 caused a fall in the capital value of investments of IPounds 18.1m, with shareholders' funds decreasing to IPounds 95.5m compared with IPounds 100.1m at December 31. Net assets per share amounted to 185p (195.5p at end-December). Mr Cecil Hayes, general manager finance, said that despite the investment losses the group had still outperformed the Irish gilt and equity markets.</p>

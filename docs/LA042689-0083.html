			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Jurors in the trial of former White House aide Oliver L. North completed  another day of deliberation without a recurrence of medical complaints that had  marked their previous day's work. A Public Health Service nurse examined juror  Jean Johnson, 53, who had complained of high blood pressure Monday, and no  further difficulties were reported from the jury room. Two other jurors with  heavy colds were reported still at work. Having finished 21 hours of  deliberation over four days, jurors were transported to their hotel for the  night with instructions to resume their sessions this morning.  </P></p>

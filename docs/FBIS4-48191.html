			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] We have said that the Rwandan Patriotic Front  [RPF] cannot accept France taking part again militarily in an  operation in Rwanda in any capacity whatsoever.    The behavior of the French Government in the Rwandan affair  is so well known that it is almost impossible for France to  envisage (?deploying) its troops in our country. The French  Government has never stopped supporting those who committed the  atrocities which erupted and continue in Rwanda, mainly by  remaining silent. This is a conniving silence in the face of  all the massacres which destroyed and still destroy human lives  in Rwanda, particularly since the beginning of the war in 1990,  through its military support in terms of men and weapons. A  large quantity of weapons deployed to exterminate the Rwandan  population has been provided by France to the bloody Kigali  regime. France also gave intensive military training to  Presidential Guards and to Republican National Movement for  Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense of the  Republic militias which have caused such misery to befall the  Rwandan population.

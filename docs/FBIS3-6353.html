Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says the Kim Yong-sam  group is committing another flunkeyist treachery by scheming to  fling open the door wider to the corrupt culture of Japan this  year and turn society into a dark sphere where Japanese fashion  and Japanese way of life will hold sway.    The news anlayst says:    The decadent American ideologies and culture and the corrupt  culture of the Japanese reactionaries have made their way into  South Korea to paralyze the consciousness of the people and  degenerate society.    When more immoral ideologies and culture flood into South  Korea where people and society are already corrupt and ailing  with the infiltration of Japan's reactionary culture, the  aftereffects will be monstrous.    If the South Korean puppets massively introduce Japanese  culture under the cloak of "internationalisation" and "opening,"  South Korea will, no doubt, become more dependent on Japan not  only in politics and economy but in culture as well.  Unpardonable is the treachery of the Kim Yong-sam group which  is trying to prolong its remaining days with the support of its  masters at the expense of the interests of the nation, fawning  upon and submitting to foreign forces.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / State loan urged for Mersey barrage SHAREHOLDERS in the Mersey barrage are to press the government to change its decision not to back the Pounds 1bn plan for an electricity-generating dam between Liverpool and the Wirral to harness the Mersey's tides. They believe the government has misunderstood the project's finances and say there would ultimately be no cost to public funds, instead possibly a profit. They blame ministerial changes since the general election and the absorption of the Department of Energy into the Department of Trade and Industry for the government decision. If it went ahead, the barrage would raise about 30 per cent of its construction costs in one group of loans, based on electricity revenues of 3p a unit. Shareholders want the remaining Pounds 700m as another group of loans, but underwritten by the non-fossil-fuel levy - the money added to electricity bills to develop rene-wable sources of energy. All or part of the Pounds 700m might come from the pool of money the levy has already built up, or by charging an additional 4p a unit after generating starts. In the latter case, such assured revenue would mean the Pounds 700m could be borrowed commercially. Whatever route were taken, the barrage company would repay the money to the government. 'We are asking for a non-fossil-fuel levy loan, not a non-fossil-fuel grant,' Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman of Mersey Barrage, said yesterday. Repayment would be slowest if the 4p a unit route was followed, beginning when the barrage was 20 years old. At that point, the barrage would be starting to make large profits as a result of its owners' depreciating it completely in the first 25 years of its 120-year life. Mr James McCormack, a Tarmac executive who is also general manager of the barrage company, said repayment could begin earlier if all or part of the Pounds 700m came directly from the non-fossil-fuel levy fund, as that would save on commercial loan charges. A reasonable rate of return would also be paid to the government, probably at about 5 per cent a year. Another barrage company director, Sir Peter Morrison, a former employment and energy minister, told shareholders the present public-sector spending round was the toughest for 14 years and may have conditioned ministerial thinking. The barrage needs Pounds 14m to proceed to final design and resolve objections from shipping interests about navigation. Any government contribution to those costs would come from Treasury funds and may have been why ministers balked, asking for the project to be shelved. Sir Desmond said the company had until November before shareholders had to decide whether to go further on their own. The time would be used to persuade the government to reconsider.</p>

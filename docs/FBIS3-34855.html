			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Meetings of the higher Jordanian-Palestinian joint  committee began at the Foreign Ministry today. The committee is  led by Dr. Sa'id al-Tall, deputy prime minister and minister of  higher education, and Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO's Political  Department. The meetings were attended by committee members of  the Jordanian and Palestinians sides.    The meetings will discuss various issues regarding  economics,  security, and development, as well as the issues tackled by the  multilateral talks.    Following the first session of higher Jordanian-Palestinian  joint political committee meetings, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani,  minister of information and minister of state for cabinet  affairs, and Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, PLO Executive Committee member  and head of the Information Department, held a joint news  conference.    Dr. al-'Anani said:    [Begin al-'Anani recording] Today's meeting was very  fruitful  and beneficial. Agreement was reached on several issues. First  of all, we discussed the mechanism of coordination, and our  evaluation of the coordination that has been conducted so far.  We decided to adopt policies that provide a clear mechanism for  this coordination, based on clear timetables, specific  committees, and fixed dates of meetings so we can coordinate our  positions from now on, especially because the negotiations  process and the peace process have begun to move from the  negotiations halls to practical implementation on the ground.  This affects the interest of the Jordanian and Palestinian  peoples on the two banks.    Likewise, we discussed the basic issues that are of an  urgent  and current nature. We know that Palestinian-Israeli economic  talks will begin in Paris. Therefore, we appreciate the  understanding of the brothers on the Palestinian side for the  need for coordination with us, particularly in the field of  trade cooperation and trade exchange. At present, this point  has special importance.    We discussed the stage of what are called security  arrangements and borders. We agreed to activate the committee  assigned with this subject and to exchange expertise and  information in this field. We also agreed to coordinate the  traffic of passengers on both sides, and to make sure that the  opening of the bridges after the implementation of self-rule  will be in the interests of the people, in term of their  movement and their return to their land -- not to empty the land  but to entrench the people there.    As for the two other issues, which are the refugees and  Jerusalem, we agreed to form two committees, a specialized  committee for each subject, in order to agree on the frameworks  within which we should deal with these two basic and sensitive  topics. You know, for the Palestinian side, these two subjects  are delayed until the negotiations on the final stage, but we  can coordinate our positions now on negotiations concerning  these subjects in a manner that secures for the Palestinian  people, and the Arab people in general, their rights in their  land in Palestine and Jerusalem, and the same applies to the  basic rights of the refugees. [end recording]    For his part, 'Abd-Rabbuh Said:    [Begin 'Abd-Rabbuh recording] The meeting discussed almost  all issues on the agenda in the areas that Dr. Jawad al-'Anani  mentioned. I believe this meeting was practical, and allows us  to go ahead with substantial steps, whether in bilateral  Jordanian- Palestinian coordination or in supporting the  position of the two parties within the framework of the  negotiations process.    There are issues that are still under discussion, such as  the  evacuees. Also under discussion is the idea of forming a  quadruple committee, preceded by a  Jordanian-Egyptian-Palestinian meeting to coordinate stands  between these parties. This subject is of primary concern and  is among the issues that are supposed to be settled during the  transitional stage. [end recording]</p>

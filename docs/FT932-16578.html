			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Hermes details scheme to go public HERMES, the French luxury goods group, has released details of plans to go public in June by joining the second market in Paris, writes Alice Rawsthorn. Hermes, still controlled by the Hermes family, intends to increase its share capital by 4 per cent, by issuing 467,410 new shares. The price has not yet been revealed. The company will also allow three banks - Banque Nationale de Paris, the BFCE group and Banque Hottinguer - to place a 10 per cent stake among institutional investors. The institutions will then be able to sell their shares on the open market. Mr Dumas said that after the issue the founding family would still own 81.4 per cent of the equity. Hermes has seen sales growth slow in the past three years since its peak in 1989. However, Hermes, which has 242 sales outlets worldwide, saw sales rise by 2.5 per cent to FFr2.46bn (Dollars 451m) in 1992 while net profits rose by 46 per cent to FFr176.2m.</p>

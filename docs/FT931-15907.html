			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Britain joins in a game once deemed a sin: With a national lottery on the cards, David Spanier delves into gambling history THE ARRIVAL of a national lottery in Britain will give the state a direct stake in the game. Church and state have traditionally been against gambling. But the Lottery Bill before Christmas changed this completely. Although they may deny it, the authorities will be encouraging gambling. The more money gambled, the more benefit to such recipients as the arts. And the more revenue, no doubt, for the Treasury. In this game, Britain is a late starter. The huge cash prizes promised in the lottery extend to Britain a trend proliferating round the world: the spread of commercial gaming with official approval. Gambling, provides a thrill; it may be short, as in the spin of a roulette wheel, it may be weekly, as in a national lottery, or it may be long term, as in currency speculation. The price - how much money to risk - is decided by the player. Gambling was once seen as a sin. In England it was opposed by the church, from the Middle Ages to Victorian times. The bible was cited as justification for this view, although no injunction such as 'Thou shalt not gamble' can be found in the scriptures. The real reason why the authorities opposed gambling was that it interfered with people's work. Games of chances were banned in the court of Henry VIII because the soldiers' passion for gaming grew so intense it interfered with archery training. When Premium Bonds were introduced, Geoffrey Fisher, Archbishop of Canterbury, fulminated against 'debasing the spiritual coinage of the people'. He told the Lords: 'The government knows, as well as the rest of us, that we can regain stability and strength only by unremitting exercise all through the nation of the old-fashioned and essential virtues. . . honest work honestly rewarded.' A more fundamental (perhaps instinctive) reason for the authorities' opposition to gambling is that people enjoy it. Anything allowing people to do what they want when they want, was seen as wrong or anti-social. In Victorian times attitudes began to change. Society came to see gambling as a crime rather than a sin, like prostitution. People might lust after fallen women but this was regarded as an undesirable trait of human nature which ought to be suppressed. But while formally condemned, prostitution was patronised by the upper classes. So with gambling. Around the turn of the century, the beau monde took off for Deauville or Monte Carlo to gamble. The masses, meanwhile, were supposed to get on with their work. The inconsistency of gaming laws was not shown up until the late 1950s, when John Aspinall came on to the London scene. His high stakes gaming parties, moving from house to house, were the Mayfair equivalent of the betting on horses with a street bookie - both were evading out of date laws prohibiting gambling. In due course the law was changed, first by a betting and gaming bill in 1960, which proved counter-productive, and then by the Gaming Act of 1968. Gambling in Britain still tends to be regulated by Home Office ideas of what is good for people. Thus, slot machines are limited to two per club. But perceptions about gambling are changing again. It has now come to be seen as a legitimate aspect of human behaviour. Once gambling ceases to be seen as wrong and is regarded as part of the leisure industry, it becomes practical to tax it. Indeed, gambling is being seen as a useful revenue earner. This reopens the question, however, of how gambling should fit into society. It is one thing for people to gamble at the race-track or in a casino. It becomes quite another thing if a government is actively encouraging gambling as a means of raising revenue. Furthermore, it is arguable that raising taxes through gambling is inherently bad economics. It is a voluntary tax because people do not have to gamble unless they want to. But it still has a bit of the 'smoke and mirrors' to it in that gambling revenue reflects expenditure diverted from elsewhere. Gains should therefore be discounted against lower activity in other sectors. At best, it is argued, such a source of revenue is a palliative which saves the government from bringing in orthodox tax measures, such as income or sales taxes. Certainly the Treasury should do well out of it. When up and running, say in its fifth year, the lottery is expected to produce anything from Pounds 1.5bn to as much as Pounds 4bn. Of this, the Treasury will lop off its due share in tax. The rate has yet to be decided, but if it were to be 20 per cent (which is one figure being talked about) the Treasury would benefit from between Pounds 300m and Pounds 800m. Good causes - arts, sports, charities, heritage and the 'Millennium Fund' for 2000 - will get 30 per cent of this. The Treasury, we may be sure, regards itself as a good cause. Expenses must also be paid. This would leave perhaps less than a half of the total money wagered for the prizes. What a gamble] But wait, this is merry old England. The government is not talking about 'gambling'. It is talking about 'improving the quality of life'. It is, formally, against encouraging gambling. You can bet on that.</p>

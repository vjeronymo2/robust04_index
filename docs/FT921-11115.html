			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Banker held as US requests extradition POLAND'S commercial banking system has been dealt another blow with the arrest this weekend of Mr David Bogatin, a US citizen of Russian origin, who owns the First Commercial Bank in Lublin. This is one of only seven banks with foreign capital. The arrest is in connection with extradiction proceedings initiated by the American authorities. They are conducting an investigation into Mr Bogatin's alleged involvement in petroleum tax evasion in the mid-1980s. Mr Bogatin came to Poland three years ago when he established Sunpol, a successful fruit processing business, and later the bank in which he holds 97.5 per cent of the shares. The First Commercial expanded rapidly last year establishing 14 branches, mainly in eastern Poland. The bank has attracted Zl846bn (Pounds 41.5m) but depositors scared by newspaper reports of Mr Bogatin's past difficulties started a run on the bank. Mr Bogatin then managed to bring the situation temporarily under control by personally assuring hundreds of worried clients that their savings were safe. Last year Poland's banking system was hit by two major banking scandals which led to the arrest of the head of the NBP, the central bank, and charges against other senior officials.</p>

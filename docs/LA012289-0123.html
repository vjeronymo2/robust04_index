			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 50TH DISTRICT CANDIDATES FOCUS DEBATE ON TUCKER  </P> <P> As befits a special election expected to draw a low voter turnout, the small  crowd that turned out for a candidate forum in Inglewood last week was  dominated by political insiders.  </P> <P> About 50 people, many of them campaign workers and former or future candidates  for various offices, watched the debate among the 50th Assembly District  candidates: Republican Mike Davis and Democrats Lois Hill-Hale, Carl McGill,  and Curtis Tucker Jr. The four are seeking to fill the seat of Curtis Tucker,  who died in October.  </P> <P> The forum, organized by the Inglewood/Airport Chamber of Commerce, was one of  the few opportunities voters will have to see the candidates before the special  election on Feb. 7.  </P> <P> As expected, the focus at Thursday's debate was on Tucker, considered the  favorite because of the financial and political support he has attracted from  top Democrats, most notably Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). As  of the last campaign reporting date, Tucker had raised more than $48,000; none  of his opponents had raised more than $1,000.  </P> <P> Tucker's foes hammered at the issue of leadership. Their hopes for an upset  appear to rest on persuading voters that Tucker's main qualification is his  name and that Brown is condemning the district to ineffective leadership  controlled by outside forces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tucker's Position  </P> <P> Tucker, a legislative aide to Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), said he  is the most qualified candidate to carry on the policies of his father. He said  his connections to the Democratic leadership will help him get things done in  Sacramento.  </P> <P> Another major issue was the death penalty, which Tucker supports and Hill-Hale  opposes.  </P> <P> Candidates also discussed health care, crime, education, economic development  and ethnic relations, all pressing issues in the district, which encompasses El  Segundo, Inglewood, Lennox, Westchester and parts of South Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Although Davis, a Republican, has sought the Assembly seat twice without  success, most recently when the elder Tucker won a posthumous victory in  November, Tucker's strategists see him as potentially the strongest challenger  to Tucker. Candidates, their strategists and elected officials predict that as  few as 26,000 of the largely Democratic district's 147,520 registered voters  will cast ballots. That means conservatives in largely Republican El Segundo  and Westchester, who tend to vote more consistently, could form a  disproportionate part of the electorate and boost Davis' chances.  </P> <P> If no one wins more than 50% of the vote Feb. 7, the top Democrat will face  Davis in an April runoff.  </P> <P> Davis, a business consultant, described himself as the candidate who can best  serve as a "bridge" between the more affluent western part of the district and  the economically depressed eastern sections.  </P> <P> "One common sociological thread does not exist," Davis said. "You have to get  out into the different communities and hear the constituents. I'm the man who  can do it."  </P> <P> Davis calls himself a moderate Republican. For example, he said, California  should adopt a universal health insurance plan similar to that set up in  Massachusetts by the former Democratic presidential candidate, Gov. Michael S.  Dukakis.  </P> <P> Hill-Hale, an Inglewood school board member who appears to be Tucker's toughest  Democratic competition, emphasized that she is the only elected official in the  race and worked eight years as chief deputy to Sen. Diane Watson. (D-Los  Angeles). Watson has joined other Democrats endorsing Tucker, though Hill-Hale  calls that a result of pressure by Brown.  </P> <P> Hill-Hale said she would be a "fresh new start" for the district and lambasted  Tucker as a tool of "fat cats in Sacramento." On the question of shrinking  availability of emergency health care, especially to low-income constituents,  she claimed that the elder Tucker respected her as a health expert. She pledged  to work for increased state funding for health care and to be "eternally  vigilant" against racism.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clash on Death Penalty  </P> <P> Hill-Hale also attacked Tucker on the death penalty, which she opposes because  she claims it is disproportionately applied to minorities. She called Tucker's  statements that it is cheaper to execute criminals than pay for them to stay on  Death Row "elitist and cavalier."  </P> <P> Tucker accused Hill-Hale of misrepresenting his statements and reiterated his  position that some of the money paying to house Death Row inmates could go to  health care or education.  </P> <P> "I believe in capital punishment for specific crimes," he said. "It costs more  to keep a man on Death Row for a year than it does to send a kid to Harvard. .  . . There's not much chance to rehabilitate a mass murderer."  </P> <P> Tucker also said criticism of his allegiance to Brown is a diversionary tactic.  </P> <P> "He's the most powerful man in the state," Tucker said. "In order to get  anything done, you have to work with him, not against him."  </P> <P> McGill, a Los Angeles police officer and recognized gang expert, is a political  newcomer who admits to lacking funds. He claimed grass-roots support and  commitment to law enforcement, especially his efforts to educate the community  about gang violence. McGill also sounded the most repeated and passionate  attack on Tucker and the Democratic leadership, whom he blames for neglecting  the district and allowing problems of crime, unemployment and drugs to fester.  </P> <P> "There are brothers out there who need jobs," McGill said. "There are sisters  selling their bodies on Figueroa (Street). I'm sick of seeing kids die in the  streets. . . . The community has suffered a great deal because it has not had  proper representation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE CANDIDATES  </P> <P> Curtis Tucker Jr., Considered the favorite because of support he has drawn from  top Democrats.  </P> <P> Mike Davis, Conservatives, who tend to vote more consistently, could boost the  chances for Davis, a Republican.  </P> <P> Lois Hill-Hale, The Inglewood school board member emphasizes that she is the  only elected official in the race.  </P> <P> Carl McGill, The Los Angeles police officer, who is an expert on gangs, is a  political newcomer.  </P></p>

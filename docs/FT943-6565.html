			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Defeated Mexican candidate urges calm The presidential candidate of Mexico's main leftist opposition party, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, has urged supporters to obey the law and avoid conflict in spite of the outcome of the election a week ago, which he has denounced as fraudulent. Addressing a crowd of 70,000 in Mexico City's central square, Mr Cardenas modified his strident rhetoric of early last week. He warned his supporters not to be provoked into clashes that could lead to bloodshed. The governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) won the election with 50.2 per cent of the votes that were not annulled and 48.8 per cent of all votes cast, according to official results. The centre-right National Action Party came second with 26.7 per cent of valid votes, with Mr Cardenas trailing a poor third on 17.1 per cent. Mr Cardenas has claimed that many of his supporters were deliberately left off voting lists and that those from the ruling party were allowed to vote several times. He has yet to offer proof of such allegations, although in his speech he proposed to establish a series of regional 'truth commissions' to examine electoral fraud. The softening of Mr Cardenas's position follows divisions in his own party on how best to respond to defeat. While hard-liners have urged massive protests, the moderates in the party have warned that this would further damage its public image and deflect from the task of rebuilding and moving to the political centre. 'We are not afraid, but we will not fall into forms of mobilisation that, in current conditions, would inevitably wear us out and exhaust both us and society,' Mr Cardenas said at the rally. In a sign that he is open to dialogue with Mr Cardenas, President Carlos Salinas said in an interview last week: 'It's important to have the presence of a modern party of the left that participates in politics and social development. I trust that Mr Cardenas, who participated in the reforms of past years, will continue to contribute in the following years.' However, Mr Cardenas warned that unless electoral conditions were fairer for his party - especially in its access to television and in campaign spending  -his supporters would not vote in future elections. Without democratic opening, he indicated, the electoral process could not be considered a legitimate way of transferring political power.</p>

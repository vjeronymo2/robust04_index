			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS ACT ON PANEL TO REVIEW JAIL DEATHS  </P> <P> Reacting to complaints about procedures for reviewing jail deaths, the San  Diego County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday took the first step toward  establishing an independent panel of medical specialists to investigate inmate  deaths.  </P> <P> By a unanimous vote, the supervisors moved tentatively toward the creation of  an eight-member Jail Medical Audit Committee to investigate the circumstances  surrounding jail deaths, as well as to review medical treatment in the jails.  </P> <P> Chief Administrative Officer Norman Hickey estimates that the medical panel  will cost $100,000 annually, and the supervisors decided to defer consideration  of the proposal until they begin deliberations on the county's fiscal 1990  budget later this spring.  </P> <P> Even that relatively modest amount -- seemingly insignificant in contrast to  the county's overall $1.3-billion budget -- could pose difficulties because of  severe economic constraints, county administrators emphasize.  </P> <P> From 1983 to 1988, there were 28 deaths in local jails, according to a report  prepared by Hickey's office. Of those, the county coroner's office attributed  11 deaths to natural causes, 10 to suicide, 6 to accidents and 1 to homicide.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department now has the primary responsibility for investigating  jail deaths, with the coroner's office, district attorney, county grand Jury,  state attorney general and state corrections board also playing roles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increasingly Questioned  </P> <P> However, the objectivity of those investigations has increasingly been  questioned in recent years, in large measure because of allegations by inmates'  relatives and others that sheriff's deputies' abuse of prisoners or jail  officials' negligence contributed to some of the deaths. Critics of the  existing system argue that it is inherently flawed through a conflict of  interest stemming from the Sheriff's Department's dual role as operator of the  jails and investigator of jail deaths.  </P> <P> Those complaints notwithstanding, the county's existing policies "provide a  sound basis for an independent review" of jail deaths, Assistant Chief  Administrative Officer David Janssen told the supervisors.  </P> <P> Under Hickey's proposal, that independent review would be conducted by a board  consisting of a surgeon, internist, emergency physician, a nurse, the county  pathologist and coroner and the jails' medical director and nurse coordinator.  In addition to enhancing the credibility of jail-death investigations, the  panel's studies could be used to recommend corrective action or policy changes,  Hickey said.  </P> <P> To further improve the process, Hickey has recommended that the supervisors  adopt procedures, recently proposed by the Grand Jury, to expand the district  attorney's role in the investigations.  </P> <P> Supervisor Susan Golding, who requested the study reviewed Tuesday, praised  Hickey's proposal for the independent medical board, even while agreeing that,  because of the county's tight finances, it should not be reviewed in isolation  from the rest of the budget.  </P> <P> "I'm more convinced than ever that an independent investigation is needed,"  Golding said.  </P></p>

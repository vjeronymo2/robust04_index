			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 103 STILL ON HOLD  </P> <P> Socialist solutions to economic problems don't work. They never have and they  never will. And yet, Rosenfield is recommending a socialist "solution" to the  economic problem of auto insurance.  </P> <P> Without questioning the wisdom of copying the economic solutions of a country  whose economy is heading south compared to ours, let's look at the state-run  Insurance Corp. of British Columbia (ICBC).  </P> <P> Rosenfield says that for every dollar paid in, the ICBC pays out a dollar in  claims. That is not true. In 1988, 92 cents was paid out. That is still pretty  good, but there is a reason for it: a surplus of over $2 billion which  generates investment income that helps to pay claims. In 1988 the ICBC took in  $1 billion in premiums. This means it has a surplus-to-premium ratio of 2-to-1.  This is six times greater than the California Department of Insurance believes  is sufficient.  </P> <P> Rosenfield says that rates are cheaper in British Columbia than in California.  Well, they are also cheaper in 47 other states -- none of which has a state-run  system. There are many factors involved in insurance rates -- such as  population density, tort laws and crime rates. These factors vary from state to  state, and even more so from country to country. A more useful comparison would  be to compare ICBC's rates to those of its neighbor Alberta. British Columbia's  rates are higher. By the way, Alberta does not have a state-run system like  ICBC. It has a private sector insurance industry.  </P> <P> But again, the many variables involved make comparisons suspect. So let's look  at ICBC's system strictly by itself. In the past three years its rates have  risen 35%. Now there is a useful comparison! It says that whatever ICBC is  doing, it is not keeping the rates down. Despite the ICBC efforts to manage  claim costs by "aggressively promoting safe driving, negotiating reduced auto  repair rates and health care charges and really going after fraud" it is unable  to provide relief from rising auto insurance rates. Some solution.  </P> <P> PHIL FOX  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

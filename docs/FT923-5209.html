			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Money Markets: Cautious trade TRADE IN the sterling cash and futures markets was calmer yesterday as the pound held above its floor against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism without the need for Bank of England intervention. However, the dollar's fall to an historic low against the D-Mark in late European trading kindled fears that sterling may weaken in the next few days and trigger a rise in UK interest rates to support the currency. 'Quite apart from the worries about the French referendum, the one thing that would frighten the moneymarkets would be a big fall in the dollar,' said a trader at one discount house. Most period rates in the cash market ended the day unchanged. Once again, the Bank of England was seen to be very helpful in its operations, dealing in all four bands and the repurchase agreement (repo) at the established rates. That policy continued to keep the overnight rate below 10 per cent, in spite of the firming of rates further out over the last week. It also led to a softening of the one-month rate by  1/16 percentage point to 10 1/16 per cent at the close. Three-month money, an important indicator of where the market thinks rates are moving, again ended at 10 5/8 per cent on the offered side. Both the six-month and one-year rates again finished at 10 7/8 per cent offered. In the morning the Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m which, in the view of one trader, was the bulk of the shortage for the week. In early operations the Bank purchased Pounds 250m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 87m of Band 3 bank bills at 9 3/4 per cent, Pounds 5m of Band 4 Local Authority bills and Pounds 167m of Band 4 bank bills at 9 per cent, and Pounds 382m in the repo at 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank did not operate in the afternoon. Trade in sterling futures was quieter than last week, with volume down to around 20,000 lots in the September and December contracts combined. But in the afternoon, sterling's fall forced the December contract down to its opening level. The September contract rose to a high of 89.28 in the morning, and closed at that level, up 8 basis points from its opening. The December contract started at 89.15, peaked at 89.22 at around lunchtime, but ended at 89.17.</p>

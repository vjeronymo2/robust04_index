			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Retailers accused of penalising card users BARCLAYS BANK yesterday accused high street retailers of holding their customers to ransom in their efforts to prevent banks raising charges for credit and debit card transactions. The claim followed revelations earlier this week by Tesco, the food store which chairs the Debit Card Users Group, that banks charge substantially more for electronic debit card transactions than they do for cheques. Mr David Malpas, Tesco's managing director, speaking on Tuesday after the company announced increased annual pretax profits, said his company might fight the increased prices for card services on its customers' behalf - if necessary by banning card payments. Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclays Central Retail Services Division, the largest credit and debit card organisation in the UK, said: 'Over the last three years, card processing charges levied on retailers have reduced sharply - by over 25 per cent on credit cards and over 40 per cent on debit cards. 'Consumers have not seen the benefits of these reductions in the prices they pay at the point of sale.' Banks claim that retailers enjoy substantial benefits through accepting debit and credit cards. These include quicker guaranteed payment, reductions in processing and security costs and a flow of extra customers who prefer to pay by card. Barclays confirmed yesterday that banks charge some retailers more for debit card transactions than for cheques.</p>

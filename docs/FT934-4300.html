			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Pain plus pragmatism: Reaction in the public sector Welfare services, such as the National Health Service, escaped punishment in this week's Budget squeeze on public spending. But many of the workers who deliver such services are now asking whether it will be at the expense of their pay packets. At the same time, Mr Kenneth Clarke's decision to leave some flexibility in his three-year public sector wage bill freeze will make it more difficult for unions to campaign against the clampdown. There remains uncertainty about precisely how the squeeze on public-sector pay will work and also about its consequences: for instance, will the drive to increase efficiency in the delivery of services be affected, and will public sector employment drop sharply? The initial reaction from important union leaders such as Mr John Edmonds of the GMB general union was sanguine. Picking up on ministerial hints that workers with political muscle such as policemen and nurses would get special treatment, Mr Edmonds said: 'At one level this is power-bargaining at its most naked. Yet there was also a pragmatic style to the announcement that we can exploit.' He warned that grandiose plans for national industrial action were likely to prove futile and that unions should concentrate on setting a 'going rate' in the public sector, allowing less powerful and less popular groups - such as local government workers and National Health Service manual workers - to piggy-back on more powerful groups. This strategy was followed by the unions in the early 1980s when the government's policy of cash-limits on pay bills was repeatedly broken. The timetable on public sector pay may be heading in a similar direction. In January the five pay review bodies, which recommend pay rates for about 2m of the 5m public sector workers, will submit their reports for 1994-1995. The future of the review bodies is in doubt following the 1.5 per cent public sector pay limit imposed this year and the proposed pay bill freeze for the next three. Recent personnel changes on the review bodies may make them more friendly to the government. Yet they are still expected to produce independent recommendations. The recommendations could be difficult for the government to reject, especially for groups such as nurses and teachers. If the union strategy proves succesful, the government would come under pressure to offer similar increases to civil servants and NHS manual workers, who start talks in April. For some parts of the public sector, pay rises at about the level of inflation are still compatible with a pay bill freeze. The NHS, for example, has only just begun to exploit the savings that can be made by improving the efficiency of unskilled workers and the professions allied to medicine. But the government's real target for such efficiency savings is its central government civil servants and, above all, white-collar local government employees, sheltered from job cuts to date. The pay bill in local government, as in most of the public sector, is about 70 per cent of total costs. This year it will be frozen thanks to the 1.5 per cent pay limit and a 3 per cent reduction in staff. The total number of employees is now below 2m. This is only slightly below the numbers employed in local government in 1979, despite the fact that local government blue-collar workers have been cut by one quarter thanks to compulsory competitive tendering. Ministers believe there is fat to cut - car allowances in local government, for example, total Pounds 600m a year - and would relish a confrontation with Unison, the public services union, which has been flexing its muscles over cuts. The drawback of the overall strategy, according to Mr Doug Henderson, Labour's local government spokesman, is that a three-year pay bill freeze would either increase unemployment steeply or create an unacceptably large pay gap between the public and private sector - damaging at a time when staff are being asked to change their working habits of a lifetime.</p>

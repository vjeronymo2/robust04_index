			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PENINSULA SCHOOL BOARD MAY KEEP MIRALESTE OPEN  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes Peninsula school board, in a move aimed at ending the long and  bitter battle over whether the district should be split, has offered to keep  Miraleste High School open on the condition that students be allowed to enroll  in the high school of their choice.  </P> <P> "We are offering to keep the school open with the added expense that brings to  bring this issue to resolution," school board President Jeffrey Younggren said  in an interview Wednesday.  </P> <P> He added: "Let's see if this works. Let's stop the debate."  </P> <P> Two leaders of the East Peninsula Education Council (EPEC), the parents' group  that has favored seceding from the district since the board decided in late  1987 to close Miraleste because of declining enrollment, greeted the offer with  optimism.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Issues to Resolve  </P> <P> However, both said a number of specific issues would have to be resolved before  the offer could become a reality.  </P> <P> "If they are really serious about settling and they want to keep Miraleste  open, it is exciting," Tom Jankovich, the group's chairman, said. "It is about  time they came to their senses."  </P> <P> Jankovich said EPEC members will discuss the offer tonight. Nancy Mahr,  spokeswoman for the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, said the  matter will be discussed at the board's next meeting Aug. 21.  </P> <P> The board voted 4 to 1 Monday to put forth the compromise. Marlys Kinnel voted  against the compromise offer, saying more time was needed to study its  ramifications.  </P> <P> The board's peace offering comes less than two weeks after the State Board of  Education issued a split decision on whether voters should be allowed to  determine if a new district should be formed.  </P> <P> In a 5-3 vote, the board lined up against the idea, but six votes are needed  before the panel's decisions are binding. The board is scheduled to hear the  matter again in September.  </P> <P> But even if the state panel had voted in favor of district officials, Miraleste  would have remained open for the term that starts this fall under a court order  overturning the decision to close the school.  </P> <P> The court order mandated that the school district produce an environmental  impact report on school closings throughout the district. The district is in  the process of preparing that report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State Urged Action  </P> <P> Mahr said the board's action this week was prompted by several state board  members, who indicated they would like to see some movement on the part of  either the local board or EPEC members in resolving the issue.  </P> <P> State board member Kenneth Peters, who favors the district's position, said  that whenever the board fails to issue a ruling, it is always the group's  "intent" that the opposing sides go back and try to work out the dispute among  themselves.  </P> <P> "It is always much more desirable to try to work out a compromise," Peters  said, "to try to take a re-look. . . . Nothing would make me happier than to  learn they worked it out at the local level."  </P> <P> In a letter mailed to Jankovich this week, Younggren wrote that the district  was willing to maintain an "active high school program at Miraleste if EPEC is  willing to accept a proposal of open enrollment throughout the district  allowing students to choose the school they want to go to."  </P> <P> "With this proposal," the letter continued, "it is clear that students who want  a small high school experience can do so while those who hope to experience a  more comprehensive program are given that option as well."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fewer Students  </P> <P> Besides Miraleste, the district operates two other high schools in Rolling  Hills Estates and Palos Verdes Estates. Miraleste, with 632 students registered  for next year, has less than half the student population of either of the other  schools.  </P> <P> Jankovich said that while the compromise offer is appealing, he doesn't believe  an open enrollment policy would be good for the coming year. Miraleste should  be given a chance to prove it can be successful and hopefully attract pupils  from nearby private schools, he said.  </P> <P> Ted Gibbs, EPEC's corporate secretary, said many unanswered questions remain  with regard to the open enrollment issue. For example, it is unclear whether  just freshmen would have the right to choose which high school they want to  attend, or whether the policy would extend to all students.  </P> <P> Moreover, Gibbs said that before the compromise would be acceptable, board  members would likely be asked to give some guarantee that Miraleste would  remain open, providing a certain number of students remain in the school and  the district.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Gibbs termed the board's offer a step in the right direction in  resolving the acrimonious issue. "We are not going to sit on our hands and let  the opportunity pass," he said.  </P></p>

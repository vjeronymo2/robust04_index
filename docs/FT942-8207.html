			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Japan's electronics groups in reverse A batch of Japanese consumer electronics groups reported weak sales and depressed profits yesterday. Matsushita Electric reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits for the third year running . It blamed continuing slow demand in key markets and the strong rise of the yen against leading currencies. The world's largest consumer electronics company suffered a 6 per cent drop in consolidated sales, to Y6,624bn (Dollars 63.9bn) from a previous Y7,056bn, while pre-tax profits declined 21 per cent to Y128.2bn from Y162.2bn. Net income fell 34 per cent to Y24.5bn from Y37.3bn. Matsushita said sales in the Japanese market were hit by slow consumer spending and weak private capital expenditure. While innovative products, such as high-tech rice cookers and washing machines, fared well, the unusually cold summer last year knocked air conditioner sales, normally an important contributor to revenues. Meanwhile, overseas business was hit by the yen's appreciation. The currency's rise led to a decline in overseas sales, which were up on a local currency basis. Sales of audio-visual equipment declined significantly due to a shift in consumer preference for lower-priced products. Sales of communication and industrial equipment fell, too. This was despite strong demand for cordless and cellular phones, and largely because of weak demand for industrial equipment as Japanese private businesses remained in the doldrums. Entertainment revenues, including sales from MCA, declined in yen terms. They were, however, boosted in dollar terms by the huge success of the film Jurassic Park. That film surpassed ET to become the highest grossing film of all time, reaping Dollars 870m in box office revenues. Parent company revenues declined 4 per cent to Y4,349.6bn from Y4,550bn, and pre-tax profits fell 34 per cent to Y63.9bn from Y96.7bn. Net income was 15 per cent lower at Y43.2bn, against Y51bn. The company expects the economic climate to remain depressed, but is looking for a significant turnround in operating profit for this fiscal year. It is carrying out manufacturing reforms overseas, increasing parts-procurement from abroad, stepping up restructuring efforts and launching new, innovative products. A director of Matsushita has been appointed president of Victor Company of Japan (JVC), the troubled audio-visual company in which it has a 52 per cent stake. JVC, which introduced the VHS video cassette tape, has appointed Mr Takeo Shuzui as president in place of Mr Takuro Bojo, who has been at thehelm of JVC since 1991. JVC has been hit by the slump in the consumer electronics market and has incurred heavy losses. It is expected to report another loss when it announces its results next week. Pioneer, the audio-visual company, reported a 14 per cent drop in consolidated sales, to Y509.9bn from Y589.7bn, and a 92 per cent plunge in operating profits, to Y2.4bn from Y28.7bn, for the full year ended March. Net income was down 30 per cent to Y6.6bn against Y10.8bn. Parent company sales declined 15 per cent to Y326.4bn from Y382.8bn, and Pioneer incurred an operating loss of Y5.7bn against Y6.9bn profit last time. Pre-tax profits were Y1.7bn, down heavily from Y16.5bn. Kenwood, the specialist audio maker, reported a Y1.2bn pre-tax loss, against Y4bn profit for the same period last year, on sales down 6 per cent to Y197.4bn from Y210.6bn.</p>

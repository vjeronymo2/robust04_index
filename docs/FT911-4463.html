			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Opportunity Labour There is a rich treasure of jobs for the girls and boys in Labour's new policy statement. Perhaps that is why it is called Opportunity Britain. New organisations abound. Here are just a few: Skills UK, for training; a network of Technology Trusts, for you know what; a National Investment Bank, for heaven knows what; new English regional development agencies, to make up for the Scots having one; a Quality Commission for the health service; a sensible new Education Standards Council . . . and I have only just begun. It is, however, premature to start putting your name down. First we must ask two questions. Will they be in a position to do any of it? If so, when? Not this year, unless Mr John Major is silly enough to call an election without first being sure that he can win. No one is calling Mr Major silly this week, after his quiet persistence on havens for the Kurds has paid off so well. So talk of a June or October contest only makes sense if you assume that the opinion polls will be running strongly in the government's favour at the time. If so, the election will be called this year - but by definition Labour will not then be so favourably placed as it thinks it is today. Well then, perhaps next year, because the government cannot hang on beyond June 1992. I have no more idea than you do of how the polls and portents will look 12 months from now, but it seems probable that inflation and interest rates will be down, the community charge will be de-fanged, and the climb out of the recession will be under way. Against that the government is likely to face a mounting budget deficit  - Pounds 15bn is a figure that has floated around the Treasury - and a consequent need to borrow that will make tax cuts difficult to justify. Meanwhile unemployment is likely to have risen to the 3m mark or thereabouts, which cannot help the Tories. It is this uncertainty that keeps Labour buoyant. Perhaps they can win handsomely, they tell themselves; if not that then perhaps just a tiny majority? On current trends it is easier to see the Tories losing their overall majority - that is, looking for a deal, or allowing Labour to make a deal, in a hung parliament. The difference is important. Anything short of a victory with a convincing majority would mean that Mr Neil Kinnock would at best have to cling to power by his fingertips for a year or so in the hope of winning properly after that. Right. Now we can go back to Labour's blueprint. How much could be put into practice in the circumstance most realistically imaginable - a House of Commons in which every vote would be a cliff-hanger? Not much - and a great deal. Matters that require big new set-piece bills, like a Scottish assembly, or nudging opted-out schools back into local authority control, or changing competition policy, would struggle for parliamentary time. Getting them through would be difficult. But ministerial fief, such as adjusting the national curriculum, would be far easier. This is where the Conservatives may come to regret some of their own legislative and administrative habits. So much of the Thatcherite legacy is in the form of enabling acts - laws enabling ministers to do much as they please, often through delegated legislation - that Labour could travel a long way using the Thatcher legal inheritance. This applies to most areas of government, including the health service reorganisation, some of the arrangements for industry regulatory bodies and even the proposals to establish a partnership in industry. Every shadow minister is working on ways to implement the huge programme announced on Tuesday without troubling the House of Commons over-much; some are being assisted by the permanent secretaries of what they hope will be their future departments. It is not Mr Major's style to stop this. Under his gentlemanly regime ministers are reverting to the practice of checking new appointments to official boards and committees with their Labour counterparts. Some of the latter hopefully read this as a sign that the Tories are reconciled to opposition. Others, perhaps with their feet closer to the ground, plan for every contingency. For example, the shadow minister responsible for water, Mrs Anne Taylor, is in intermittent discussion with the industry itself. They tend to return her calls fastest when the Labour lead in the opinion polls is highest. A northern woman blessed with common sense and an effective relationship with Mr Kinnock, Mrs Taylor is evidently set fair for further promotion. She is clear about what she could do without needing a parliamentary bill. The water industry regulator would receive fresh instructions on costs passed through, 'excess pricing', and the like. She points to the very sub-clauses in the Water Act that would enable her to issue such orders to Mr Ian Byatt, the director-general of the Office of Water Services. All of the above is some compensation for probably not being able to buy back the water companies since that would require a strong Labour majority, the establishment of regional authorities, and a willingness to divert perhaps Pounds 30bn to buy water shares and invest in new plant. Even just purchasing control for, say, a third of that would be an absurd priority for Labour, although Mrs Taylor argues that regional pension funds might do the job. There is plenty that Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow industry secretary, could do at the stroke of a ministerial pen. The national investment bank could be established by the Bank of England under existing rules. The technology trusts could be set up as informal organisations. How would they be paid for? The Tories have provided a convenient method. There is a technology budget in the Department of Industry, and the preferred practice is to let out contracts to non-governmental bodies. I am sure that Mr Brown would be delighted to pick up and use this Conservative device for Labour purposes. It is a piquant prospect, probably the most that he can aspire to short of a political miracle.</p>

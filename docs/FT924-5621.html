			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Moody's downgrades DnB senior debt MOODY'S Investors Service, the US-based rating agency, has lowered the senior debt rating of Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, due to the financial pressures caused by weak third-quarter results. Moody's downgraded DnB's senior debt, affecting approximately Dollars 1.7bn, to A3 from A2, but confirmed the bank's commercial paper rating at Prime-2. DnB plunged to a nine-month net loss of NKr2.46bn (Dollars 374m), compared with a NKr2.33bn profit in the same period last year. On Monday, the state-backed bank insurance fund announced a rescue package in which DnB will receive NKr1.5bn (Dollars 228m) in preference capital and a NKr600m state guarantee. The fund gave DnB NKr5.9bn last year.</p>

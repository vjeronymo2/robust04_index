			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ke Guang (2688 0342): "A General Review of </F> China's Foreign Relations--Deng Xiaoping: `We Are Afraid of No  One and We Will Not Offend Anyone'"]    [Text]  <H3>  China Plays an Active Role in the Multipolar  Arena </H3>   Events from Chinese President Jiang Zemin's formal meeting  with U.S. President Clinton in Seattle to the successive visits  to Beijing by 31 heads of state, 18 speakers and 28 foreign  ministers create a vivid picture regarding China's  omnidimensional diplomacy in the multipolar international arena.  <H5>  The Sino-U.S. Summit Meeting Achieves Results </H5>   A matter of first importance in China's foreign affairs in  1993 should be the formal summit meeting between Jiang Zemin and  Clinton held in Seattle on the 19 November. It was not only the  first formal Sino-U.S. summit meeting since the "Beijing  disturbance" in 1989, but also a contact in which both sides  sought a favorable turn at a time when Sino-U.S. relations were  undergoing twists and turns. So their meeting was of special  significance.    Jiang Zemin's meeting with Clinton occurred at the crucial  time when there had been conflict between China and the United  States, though neither side wished to fall out with the other  completely. Ever since Clinton took office, Sino-U.S. relations  have tended to be strained. The two most prominent incidents  created by Washington in July were: The U.S. ban on the export  of high-tech, sensitive products to the PRC for two years on the  so-called grounds that "China had transferred M-11 missile  technology to Pakistan"; and the obstruction by U.S. warships of  the Chinese freighter "Yinhe" on its way to Iran in accordance  with false information that the freighter was loaded with the  precursors of chemical weapons. These were the strong measures  taken against China by the United States on the issue of weapons  proliferation. However, Beijing did not submit. It strongly  protested to Washington, declaring that it would reconsider its  commitment to the "missile technology control regime" and  claiming compensation of $12.93 million from the United States  for the loss which China suffered from the "Yinhe" incident.  <H3>  The United States Will Shift Its Target for an Economic  Boost to Asia </H3>   On the other hand, the United States has decided to shift  the  focus of its foreign policy to Asia in accordance with its  primary target for rejuvenating its economy, which is suffering  a slump. Under such circumstances Clinton reiterated that  Sino-U.S. relations will be strengthened while he was on his way  to Tokyo to attend the G-7 summit meeting and during his visit  to Seoul. Some White House advisers offered advice, suggesting  that Washington change its China policy. Then Clinton approved  his senior officials' visits to Beijing. Charles Freeman, U.S.  assistant secretary for regional security affairs, visited China  at the end of October, reopening the dialogue between Chinese  and U.S. military officials which had been suspended for four  years. At the same time, Clinton invited Jiang Zemin to attend  the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum summit conference in  Seattle. Thus the Chinese and U.S. Presidents, who had newly  assumed office, had an opportunity for contact.    The meeting between Jiang Zemin and Clinton lasted 90  minutes. Later Clinton talked to the press, saying that the  meeting was "fruitful" and a "good beginning" for Sino-U.S.  relations, while Jiang Zemin said that the meeting "had promoted  understanding, helped improve and develop Sino-U.S. relations,  and marked a good, new beginning for the Sino-U.S.  relationship." Both leaders made positive comments on their  meeting.    Political observers note China and the United States differ  on the issues of human rights, trade and weapons proliferation.  China has not made any concessions. Although Clinton mentioned  these problems at their meeting, Jiang Zemin ignored them.  Before setting out for Seattle from Beijing Jiang had  reiterated China's position, saying that "attaching conditions  to U.S. most-favored-nation treatment was a practice left over  from the time of the Cold War and should be discarded."    Since the meeting of the Chinese and U.S. leaders, the  foreign ministers of the two countries have visited each other  and the departments concerned have increased their mutual  visits. Qian Qichen said at a press conference that both sides  had many specific problems to discuss, such as trade, human  rights and weapons proliferation. Whatever problems concerned  China and the United States could be discussed. The United  States is concerned about the big trade deficit, while China is  concerned about whether it gets approval to purchase U.S. goods.    International opinion believes that both China and the  United  States have found ways to improve their relationship and China  has increased its impact on the world.  <H3>  Kohl Returns Home With Fruitful Results, Having Entered Into  Business Contracts Worth $2.8 Billion </H3>   German Chancellor Kohl visited China last November. During  his visit China and Germany signed more than 20 business  contracts, agreements and letters of intent, the amount of  business totaling $2.8 billion. This shows there has been a new  breakthrough in the relationship between China and a big  European power.    Kohl has been to China three times. However, this was his  first visit as head of government of unified Germany. It was  also at a time when Germany had adjusted its "new Asian  strategy." He made it clear that Germany would follow the policy  of "one China" and that it would not have any official  connections with Taiwan or sell it any weapons.    Germany, with its powerful economic strength, has noted that  Asia has maintained a strong impetus in its economic  development. It is especially attracted by China, whose economy  has been developing at high speed. At the same time, Germany is  seeking a permanent seat in the Security Council of the United  Nations, with the hope that China will vote for it. So Kohl  visited China in November after visiting five Asian countries,  namely, India, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan and the ROK, in  February. He declared that the purpose of his visit to China  was to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in  various fields, endowing the German-Chinese relationship with a  new quality.    China badly needs funds and advanced technology from Germany  in the process of pushing its national economy up to a new  stage. Germany is China's biggest trading partner in Europe.  Trade between the two countries this year greatly exceeds the  total of $6.47 billion in 1992. The contracts signed between  China and Germany include German loans for the project of  constructing the Guangzhou underground railway network and  China's purchase of six German A-340 airbuses. Kohl said that  there were no obstacles on Germany's part in exchanges between  Germany and China in the sphere of high technology. There is no  doubt that Germany has sent China "charcoal in snowy weather,"  given that the United States has banned the export of sensitive  high-technology products to China.    As Taiwan intended to buy submarines from Germany, some  German enterprises showed great interest and wished to try.  However, Kohl made it clear that Germany would not sell any  weapons to Taiwan to avoid possible trouble in the Sino-German  relationship.  <H5>  What Lessons Does Britain Draw From What Germany Has Done? </H5>   In Europe, France is probing to repair its relationship with  China, while Britain has fallen out with China over the  political system in Hong Kong. Talks between China and Britain  have been suspended and China is quickening the preparatory work  for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. It is  inevitable that trade between China and Britain will be  affected. In this way, Britain has lost a good opportunity to  enter China's market, in striking contrast with Germany, which  is quickening its road to the East and promoting all-round  cooperation with China.    During Kohl's visit to China, China sent two signals to the  West: One was Beijing's perception that Germany took the correct  stand on the question of Taiwan, thus laying an "important  foundation for the continuous development of Sino-German  relations; the other is the great potential of China's market,  that is, during its Eighth Five-Year Plan from 1991 to 1995,  China's total import amount will increase from the originally  planned $300 billion to $400 billion. It is no doubt a great  attraction to the slack economy of the West.  <H5>  ASEAN Countries Get Closer to Beijing </H5>   Heads of state and government leaders of the six ASEAN  countries visited China, while Qiao Shi, Chairman of the  Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress  [NPC], visited five ASEAN countries this year. From February  with its spring chill to November with its clear autumn skies  and crisp air, Prime Minister of Singapore Goh Chok Tong,  President of the Philippines Ramos, and Prime Minister of  Thailand Chuan Likphai visited China one after another after  they took office. Sultan Hassanal of Brunei visited Beijing  after his country established diplomatic relations with China.  Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir visited China for the  second time. Although no senior officials from Indonesia  visited China this year, President Suharto met with Jiang Zemin  in Seattle.  <H3>  ASEAN Leaders Take Large Groups of Entrepreneurs To Visit  China </H3>   Economic and trade cooperation with mutual benefit is the  distinctive characteristic of the contacts between China and  ASEAN countries this year. Some ASEAN leaders took large groups  of entrepreneurs to visit China directly and signed huge  cooperative projects with China. Among them is the "Suzhou  Industrial Park," a cooperative construction project between  Singapore and China which introduces Singapore's experience in  the construction and management of Yulang Industrial Park.  Businessmen from Singapore have also invested in opening up a  large area in Shandong Province.    It is worth noting that the leaders of five ASEAN countries  do not believe the "China threat theory" spread by the West.  Instead, they consider that a strong and prosperous China will  benefit the prosperity and stability of Asia. Moreover, they  accept China's position on the Nansha Islands, that is, "put  aside disputes and open them up together."    Qiao Shi chose Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and  the Philippines for his first visit after he became chairman of  the Standing Committee of the NPC. It never happened in the  past that a Chinese leader visited five ASEAN countries in one  trip. During his visit Qiao Shi put forward the four principles  which China would follow in its contacts with ASEAN countries.  Of the four principles, the Five Principles of Peaceful  Coexistence are listed first. This has further promoted the  trust of the ASEAN countries in China.    In November this year, ASEAN Secretary General Singh [xin ge  6580 2706] paid his first visit to China. His Beijing trip  resulted in the establishment of the joint Sino-ASEAN Committee  of Economic and Trade Cooperation and the Joint Sino-ASEAN  Committee of Science and Technology Cooperation and promoted the  cooperation between China and ASEAN countries in the fields of  economy, trade and science and technology.  <H5>  New Developments in Sino-Vietnamese and Sino-Indian Relations </H5>   This year China has also improved relations with Vietnam and  India. They are neighbors which had once fallen foul of Beijing.    In November 1991, leaders of the Communist Party of Vietnam  Do Muoi and Vo Van Kiet visited China, their trip promoting  normalization of the relationship between China and Vietnam. At  the end of 1992, Li Peng paid a return visit to Hanoi, while  Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh visited Beijing in November this  year. Their visits deepened top-level mutual understanding.  The obstacles in Sino-Vietnamese relations lie in the border  dispute and the Cambodian issue. Now the Cambodian issue has  been basically settled. Since the normalization of  Sino-Vietnamese relations, vice foreign ministers and  specialists of both sides have held meetings to deal with the  border dispute. In October this year, China and Vietnam signed  a treaty on the basic principles for solving the issue of border  territory, laying the foundation for further border negotiations  between the two countries.    Contacts between top officials of China and India have also  increased. At the end of 1991 Li Peng visited New Delhi, while  Indian Prime Minister Rao paid a return visit to Beijing in  November this year. The greatest reward of his visit to China  was the signing of a treaty ensuring peace and stability in the  border areas which both sides actually control. Thus,  conditions for final settlement of the border issue were created.    Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, visited Nepal, India and Pakistan in  November. It was another diplomatic move by China to further  develop good-neighborly relations with these three Southeast  Asian countries.  <H5>  China Pays Attention to the Countries to Its North </H5>   China also lays stress on cooperation with countries of the  CIS. Exchanges in various fields such as economy, culture and  military affairs have been further strengthened.    Last year Russian President Yeltsin was invited to visit  China. As a result, trade relations between the two countries  have been developing rapidly, their trade volume totaling more  than $5 billion. In June this year, Liu Huaqing, member of the  Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central  Committee of the CPC and vice chairman of the Central Military  Commission, visited Russia, and Russian Defense Minister Grachev  visited Beijing in November. Both sides signed a Sino-Russian  treaty of cooperation between the two defense ministries. It  involves contacts between personnel and exchanges of experience.    In addition, Georgian head of state Shevardnadze, Tajikistan  head of state Rakhmanov and Lithuanian President Brazanskas  visited China for the first time.    Li Peng originally planned to visit four Central Asian  countries, namely Kazakhstan, Kyrgyszstan, Turkmenistan and  Uzbekistan, and Mongolia to the north of China as well. He  postponed his visits to these countries because he suffered a  sudden heart attack.    To seek a peaceful international environment, especially a  stable surrounding environment, China has promoted friendly  contacts with its neighboring countries in a big way. Hu  Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau  of the CPC, led a party and government delegation to visit the  DPRK. The visit was also aimed at promoting good relations with  its neighbor to the northeast.  <H3>  Countries That Have Established Diplomatic Relations With  China Have Increased to 158 </H3>   China has been very active in its foreign affairs this year,  having established diplomatic relations with the Czech Republic,  Slovenia, Eritrea and Macedonia and resumed diplomatic relations  with Liberia. Thus those countries that have established  diplomatic relations with China total 158. Dominican President  Seignoret recently visited Beijing, though his country has not  yet established diplomatic relations with China.  <H5>  Democratic Parties Get Involved in Foreign Affairs </H5>   It is a new tendency in China's foreign affairs that leaders  of China's various democratic parties take turns to welcome  foreign leaders who come to visit China at the Great Hall of the  People in Beijing.    Rong Yiren, known for his nickname "red capitalist," talked  freely about internal and external affairs while meeting foreign  guests in Beijing. Furthermore, he visited Portugal and Spain  as part of the effort to promote China's foreign affairs.  <H5>  China's Year of Foreign Ministers </H5>   It is a new tendency that the foreign ministers that visited  China this year are particularly numerous. By the end of  November, there had already been 24. Some people consider this  year "China's year of foreign ministers." Qian Qichen, Chinese  vice premier and foreign minister, has been especially busy  since so many ministers of foreign affairs have visited Beijing.  At the same time Qian Qichen has also visited 26 countries this  year (20 countries last year).  <H3>  Qian Qichen's Frequent and Busy Activities Epitomize China's  Active Foreign Affairs </H3>   While attending the 48th UN General Assembly in New York at  the end of September, Qian met with state heads, government  leaders and ministers of foreign affairs of nearly 60 countries.  It is Qian Qichen's frequent and busy activities in foreign  affairs that epitomize China's foreign affairs.   <H5>    Deng Xiaoping's 16-Character Policy </H5>   The pragmatic and flexible display of China's  omnidimensional  foreign affairs embodies Deng Xiaoping's analysis of the  international situation and his diplomatic tactics. In November  this year, the Chinese authorities first made known a series of  speeches on China's foreign affairs and the international  situation made by Deng in recent years.    On 3 March 1990 Deng talked with several bigwigs of the CPC  after great changes had taken place in Eastern Europe. He  pointed out: "The old pattern is undergoing changes, but this  process is actually not completed and the new pattern has not  formed yet. As for the two big issues of peace and development,  the issue of peace is not settled and the issue of development  has worsened."    In the face of the changeable international situation, Deng  Xiaoping put forward the 16-character guiding policy for China  to cope with international problems in its foreign affairs. It  reads: "Observe coolly, stand firm, tackle calmly and accomplish  something."    On 4 September 1989, when Deng talked with several top  leaders of the CPC about the present international situation and  China's tactics, he summarized it in three sentences: "The  first sentence is to observe coolly; the second one is to stand  firm; and the third one is to tackle calmly." He said  emphatically: "Be cool, cool and cool again, immerse ourselves  in hard work, do a good job, a job of our own."    In accordance with the three sentences put forward by Deng  Xiaoping, in its foreign affairs China went through the test  when international incidents such as the disintegration of the  Soviet Union occurred and withstood the pressure caused by  Western sanctions. On 14 December 1990, 14 months later, Deng  talked with several bigwigs of the CPC. He urged China to  accomplish something in diplomacy. He pointed out: "There are  many unpredictable factors in the international situation, while  contradictions become more and more prominent." He said: "Some  Third World countries want China to take the lead. It is a  fundamental policy of our country that we will never take the  lead. We cannot afford to do that. It is beyond our strength.  It is absolutely disadvantageous to do so for we will lose a  lot of initiative. China will always stand on the side of the  Third World. China will never seek hegemony, nor will China  take the lead. However, it is not possible to do nothing on  international issues. We should accomplish something. What to  do? I think we will actively promote the establishment of a new  international order in politics and economy. We are afraid of  no one and we will not offend anyone. We will act in accordance  with the five principles of peaceful coexistence, which we will  stick to on matters of principle and stand."    Deng Xiaoping's theory is still guiding Chinese diplomats  from behind, moving freely and developing flexibly in the  international arena.</p>

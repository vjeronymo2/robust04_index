			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou by </F> correspondents Kiki Angelopoulou, Roula Kambouryianni, and an  unidentified correspondent at the prime minister's office in  Athens; date not given--recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Will there be  any progress at the Corfu Summit for the European Union [EU]  membership applications from Cyprus and Malta?    [Papandreou] Look, this is our national position. These are  two countries that must surely join the EU. We want to settle  the issue of beginning negotiations for Cyprus' accession,  something that will certainly be raised in Corfu.    [Correspondent] What are the prospects and the climate?    [Papandreou] The climate is not very positive, because  accession is linked to the solution of the political problem in  Cyprus -- that is, to speak bluntly, with the occupation of  northern Cyprus by Turkish troops. This is presented as an  obstacle to Cyprus' accession. Turkey is utilizing it, and even  threatening that if something like this happens then northern  Cyprus will merge with Turkey.    [Correspondent] Would you comment on UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report on the Cyprus issue? What are the  current prospects for our national issue?    [Papandreou] I can honestly say that this is the first time  I  have been happy with a statement by the UN secretary general. He  actually lays the blame where it belongs, on Turkish Cypriot  leader Rauf Denktas and Turkey. It is the first time that  something like this has been stated so clearly. This means we  are at a turning point. Right now we are in a deadlock, and we  must wait to see what the next step will be.    [Correspondent] It appears that there is a second report by  the UN secretary general on the issue of Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Is the Greek Government  officially aware of it?    [Papandreou] I know about the basic points of Butrus-Ghali's  report. I have not seen the text. What is important is that  the tripartite dialogue continue, in the sense that there are  two bilateral talks -- with international mediator Cyrus Vance  and U.S. presidential envoy Matthew Nimetz -- not direct talks  with Skopje. I hope and pray that we will have some sort of a  solution before long.    [Correspondent] Nimetz is expected in Athens next week, amid  rumors about a double or triple name.    [Papandreou] Various scenarios.    [Correspondent] Right. Do you believe that the road to a  permanent settlement of this national issue will be open after  the European Parliament elections, or will we have to wait for  the Skopjean elections in November?    [Papandreou] I have hopes that the issue will be concluded.  About the scenario where there would be two names, I want to  remind you that we have two basic positions: First, that we  will not recognize any state if it includes the term Macedonia  or any of its derivatives in its name; second, that we will lift  the embargo the minute Skopje removes the star of Veryina from  its flag and changes the articles of its Constitution that  affect our country's territorial integrity. These are our two  conditions and we will not deviate from them.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, Hellenism feels that it  is being attacked from everywhere. There are sources of tension  and provocations from Albania, Skopje, and Turkey. Do you  believe that these are isolated incidents unlinked to one  another? What is your evaluation?    [Papandreou] I cannot speak about an organized plan by these  three. I cannot say that Turkey, Albania, and Skopje  systematically cause problems for our country according to a  plan. They do create problems though; and they have a climate  of cooperation and mutual understanding, and there is a  possibility that something like this will happen. What is  happening in Albania may be explained better within the  framework of Ankara's policy. I do not rule it out. I must say  that before the wall of the Cold War fell, we did not have such  problems. We are one of the few European countries that the  fall of that wall treated unjustly. We are the only ones who  did not benefit.    Our position on Albania is known. We follow an open door  policy. We want peace, but on condition that Greek Albanians  have all the rights that citizens enjoy anywhere else in the  world today: human rights, the freedoms of religion, education,  language, and culture. Albanian President Sali Berisha is  clearly provoking Greece, a power that is much stronger than  Albania. We have said that we are observing the situation. We  have both diplomatic and political means that could make any  decision of ours be felt heavily in Albania. Let us hope that  things will cool off. It appears that for the time being they  are.    [Correspondent] There is a climate of fabricated tension,  particularly on Turkey's part. For example, Turkey is accusing  us of training Kurdish guerrillas. There is some information  that the United States is pressing for the Greek-Turkish  dialogue to resume. What should our country's position toward  Ankara be?    [Papandreou] First of all, I must stress that a big issue  for  Greece is relations with Turkey. Skopje is also important, but  it is another type of issue. Skopje does not threaten us  militarily. The same is true for Albania. Turkey is a great  military power, so we must be careful.    What does starting a dialogue with Turkey mean? If this  dialogue focuses on cooperation on some points--positive  actions--then we must examine it. There are possibilities.  However, when Turkey speaks about a dialogue, it means a  dialogue that would resolve the so-called Greek-Turkish  differences, in the Aegean for example. Let us not speak about  Cyprus, which is a tremendous issue. What the Turks refer to as  differences that must be resolved through a dialogue are things  against our national sovereignty. So, when someone says that we  must talk, I tell him to write down the issues. If the issues  concern Turkish ambitions, why should I sit down and discuss  them? If someone comes and tells you that your property is his,  would you sit down to discuss with him whether it is his or how  much of it is his? This is the Aegean problem. [passage omitted]</p>

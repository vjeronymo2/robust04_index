			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN, AND PARKING GOES BACK THE WAY IT WAS;  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA: THE COUNCIL DECIDES THAT MOTORISTS WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO FEED  METERS UNTIL MIDNIGHT.  </P> <P> Wiping the egg off its collective face, the Santa Monica City Council has  quietly rolled back the extended metered street-parking hours it put into  effect just five weeks ago.  </P> <P> "I said: 'Hey guys, we should say 'Uncle' here. We really blew this one,' "  said Councilwoman Christine Reed, who sponsored the move to scrap the new  policy of enforcing metered parking on downtown streets until midnight.  </P> <P> "People were angry," Reed said. "They were swearing they would never come back  to this city. Our own citizens were phenomenally upset . . . because what we  did was such a dumb idea."  </P> <P> And so at last week's council meeting, after acknowledging a deluge of  complaints from merchants, residents and motorists, the council voted to  further study its newly initiated policy.  </P> <P> Then, after going into executive session and after nearly everyone in the  audience had gone home, the members voted again -- this time 4 to 1 -- to scrap  the policy, at least for the time being.  </P> <P> As fast as humanly possible, the adhesive labels advising of the extended hours  will be scraped off or replaced with new labels restoring the previous 6 p.m.  deadline. After 6 p.m., parking in those spots will again be free.  </P> <P> In all, about 2,500 meters are affected, on streets in the downtown shopping  area, on Main Street north of Ocean Park Boulevard, and on Wilshire and Santa  Monica boulevards from Lincoln Boulevard east to the city limit, said City  Parking and Traffic Engineer Ron Fuchiwaki.  </P> <P> Unaffected by the council's retreat, however, will be the six downtown city  parking structures, where 3,000 metered spaces were also extended from 6 p.m.  to midnight last month. And enforcement of metered parking on Main Street south  of Ocean Park, which already had lasted until midnight, will not change,  Fuchiwaki said. Fuchiwaki said police and parking officers have been instructed  not to ticket people in affected areas during the evening. And he said city  officials are hoping they will be able to peel off the stickers stuck on meters  to display the new hours, so the old hours can be seen. But because the  stickers have such strong adhesive, he said, new stickers will probably be  necessary.  </P> <P> "We will be making our best efforts to change the signs that we just changed,  but it may take some time," Fuchiwaki said.  </P> <P> The underlying problem is that many of the meters in question have limits  ranging from 36 minutes to an hour -- fine for daytime shoppers, but far too  restrictive for the diners and movie-goers who flock to the Third Street  Promenade area at night.  </P> <P> The changes may not be permanent. The council hopes to engineer some kind of  compromise to keep metered parking at night, but in such a way that doesn't  discourage nighttime visitors.  </P> <P> Fuchiwaki said he expected the new, more permanent recommendations requested by  the council to be completed in about one month.  </P> <P> The change was approved by the council in May, but it wasn't until city  employees started putting the new stickers on the meters in mid-August that  merchants, their customers and residents started raising a stink.  </P> <P> One merchant, Tony Minero, was so outraged with the new policy that he  collected more than 1,100 signatures in less than five days.  </P> <P> "I'm sure I could have stood on a corner and gotten millions of signatures,  because nobody liked it," said Minero, owner of the 2nd Street Bar &amp; Grill.  </P> <P> Minero said the new policy hurt business in the few weeks it was in effect. "It  was a mistake," he said. "They realized after a lot of noise from customers and  merchants."  </P> <P> Thomas H. Carroll, executive director of the Bayside District Corp., which  operates the Third Street Promenade, also hailed the council's decision to back  off the new policy.  </P> <P> "We think four hours (of parking) is what is needed at night," Carroll said.  </P> <P> The policy was expected to bring the city $350,000 a year in additional  revenue, some of that possibly to build more parking lots.  </P> <P> City officials had defended the extended enforcement hours, saying the change  was instituted not only to raise money but to help alleviate the parking crush.  By making it more expensive to park, Fuchiwaki and other officials said, people  would turn over the spaces more often, and maybe even walk instead of drive.  </P> <P> Fuchiwaki agreed this week, however, that forcing people to keep feeding  one-hour meters at night was bad for business.  </P></p>

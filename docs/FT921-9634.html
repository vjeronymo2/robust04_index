			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Clowes awaits sentence for theft and fraud MR Peter Clowes, the man behind the most spectacular UK investment scandal of the 1980s, was yesterday found guilty on 18 counts of theft and fraud, 3 1/2 years after the Pounds 150m collapse of his investment company, Barlow Clowes. He was led from court in handcuffs and detained at Brixton prison overnight, before being sentenced this morning at the Old Bailey. A business associate of Mr Clowes, Mr Peter Naylor, was found guilty on one count of theft, but cleared of other theft and conspiracy to defraud charges. Two other associates - Mr Guy Cramer and Mr Christopher Newman - were both acquitted of all charges against them in a day of mixed success for the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the prosecution. More than Pounds 113m had been 'milked' from the funds of mainly elderly clients, who had been led to believe they were investing in secure gilt-edged stock, the jury was told during the seven month trial. Much of the money was spent by Mr Clowes on buying up other companies and a luxurious lifestyle which included the purchase of a yacht, an executive jet and a French chateau. The collapse of Barlow Clowes has cost the British taxpayer Pounds 150m, paid out in compensation by the government after an unprecedented campaign by investors. In an interview ahead of the verdicts, Mr Clowes insisted that he had acted within the investment guidelines of his company. Speaking at the end of last week, he reserved his harshest criticism for Spicer &amp; Oppenheim, the Barlow Clowes auditor which has since merged with Touche Ross. He said the auditors must have known what Barlow Clowes was doing with investors' money, and have sanctioned it. If the auditors thought the company only invested in gilts (UK government bonds) they should have questioned the lack of gilt certificates in the company, he said. 'Did they just think Pounds 100m was sitting in a bank?' Mr Clowes sat stony-faced as the verdicts were returned, but his wife Pamela shook her head in disbelief and his daughter ran from the courtroom in tears. Much of the evidence heard over 108 days was highly complex and related to the details of the money laundering operations set up by Mr Clowes. Thanking the jury, Mr Justice Phillips said: 'Until recent times, no one could have imagined that our legal system could place such a burden on anyone's time.' At a press conference after the verdicts were delivered, Mr Cramer criticised the prosecution brought against him by the SFO. He said no evidence had been produced to show that he knew of any fraud within Barlow Clowes and he had been tried on a 'guilt by association' basis. Outside the court, Mr Newman said he was 'delighted that the ordeal of the last three years is now over'. Landmark case of old-fashioned theft Page 8</p>

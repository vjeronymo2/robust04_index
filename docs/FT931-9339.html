			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Ministers warned on transfer rules THE GOVERNMENT'S law officers have warned that it could be liable to pay damages to former civil servants whose employment conditions deteriorated when the public services they had been providing were contracted out to the private sector. In an eight-page confidential document seen by the Financial Times Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, the lord advocate, Scotland's senior law officer, warn that ministers should take 'seriously' the government's potential liability for such damages. The EC's 1977 Acquired Rights Directive, which the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations were designed to implement in the UK, protects the jobs and conditions of workers in mergers. Recent decisions of the European Court of Justice have confirmed that the directive can apply to the contracting out of public services. The regulations mean that employees who are dismissed because of a transfer may be classified as unfairly dismissed and therefore entitled to compensation. The dismissal would automatically be unfair unless it was genuinely on the grounds of redundancy or for some other legally valid reason. The document says a reduction in pay or any other worsening in conditions could allow employees to resign and claim constructive unfair dismissal. The main category of individuals likely to pursue such claims are those who have been unable to take advantage of the EC protection because the UK regulations exclude non-commercial ventures. It is understood that officials expect few actions to arise from past contracts that have been put out to tender as the number excluded from the EC legislation under the non-commercial venture clause is small. The government has accepted that the UK regulations do not meet EC obligations and is in the process of amending them to include non-commercial ventures. The document indicates that the government could be liable for claims arising from any flawed transfers that may have taken place in the past. The government would be liable for two reasons, the document says. First, directives impose obligations that directly bind 'the Crown and emanations of the state irrespective of the (UK) regulations'. The law officers add that the normal time limits for such actions would not apply 'since domestic time limits cannot operate in favour of the state until it has brought its law into harmony with community obligations'. Second, individuals can sue the government because there is a right to compensation for EC citizens injured by a member state's failure to give effect to community law obligations. The Cabinet Office said it could not comment on 'what may or may not be advice from legal officers'. The NUCPS Civil Service union said it would now activate the cases it has been preparing over the past few months.</p>

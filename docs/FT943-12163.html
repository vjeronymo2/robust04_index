			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Growth in exports boosts manufacturing Further evidence that UK manufacturers are witnessing steady economic recovery emerged yesterday after a business survey reported that improving exports contributed to the fastest rise in manufacturing order books for almost six years. But a sharp rise in the number of businesses expecting to raise prices and indications that capacity constraints may develop in some manufacturing sectors gave a hint that this faster growth might fuel inflationary pressures later this year. With Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, due to hold his monthly meeting tomorrow with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, these findings may add to speculation that interest rates will be raised soon. The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends survey, for the three months to July, showed that one in five manufacturers expects to raise prices in the next four months, while only 8 per cent expect to reduce them. In the previous survey, conducted in April, slightly more manufacturers were expecting to reduce prices than raise them. Sir David Lees, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, yesterday admitted that this change was 'worrying'. But he called on the government to hold interest rates steady until at least the autumn. He said: 'In our judgment, the inflation pressures are not sufficiently serious to suggest that monetary policy should be tightened immediately.' The price rises, he pointed out, were occurring from a relatively low base and the continued intense domestic competition meant that manufacturers had generally not been able to make price rises stick in recent months, even where they had been expecting increases. The Treasury yesterday welcomed the figures as evidence that the recovery was 'becoming broader and stronger'. With the government hoping that the recovery will become more export-driven later this year, after being largely fuelled by domestic consumer consumption last year, a steady rise in the reported level of export performance was 'encouraging', Treasury officials said. Meanwhile, concerns about the expectation of higher prices were yesterday fuelled in the City by hints in the CBI survey that bottlenecks were developing in some manufacturing sectors. The survey said the number of companies working below capacity fell back to 54 per cent in the last quarter, compared to 59 per cent in April. The survey gave little sign that UK companies were yet seriously addressing potential capacity constraints. Investment intentions grew at a relatively weak rate last quarter, with only slightly more companies expecting to increase their investment on plant and equipment than expecting to reduce it. The findings yesterday led Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the stockbroker, to predict an earlier and larger increase in base rates, not least because the expectation of higher inflation had been cited by Mr George as a factor that would call for tighter monetary policy.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 61(a)(1) of the Code states that, except as otherwise provided, gross income includes compensation for services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items. In addition, if an employer reimburses an employee for expenses paid by the employee in connection with the performance of services as an employee, the amount reimbursed generally is includible in the employee's gross income. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 62(a)(2) of the Code allows an employee to deduct employer reimbursements for expenses paid by the employee in connection with the performance of services as an employee from gross income to arrive at adjusted gross income when the amounts are paid under a reimbursement or other expenses allowance arrangement with his or her employer. Section 62(c) of the Code provides that, for purposes of section 62(a)(2)(A), an arrangement will not be treated as a reimbursement or other expense allowance arrangement if: (1) the arrangement does not require the employee to substantiate the expense; or (2) the arrangement provides the employee the right to retain any amount in excess of the substantiated amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 132 of the Code provides that certain fringe benefits provided by an employee to an employee may be excluded from the employee's gross income. An employer-provided membership in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purposes is a fringe benefit includable in gross income unless otherwise specifically excluded. Similarly, an employer's payment of travel expenses with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying an employee on business is a fringe benefit includable in gross income unless otherwise specifically excluded.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1.61&hyph;21(a) of the Income Tax Regulations. Section 1.132&hyph;5 of the regulations permits exclusion of employer-provided membership in a club, or an employer's payment of travel expenses with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other individual, accompanying an employee on business as a working condition fringe benefit, provided that the payments for these items would be deductible by the employee under sections 162 or 167 of the Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OBRA amended section 274 of the Code to disallow a deduction for (1) 50% of business meal and entertainment expenses; (2) amounts paid or incurred for membership in any club organized for business, pleasure, recreation, or other social purpose; and (3) amounts paid or incurred with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying the taxpayer (or an officer or employee of the taxpayer) on business travel, unless the accompanying individual is an employee of the taxpayer, the travel of the accompanying individual is for a bona fide business purpose, and the travel expenses would otherwise be deductible by the accompanying individual. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The legislative history to OBRA indicates that Congress did not intend that the business meal and entertainment expenses disallowance provided by section 274(n) of the Code should result in income to employees. ``The committee believes that denial of some part of the deduction is appropriate as a proxy for income inclusion of the consumption element of the meal or entertainment.'' H.R. Rep. No. 111, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 645 (1993). Thus, consistent with Congressional intent as evidenced by the legislative history, these proposed regulations amend the regulations under section 62 of the Code to the extent necessary to provide that a reimbursement or advance for business meal and entertainment expenses will not be considered wages subject to withholding and employment taxes under &sect;1.62-2 of the regulations, notwithstanding the deduction disallowance to the employer of 50 percent of that amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations also amend the regulations under section 132 of the Code to provide that denial of a deduction to the employer for the employer's payment of an employee's membership in a club, or for the employer's payment of travel expenses of a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying an employee on business travel, does not provide those items from qualifying as working condition fringe benefits. These amounts may qualify as a working condition fringe benefit to the extent that (1) the employer has not treated such amounts as compensation under section 274(e)(2) of the Code; (2) the amounts would be deductible under section 162 (without regard to sections 274(a) and 274(M)(3)); and (3) the employee substantiates the expenses within the meaning of section 274. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An employer may choose to exercise the option of avoiding any section 274 disallowance at the employer level by characterizing employer-provided club membership dues or payment of travel expenses with respect to a spouse, dependent, or other individual accompanying an employee on business travel as compensation. Section 274(e)(2). If the employer makes this election, the amount of such expenditure is fully includable in gross income by the employee as compensation. The proposed regulations under section 132 of the Code do not provide the employee with any exclusion from gross income in this situation because the section 274 disallowance applies to the employee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

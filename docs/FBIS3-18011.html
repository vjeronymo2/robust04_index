The party says it cannot understand why the preparation of  the agreements was delayed for two years, thus, losing the time  when the agreement could have been based on terms more  advantageous to Latvia.    The party is surprised why international experts have not  unveiled their views on the environmental and health effect of  the Skrunda radar yet. The findings missing, the radar facility  has become an object of conflicts and political speculations.    The issue of the amount of rent for the radar's functioning  should not be left only with the presidents of Latvia and Russia  because the Latvian Constitution grants the country's president  no such prerogative. The party wants Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs to also sign the anticipated rent contract.</p>

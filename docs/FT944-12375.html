			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Caymans plea on refugees The administration of the Cayman Islands is again seeking US assistance in ridding the British colony in the north-western Caribbean of 1,200 Cuban refugees, most of whom have arrived in the islands since August. A delegation from the Cayman Islands has gone to Washington to ask the US government either to give the refugees visas to enter the US, or to transport them to refugee centres in Panama or at Guantanamo Bay, the US naval base in southern Cuba. The Caymanian administration says it has exhausted this year's budget for taking care of the refugees, most of whom are living in tents. It had earlier said it would repatriate the Cubans, but few among the 1,174 refugees appear either willing to go home or to be transferred to Panama or to Guantanamo Bay.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / World Bond Markets: Euromarket spin-offs aid charities - International The hefty profits earned by the underwriters of last year's bumper crop of Eurobond issues - and the sizeable bonuses paid to many bankers - have left market participants feeling more than usually flush. Happily, car dealers and offshore fund managers have not been the sole beneficiaries. In the last month, London's Eurobond syndication community has spawned several imaginative schemes for raising money for charities. Morgan Stanley launched an issue of zero-coupon perpetual charity bonds, which has so far raised 'well over Pounds 100,000'. The bond structure is simple: the investor buys a bond, in denominations of Pounds 1,000, Pounds 5,000 or Pounds 10,000, which does not pay interest and is never redeemed. However, the investor does receive a bond certificate, and participating institutions will be featured on 'tombstone' advertisements in the financial press. The money is channelled through The Charities Aid Foundation and distributed to three charities, the Depaul Trust, which helps homeless young people, the Samaritans, which offers comfort and support to people in need, and Relate which advises couples and families in times of trouble. 'In the syndicate world, there is a very tight community, and all day long we sit and price deals,' says Mr Michael Dee, head of Morgan Stanley's syndicate desk. 'We wanted to put a positive spin on it.' On December 7, Canadian-owned Wood Gundy donated all its trading and syndicate profits from its London operation to Children in Crisis, which helps the children of the former Yugoslavia. With staff contributions and donations from clients, the firm raised Pounds 110,000. The third scheme, dubbed Eurobonds in Action, is specifically designed to thrive on the competitive nature of a market obsessed by league table performance. Participating banks have agreed to contribute a percentage of every bond issue they arrange between the start of the year and Mardi Gras (February 4) to Action Research, a charity which funds medical research. For example, if a bank launches a Dollars 300m issue, it contributes 0.001 per cent of the value of that issue - in this case, Dollars 3,000 - to the charity . Mr Denys Firth, director of debt capital markets at SG Warburg, and his wife Victoria, who is on the London fund raising committee of the charity, persuaded 19 Eurobond houses to participate. The market timing, always a prime concern for syndicate officials, could not have been better. 'I doubt if there is any other time in the market when we could have achieved this,' said Mr Firth. Mr Firth's market instincts did not let him down: the flow of new Eurobond issues, always heavy at the start of a new year, has already reached Dollars 50bn so far this month, and could set a new record.</p>

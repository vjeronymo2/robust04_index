			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Self-appointed patron of poor: Imelda Marcos's presidential aspirations Since Mrs Imelda Marcos returned to the Philippines last November she has collected law suits as she used to collect shoes. The widow of the country's late dictator and self-appointed champion of the poor has already been charged on more than 100 counts, ranging from tax evasion to theft of hundreds of millions of dollars. In spite of these lawsuits, Mrs Marcos is pressing ahead with her attempt to become president of the Philippines. Last week she filed as a candidate in the May polls, the first since President Corazon Aquino came to power in 1986 after a failed coup had triggered a popular revolution. A comeback by Imelda could be dismissed as the dream of a deluded and unemployed former First Lady. But Mrs Marcos is creating enough of a stir to suggest that, even if she will not win, she will again play an important role on the political stage. For this she has Mrs Aquino in part to thank. Restoration of democratic institutions after 14 years of martial law under President Ferdinand Marcos has been a painful experience. Mrs Aquino's reluctance to seize the reins of power and give firm leadership has led to policy drift, an uncertain investment climate and a stagnant economy. Divisions in the ruling party will be exacerbated by Mrs Aquino's choice of General Fidel Ramos, the former defence secretary, as her preferred successor. A protestant in a predominantly Roman Catholic country, Gen Ramos was also head of the Philippine Constabulary for a decade under President Marcos and may have awkward questions to answer. Mrs Marcos is astute enough to capitalise on these shortcomings. Remarkably, the nation's greatest shopper is presenting herself as the underdog, an 'oppressed widow and orphan', rebuilding her ties with the poor. 'For years the poor have cried with me,' she said last week from the splendour of her Dollars 2,000-a-day Imperial Suite at the Plaza Hotel. She brushes aside suggestions that these statements are inconsistent with her fabulously opulent lifestyle before she was ousted with President Marcos in 1986. 'When you are First Lady you are like a guiding light holding some kind of torch,' she says, waving a diamond ring she says Mr Marcos bought with a fortune he had already made when they married 37 years ago. Sceptics have suggested that Mrs Marcos's presidential aspirations might not be entirely divorced from her imminent trials in Manila. But Mrs Marcos dismisses this suggestion. 'They say the voice of the people is the voice of God,' she says, hinting that being elected would be vindication enough. 'But I am not afraid to go through judicial and legal process.' Manila's intelligentsia has largely scoffed at Mrs Marcos, partly because of a string of outlandish theories. She believes, for example, that Chinese adventurers are poised to strike south to reopen Manila's seventeenth century galleon trade with Mexico. These critics say that she can only win by buying the elections, like her husband tried to do in 1986. But they may be missing the point; Mrs Marcos is not talking to them. 'I have support from the masses, the people, the poor ones,' she claims. At a rally outside an army camp last week, Mrs Marcos did indeed seem to inspire a collective amnesia. She also has a surprisingly commanding presence before her 'little people'. Such advantages may not be enough. Realistically, Mrs Marcos is running for president from too far back in the field. Her best chance is to link up with her husband's most accomplished business associate, Mr Eduardo 'Danding' Cojuangco, another of the eight presidential candidates. But for the moment she sounds like a true believer in her own humbug. 'I was like a tree that was fruitful, flourishing and productive, who could not grow a leaf, not a single flower to share with people in need,' she says of her time in exile. 'To be uprooted was the beginning of slow death.' If forgiving Filipinos fall for this line and allow Mrs Marcos her comeback, the outside world will surely feel that the restored democracy has failed. The Philippines could then lose much of the international business and political support it still badly needs.</p>

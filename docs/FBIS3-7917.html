			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by the executive leadership of the </F> Constitutional Forum on the Macedonian question"; place and date  not given]    [Text] The Constitutional Forum has always followed a  policy of maintaining close contact with Bulgarians abroad,  defending their interests as a matter of principle, and using  their efforts to surmount the crisis that our fatherland is  experiencing.    Taking account of the historical truth concerning Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], the  Constitutional Forum categorically rejects the Serbian and  Komintern thesis of Macedonianism and, in conformance with the  facts of history, declares that the Slavs in Macedonia are  native [prirodni] Bulgarians.    We are distressed, however, to have to confirm that the  agents of authority representing the Bulgarian state continue to  handle the Macedonian question in the spirit of the Komintern  doctrines. In this connection, the Constitutional Forum demands  the following:    -- Reestablishment of the historical truth concerning the  Bulgarian nature and origin of the Slavs in Macedonia. The  president, parliament, and government should issue declarations  to this effect and mount an international campaign to defend the  national rights of our compatriots.    -- Opposition by diplomatic means to the pressure being  applied to Macedonia by Greece and Serbia to ensure the  possibility for the state of Macedonia to develop in peace.    We are convinced that the democratic Bulgarian public is  bound to defend the historical interests of the Bulgarian  national spirit in Macedonia, while our state guards against a  settlement of the Macedonia question by the use of force.    We call upon the mass media to handle the Macedonian  question  in conformance with the historical truth.</p>

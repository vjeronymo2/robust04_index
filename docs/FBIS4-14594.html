			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia believes that the agreement between  representatives of Croatia and Krajina's Serbs concluded in the  Russian Embassy in Zagreb on Wednesday [30 March] will be  observed. The party which violates it "will challenge the key  members of the world community. It would be extremely  unreasonable," the special envoy of the Russian President  Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's deputy Foreign Minister, declared at a  press conference on Thursday in Moscow.    He also reported that the UN General Secretary Butrus Ghali  had already addressed the Security Council with a request to  allocate additional forces to be deployed in the disengagement  zone.    Responding to an Interfax correspondent, Churkin indicated  that in Croatia there are 800 Russian servicemen in the  composition of the UN peacekeeping forces. As many as 200  Russians will go there in the second half of April.    Speaking about the political status of the self-proclaimed  republic of Serbian Krajina, Churkin pointed out that "the  solution of this problem should come with time. Those Croatian  Serbs who adhere to unreconcilable positions on this issue are  actually taking up an anti-Serbian position."    In Churkin's words, "the event which occurred in Zagreb is  of  great importance because it is a political-diplomatic model  within which one must work during the next few weeks and months  to settle the situation not only in Croatia but in Bosnia as  well. The meeting with the participation of the Bosnian Serbs,  Croats, and Moslems may take place within the next few weeks if  not the next few days."    Churkin believes that the Bosnian Croats and Moslems who  have  concluded an agreement on the creation of the federation must  coordinate and develop a joint position for the negotiations  with the Bosnian Serbs.    As Churkin said, an active involvement of the  representatives of the United States, European Union, and United  Nations is not just "a tribute to politeness." "Russia was and  will be in favor of the expansion of international interaction  during the settlement in the former Yugoslavia. We must act in  agreement with the United States, European Union, and United  Nations."</p>

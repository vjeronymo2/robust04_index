			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and </F> economic cooperation, by an unidentified correspondent on 29  December; place not given]    [Text] Beijing, 30 Dec (XINHUA) -- [Correspondent]  The People's Bank of China has announced Beijing will begin  major reform of the foreign exchange structure. What impact  will this reform have on the development of China's foreign  trade?    [Wu Yi] In line with the guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the state will mainly  apply such economic means as exchange rates, taxation, and  credit to regulate economic activities with foreign countries.  Exchange rates -- an economic lever -- are playing an  increasingly important role in regulating our country's foreign  trade. The State Council's decision to further reform our  country's foreign exchange control system beginning next year is  very important. Because it is crucial to the deepening of  reform of the foreign trade structure, such reform will have a  major, positive, and far-reaching impact on the development of  foreign trade in our country. In line with the overall plan for  reform of the foreign exchange control system next year, we will  eliminate the double-track exchange rate system; introduce a  unitary market-based manageable floating exchange rate system;  introduce a system under which foreign exchange settlements and  selling of foreign exchange are conducted by the banks; and  abolish the system of retaining a portion of foreign exchange  while delivering the rest to the state. This is of tremendous  significance to further reforming the foreign trade structure.  In my opinion, all these reforms will create a good environment  for fair competition by all types of export enterprises, will  greatly speed up transformation of the operating mechanism of  foreign trade enterprises, and will allow foreign exchange rates  to play their function more effectively in regulating foreign  trade, thus playing a very important role in expanding the  import-export trade. Reform will bring our country's foreign  exchange and foreign trade structures closer to the requirements  of a socialist market economy; is conducive to establishing an  operating mechanism suited to the rules and customs common in  international economic activities; and will play a positive role  in restoring our country as a signatory to the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade.    It can be said that deepening reform of the foreign exchange  control system, and establishing a new foreign exchange  mechanism in which the establishment of a socialist market  economic structure is being accelerated and in which opening up  to the outside world is being further widened, have created a  hard-to-achieve opportunity for China to expand its foreign  trade. We must have a firm grasp of the situation, seize the  opportunity, strive to expand our foreign trade in 1994, and  undertake foreign economic and trade work in a better manner.    [Correspondent] How can foreign exchange needed by  import enterprises for regular use be guaranteed after the  system of foreign exchange conversion is introduced and after  the system of retaining a portion of foreign exchange is  abolished?    [Wu Yi] Some are concerned whether export enterprises will  be ensured of the foreign exchange they need for their regular  use following the introduction of the foreign exchange  conversion system and the abolishment of the system for  retaining a portion of foreign exchange. In fact, such concern  is unnecessary because, first, the system of examination and  approval for the use of foreign exchange will be abolished on  the basis of the system for foreign exchange conversion and of  the system for selling of foreign exchange by banks under which  the renminbi is convertible on a conditional basis. Any  enterprise wishing to use foreign exchange may use a valid  certificate to convert renminbi for foreign exchange, provided  its operation meets the requirements of the state industrial  policy. This makes it easy for all types of enterprises to  operate their business. Second, as a transitional measure to  ensure foreign exchange for export enterprises, it may set up a  counter account at the designated foreign exchange bank with  renminbi equal to 50 percent of the total amount of foreign  exchange it needs. The bank will guarantee the supply of  foreign exchange to the enterprise, within the limit of the  counter account, for its needs in expanding export trade, such  as the import of materials for processing, packing materials,  export base expenses, settlement of claims, freight charges and  insurance, after-sales services, and subsidiary expenses. The  export enterprise can still buy additional foreign exchange at  the designated foreign exchange bank by showing valid  certificates, to meet needs which the balance of the counter  account is insufficient to cover. So, the normal needs of  export enterprises in foreign exchange are reliably guaranteed.    Of course, problems may happen during the shift from the old  to the new system. We should further deepen reform, formulate  concrete operational procedures, and promptly solve any problems.    [Correspondent] How will the reform of the foreign  exchange management system affect the foreign exchange currently  retained in the hands of export enterprises? To put it more  clearly, will the enterprises be allowed to continue to use  it?    [Wu Yi] All export enterprises are concerned about this  question since it involves their vital interests. Here I can  unequivocally tell everyone that the current reform of the  foreign exchange management system has taken the interests of  enterprises into full consideration. First, enterprises are  permitted to keep and continue to use their current retained  foreign exchange accounts and their current foreign exchange  cash accounts. Second, enterprises are permitted to continue to  use the balance in their retained foreign exchange accounts  which were set up before the elimination of the double-track  exchange rate system, and the balance shall be converted  according to the official exchange rate of the day before the  double-track exchange rate system was eliminated. If the  retained portion of foreign exchange earnings has not yet been  deposited in the account, the enterprise is required to deposit  it within one month and is permitted to continue to use it in  accordance with the aforesaid principle. Third, while  enterprises are permitted to keep their foreign exchange cash  accounts and continue to use them in making normal payments or  sell the foreign exchange to the bank, no new deposits may be  made to the accounts.    [Correspondent] How will the current reforms of the  foreign exchange management system and the foreign trade system  affect foreign-funded enterprises?    [Wu Yi] This is an important question and the answer is  simple. 1) The way to manage foreign exchange for  foreign-funded enterprises remains unchanged. 2) The  elimination of the double- track exchange rate system benefits  foreign-funded enterprises, because it resolves the  contradiction caused by the fact that their registered capital  is converted according to the official exchange rate, while the  profits they remit home are converted according to market  regulatory rate. So, the change will help attract foreign  investors.    [Correspondent] After the reform, China's foreign  exchange management will adhere to the market norm. However, it  is reported that people in some foreign countries often take  anti-dumping measures against our export goods on the grounds  that our government manipulates exchange rates. Do you have any  comments on this issue?    [Wu Yi] By further reforming the foreign exchange management  system and the foreign trade system, China will manage foreign  exchange business in accordance with market norms. At the same  time, the unitary, well-managed floating exchange rate system  based on market supply and demand will no doubt further enhance  the effects of market regulation on our foreign trade activities.    Anti-dumping measures against our goods, which you have just  mentioned, indeed exist abroad. In my view, as our economic  system, including the foreign exchange management system and the  foreign trade system, has undergone profound changes and we will  continue to deepen reforms, the allegation of so-called exchange  rate manipulation is groundless. We advocate promotion of  exports in accordance with international trade norms. As a  developing nation, we do not have the strength to dump goods  abroad. We also oppose the practice of increasing exports by  means of dumping. The prices of our export goods are relatively  lower mainly because our labor is cheaper. The low prices are  not caused by the exchange rate factor. Here I would like to  reiterate that we oppose the practice of increasing exports by  means of dumping, and we also oppose anyone who practices  protectionism on the pretext of taking anti-dumping measures.    [Correspondent] What are the main contents of the  reform of the foreign trade system in the next stage?    [Wu Yi] According to the State Council's overall plan, the  reform of our foreign trade system in 1994 will keep abreast  with the reforms of the finance and taxation system, the banking  system, the investment management system, the planning system,  and the foreign exchange management system. Major steps will be  taken in reform.    In order to deepen the reform of the foreign trade system,  we  should firmly keep to the reform orientation of unified  policies, open operation, fair competition, integration of  industry and trade, promotion of the agent system, and  enterprises assuming sole responsibility for their own profit  and loss. The objective of reform is to build a foreign trade  operational mechanism which conforms to the general practice of  the international economy.    The main contents of the reform of the foreign trade system  in the next stage are: 1) The state will further improve  macroeconomic management of foreign trade, and mainly use  economic means, such as exchange rates, taxation, and credit, in  regulating foreign trade activities. We will reform the  import-export management system, abolish mandatory plans, and  reduce administrative intervention. We will control the total  amount of a small number of commodities; manage them in  accordance with the principle of efficiency, fairness, and  openness; and distribute them by open tender or auction, or  according to specific rules. We will pursue the policy and  measures of encouraging exports, improve the export duty refund  system, and practice a credit policy which is conducive to the  development of foreign trade. We will establish a set of  feasible systems for managing our enterprises abroad. We will  accelerate foreign-trade legislation and manage foreign trade  according to law to maintain orderly foreign trade operations.  2) We will deepen the reform of foreign trade enterprises  and reorganize state-owned foreign trade enterprises in  accordance with the modern enterprise system. We will  explore a new mode -- "large-scale economic cooperation and  trade" characterized by the integration of trade with industry,  agriculture, technology and commerce, as well as the integration  of foreign trade, foreign capital, and economic cooperation. We  will speed up the process of giving foreign trade power to  qualified productive enterprises, scientific research  organizations, and certain commercial and materials supply  enterprises. 3) We will build and improve a foreign trade  coordination service mechanism, and give full play to the  coordination and service functions of the chambers of commerce  for various import-export trades. 4) We will maintain the  unity of our foreign trade policies and systems, and we will  enhance their transparency.</p>

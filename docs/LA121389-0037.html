			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10 OFFICIALS DECIDE TO DROP POSTSEASON BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> Citing primarily academic reasons, Pacific 10 Conference officials voted to  drop the annual postseason basketball tournament. The final tournament will be  held at Arizona State, March 8-11.  </P> <P> "Playing in the tournament can be a hardship for the players in the form of  lost class time," said Jim Muldoon, assistant Pac-10 commissioner.  </P> <P> "It is particularly difficult on schools that are on the quarter system because  the tournament falls going into an exam period. Theoretically, if a school goes  on to play in the NCAA postseason tournament, a player could miss three to four  weeks of class time."  </P> <P> Another reason for cancellation was that Pac-10 teams were forced to schedule  conference games, rather than nonconference games, in early December.  </P> <P> The cancellation of the tournament will hurt the schools financially. Since  1987, when the tournament began, each Pac-10 school has received about  $200,000.  </P> <P> The decision to drop the tournament was initiated by Pac-10 school presidents.  Muldoon said that Pac-10 coaches still favor the tournament.  </P></p>

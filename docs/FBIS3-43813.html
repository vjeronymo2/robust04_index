			<p>Language: <F P=105> Somali </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] This afternoon at a Mogadishu hotel Iman  Mohamoud Iman Omar officially closed a Hirab [Hawiye]  communities reconciliation conference. The conference, which  had been going on for four days, discussed the destruction  inherited from the civil wars and the attainment of peace and  total unity. The conference was attended by 176 people  consisting of chiefs, distinguished people, peace-seekers,  religious leaders, politicians, intellectuals, officers, and  youths drawn from these communities.    Iman Mohamoud Iman Omar's speech was given due  consideration.  An evaluation of living conditions, peace, and other matters  affecting the communities was also made.    The communities decided on the following resolutions:  Peaceful coexistence should be practiced and any conflict  should be resolved through joint dialogue; destruction both to  life and property during the civil wars should be forgotten;  expropriated properties, be they movable or immovable, should be  returned to their rightful owners in line with Islamic law;  roads connecting regions should be opened up for free movement;  and concerted efforts should be made to combat bandits in line  with Islamic law.    The conference appealed in fraternity and peace to other  Somali communities to observe peaceful coexistence. The  conference resolved that a 19-member committee conversant with  laws and customs be formed. A committee composed of 15 members  will be formed. Its task will be the implementation of the said  resolutions. It will start functioning seven days after the  signing of the agreement.    [Passage omitted] The speakers prayed to God to put the  Somali people on the right path and asked that God inflict His  curse on those opposed to peace. [passage omitted]    Speaking at the closing ceremony, Iman Mohamoud Iman Omar  thanked the participants for the success of the conference.    After the conference concluded, the participants, led by the  iman, met thousands of people who supported the reconciliation  meeting and who were lining both sides of the road connecting  hotels Kah and Towfiq.    The conference issued the following appeals:    1. In consideration of the common background and the general  history of society, taking into account the unprecedented  problems which have affected the brotherly society, and taking  into account the indispensibility of peaceful coexistence, the  conference appealed to the great Somali society to implement the  peace resolutions tirelessly.    2. The conference appealed to the Somali communities to live  together in peace and brotherhood.    3. The conference appealed to the people to sort out any  existing disagreements with a view to attaining peaceful  coexistence and restoring unity and national dignity.    4.

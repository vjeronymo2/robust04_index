			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, Feb 11 (AFP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) is "skeptical" that North Korea will allow  inspections of its nuclear sites and wants the UN Security  Council to decide whether to impose sanctions, Western diplomats  said here Friday [11 February].    They said the IAEA's Swedish general-director Hans Blix had  stressed repeatedly that it was "not necessary" for the  organization's board of governors to adopt a resolution sending  the issue to the Security Council when the governors next meet  on February 21.    However, the board's 35 members are to hold consultations  next week on what position to take over North Korea's persistant  refusal to have its nuclear facilities inspected, diplomats said.    And certain delegations appeared to favour taking a "firm"  stance.    The IAEA is not empowered itself to slap sanctions on the  country.    "No one really knows if North Korea has an atomic bomb, but  because of its refusal (to allow inspections), suspicion,  concern and doubt are growing and the North Koreans are doing  nothing to allay these doubts," the diplomats added.    There has been no official contact between the agency and  North Korea since January 25, when the IAEA provided further  details on what kind of inspection measures it deemed necessary.  North Korea subsequently rejected some of these measures.    South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu was due to meet  with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington on  Friday to discuss North Korea's persistant refusal to have its  nuclear facilities inspected.    Han's visit comes as the IAEA awaits a response from  Pyongyang in the next two weeks on outside inspection of its  suspect nuclear sites.    If no progress is made, the Vienna-based IAEA will meet  February 21 to announce it can no longer certify that North  Korea has no nuclear-weapons program, possibly leading to a US  request for UN Security Council sanctions.    Such a move, however, could be stopped by China, one of the  council's five permanent, veto-wielding members. The WASHINGTON  POST said Thursday that China recently rejected a proposal to  have the council issue Pyongyang a warning.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Accountancy Column: Graduates who fail credibility test in the real world - Why many firms favour recruits with seemingly non-relevant qualifications ACCOUNTANCY firms are turning their backs on accountancy graduates. They are seeking instead graduates with other degrees, believing they have the skills and attributes necessary for success in the profession. In a letter this summer to an accountancy graduate, Mr Martin Rooney, a partner at FW Smith Riches, a London firm, says: 'From my own experience I have come to the conclusion that non-relevant (non accountancy) graduates are best able to cope with the pressures of work and passing the examinations. I have therefore restricted my firm's recruitment, for the last couple of years, to non-relevant graduates only. Accordingly, I will not be in a position to process your application form.' The graduate in question says: 'I have spent three years studying an accountancy degree thinking it would help me become an accountant, so their decision has made me change my mind about the profession. But some firms are completely out of their heads because they think an accountancy degree is just about number-crunching.' But Mr Rooney defends his decision. 'Having a degree shows an indication of ability to think logically and plan thoughts, but accountancy graduates are less willing to accept that they have to start at the bottom and learn,' he says. 'In the first two years, the job can be very mundane and even an accountancy graduate with a first would have great difficulty in settling down.' There are a few exceptions. Mr Wayne Barnett, a partner with Jayson Newman, says: 'I find accountancy graduates easier to train because at least they have shown a commitment to their choice of career and have a feeling for the subject.' But the firm is in a minority in its willingness to take graduates of accountancy, in spite of the breadth of the subject, which covers topics such as company law, psychology and organisational methods. Accountancy firms who prefer non-relevant graduates point their fingers to the pass rate statistics for PE1 - the first year chartered accountancy professional exams - and argue that the best and brightest graduates are in engineering, science and maths - but not in accountancy as might be expected. Just how important the statistics are to accountancy firms can be seen at Touche Ross, where an accountancy graduate is required to have at least a 2.1 to apply for an interview, but a non-relevant graduate can apply with a 2.2. Only 20 per cent of the firm's intake is accountancy graduates. Mr Nigel Llewellyn, the national recruitment partner, says he is 'surprised people are surprised' that the figure is not higher. He argues that the statistical trend is so consistent that he cannot ignore it. 'Some people think it is unfair for us to be so strict, but we think it is unfair for us to relax our standards,' he says. But why use the pass rate statistics to select graduates? The answer is best summed up by Mr Stephen Boley, the national director of graduate recruitment at Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'We want the best graduates - even if 75 per cent of them are not accountancy graduates,' he says. Several suggestions have been put forward to explain why accountancy graduates are under-performing at PE1. Ms Debbie Bryant, senior recruitment manager at Price Waterhouse, says: 'Students with a degree in accountancy can often become over-confident of passing the PE1 exams. They tend to fall down because they don't appreciate the volume of studying necessary. They need to understand the question and apply what they've learnt.' Mr Richard Parnell, a director at Robert Walters Associates, the financial recruitment firm, believes that accountancy graduates have the theoretical grounding but cannot apply this to the practical nitty-gritty of PE1. 'Accountancy graduates are not too hot at constructing a balance sheet in twenty-five minutes,' he says. Nevertheless, there is a case that some accountancy firms are getting carried way with statistics. Mr David Clifford, the National Student Recruitment Partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, says: 'Obviously it is important for students to pass the exams, but it can also be very useful to look at how students approach the exams.' Ms Jo Magne, national personnel manager at Moores Rowland, says that past examination performance is the fairest measure so far identified as a measure for pre-selection. He argues that while the number of applicants continues to greatly exceed the number of places, firms must use some means of sorting through hundreds of application forms. This is disheartening news for accountancy graduates, but there are suggestions that the situation can be improved. Ms Jackie Wynn, recruitment manager of The HAT Group of accountants, argues that degree courses in accountancy should be made more practical. 'We have to unlearn everything accountancy graduates have been taught and start all over again,' she says. 'They haven't even covered the basics in enough depth, if at all, especially in double-entry book-keeping.' Mr Boley says he would encourage more academic departments to teach accountancy through group work. 'Accountancy is not just about auditing. It may be about auditing initially, but in the long term students become business advisers,' he says. An analysis conducted by Coopers &amp; Lybrand suggests that accountancy graduates are a burden on industry because they frequently have an inadequate ability to discuss, communicate or negotiate with others. This raises the question of whether the existing degree courses in accountancy should be overhauled. Yet accountancy courses remain very popular, and not all their graduates want to enter the profession. Just how popular an accountancy degree course is can be seen at Manchester Polytechnic, where last year there were 3,500 applications for the 100 places on an honours Accounting and Finance course. Ms Sue Harvey, head of careers at the Polytechnic of North London, says: 'An accountancy degree is not just a passport to a career in accountancy. I have seen a number of accountancy graduates go into other financial areas such as Banking or the Tax Inspectorate, and also commercial areas such as sales and marketing.' But what about accountancy graduates that want to become accountants? Ms Magne stresses that applicants should focus on firms which are sympathetic to the qualification (the student recruitment department of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales publishes a list each autumn) and make sure they stress 'not only numeracy, but also other skills and attributes'. But, as in any subject, the result is of vital importance. Ms Faith Jenner, UK director of personnel and recruiting at Arther Andersen, says: 'My advice is, generally, accountancy graduates with a 1st or 2.1 will probably have the aptitude for the professional exams, but those with a 3rd should think carefully about whether they are suited to the profession.' Sunjay Kakar is an accountancy graduate who decided against a career with an accountancy firm.</p>

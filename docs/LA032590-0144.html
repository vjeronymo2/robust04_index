			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MONEY FOR SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Yes, I care about the deplorable dropout rate in our San Diego high schools  ("Where Is the Public Outcry for Black Students," March 11). The dropout rate  is a disgrace.  </P> <P> It could be improved, certainly, with sufficient funding for smaller classes  and for more counselors. But we have both a president and a governor who talk  about education but do not give it any priority when it comes to funding.  </P> <P> President Bush came to California recently, but he did not promise more federal  funding for schools. Instead, he dedicated a prison and spent the balance of  his time raising money for Republican political candidates. Nor did he talk  about the inner cities and the lack of decent housing for low-income families,  a lack which contributes to the failures in our schools.  </P> <P> A few days after he left, another nuclear weapons test took place in Nevada, a  wasteful display of power in this period of thawing of superpower animosity.  Nuclear weapons tests cost approximately $60 million a throw. Why not use this  kind of money for education and housing?  </P> <P> I'm still looking for the "kinder, gentler" America that George Bush promised  us.  </P> <P> PHYLLIS C. HUMPHREY  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

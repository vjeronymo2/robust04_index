			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ASSAILED BY PROSECUTOR, GABOR FLEES  </P> <P> Zsa Zsa Gabor stomped out of her Beverly Hills cop-slapping trial in tears  today as a prosecutor told jurors that the flamboyant actress viewed the  courtroom as a stage where "she came to entertain you."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Elden Fox used a 70-minute closing argument to both shore up  his misdemeanor criminal case against Gabor and attack her for what he called  disruptive and attention-grabbing actions during 13 days of trial.  </P> <P> "The thing that outrages me most is she used and abused two weeks of this  process for her own aggrandizement," Fox said. "The defendant doesn't know the  meaning of truth. . . . Her perception of truth differs from facts in the  case."  </P> <P> Fox said jurors had a unique opportunity to see Gabor "in an arena that doesn't  have scripts or cue cards."  </P> <P> "She came to entertain you. . . . She craves the media attention in this case,  it is clear," Fox said angrily.  </P> <P> Gabor then broke down in tears and fled the courtroom, her fourth such exit  from the trial, which has cost taxpayers nearly $30,000.  </P> <P> "I want to get out of here. I want to go to Europe," the tearful Gabor said in  the hallway.  </P> <P> Her exit came five minutes into Fox's final argument, and the prosecutor  continued his address to jurors.  </P> <P> "The world revolves around Miss Gabor (in her mind). What she doesn't like she  denies. . . . The truth is what's convenient for the defendant. . . . I think  her true persona has emerged in the course of this trial," he said.  </P> <P> "The defendant in this case insults you," he added.  </P> <P> This morning, Gabor arrived at court 15 minutes early and told reporters she  was "dressed for jail" in a black pantsuit outfit.  </P> <P> She also showed off her "horse's behind" cuff links she plans on presenting in  coming weeks to a TV news commentator who railed against her.  </P> <P> "The policeman, he has a temper, but so do I," the fiery Hungarian said.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills Police Officer Paul Kramer pulled Gabor over after noticing  expired registration tags on her Rolls-Royce Corniche. As he checked for other  violations, she drove off.  </P> <P> Gabor slapped him when he pulled her over a second time. He said the attack was  unprovoked, but she said she reacted in self-defense when he forcibly removed  her from her car.  </P></p>

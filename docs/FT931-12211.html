			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Obituary of Lord Poole: Senior Tory and ex-FT chairman LORD POOLE, who died yesterday aged 81, straddled the worlds of finance and politics. He played a key role in the organisation of the Conservative party during the 1950s and 1960s. At the same time, as the closest adviser to Lord Cowdray, he was deeply involved in directing the affairs of what was, until publicly floated, one of the largest privately owned business empires in the country, the S. Pearson group. As chairman of Lazards, he was for many years a central figure in the City. Oliver Poole was born on August 11 1911 and was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. After a brief period in the Life Guards he joined a firm of building contractors in Birmingham, where in the difficult trading conditions of the mid-1930s he acquired his first direct experience of financial management. Shortly before the outbreak of war he joined his family business - Lloyd's insurance broking. During the war he served with the Eighth Army in north Africa, where he helped to plan the landings on Sicily and later did the same with 21st Army Group for the D-Day landings. He was mentioned in dispatches three times and was awarded many decorations. At the end of the war he was Colonel (Q Plans) to Field-Marshal Montgomery. His organisational skills drew him to the attention of the Tory party. Towards the end of the war, Conservative Central Office asked him to stand as a candidate and he entered the Commons in 1945 as MP for Oswestry. But he did not find the life of an MP congenial and quickly decided not to stand at the next election. His subsequent backstage role was crucial to the party. Poole had already had a hand in the pamphlet The Right Road for Britain, which became the basis of the 1950 election manifesto. In May 1950 he became political head of the Conservative Political Centre in succession to RA Butler. His interest in business advanced simultaneously: shortly before leaving the Commons in 1950 he was asked by Lord Cowdray to join him in running S. Pearson. The pair had become friends at Oxford, both being members of the University polo team. At that time the S. Pearson group faced the problem of adjusting to some drastic changes which had recently affected its interests. The main aviation activities had been nationalised, as had been the coalmines and the electricity utilities. What was left was an assortment of businesses, most of them sound and profitable but needing to be co-ordinated on a more rational basis. Poole helped to formulate a new strategy for the company, selling off some of the peripheral interests and concentrating on four main lines of development - banking and finance, publishing, the industrial group centred on Doulton, and oil. His main personal interest lay on the banking side, and he was particularly concerned to develop close co-operation between the three Lazard companies in London, Paris and New York. During the 1960s, he was credited with instilling a new verve into Lazard's activities in London. Poole also took an active interest in other parts of the group. He played a central role S. Pearson's decision to acquire control of the Financial Times in 1957 and he became chairman of the paper in October 1958 on the death of Viscount Bracken. He held the post until the end of 1960, when he was succeeded by Lord Robbins. He continued to be very much an international figure and in 1972 became a member of the main Fiat Board. Politics, however, had remained an important part of his life. In 1952 he was appointed joint treasurer of the Conservative Party, a post in which his administrative talents, his profusion of new ideas and his ability to raise very large sums of money brought him increasingly to the attention of the party's hierarchy. Poole succeeded Lord Woolton as party chairman in 1955, a post perfectly suited to his taste for working in the background. He travelled round the constituencies and forged close ties with Central Office, which were to serve as the basis for a decade of Conservative party organisation. Poole was created a baron in 1958 and a Privy Counsellor in 1963. In 1957 the job of chairman was divided, functionally, between Poole and Lord Hailsham - Poole quietly working away on improving the efficiency of the party machine while Lord Hailsham stumped the country making rousing party speeches. 'Leaving the limelight to others,' Mr Michael Foot wrote later, 'Lord Poole created the most efficient machine which has ever contested an election in this country. He knew more about the details in every marginal constituency than had ever been assembled at a party headquarters before.' At the end of that period Poole returned to the City, but in 1963 he was suddenly recalled by Harold Macmillan to serve as joint chairman with Iain Macleod in the aftermath of the Profumo scandal, when Macmillan's leadership of the party was under siege. He served in this post for just over a year. He was known to his closest friends for his great kindness and generosity to those of other political persuasions. 'He could never stand rancorous politics,' said one. 'He accomplished great good and kindnesses by stealth.'</p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Regional bank bucks the trend Most of the UK's big high-street banks may be taking the knife to their branch networks  - but not all. Yorkshire Bank, whose Australian ownership is not permitted to obscure its homely, northern flavour, underlined how it is successfully bucking the trend with the opening of its 270th branch at Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, last week. Yorkshire cannot claim to have completely escaped the storm of political criticism directed at banks. But it sees the present wave of ill feeling more as a market opportunity than a problem. Far from dreaming up a novel strategy for the times, however, its tactics seem to be to play on its traditional strengths while the others flounder. In terms of products, Yorkshire cannot claim to be much different from its larger competitors. Its emphasis has been on carving out for itself a different brand image, consolidating its position as a regional bank - though its branches now stretch from Gateshead to Slough  - and of winning business from customers who are simply fed up with its rivals. Yorkshire took a close look at the promotional activities of its competitors last year and found that customers were unimpressed with the stark contrast between expensive advertising imagery and actual delivery. It believed the service its own network delivered was, if anything, running ahead of its image. With personal and small- to medium-sized business accounts as its main target, Yorkshire increasingly makes a virtue of its size and parochialism. Its claims of friendliness and approachability seemed to be supported recently when it was voted best overall bank for customer satisfaction by 'Which?', the UK consumer magazine. While insistent that it will not necessarily pick up accounts other banks consider too risky, Yorkshire maintains that the greater autonomy and discretion given to its managers guarantees a more considered, sympathetic approach. Not everyone, however, is impressed. Christopher Cartwright, the owner of a small but long-established graphic design company who responded to Yorkshire's well-publicised desire to help small businessmen, says he got a sympathetic hearing  - and a polite refusal. 'So much for a different approach,' says Cartwright. Not content with welcoming suitable refugees from other banks, Yorkshire also has a keen eye for the empty high-street properties vacated by its shrinking competitors. The bank has moved into branch premises vacated by competitors in such towns as Macclesfield, St Albans, Reading and Slough, though it remains fussy. It turned up its nose at every branch on a long list of properties put on the market by Midland Bank. Expansion is undertaken steadily, advancing into new, adjacent areas only when the bank's local presence has been established. With a large chunk of the country now covered, attention is primarily concentrated on expanding within existing areas, rather than on reaching new regional markets. There are around 70 locations on the bank's expansion list, although only three new branches are projected to open this year. At around Pounds 500,000 a time, no one wants to get the next location wrong. So far, Yorkshire claims it has never been forced to close down a branch, most of which become profitable in about three years. Yorkshire does have some things in common with its larger counterparts - apart from its recently reported 1992 losses. It shares the view that branches will increasingly take on the appearance of other high-street shops, with the majority of space given to customers, rather than staff. The Hemel Hempstead branch, with its spacious banking hall, is a sign of things to come. Steve Harrison is far too thrilled with his first manager's post to complain about his own, windowless box at the back of the building. In any case, he intends to spend most of his time on the road seeing customers: 'If I'm sitting in here I'm not making any money,' he grins.</p>

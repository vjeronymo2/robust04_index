			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: IBM, Lend Lease in Australian IT deal Lend Lease, the Australian financial services group, is linking with International Business Machines of the US to sell information technology services to Australia's business community. They will offer services ranging from management of desktop systems to business recovery services. The two companies estimate the current IT services market in Australia is worth about ADollars 2bn (USDollars 1.4bn) a year. They aim to capture at least a 30 per cent share within the next five years. The services will be marketed through a new joint venture company, Integrated Systems Solutions Corporation, which will be 65 per cent owned by IBM Australia and 35 per cent by Lend Lease. No financial details of the partners' investments were revealed. However, the new organisation will be a substantial business, employing some 1,300 people. About 750 staff will come from IBM, and the balance from Lend Lease. Under the terms of the agreement, both Lend Lease and IBM will source their own IT requirements from ISSC.</p>

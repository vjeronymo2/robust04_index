			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 4 (BTA) -- A total of 500 computer  viruses were identified in Bulgaria only within about an year,  which makes an average of two viruses per day. All state  institutions -- parliament, cabinet and the president's office  -- last year were subject to information terrorism three to five  times, BTA learned from Mr. Evgeni Nikolov, head of the computer  security lab with the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAN). An  international conference on information protection is currently  being held in Varna (on the Black Sea).    An unidentified writer penetrated the Finance Ministry  computers precisely when the 1994 national budget was being  drafted, it became known at the conference. The National Bank  of Bulgaria (BNB), too, just like all major commercial banks,  was troubled by viruses. Jack the Ripper was the most dangerous  of the viruses traced and broken by the BAN computer security  experts, Mr. Nikolov said. It appeared last September in  Bulgaria and caused serious damages after penetrating about 70  percent of the computers. "While we were ready to beat it  within about a fortnight, it took the other affected countries  three months longer to solve this problem," Mr. Nikolov also  said.    Statistical figures set the number of operating computers in  this country at over 1 million. The experts working at the  anti-virus lab with the BAN are 11 and only within an year they  have developed some 1,000 anti-virus packages. They, however,  have to sell their products cheap to prove they are not writing  computer viruses as a means to provide a market for the  anti-virus products.    Bulgaria has highly qualified computer experts. It is  generally believed that some of the unbreakable viruses,  including the Dark Avenger, are Bulgarian-made. According to  Mr. Nikolov, however, it makes no sense blaming one nation or  another and the anti-Bulgarian campaign in this sector is losing  its vigour.</p>

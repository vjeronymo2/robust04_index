			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Growth creates Australian jobs Further signs of economic recovery in Australia emerged yesterday with the announcement of a continuing growth in the number of jobs created during the last three months. Figures published by the official statistics bureau showed the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained at 9.5 per cent in September, despite the substantial rise in the number of people who actively looked for jobs during the month. Nearly 76,000 jobs were created in September, while the 'participation rate', the percentage of working age population actively seeking work, rose to 63.3 per cent from 62.8 per cent in August. Mr Simon Crean, the employment minister, said this reflected the confidence of the labour force in a growing economy. The Labor government's promise of creating 500,000 jobs in five years (from 1993) will be easily achieved. During the last three months, 140,000 jobs have been created and analysts are predicting that the 3 per cent growth in employment forecast in the government's 1994/95 budget will be exceeded. New capital expenditure during the three months to June increased 7.7 per cent in constant prices, the best figure since the September quarter of 1990. Spending on plant equipment during the period rose 14 per cent in real terms.</p>

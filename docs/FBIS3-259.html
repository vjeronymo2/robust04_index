			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kathryn Strachan] </F>   [Text] The SAP [South African Police] strategy for policing  the election was an unprofessional plan with major gaps, EC and  Independent Electoral Commission security adviser Mike Brogden  said yesterday.    Speaking at Wits [Witwatersrand] University's Centre for the  Study of Violence, Brogden said that once the administrative  staff had been subtracted from the SAP's manpower of 140,000, it  left fewer than 70,000 effective police officers. This amounted  to a totally inadequate number of two to three officers to each  polling station on the three voting days.    The SAP planned to call all police officers from their usual  duties, leaving these tasks to inadequately trained reserve  policemen during this volatile period. Brogden questioned the  quality of policing and policemen's knowledge of electoral  procedure. Another criticism was the lack of contingency plans  if things failed to go smoothly.    The plan was also very centralised, which was an obstacle  given the time taken to relay a message from Pretoria to  peripheral areas. There were no plans to coordinate with  emergency services. Nadia Levine, a researcher from the  centre's policing project, highlighted the plan's vagueness and  the lack of detail about its implementation. She said it failed  to focus on the various problems the different regions would  experience.    SAP spokesman Brig Francois Cronje countered criticism of  the  plan being too centralised, saying the SAP's 10 regions had a  high degree of independence. For this reason the plan was  intended to be only a guideline, and the regions would be able  to develop their own plans according to circumstances on the  ground. He said reservists would be used only in trouble-free  areas. Contingency plans were in place, but could not be  disclosed.    SAPA reports that President F.W. de Klerk told Parliament  yesterday that government had a contingency plan to counteract  violence or any threat to the election but it would not be made  public. "I will ensure that the election is free and fair."  The law would be brought into effect and the security forces  applied against any effort to deny voters their rights. The TEC  [Transitional Executive Council] would also be brought into play.    SADF [South African Defense Force] spokesman Maj Merle Meyer  said troops would be deployed to assist. Some citizen force  members were also being called up to replace soldiers seconded  to the National Peacekeeping Force.</p>

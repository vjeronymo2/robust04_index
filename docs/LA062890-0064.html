			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH: SUMMER SCHOOL IN SESSION FOR LATC STUDY GROUP;  </P> <P> DOWNTOWN: THE 11-MEMBER PANEL IS CHARGED WITH FIGURING OUT HOW TO ENSURE 'THE  PERMANENT SURVIVAL OF THEATER' ON SPRING STREET.  </P> <P> The 11 people who could determine the future of Los Angeles Theatre Center met  for lunch in Mayor Tom Bradley's office Monday and began their summer-long  deliberations.  </P> <P> Appointed by Bradley a month ago, this group was charged with figuring out how  to ensure "the permanent survival of theater" in the Spring Street building  that houses LATC. The Community Redevelopment Agency has said that it can no  longer afford LATC's facilities and debt. The LATC estimates that those costs  -- including the creation of an endowment -- could total $32 million over the  next five years.  </P> <P> "None of those people would be sitting there (at the Monday luncheon) if they  felt that any of this were pre-judged," said William Wingate, the consultant  who will conduct the research for the study group, after the meeting. "The  mayor said, 'Don't feel there are any sacred cows here.' "  </P> <P> Asked to briefly speculate about how the facility costs might be reduced,  Wingate replied, "If the city had the expense of keeping only one theater  (instead of four) open a certain number of weeks (instead of year-round), the  facilities costs might look very different."  </P> <P> In other words, LATC could be a shadow of its former self if the money isn't  found to maintain the building and pay its debt service.  </P> <P> "We would disagree that there would be a cost savings in that solution," said  LATC managing director Robert Lear. Keeping only one theater open "would  provide us with less revenue," he added.  </P> <P> Asked where additional facilities money might come from, if not from the CRA,  Wingate replied, "I have no idea. I don't know enough about the city  bureaucracy to know" if other branches of city government might be able to fill  the gap. Wingate added that "it is not this group's task to find those  potential funding sources" -- though its members will "try to identify all  reasonable options."  </P> <P> Wingate, who left his job as executive managing director of Center Theatre  Group in 1988 and moved to New York, said he saw "only a couple of productions"  at LATC before his departure. But he did serve on National Endowment for the  Arts theater panels, which reviewed LATC grant applications, including a term  as chairman in 1986. At the time, he recalled, "there was some question of the  ongoing viability of LATC. But those questions have recently been laid to rest.  Certainly the balance sheet (of LATC itself, apart from the facilities costs)  looks much better than it ever has."  </P> <P> LBCLO TO LACLO?: Martin Wiviott and Keith Stava, the pair of producers who  resigned from Long Beach Civic Light Opera last week, are in talks with the  Nederlander Organization over the possibility of programming the Los Angeles  Civic Light Opera, according to both Stava and the Nederlanders' West Coast  president, Stan Seiden.  </P> <P> A NEW CONTRACT: Actors' Equity's Western Advisory Board will be asked to  approve a new Hollywood Area Theatre contract, covering theaters with between  100 and 500 seats, at its July 5 meeting. The contract could go into effect as  early as August, said George Ives, the union's incoming Western regional  director.  </P> <P> The contract will call for graduated pay scales, with minimums increasing as  capacities expand in increments of 100 seats. The old Hollywood Area Theatre  contract "is not responsive to producers in smaller theaters," said Ives. "They  need contracts more tailored to those venues."  </P> <P> Ives said some of the producers who frequently use the town's mid-sized  theaters were consulted in the drafting of the contract. Not consulted were  officials of Associated Theatres of Los Angeles (ATLAS), the producers'  organization that broke off talks with Equity on this issue a year ago. Ives  said ATLAS represents producers in sub-100-seat venues "who may wish sometime  to move a show" into a mid-sized house. "It's difficult to treat them as the  correct bargaining unit; they're not active in the field."  </P> <P> ATLAS chairwoman Laura Zucker said this disregard of ATLAS follows "the Equity  pattern of trying to unilaterally promulgate a contract." Nevertheless, she  approves of many of this contract's features, adding that the seating-capacity  scales and breaks for large-cast shows actually grew out of ATLAS suggestions.  </P> <P> However, she said the draft of the contract, as read to her over the telephone  by Ives, "ignored all the flexibility issues" that had been discussed in the  talks with Equity. ATLAS sought to permit fewer performances and/or rehearsals  per week than this contract would allow. ATLAS members won't sign the new  contract, she predicted.  </P> <P> Ives responded that the producers he did consult were not concerned about  flexibility. If ATLAS members want more flexible schedules, he said, "they can  always negotiate for special concessions" for individual productions.  </P> <P> DE OBEAH MON: Equity will send cease-and-desist letters to three of its members  who are appearing in "De Obeah Mon," at the Westwood Playhouse, and will ask  the Screen Actors Guild to send similar letters to two of its members who are  in the show, said Equity's Ives. The producers of the show are operating  without an Equity contract.  </P></p>

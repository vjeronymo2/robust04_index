			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: NHS fraudsters face clampdown Family doctors and pharma-cists are to be asked to spearhead a drive to stop the National Health Service being robbed of millions of pounds through prescription charge fraud, Mrs Virginia Bottomley said yesterday. While no precise figures for the fraud were available, the health secretary suggested that 'tens of millions' of pounds might be involved. Mr Gerald Malone, the health minister, is to have urgent talks with doctors and pharmacists about tightening procedures on prescribing and dispensing medicines. This could involve doctors providing written confirmation of patients entitled to exemption from charges, and patients having to produce proof of identity to pharmacists. Mrs Bottomley, who was not subjected to any criticism by constituency representatives in a debate dominated by praise for the NHS, received an unenthusiastic standing ovation. She said prescription exemption arrangements for pensioners, expectant mothers and those suffering from persistent illness as being among the most generous in the world. Defending the self-governing hospital trusts and other reforms introduced in April 1991, Mrs Bottomley said 3,000 extra patients were being treated every day. She confirmed that more GPs would be given the chance to control their budgets through an extension of the voluntary GP fundholders' scheme. All practices with 3,000 or more patients will be able to join an 'easy entry' community fundholding scheme to cover drugs, staff, and diagnostic tests.</p>

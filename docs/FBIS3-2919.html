It invited Standing Committee  members of the CPPCC National Committee, Wan Guoquan and Li  Gang, and National Committee members Yan Ruifen, Zhao Changbai,  Zhang Junsheng, and Wang Jie to answer questions. We now  broadcast excerpts of the recorded news conference.    [Begin recording] [unidentified moderator] Ladies,  gentlemen, and friends, the NPC-CPPCC Press Center is hosting a  news conference for Chinese and foreign correspondents here this  afternoon on the themes of establishing a modern enterprise  system and improving state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises. We are honored to have been successful in inviting  six Standing Committee members and members of the CPPCC National  Committee here today. Please allow me to introduce them to you,  they are: Wan Guoquan, Standing Committee member of the CPPCC  National Committee and vice chairman of the Central Committee of  the China Democratic National Construction Association; Li Gang,  Standing Committee member of the CPPCC National Committee, vice  chairman of the Economy Committee of the CPPCC National  Committee, and adviser to the China National Automotive Industry  Corporation; Yan Ruifen, member of the CPPCC National Committee  and general manager of Guangdong China Guanglian Enterprise  Company Limited; Zhao Changbai, member of the CPPCC National  Committee and vice-chairman of the Board of Directors of Shoudu  Iron and Steel Corporation; Zhang Junsheng, member of the CPPCC  National Committee and board chairman of (Hehe Meiling) Company  Limited; and Wang Jie, member of the CPPCC National Committee  and professor of the Economics Department of the CPC Central  Party School. We now invite questions.    [Ye] I am Ye from the (?SHANG YE JIN RONG BAO) [?COMMERCIAL  AND FINANCIAL JOURNAL]; my question is: Quite a number of  shareholding enterprises have claimed that their switch to  shareholding status means they have already changed their  operating mechanisms and see no need to change them again under  the current call. What do you think?    [Moderator] We would like to invite Committee Member Li Gang  to answer this question.    [Li] Thank you. This is a very meaningful question. There  are quite a number of factors that currently make large and  medium state-owned enterprises unable to enliven themselves.  One of these is shortage of funds. However, we feel the most  fundamental reason for the poor performance of large and medium  state-owned enterprises is one of mechanism and system.  Although capital may be injected through share issues, in the  final analysis, the success or failure of enterprises depends on  whether or not we can enliven our system.    [(Li Ruisheng)] I am a reporter from RENMIN RIBAO, my name  is (Li Ruisheng). I would like to direct my question to board  chairman Zhang Junsheng of the (Meiling) Company. [words  indistinct]    [Zhang] To a developing nation like China, I think admission  to the GATT will have far-reaching impacts; in the meantime,  however, it will play a big role in pushing China's economic  development. To we Chinese enterprises, admission to GATT  presents both a challenge and an opportunity. As far as our  company is concerned, our (Meiling) refrigerators are well  prepared to compete with refrigerators produced by any country  on an open, just, and fair basis. We are confident we will get  our deserved market share.    [(Chen Yunping)] I am (Chen Yunping) from the Central  Television Network. I would like to direct my question to Zhang  Junsheng. It is argued that there are two ways to enliven large  and medium state enterprises; one is implementing the  share-holding system the other is private ownership. What are  your views? Do you think these arguments are correct?    [Zhang] From the perspective of historic development, the  development from private ownership to public ownership is  inevitable; history should not reverse itself. According to the  operating characteristics of the market economy, the superior  will win while the inferior will lose. Under these  circumstances, private ownership may (?accommodate) public  ownership and verse versa. Therefore, I would say that the  question of introducing private ownership in China does not  arise. In addition, in his government work report delivered  yesterday, Premier Li Peng emphatically stressed keeping public  ownership as the mainstay of the economy.    [(Wen Shizai)] I am XIN MIN WAN BAO [XINMIN EVENING POST]  reporter (Wen Shizai). The enforcement of the Bankruptcy Law  will bring unemployment to some workers. My first question is:  Are we going to control our unemployment rate? And my second  question is: If the answer is yes, to what extent should we  exercise control?    [Moderator] Shall we direct these questions to Committee  Member Wang Jie?    [Wang] Once the Bankruptcy Law comes into effect, some  workers will inevitably face temporary periods of waiting  between jobs. In the process of developing a market economy,  and in the course of promoting fair competition, the "superior  will win and the inferior will lose" law will certainly apply to  every enterprise. Some workers, therefore, are bound to spend  some time job-waiting. It can be argued, though, that this  job-waiting is different from previous western-style, long-term  unemployment phenomena. As far as our socialist system is  concerned, the working people are the masters of our nation and  we will make every effort to get jobs for them. Hence, our  party and governments are now vigorously developing tertiary  industry, township and village enterprises, and small and medium  cities, and towns. All these are designed to provide a secure  [words indistinct] workplace for the working people who are  temporarily out of job. It has been my personal view that, in  light of deepening of reform and the development of a socialist  economy, there will be more job opportunities. This point  [words indistinct] has been proved by history.    [(Li Rao)] My name is (Li Rao) from the ZHONG HUA GONG SHANG  SHI BAO [CHINESE INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL JOURNAL], I have a  question for committee member Wan Guoguan. At present, large  and medium enterprises are the main components of our country's  economy, their success or failure will have an impact on the  development of the whole national economy. For the past few  years, we have been introducing contract systems, implementing  regulations on transforming operational mechanisms, and now we  are active in developing a modern enterprise system. As doubts  and anxieties still exist over whether these measures are really  helpful to the invigoration of large and medium enterprises, can  we ask the views of Wan Guoquan, the executive chairman of the  Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction  Association and a representative of democratic parties, on these  issues?    [Wan] I think this is a very important question, an issue  of deep concern for us. Before discussing it we must, first and  foremost, affirm the contributions made by our large and medium  state enterprises to the country and people in the first few  decades after its founding. Meanwhile, we should also recognize  large and medium state enterprises as the mainstay of the  national economy. They have played a dominant role in national  economic construction in the past, play a similar role now, and  will continue to do so in the future. Because state enterprises  were founded on the enterprise system under a planned economy,  the introduction of a socialist market economy in China has  indeed put them in a predicament. However, I have ample  confidence that state enterprises can be invigorated, for four  reasons: First, central government has adopted a clear-cut goal  and policy measures to enliven state enterprises, which are  reflected in the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee and Premier Li Peng's government work  report. As Premier Li Peng explained, the goal and policy  measures can be summarized as follows, the requirement that  large and medium state enterprises deepen reform and change  operating mechanisms, including, of course, the establishment of  a modern enterprise system, under which property rights as well  as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises are clearly  defined, government administration and enterprise management are  separated, and scientific management is established. Based on  my experience as a manager when enterprises did not have  managerial autonomy and were not responsible for profits and  losses, I am fully aware of that if an enterprise is shackled by  many restrictions it will lack vitality. If state enterprises  operate according to central government policy and the Company  Law, which will come into force soon, they will be full of  vitality. Second, even though the equipment of some enterprises  is outdated, others have upgraded or, more importantly, have  been equipped with internationally advanced facilities. The  latter can play an effective role in promoting socialized mass  production. Third, state enterprises have a large contingent of  talented people, including senior engineers and veteran workers.  They are an invaluable asset of ours. Moreover, through more  than a decade of continuous exploration, we have accumulated  experience in bringing state enterprises more into line with our  socialist market economy. The entrepreneurs present here today  are typical products of such exploration. Fourth, central  authorities have set great store by, and the people have shown a  keen interest in, reform of the large and medium state  enterprises. Now is the time to reform them or they will not  survive. This is a demand of our socialist market economy.  Reform must be carried out and will certainly succeed. That  Premier Li Peng devoted a whole section of his report to this  question explains the great importance attached by the State  Council to reform of state enterprises. Therefore, I am fully  confident that enterprise reform will succeed, but it will take  some time.    [Correspondent] I am from Hong Kong's KUAI PAO [EXPRESS].  During an interview a few days ago, an economist propounded a  theory that the performance of large and medium state  enterprises was not bad, but that their vitality had been  diverted into other areas. Do you agree with this theory?    [Moderator] Shall we direct this question to Professor Wang  Jie?    [Wang] There is some truth in the theory that the poor  performance of state enterprises does not indicate a decrease in  their efficiency, but rather the diversion of efficiency to  other areas. At present, some large and medium state  enterprises have to undertake a heavy burden. For example, they  have debts and apportionments for social undertakings and  various expenses, which must be paid from their profits. It is  true, therefore, that in the final analysis their efficiency is  low. However, we must admit that the overall efficiency of  enterprises is not high; and the reasons, as mentioned in  Premier Li Peng's report, are many. The fundamental one lies in  the shortcomings and defects of the management systems and  operating mechanisms of state enterprises. How are the  shortcomings and defects reflected? They are reflected mainly  in the failure to clearly define the property rights as well as  the rights and responsibilities of enterprises, and in their  administrative (?interference) with operating mechanisms. For  this reason, all enterprises have limited management autonomy  and are weak in market competition. It is precisely because of  these shortcomings and defects that the decision of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has explicitly  proposed a step-by-step reform of state enterprises, and has  defined the establishment of a modern enterprise system as the  objective of reform. I believe that once property rights and  the rights and responsibilities of enterprise are clearly  defined, once government administration and enterprise  management are separated, and once scientific management is  established in accordance with the objective set by the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, state  enterprise efficiency will surely be gradually enhanced, and  they will bring into more effective play a role commensurate  with their dominant position in the national economy.    [Correspondent in English, fading into Mandarin  translation] I am from the SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST. There  appears to be something of a contradiction in Premier Li Peng's  government work report. On the one hand, he demanded that state  enterprises rely on themselves to achieve development through  reforms, while on the other he pledged more government financial  aid to these enterprises. For example, they are no longer  required to pay funds for energy and transportation construction  projects and budgetary regulatory funds. Moreover, the  government will also provide financial aid to enterprises to  help them resettle surplus labor. If the government continues  to provide assistance in terms of funds to state enterprises,  how can they be encouraged to make reform and enhance efficiency?    [Unidentified CPPCC committee member] The premier's report  is not contradictory. What is essential is that enterprises  rely on themselves by deepening reform and changing their  operating mechanisms. However, during the transitional period,  the state will implement an interim preferential policy toward  enterprises, especially to guarantee the livelihood of their  workers and staff. If an enterprise rely on the preferential  policy without deepening reform, it can go nowhere. Government  support will not last forever. The only way out for an  enterprise running in the red over a protracted period is to  declare bankruptcy.    [(Chen Tiebiao)] I am (Chen Tiebiao) from the (?Cable  Television). My question is about the tax assignment system,  which is a new state policy. As the Finance Minister explained  in the budget report, the new system may encounter  contradictions in the course of implementation. Will such  contradictions be those between the state enterprises and local  governments, or between the enterprises themselves? Please  clarify.    [Unidentified CPPCC member] Implementation of the tax  assignment system is a very important step in our tax reform.  It is not a system unique to China, and is also implemented in  many other countries. At present, there are national and local  taxes. However, under the tax assignment system, the central  government, in order to make allowances for local governments,  will reimburse them a certain amount of tax revenue to tide them  over difficulties during the transitional period. Of course, it  is entirely possible that a reform of such a great magnitude  will affect the interests of a certain sector. What we can do  is to proceed from the overall situation and take into  consideration both national and local interests.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Sharp increase in US production boosts shares to record levels US industrial production grew at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent in real terms in the fourth quarter of last year, a further sign of the accelerating pace of economic recovery, figures from the Federal Reserve indicated yesterday. The news prompted a strong rise in share prices and the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day 24.77 up at a new high of 3,867.2. Bond prices fell on fears that faster growth would bring forward the timing of an interest rate rise. As the Clinton administration puts the final touches to this year's budget, due early next month, senior officials are increasingly confident about the economic outlook. In an address in New York yesterday, Mr Robert Rubin, chairman of the White House National Economic Council, forecast a robust, sustained recovery. He said there was 'very little probability of inflation reigniting' and predicted 3 per cent growth this year. Mr Rubin said economic conditions would also be favourable in 1995 and 1996 because, by then, the US would be boosted by economic recovery in Japan and Europe. In an apparent preview of the budget, Mr Rubin also predicted the US would make more rapid progress than expected in reducing the federal budget deficit. The deficit would fall to 'substantially under 2 per cent of GDP' over five years, he said. Last year's budget projected a deficit of 3.1 per cent in 1998. The Fed report showed production up 0.7 per cent in December after strong gains in preceding months. Although led by a surge in car production, output strength appears broadly based, with nearly every industrial sector registering healthy gains. Excluding cars, production was up 0.5 per cent last month, the same rise as in November. The rate of industrial capacity utilisation rose to 83.5 per cent, above its long-term average of 81.9 per cent but still below the 84.8 per cent registered at the peak of the 1980s boom. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index was reported to have risen sharply in early January to 95.8 against 88.2 in December.

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Komatsu to unveil European excavator KOMATSU, the world's second biggest construction equipment manufacturer, is about to become the first Japanese producer to develop, design and make a new model outside Japan. Komatsu UK, based in Birtley, near Newcastle, will unveil its new wheeled excavator later this month at the Bauma construction equipment exhibition in Munich. The move is a sign of the growing Europeanisation of Japanese construction equipment producers, and of Komatsu's increasing confidence in its wholly-owned UK subsidiary. The Birtley plant, formerly owned by Caterpillar, began production in 1987. The launch is also intended to plug a gap in Komatsu's range and enhance its position in the German construction equipment market, where wheeled excavators are an important product. Virtually all other European markets are in recession of varying depths, but German demand has risen at least 50 per cent since reunification. Mr Toshitaka Suketomo, Komatsu UK's managing director, said 80 per cent of shipments from Birtley were now being exported to Germany. That compares with about 40 per cent before reunification. However, other markets have declined and the plant's total production has fallen. Shipments to the UK market are running at about half the level seen in busy times, while deliveries to France have virtually halted. Mr Suketomo said Komatsu UK had slightly adjusted downwards its forecast for 1992 sales, and was now less optimistic than at the beginning of the year. He believes production at Birtley will fall 10 per cent this year, but this would be offset by the launch of the new PW170-5 excavator. Mr Clive Morton, director of personnel and administration, said Komatsu UK was talking to the Department of Trade and Industry about the local content rules.</p>

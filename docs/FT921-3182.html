			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (2): A very partial success / Assessing the Structural Adjustment Programme HISTORY WILL rate the Babangida government on its success, or otherwise, in recasting Nigerian politics while restructuring the economy. Within a year of seizing power, General Babangida launched the 1986 Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP), then billed as a two-year exercise. Nearly six years later, the jury is still out on both the political and economic counts, but there is disconcerting evidence that when the ledger is finally written up, SAP will be seen - at best - as no more than a very partial success. This does not mean that reform cannot be resuscitated, but unless the government is far bolder in the next nine months than in the past 36, it risks going down in history with the end-of-term report: 'Should have tried harder'. A harsh judgment? How else does one explain the absence of a World Bank lending programme for structural reform, after all the time, energy and money it invested in the late 1980s? How too does one account for the suspension of the IMF programme, following the failure to meet public sector borrowing targets? Above all, it is impossible to explain away ongoing policy shortcomings - exchange rate management, public sector investment, excessive dependence on oil revenues for exports and government revenue, the foreign debt burden and the dismal performance of the public sector as a whole. Were not all these problems the very ones that SAP was meant to solve? Yet they remain as much a threat to future economic performance today as they were in 1986. Indeed, the experience under structural adjustment illustrates what threatens to become the iron law of sub-Saharan economic reform. The best-framed economic policies falter due to a combination of insufficient political commitment, inadequate administrative capacity and the shortage of external resources. A kinder judgment portrays the glass as a third full, rather than two-thirds empty, but there can be no escaping the fact that the momentum of early reform during the 1986-88 period was not maintained. First in 1988 and then again in 1990-91 public spending lurched out of control and all sorts of non-market distortions were imposed on the system to depress bank lending rates and maintain an unsustainable exchange rate for the naira. Nigeria's capacity to service its foreign - and domestic - debt while maintaining politically-acceptable levels of public spending depends entirely on the world oil market. In early 1992, with oil prices in retreat and quota cutbacks, an economic crunch is imminent. The plight of the new civilian governors who inherited debt-stressed state treasuries and empty bank accounts at a time of crumbling infrastructure highlights the federal government's limited room for manoeuvre. It is a classic catch-22 dilemma; the government must have a debt relief agreement with the Paris Club of official creditors if it is to hand over a remotely clean balance sheet to the civilians in nine months' time, avoid a debt default and yet another build-up of arrears. To satisfy the IMF, it must merge the 'official' and 'competitive' market exchange rates, and substantially reduce the budget deficit - estimated at 11.4 per cent of GDP last year. It must also take effective steps to slow inflation and (probably) reduce the domestic petroleum subsidy. Indeed, the government has already agreed to raise domestic petrol prices to 'export parity' by 1994. But officials warn that the political cost of such reforms could be widespread domestic unrest in the run-up to elections, which is in no-one's interest. And even were an IMF deal to be bought for so heavy a political price, only Britain currently supports debt-relief on Trinidad-style terms for Nigeria. Nigerians point to their experience in the last two rounds of debt negotiations with the Paris and London clubs last year. Not only did they receive less generous terms from the official creditors in Paris than they had hoped but only two of some 400 banks that signed the London Club agreement were prepared to accept the 'new money' option, which was subsequently allowed to lapse. Yet Nigeria continues to attract substantial inflows of foreign direct investment - Dollars 1bn a year in the last three years, and more than the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa. But offsetting that is the heavy amortisation burden of Dollars 3.8bn annually, including last year's net repayment to the World Bank group of some Dollars 300m. Disappointments aside, the glass is still one third full; quantitative measures of SAP's performance must be interpreted cautiously, given the extent to which economic performance is driven by oil market conditions. Output did grow substantially faster in the post-SAP period than in the preceding five years but the former was one of sharply declining oil prices while the latter includes the short-lived Kuwait invasion boom. Economic growth aside, there are three striking indicators in the table that cast doubt on the success of SAP. As in so many African SAPs, investment underperformed, averaging 6 per cent of GDP as against 12 per cent pre-SAP, while inflation increased. Equally striking is the collapse in imports as a share in GDP, itself a partial explanation of the poor investment record. Qualitative yardsticks offer greater encouragement; the key achievements of SAP include the abolition of import controls, the deregulation of prices and interest rates, the shift towards indirect techniques of monetary management, the privatisation of 78 enterprises, the commitment to commercialise many others and the partial freeing of the exchange rate. These add up to a very substantial shift in economic policy. Sadly, there is another side to the coin; Nigeria, ranked as an aspiring middle-income country at the time of the previous handover to civilian rule in 1979, is today the world's 13th poorest country with a per capita income of a mere Dollars 250, down from Dollars 1,000 in 1980. The social picture is depressing too, with population growth of 3 per cent outstripping food production, job generation and the provision of education and health facilities. The average daily calorie intake of 2,190 falls 7 per cent below the international standard of 2,350, while infant mortality at 85 per 1,000 exceeds the world low-income average of 70. Sixty per cent of Nigerian children under the age of five years suffer from protein energy malnutrition while government spending on health and poverty alleviation has fallen under SAP. Yet it is hardly fair to blame SAP; the fact is that resource allocation decisions in Nigeria reflect the control exerted by vested interests. The 'toys for the boys' syndrome means shiny new tanks for the military and 300 smart new Peugeot sedans for officers rather than better-equipped schools and universities. Roads and power infrastructure deteriorate while public funds are earmarked for grandiose projects such as Ajaokuta steel and the proposed aluminium smelter; petrol sells domestically at the absurd price of US4c a litre; there is massive evasion of customs duties and no serious attempt has been made to broaden the fiscal base so that essential public spending can be met from taxes rather than the central bank's printing press. The upshot has been pain without much gain. It is now too late for the government to do much to alleviate the pain, but it can - and should - finish as it started. In the past fortnight, after nearly two years of policy drift, there are signs of a new determination to complete the job it started six years ago. The decision to abandon the artificial foreign currency auction system and float the naira was a crucial first step towards an IMF deal. On its own, this will not be enough. The government must raise domestic oil prices to help finance what threatens to be an unsustainable budget deficit this year, cut public spending, clamp down on smugglers and corruption at the ports, and impose more monetary restraint, without which the exchange rate will continue to slide. Such a package ought to satisfy the IMF, thereby opening the door to a Paris Club debt relief deal. The timetable is tight and the challenges formidable. The military has no more than nine months in which to negotiate a new IMF agreement, secure a debt-relief deal from the Paris Club, stabilise the naira and prevent inflation from soaring above 40 per cent. But there is no viable alternative to a virtuous end-game strategy. The present lame-duck policy of drift - interrupted, if not abandoned, this month when the naira was floated - carried no credibility at all, least of all in the markets where the gap between the official and competitive exchange rates had widened to more than 90 per cent before the military accepted the inevitability of substantial devaluation. The government has no electorate to face, and nothing to lose by reverting to the policies that were beginning to work in 1986-87 and again in 1990. After all his efforts to recast the political system, President Babangida has no wish to be remembered as the man who bequeathed a poisoned economy chalice to his successors. Floating the naira gives him the chance to go out as he came in, though only if the other shoe, in the form of spending cuts and credit restraint, is allowed to drop.  -----------------------------------------------------------       GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT CONSTANT 1984 PRICES  ----------------------------------------------------------- YEAR                   NBN  ----------------------------------------------------------- 1981                  70.4 1982                  70.2 1983                  66.4 1984                  63.0 1985                  68.9 1986                  71.1 1987                  70.7 1988                  77.8 1989                  83.5 1990                  90.4 1991*                 94.3 1992**                95.5  ----------------------------------------------------------- * Provisional. ** Forecast Source: Federal Office of Statistics and National Planning  -----------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------    DOMESTIC PUBLIC DEBT           (Nbn)  -------------------------------- 1980                     26 1985                     40 1987                     50 1988                     66 1989                     81 1990                    107 1991                    120  -------------------------------- Source: Central Bank of Nigeria  --------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------                  THE ECONOMY UNDER SAP*  -------------------------------------------------------- Period                           1981-86       1987-91  -------------------------------------------------------- GDP growth (% pa)                0.2           5.7 Investment (% of GDP)             12.0           6.0 Inflation (% pa)                17.0          24.0 Exports/GDP (%)                   14.3          18.0 Imports/GDP (%)                   11.8           3.8 Budget deficit (% of GDP)          5.3           3.7  -------------------------------------------------------- *Structural Adjustment Programme Sources: Central Bank of Nigeria, Fed  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

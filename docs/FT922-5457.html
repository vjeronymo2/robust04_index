			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Arts: Jazz Cafe THE liner-like Jazz Cafe in Camden Town is still without an owner, but is not yet rudderless. In the final throes of its previous owners' programming, the club continues to delight with such gems as a Joe Henderson quartet. Not that there were no disappointments: the beer chilling equipment was bust and cool bassist Charlie Haden failed to materialise. Disappointment evaporated, however, with the sight and sound of Al Foster seated at a strangely tall drum kit and Renee Rosnees at the grand, alongside the slight frame of the voguish Californian tenorist. Henderson's most recent recording, Lush Life (The Music of Billy Strayhorn) (Verve 511779-2) which features Wynton Marsalis on trumpet, currently holds the No. 1 slot in the US Billboard jazz chart. A selection of standards, The Standard Joe (Red Records/Harmonia Mundi, 123248-2), with Al Foster, is out soon. Henderson is an insidious stylist whose technique detracts from that of his post-Coltrane peers. Not so much a series of rumbustious licks, Henderson's soloing consists of long, mellow and nagging passages, which both he and the listener can take some time to warm up to. Indeed, for some of us hanging over the rail on the top deck of an almost tropical Jazz Cafe, it seemed that Henderson might be drifting away at times. Before the doldrums set in however, the melody flows again pulling him back into view. Where Henderson's passages were expansive and subtly persuasive, they were in sharp contrast to Al Foster's jolly crash-bang-wallop accompaniment. Foster is an ex-Miles Davis sideman and equally at home with bop, abstraction or fusion. Alongside Henderson, he bided his time with gentle fills ready to explode as the leader left the stand. The quartet makes a splendidly dislocated ensemble, pianist Rosnees' spidery technique and blue glissando adding another, more subdued, colour. She and Foster, who did use a great deal of stick, enjoyed some samba interplay, bumped along ably by Larry Grenadier, who had the unenviable job of replacing Haden. But Henderson is the focus of the unintroduced, gentle tunes and if he did take a while to get dug in, it was worth the wait.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "European Union </F> Ecofin Council To Debate Reduction of Taxes on Biofuels on 6  June--Creation of a Scientific Group in France"]    [Text] Brussels/Tours, 10 May 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) -- As  part of the first European Forum on Biofuels, the European  Commissioner with responsibility for taxation, Mrs Christiane  Scrivener, has announced that the Ecofin [Economic/Financial]  Council will examine the plan for a reduction of taxes on  biofuels at its meeting on 6 June.    Meanwhile, the French government has set up a scientific  group that will attempt to promote the development of biofuels  along with the concerned ministries (Industry, Environment,  Higher Education and Research, Agriculture and Fisheries),  announced Agriculture Minister Jean Puech, as he inaugurated the  Forum. The new group "Agriculture for Chemistry and Energy"  (Agrice), to be chaired by Philippe Mangin, brings together  representatives of the National Institute for Agronomic Research  (INRA), national agricultural trade unions and industry. Mr  Puech added that "the industries concerned by the future of our  agriculture, as well as potential customers for the technologies  being explored also wish to take part. Two major French  enterprises, Total and Rhone-Poulenc, are currently representing  these interests". France has chosen "an intelligent alternative  to traditional set-aside, namely, industrial set-aside", he  added.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: ALL COLD REMEDIES 'WORK' THE SAME -- THEY REALLY DON'T  </P> <P> It's a billion-dollar industry that flourishes on misery -- sniffles, sneezes  and sore throats. But despite the ads on television promising instant relief,  most cold remedies provide little more than smoke and mirrors.  </P> <P> Antihistamines are a mainstay of the runny nose market. But while they help  against allergies and hay fever, they are almost useless against the common  cold. The FDA has been asked to reject antihistamines for cold treatment, but  the agency has so far avoided the issue.  </P> <P> Pain killers like aspirin and acetaminophen are common ingredients in cold  remedies. Doubtless, ibuprofen will start showing up in the near future. But  are such drugs helpful against a cold?  </P> <P> In most cases the answer is no. Garden-variety colds are not generally  associated with aches and pains or high fevers. If you feel like you've been  hit by a truck, chances are you have the flu instead of a cold.  </P> <P> What about gargles, sprays and throat drops? None will cure a sore throat or  really do much to relieve inflammation, which is what causes the pain in the  first place. A salt water gargle (one-half teaspoon of salt in an 8-ounce  glass) may provide as much temporary relief as most lozenges.  </P> <P> Oral decongestants such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) and phenylpropanolamine  (PPA), found in Contac, Dimetapp and Alka-Seltzer Plus, can help a stuffy nose.  They tend to dry out the mouth and nasal passages in the process, though.  People with high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, prostate enlargement  or an overactive thyroid gland should probably avoid such products.  </P> <P> Nasal sprays that contain topical decongestants such as Afrin, Duration,  Otrivin or Neo-Synephrine are extremely effective and appear safer than oral  decongestants, but they can only be used for three days. After that you run the  risk of developing a dependency because when you stop spritzing your sinuses  the congestion returns worse than before.  </P> <P> So what should you do if you catch a cold? For one thing, stay home. The first  few days you will be the most contagious, so don't share it with everyone else.  </P> <P> Dr. Elliot Dick, one of the country's leading cold researchers, has become a  believer in massive doses of vitamin C. To get this vitamin into white blood  cells where it is needed he suggests several grams a day.  </P> <P> No matter what your favorite treatment -- chicken soup, vitamin C or every pill  and potion in the pharmacy -- your cold will probably go away in a week. And if  you take nothing at all it will likely last seven days.  </P></p>

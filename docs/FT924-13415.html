			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Republican attempt to discredit Clinton backfires THE LAST-DITCH Republican attempt to portray Governor Bill Clinton as a man incapable of telling the truth on anything was thrown severely off stride yesterday. The Washington Post reported that a senior State Department official had ordered the US Embassy in London to conduct an 'extremely thorough' search of its files for anything incriminatory in the Democratic candidate's life in the UK 23 years ago. Senator Al Gore, Mr Clinton's running-mate, alleged that Mr Bush was conducting 'a police state search for information' and was guilty of McCarthyism. Mr Dan Quayle, at his most combative in Tuesday night's vice-presidential debate, said he understood that the State Department official was only responding to Freedom of Information Act requests put in by the media. However, the newspaper quoted Mr Norbert Krieg, the US consul general in London, as saying that the cabled request two weeks ago, also sent to the Oslo embassy, was pressed the following day in a personal telephone call from Mrs Elizabeth Tamposi, assistant secretary of state for consular affairs. Mrs Tamposi, according to her biography, is a Republican political appointee. Mr Krieg said the London files were bare. Mrs Tamposi was said to be on 'personal leave', while the head of the Freedom of Information Act office at the department said files could not be let go without the written consent of the person under scrutiny. On Tuesday Mr Bush had denied Democratic charges of McCarthyism, but his campaign has been embarrassed by having to fire a low-level official who issued a press release alleging, without substantiation, Mr Clinton was under communist influence during the Vietnam war. In the debate, Mr Quayle gave a clear indication of the line of attack the president is expected to pursue in the next two presidential debates, starting tonight. Mr Clinton, he charged, was incapable of telling the truth, not only on the draft and what he did to protest against the Vietnam war, but also in every aspect of substantive policy. He accused Mr Gore of 'pulling a Clinton' in many of his interventions. He also claimed that Mr Gore was conspicuously unwilling to come to the defence of Mr Clinton's character. Mr Quayle's concluding words were: 'Do you trust Bill Clinton to be your president?' Mr Bush declared afterwards that his vice-president had 'hit a home run'. While engaging in some furious exchanges with the vice-president, in which both scored debating points, Mr Gore did his best to stick to the basic Democratic message, that the election is about the state of the economy. Instant polls found that Mr Gore might just have shaded Mr Quayle in the public eye. But hardly a soul thought that retired Admiral James Stockdale, Mr Ross Perot's running mate, had shown himself worthy of being the proverbial heartbeat away from the presidency, a perception which could damage the legitimacy of Perot's campaign. Apart from one or two pithy one liners, Mr Stockdale often seemed flustered, at a loss for words and painfully short of a knowledge of policy issues. Democrats seek to buck Baker mystique, Page 5</p>

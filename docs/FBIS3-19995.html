			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "df": "Wage Pact Negotiators Have Done Their </F> Job; Now the Bundesbank Has To Act"]    [Text] Duesseldorf, 8 Mar--The head of the German  Federation of Trade Unions, Michael Geuenich, characterized for  HANDELSBLATT the outcome of the metal and chemical industries  collective bargaining negotiations for 1994 "as a thunderclap  that should rouse those who make economic policy in Bonn and  fiscal policy at the Bundesbank from their inaction." The stance  of the Bundesbank, in particular, can no longer be justified on  economic grounds.    Signs are increasing in the Federal Republic that the  recession has not yet hit bottom. Industrial production in the  fourth quarter of 1993 was again 4 percent below last year's low  figure, and incoming orders also failed to reach the level of  last year's quarter. Because of the strong effect of losses,  caused in part by the government's economy measures and tax  increases, a further setback in the first quarter of 1994 cannot  be ruled out. This view is reenforced by even lower than  generally expected collective wage agreements, which will cause  revenues to decline more than anticipated.    Almost 12 months ago, industrial producer prices stopped  rising. In December 1993 they were 0.1 percent below the level  of 1992. Wholesale prices indicated complete stability. Even the  rate of retail price increases had only a 1 before the period.  Today, the rate of price increases in all of West Europe is the  lowest since the beginning of the nineties.    Geuenich: "Interest rates, nevertheless, continue to drop  much more slowly than they did in the United States when it was  in a similar economic situation, and much slower than in all  previous German downturns. The interest rate policy of the  European Union is chained to that of the German Bundesbank."    An imminent revival of investment activities is therefore  not  expected in Europe, especially since consumer confidence in  almost all countries is just as low as it is in Germany.  Therefore, since Europe is the center of the German export  trade, there is no hope for a lasting revival of the Federal  Republic's exports.    Geuenich: "The government and the Bundesbank never tire of  giving pedantic advice during ongoing wage negotiations. Whether  they like it or not, they are now caught in a cul-de-sac of  paralyzing inactivity. They can get out only by initiating  reassuring, expansive measures."  <H5>  Interest Rates Must Drop Quickly to Much Lower Levels </H5>   This clearly means that the Bundesbank must quickly allow  interest rates to drop considerably. The current discount rate,  which has a 5 in front of its period, used to be associated with  times of boom, but never with such a full-fledged recession as  we experience today. After all, because of the Bundesbank's  policy, the volume of consumer credits, current accounts, and  discount credits of roughly 500 billion German marks [DM] is  more expensive. The Bundesbank must act to remove this barrier  to demand. How can fear of inflation still be rampant in  Frankfurt when in almost all European countries, including  Germany, prices of goods not affected by the government do not  rise, but decline, and when capacity remains greatly  underutilized?    Nor can the Federal Government, according to Geuenich,  forever defend itself with the argument that it lacks fiscal  flexibility. Raising investment grants by, let us say, 10  percent for equipment and commercial construction investments,  provided the volume exceeds that of 1993, for example, would  reduce tax revenues by an estimated DM2.5 to 3 billion. The  Institute for Economic Research has determined that for 1992,  investment grants created 350,000 permanent jobs. Considering  the overall cost of DM42,000 for each unemployed worker, the  cited effect on the job market saved the public DM15 billion.    The Location Security Legislation passed a few months ago  cannot be accepted until doomsday as an alibi to demonstrate  that economic policy has been done justice. The Federal  Government and the Bundesbank talk incessantly about "investor  confidence." However, with their paralyzing inaction they,  themselves, are responsible for a climate of insecurity and  disincentives. Geuenich: "The trade unions are doing their duty  in an exemplary manner; now the pedants in Bonn and Frankfurt  have to make a move."    In contrast to the Federal Republic, the United States has  found a way to initiate its monetary and fiscal policy  successfully. A change in monetary policy toward expansion  occurred in the United States as early as the beginning of 1990,  just one year after the start of the recession. American  corporate investments for equipment showed a particularly strong  increase, and in 1992 and 1993 real growth exceeded 10 percent.  Financial policy, too, did not switch to consolidation until  early in 1993; in 1992 it still contributed heavily to the  stabilization of the recovery.</p>

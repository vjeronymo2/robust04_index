			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> COUNCIL WEIGHS METHOD OF SELECTING A MAYOR  </P> <P> A 3-2 majority of the City Council indicated support Tuesday for returning to  the system of choosing a mayor from among council members, but postponed a  decision on whether to put the issue before voters.  </P> <P> In 1974, Anaheim voters passed an amendment to the City Charter that provided  for the direct election of a mayor apart from the City Council. Under the  amendment, a council member must serve two years before becoming eligible to  run for mayor. Previously, the mayoral position had been rotated among the  council members.  </P> <P> The council took up the matter Tuesday because Aug. 11 is the deadline for  placing issues on November's special election ballot. Council members Thomas  Daly, Miriam Kaywood and Irv Pickler said they were inclined to support placing  the mayoral election issue on the ballot, but not until the city's Charter  Review Committee completes its report in the spring. Mayor Fred Hunter and  Councilman William D. Ehrle oppose changing the existing system.  </P></p>

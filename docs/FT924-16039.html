			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Blockleys profit and interim cut Blockleys, maker of bricks and paviors, is cutting the interim dividend from 1.95p to 0.5p as pre-tax profits were halved from Pounds 852,000 to Pounds 410,000 for the six months ended June 30. The group said there was, as yet, no prospect of any significant improvement in construction activity. Measures had been taken to reduce further its production this year by some 10 per cent. In the first half sales volume showed a 'reasonable improvement', but turnover slipped from Pounds 5.39m to Pounds 5.15m. Sales in the second half were not expected to increase over last year although sales of paviors, particularly to Germany, had grown rapidly to around 30 per cent of pavior sales. Earnings per share were down to 0.99p (2.3p).</p>

The puppet Army's mobile tank groups deployed in Chomwon-ri,  Paju County, Kyonggi Province, South Korea frantically conducted  land attack operation exercises aimed at the northward invasion  on that day in cooperation with the mechanized infantry outfits.  Large- caliber artillery units of the puppet Army moved in  Kajon-ri, Imje County, Kangwon Province, South Korea and assumed  a firing position against our side, agitating us extremely.    On the same day, the armed rascals of the puppet Army  occupied battle positions in Nosang-ri, Ogum-ri, and Yongsan-ri  in Paju County and fired at random some 1,000 shots of  large-caliber machine guns and automatic rifles.    Meanwhile, some 10 armed helicopters and transport  helicopters of the puppet Army moved out in the skies above  Yonchon and Pochon of Kyonggi Province and Chorwon County of  Kangwon Province, South Korea, and frantically conducted  exercises of supporting land units, dropping special attack  corps, and supplying operation equipment in the air, while  flying at low and very low altitudes.    All these facts prove that the South Korean puppets are  running toward confrontation and war and running counter to  peace and detente.</p>

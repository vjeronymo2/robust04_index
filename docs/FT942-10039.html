			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Airsprung sees static outcome Directors of Airsprung Furniture, Britain's second largest bed maker, said yesterday that they were expecting profits for the 12 months to end-March to be similar to the previous year's record Pounds 6m pre-tax. That figure, however, was below average market expectations and the company's shares fell 10p to 235p. Directors blamed the expected standstill on a poor performance by the main offshoot in the upholstery division. Nevertheless, they intend a 6 per cent increase in the total dividend.</p>

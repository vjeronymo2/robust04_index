			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Special agent licensed to listen and learn from industry: The Bank of England official responsible for economic information-gathering ALAN WATSON takes off his glasses, cocks his head, poses a meticulously framed question and listens intently. It is a pose he repeats hundreds of times a year in the course of gathering information about economic conditions from top industrialists. Mr Watson is the most senior of nine people employed by the Bank of England throughout Britain to form contacts with the business world. The ideas they come up with - from a network comprising some 3,600 companies - are fed each month to the Bank's headquarters and shared with the Treasury. Mr Watson acts as its 'regional agent' in north-west England, taking in Greater Manchester, and parts of Lancashire, Derbyshire, Cheshire and Staffordshire. The head of a 60-strong Bank branch in Manchester his main task is searching for economic insights. He combines this with arranging contacts for companies and providing a sympathetic ear to recession-hit executives. Reports on the 20 or so companies Mr Watson visits each month are dictated into a tape recorder as he drives between appointments. The reports form the basis for his seven-page study of economic conditions in the north-west sent monthly to Mr Mike Smith, the Bank official in London who co-ordinates the regional agents' work. Mr Smith translates the prose of Mr Watson and the other agents into a five-page, confidential 'national summary' of UK business conditions. Together with the latest economic statistics and evidence from business surveys, the summary is fed to a small group of Bank and Treasury officials for briefing Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on economic developments. With the government having been wrongfooted on several occasions during the recession about the speed of recovery, the Bank and Treasury are examining the regional reports increasingly closely for clues as to how close Britain is getting to sustainable growth. The Treasury, while stopping short of establishing as wide ranging a set of company contacts as the Bank, is trying to learn more about conditions in industry, mainly through a series of company visits for top officials. Much of Mr Watson's time is taken by visits to companies and lunches and dinners with industrialists. Through such contacts he believes he finds out about nearly all the important events at the 400 or so companies with which he is in contact. Mr Watson has no formal training as an economist, spending most of his Threadneedle Street career in departments dealing with banking and management training. But in discussions he turns his hand to conveying the formal Bank views about such things as how much inflation is working through the economy. The general conclusion from his recent visits to companies - and supported by the monthly reports from the other eight Bank agents - is that a fragile recovery has started. Yet it could be stifled by events such as further economic contraction in continental Europe. A broad assessment is given by Mr Peter Foden, chairman of the Cheshire-based ERF truckmaker: 'The economy is healthier than it was, but it's a long way from going mad.' Mr Watson has to work hard at keeping the confidence of the companies he talks to. The reports he sends to the Bank's head office do not discuss individual companies by name. 'I try to probe but not embarrass,' he says. Mr Watson's general knowledge about the region - and his links with commercial banking and the Treasury - are appreciated by contacts such as Mr Peter Jones, chairman of the Emerson housebuilding group in Alderley Edge, Cheshire. 'I use Alan as a sounding board,' says Mr Jones. Another fan is Mr John Waldron, chairman of Kratos, a Manchester-based maker of scientific instruments. 'He's plugged into the (business) network in the north-west and speaks his mind clearly.'</p>

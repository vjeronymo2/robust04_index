			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DUARTE;  </P> <P> GAS STATION PERMIT REJECTED  </P> <P> Citing increased traffic, noise and safety problems, the City Council  unanimously denied a permit request for a 24-hour Arco gas station and  mini-market at the southwest corner of Buena Vista Street and Duarte Road, in  an area zoned for apartment buildings and houses.  </P> <P> The council's decision Tuesday came after an hour-long public hearing during  which residents spoke both for and against the proposed Arco station.  </P> <P> Those in favor said the station and mini-market would provide a convenient  place for residents to shop. Those against, including Duarte Unified School  District officials, said the station would be an "attractive nuisance,"  creating traffic, noise and loitering.  </P></p>

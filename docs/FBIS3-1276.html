So says ANC [African National Congress] Secretary  General Cyril Ramaphosa. Either the TEC should take  administrative control of KwaZulu or it should adopt a military  choice of deploying a combined security force in the region to  defend polling stations.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Ami Nanackchand] Speaking  at  an election rally at Phoenix, north of Durban, Mr. Ramaphosa  said the TEC was determined to go ahead with the elections even  though there was resistance from some quarters to the first  nonracial poll. He said the TEC had an obligation to protect  the taxpayer from threats to his right to vote.    [Ramaphosa] And this the Transitional Executive Council must  do. If we don't do that, then it will have failed in its task  of making sure that elections do take place on a free and fair  basis in Natal, and we do have the SADF [South African Defense  Force], and the South African Police, and we have the National  Peacekeeping Force, and those forces will just have to come to  the defense of the people, to come to the defense of democracy,  to come to the defense of the election process. And if  Buthelezi does not like it, then tough luck for him. He is in  big trouble. [end recording]</p>

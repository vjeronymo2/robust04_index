			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a military source, on 5 May the U.S.  imperialists staged a provocative nocturnal aerial surprise  strike exercise over the sea aimed at a Northward invasion.  This frantic war exercise was staged on a large scale, which  was waged in the air over the sea off Kangnung from around 1900  to around 2200, using pursuit-assault planes and vertical  takeoff and landing assault plane squadrons from U.S. Pacific  area bases; and fighter bombers, assault planes, and observation  planes of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea.    E-3 early warning planes serving as an aerial flight command  post, which had flown into U.S. occupation Air Force bases in  South Korea prior to this war exercise, directed a comprehensive  command of the aircraft mobilized for aerial surprise strike  exercises over the sea, flying around in the air over the  operational area on that night.    This war exercise was like playing with fire aimed at  increasing the capabilities for actual warfare for nocturnal  aerial surprise strikes over the sea for a Northward invasion  under the command of E-3 early warning planes.    In the meantime, two KC-135 refueling planes from an  overseas  base were mobilized in the air over the sea off Kunsan that  night for a double flight over Anma Island and Woeyon Island,  conducting midair refueling for several tens of fighter bombers,  assault planes, and observation planes mobilized for the  nocturnal aerial war exercise.    This war maneuver fully reveals that the U.S. imperialists  are recklessly running amok to realize their attempt to launch a  surprise aerial preemptive strike against the Northern part of  the Republic.</p>

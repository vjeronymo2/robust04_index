Kolesov] </F>   [Text] Today the United States is completing work on  creating the Advanced Combat Direction System (ACDS) for surface  ships. Its variant--the ACDS Block 1, being developed by a  scientific research subdivision of the surveillance and command  and control center in San Diego, California--underwent testbed  trials in early 1992 at a special coastal combat information  center using an extensive simulator of reflecting targets to  check the capabilities and reliability of the system. In order  to conduct sea trials of the ACDS, Block 1 is to be installed  aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70).    The new ACDS has three loops, each of which embodies the  principle of similar source integration (SSI): Sonar environment  [SE] SSI; radar environment [RE] SSI; and electronic environment  [EE] SSI.    Like previous systems, the ACDS Block 1 is intended  primarily  for air defense; however, it possesses a significantly increased  range of operation, a higher degree of automation, and higher  level of target tracking. The system provides for the capability  of changing and correcting software both in the process of sea  trials and during future operation in the fleet. Although the  ACDS was developed for aircraft carriers, it also can be  installed aboard amphibious warfare ships and cruisers.    The EE SSI loop is the main element of the entire system of  electronic support of battle groups. Thanks to it, electronic  intelligence [ELINT] sets and electronic environment channels of  electronic warfare [EW] systems will be able to operate  together, which will make it possible to create a single picture  of the tactical situation for the battle group commanders. And  although the EE SSI loop was combined for the first time with  other loops in the new ACDS, in the future it is planned to  include it in all combat direction systems in the fleet.    This loop will accomplish exchange over digital  communications channels with information sources, triangulation,  and tracking of radiating electronic systems and their platforms  on a real-time basis; compare the results with returns from the  radar and IFF system; classify the radiating targets; eliminate  information that does not match; and display the tactical  situation on displays of the battle group units. This will make  electronic detection a completely automated process, changing  the very view of building a picture of the electronic  environment.    The EE SSI loop is designed to automatically connect the  bearing line to the radiating electronic system and the  parametric outputs of information sources. The latter may be  ELINT sets and electronic environment channels of EW systems,  such as the WLR-1H, SLQ-32 and SLQ-17 (installed on aircraft  carriers), SLQ-32 and WLQ-16 (on cruisers, destroyers, and  frigates), ALQ-142 (on SH-60B Seahawk helicopters), ALR-66 (on  P-3C Orion aircraft), ALR-76 and ULQ-20 (on S-3B and ES-3A  Viking carrier-based aircraft), and ALR-73 (on E-2C Hawkeye  carrier-based airborne early warning [AEW] aircraft).    The S-3B and P-3C aircraft can exchange information with  surface ships both directly and via E-2C AEW aircraft, but the  SH-60 helicopters and ES-3A aircraft can do so only with their  own ship platform. Surface ships also receive information from  ELINT satellites and enter it into the system.    The EE SSI is designed to use the Link-16 jamming-resistant,  high-capacity, digital communications line, which is part of the  JTIDS (Joint Tactical Information Distribution System) system.  Link-16 provides information to a special subnet for exchange of  commands and reports on the electronic environment. Tactical  units of a battle group and its supporting aircraft tied into  this system can receive a picture of the overall situation  generated by the EE SSI loop of the flag ship and supplement it  with their own data, regardless of whether or not their loop has  wide capabilities. Using the new target data processing  equipment, the control station officer will be able to provide a  single electronic image to all Link-16 subscribers.    The same processes occur on the Link-16 digital  communications line as on the Link-11, but with greater accuracy  and intensity. In order to increase the efficiency of the EE SSI  loop, in 1989 NATO experts approved changes in the standard  messages of the EE subnet of the Link-16 line.    The loop operates in the following manner. With receipt of  the sum total of bearing lines from the information sources and  also data on frequency, pulse spacing, and pulse scanning period  in the system, they are first compared to one another and then  with radar returns. This process is automated and controlled  using a computer. When the next report from an information  source comes into the system, it determines if a corresponding  report is in the system. If there is, the computer identifies  the bearing lines and marks the radiating electronic system at  their intersection, which is then compared to the radar return.  If there is no corresponding report in the system, the loop  compares the bearing line to the radiating source with the radar  return, simultaneously continuing select a pair. These processes  proceed continuously, so a return from a radiating target can be  formed, for example, from a single bearing line taken at a great  distance into a moving areas of probable target locations  (ellipse). It can then supplemented by a second and third  bearing line taken from the same or a different source, compared  with the newly appeared radar return, and return to the starting  position of the bearing line, when the supporting forces have  lost electronic contact (their tracking is done according to  radar data), or continue to exist in the system, even if there  is no radar contact. Under certain conditions, for example, if  the enemy is not using restrictions in the operation of  electronic systems, the EE SSI loop can display the tactical  situation without turning on the radar.    It must be re-emphasized that the EE SSI loop accomplishes  the comparison of bearing lines based on measured parameters and  not on the results of classification of radiation sources, which  may be presented later. In other words, two intersecting bearing  lines having the same frequency, pulse spacing, and scanning  period will be connected automatically by the loop regardless of  whether or not the appropriate classification data are in the  computer memory. The design of the question contains a postulate  that a false association is worse than missing an association.  If the pair does not coincide accurately enough according to the  measured parameters, an association will not occur and the  bearing lines will not be connected. The decisions by the  computer, just like those by a person, may be incorrect;  therefore, the loop's software provides for the capability of  operator intervention in the into the computer operations to  change manually the target classification and identification  results.    Each mark of a radiating electronic system, based on one or  several bearing lines, is processed by a Kalman filter, which  with the passage of time "clears up" the assumed position of the  radiating source. Measurement of the bearings does not have to  be simultaneous in order to receive a good result. Subscribers  may transmit data about the electronic environment quickly or  slowly, depending on the situation, without special coordination  of their actions. The operator recording the mark of the  radiating target on the display can see how the size of the  areas of possible target location will decrease as additional  bearings are received from the information sources, and the  heading and speed of the radiating source gradually stabilizes,  nearing the actual value. Despite the fact that the Kalman  filter works more effectively with a large number of incoming  reports, the target movement elements can be analyzed when just  one subscriber reports on the radiating target.    The EE SSI loop plays the primary role in the process of  classifying ungrouped radiating targets in the ACDS Block 1. The  parametric data of each return of a radiating electronic system  are compared with the parameters in the computer memory, as a  result of which a listing of possible radiation sources is  produced. It is very rare that just one source is given, since  the ranges of the parameters of the various electronic systems  overlap considerably.    For each class of radiation sources there exists a set of  probable platforms on which it can be installed. If several  radiating electronic systems are detected at one point in space,  the potential adversary is located at the spot of intersection  of the lists of probable platforms of each of them. Data on  target speed and altitude from the RE SSI loop are also used to  reduce the list of possible platforms. The computer calculates  the likelihood of the existence of each class of targets.    The ACDS Block 1 and its EE SSI operate in close  interconnection with other systems. The sets of data from  information sources, according to which they make the decisions,  and the decisions themselves circulate over the JTIDS  communications system with other ships. The easy-to-understand  picture of the overall environment generated by the ACDS of the  flag ship is transmitted to each ship without the aid of the  costly installation of the ACDS.    In addition to the problem of creating a combined picture of  the overall environment for ships of the battle group, the  following problem causes difficulty for American experts: How to  avoid unnecessary duplication of primary information being  received by tactical units where the situation analysis is done,  which may arise due to the great spatial multichanneling in the  digital communications line. This is particularly important when  analyzing the electronic environment where the time sequence of  data being received plays an determining role. American experts  see the solution to the problem in changing the standard  messages being transmitted over the Link-16 channels, which was  discussed above, and also in ensuring a single target numbering  system both for tactical units of the group and for supporting  forces.    When an operation on one of the ships of the group  intervenes  in the operations of the computer and does the association  manually, the same thing automatically takes place on the other  ships, too. Such a decision is due to the fact that each ship  has tracking data which is not entered into its circuit, but is  integrated into its local picture. The information received from  its own sources is more complete and has a higher confidence  level than that transmitted from distant sources.    American experts believe that it is impossible to ensure a  completely identical picture of the tactical situation on each  ship of the group, but it is realistic to receive a combined  picture. To do this, it is necessary to distribute the duties  beforehand among those involved in the search. One reports only  radio frequencies, another the pulse spacing, and still another  the scanning period. Manual and automated information sources  operate together in order to produce an artificial uniform  product for relay to other subscribers. Manual sensors are used  to divide up the parameters to be transmitted, and automated  sensors are used to divide up the search sectors. One merit of  the EE SSI loop is the fact that any variants of distributing  duties is suitable for it.    As is noted in the Western press, detection of battle groups  using electronic assets today is considerably more effective  than using radar assets. In particular, it notes the  disproportion of efforts expended by servicing personnel on  analyzing the electronic environment and the results obtained.  Even on the newest ships of the fleet, displaying the electronic  environment is a process that requires intensive manual labor  and constant attention of the operator. Combat direction system  operators must carefully compare the bearing lines by time and  identify them with radar returns, and the signals often  disappear before this work is finished. American experts believe  that taking two bearings from different units with a rigid base  (now totally at the initiative of the personnel), is a waste of  time. It is impossible to accomplish such actions without  coordinating over radiotelephone communications. In addition,  operators know that only important information is worth the  considerable efforts, and if a mistake is made in target  classification, such a report will evoke obvious displeasure  among the rest of those involved in analyzing the situation.  Therefore, today personnel rarely use Link-11 for transmitting  data on the electronic environment. Operators aboard Orion,  Hawkeye, and Viking aircraft supporting a battle group also  rarely report these data for the same reasons, although they  have ELINT sets with good capabilities aboard the aircraft. An  exception to this is the SH-60B Seahawk LAMPS-3 helicopter,  which uses the ALQ-142 ELINT set to generate a continuous flow  of bearings for detection of radiating sources. They are shown  on displays of the ship platform, where the bearings are  intersected with bearings of the onboard SLQ-32. American  experts believe that such a fully automated exchange between the  two units should be accomplished at the battle group level using  the EE SSI loop.    The exchange of data on the electronic environment must be  done at a pace that makes it possible to assess the dynamics of  target movement. This work cannot be done manually, especially  in conditions of sailing in coastal areas and in areas of heavy  navigation, when dozens of air and surface targets are in the  battle group's surveillance zone.    Development of the principle of integrating similar sources  makes one look in a new way at certain concepts in electronic  warfare. The word "return," which had only a simple radar  meaning, is presented in the ACDS Block 1 actually as a  "multi-return." It consists of connected intermediate returns of  short- and long-range radars, identification systems, the EE  loop, and sonar returns. Operators must clearly imagine the  structure of this process, otherwise an incorrect identification  will be difficult to recognize and correct. If people and  systems such as the ACDS never made mistakes in combining,  comparing, and classifying targets, the operator would not have  to imagine all the particular features of the process of target  processing by the EE loop. However, mistakes are inevitable and,  in the opinion of American experts, servicing personnel must  have the opportunity to correct them until the data corresponds  to reality.    Automation of the process of collecting and processing data  on the electronic environment will enable operators to analyze  the values which they observe. Tactical units will be able to  report intercepted bearings for the EE SSI loop, enable other to  make decisions on their comparison, or do this themselves. It is  necessary to observe just one technical condition: To exchange  data over the Link-16 line.    It is believed that electronic surveillance and tracking  must  become as fully automated and integrated a process (within the  battle group) as radar surveillance is today.</p>

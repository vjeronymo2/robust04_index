			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Yesterday, deputies approved a draft  bill authorizing the National Congress and not the Executive  Branch to make any modifications to the customs valuation  factor. Congress President Carlos Flores Facusse himself  presented the draft bill to the legislators, and he immediately  appointed an advisory commission for its approval.    Flores Facusse explained that according to Article 205 No.  35  of the Constitution, only the National Congress is empowered to  assess taxes and contributions, as well as public expenses.  Nevertheless, Article 3 under Decree 18-90, better known as the  "swindle package," instituted by former President Rafael  Leonardo Callejas, states the customs valuation factor, when  applied in the calculation of duty tariffs on imports, exports,  and other assessments, modifies tariffs and the budget,  therefore this factor must be approved by the National Congress  beforehand.    Flores Facusse said the effects of an increase in the  customs  valuation factor are mostly negative for most of the Honduran  population because it not only increases the cost of finished  products, but raw materials, intermediate products, and capital  goods as well. On 3 March 1990, he proposed that Article 3 of  Decree 18-90 be modified by adding a final paragraph that says:  "any modification to the customs valuation factor requires prior  National congress approval."    After Flores Facusse read the draft bill, he appointed an  advisory commission composed of Alberto Rencoco, Maria de la Paz  Rivera, Marco Antonio Andino, Soad Salomon de Facusse, and  Johnny Handal. Flores Facusse hesitated for a moment as he did  not know whether to call a recess or adjourn for the day.  Finally, he decided to call a 20-minute recess, which actually  lasted for almost an hour, to allow the advisory commission time  to express its opinion regarding the project Flores himself has  presented.  <H5>  The Decision </H5>   The members of the advisory commission stated their points  of  view and recommended the draft be approved as presented by  Flores Facusse. Among other considerations, they said that when  Decree 18-90 was approved, it established that import taxes,  included in the Import-Export Tariff and other such taxes, would  be determined after converting the value in foreign exchange to  its equivalent in lempiras and applying a valoration factor  based on the exchange rate set periodically by the Central Bank.  The text of Article 3, however, does not say who the competent  authority is to set the customs valuation factor. The board of  directors of the Central Bank can only set the currency exchange  rate.    Additionally, when the valuation factor is set or increased,  there is also a change in the taxes applied to imports and  exports. This, of course, becomes an increase in revenues which  modifies the General Revenue and Expense Budget in the form of  revenue and taxation from imports and exports. Both of these  changes can only be made by the National Congress.    When the session resumed and just before the draft was to be  discussed for the first time, Santiago David Amador, the leader  of the Liberal Party faction, presented a motion to approve the  draft in one session, eliminating the other two. He said this  would benefit the majority of the Honduran people. "This is a  political National Congress, friendly yet not submissive. It is  different from previous years; it will not approve everything  the executive branch sends," he stressed after warning that  "these are gentle warnings."    When it came time to vote, the only ones who did not raise  their hand were Liberal Party deputies Gautama Fonseca and Fredy  Miralda. Fonseca said he had privately told Flores Facusse his  opinion, which he preferred not to present to the plenum.  Miranda said this had been a hasty decision.    In order for the text of the decree to be final, Facusse  appointed a Style Commission composed of Hector Ramon Trochez,  Donaldo Reyes Alvear, and Sandoval Cabrera. The National  Congress president then closed the session and called another  session for yesterday afternoon, basically to ratify the minutes  of the morning session.    Although the session was scheduled for 1430, it was actually  called to order at 1600 [2200 GMT]. During the debates, several  deputies commented that this was an attempt to strip President  Carlos Roberto Reina of part of his powers. Flores Facusse,  meanwhile, left the hall using a tunnel that leads straight to  his office and called a surprise news conference.    Reaction to the National Congress' decision came after a new  adjustment to the customs valuation factor went into effect on  Tuesday. The factor was increased from 6.2 lempiras to the  dollar to 7.27. The decree has no effect unless it is published  in the Gazette. When they try to modify the valuation factor,  the National Congress will have to give the final approval.    The Treasury Ministry has been responsible for setting the  customs valuation factor since July, and before that it was the  Central Bank.</p>

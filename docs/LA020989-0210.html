			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NO CAPITAL GAINS CUT: ROSTENKOWSKI;  </P> <P> WAYS AND MEANS CHAIRMAN ASKS 'REALISTIC' APPROACH  </P> <P> Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,  today promised all-out opposition to President Bush's proposal to reduce the  tax on capital gains.  </P> <P> "I'm not about to tell the wage earners in Chicago that they should pay a  higher tax than stockbrokers," Rostenkowski said in a speech to the National  Press Club.  </P> <P> "I personally will strongly resist any efforts to undo (the 1986) tax reform,  including the return to a preferential tax rate for capital gains,"  Rostenkowski said.  </P> <P> He spoke eight hours before Bush was to deliver a package of budget  recommendations that was expected to include a call for lower taxes on capital  gains, which are profits from the sale of stocks, real estate and other assets.  </P> <P> There is strong support in Congress, principally among Republicans but even  among some Democratic liberals, for taxing capital gains at a lower rate than  applies to wages and other income. Capital gains and most other income now are  taxed at rates of either 15%, 28% or 33%.  </P> <P> Seventy percent of capital gains are taken by people with incomes above  $100,000 a year.  </P> <P> Rostenkowski sounded another familiar theme at the press club: Despite Bush's  campaign pledges, any realistic plan for reducing the budget deficit must  include tax increases, he said.  </P> <P> "If President Bush is willing to put all spending and revenues on the table, he  will find a Congress willing to make the tough choices that real deficit  reduction requires," he said.  </P> <P> The veteran lawmaker said that former President Ronald Reagan also made a  no-tax pledge but that during his eight years in office, "Reagan raised more  taxes than any peacetime President." Reagan signed more than a dozen tax  increases.  </P> <P> Rostenkowski said the 1990 budget left by Reagan was based on highly optimistic  projections on how the economy will perform.  </P> <P> "Does anyone really believe that real growth will be 3.2% this year? Or  inflation at 3.8%? Or short-term interest rates at 6.3%?" Rostenkowski asked.  "Those are the numbers in the last Reagan budget.  </P> <P> "I hope I don't see them in President Bush's budget. I don't want to raise  taxes, but I won't participate in a sham."  </P></p>

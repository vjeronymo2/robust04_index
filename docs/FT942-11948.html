			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Decoupling hopes face another test Hopes for a decoupling of UK equities from global bond markets will be put to the test again this week in a confused-looking stock market. Market strategists are asking why, with increased dividends appearing on all sides, with investors and even the Confederation of British Industries more relaxed on the base rate outlook, with inflation subdued and the market alive with bid speculation, equities cannot perform better. 'Above all else, equities need gilt market stability,' commented Edmond Warner at Kleinwort Benson Securities. This is easier said than done, in a market which can still move through a range of more than 1 per cent because the European and US bond markets remember that the Federal Reserve may tighten credit again soon. From this point of view, there are at least some signs of a change of step. On Friday, equities remained relatively steady in spite of overnight weakness in the US, at least until the sudden excitement in the dollar pushed all other considerations into the background and put the Federal bond market back in the driving seat. Kleinwort Benson remains cautious on the influence on equities cast by the bond markets, which Mr Warner believes relates to the re-rating of future dividend flows following the dramatic fall in bond yields during the recession; the problem was compounded by disappointing corporate earnings. He fears that equities may be 'condemned' to a long period of consolidation while investor portfolios readjust and warns that, even if decoupling is on the way, the transition could be painful. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett suspects that bonds and equities could begin to decouple this week if, as expected, the local elections deliver a drubbing to Mr John Major's government. This could put sterling under pressure, warns Strauss, and that scenario has historically seen equities rising while bonds fall. The markets have been slow to discount the political factor. The setback in bond markets has been another adverse factor for property shares. The sector has shown a relative decline of 6 per cent since mid-March as stock market investors have stubbornly refused to believe in a recovery in property shares. But BZW, warning that while rental growth prospects remain weak the sector cannot decouple from bond yields, continues to urge clients to be underweight in the property sector. BZW is still highly negative on the outlook for UK office property which is underperforming retail and industrial property and likely to continue to do so, according to BZW's Mr David Nighy. He identifies a problem of over-renting in London and the South-east and believes the sector still under-rates the significance of obsolescence in valuing properties. The UK investment bank sees Asda Property Holdings showing attractive net asset value on the back of strong 1993 capital growth rates on both its retail and industrial holdings.</p>

"The Chinese Communists are aggressively building up their  arsenals and have never renounced their intent on the use of  force against Taiwan," Chien said in an interview carried in the  weekly's Jan. 22 issue released Thursday [20 January].    Beijing's unwillingness to renounce military action against  Taiwan provides the rationale for Taipei's continued need of a  strong deterrent capability, Chien noted.    He also pointed out that Beijing's constant suppression of  the ROC's international activities and its attempt to stop the  world community from selling defensive weapons to Taiwan have  pushed many Taiwan residents to lean more and more towards a  total break in relations with the mainland.    "The Chinese Communist regime has since its inception gone  all out to suppress and squeeze US out of the international  community," Chien said. "Ever since we declared our intention to  participate in the United Nations, Beijing has become even more  adamant in its attempts to downgrade our status and evade  reality."    Chien stressed that the ROC Government will dedicate all its  efforts to expand room for diplomatic maneuver and build up  friendly support in the international community.    "We will also, in coordination with our mainland policy,  urge  the Chinese Communists to squarely face the objective fact that  the nation is divided and ruled by two different governments,  and that we must support each other in the international arena  while working together for reunification," Chien noted.    Prior to national reunification, Chien said, the basic  rights  of the 20.8 million ROC citizens should not be ignored.    He said the ROC has launched a campaign to end its long  stretch of international isolation. Key elements of this drive  include efforts to gain membership to the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade, the United Nations and the ASEAN regional  forum.    Chien further pointed out that Beijing's staunch opposition  to the political reforms package brought out by Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten clearly shows that the Chinese Communists  will not allow Hong Kong people to enjoy full political freedom  after 1997.    "Therefore we firmly believe that Beijing's `One Country,  Two  Systems' policy towards Hong Kong should never be carried out  here, nor should such a policy ever be taken as the model for  China's reunification," Chien added.</p>

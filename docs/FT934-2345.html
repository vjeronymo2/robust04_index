			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark edges lower The D-Mark rose in early dealings as hopes that the Bundesbank might cut interest rates this week faded. However, it slipped later to finish slightly weaker against the US dollar and some European currencies, writes Conner Middelmann. The German currency received an early lift from a report in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily newspaper that the Bundesbank's central bank council is not planning to lower official interest rates on Thursday - its last meeting of the year. Citing an unnamed central bank source, the paper said the Bundesbank had made clear by setting securities repurchase agreements at a fixed rate of 6 per cent until January 5 that there would be no more interest rate cuts before the year-end. There has been some speculation that the Bundesbank may lower its 5.75 per cent discount rate and 6.75 per cent Lombard rate at the meeting. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, said last week that the policy-making body would discuss the M3 money supply growth target for 1994 at this week's meeting. He also said that next year's M3 target is likely to be close to this year's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent range. According to a poll of private economists conducted by Reuters, the Bundesbank is widely expected to set an unchanged or slightly lower target. The German overnight rate tightened slightly amid the outflow of monthly tax payments. Call money was changing hands at around 6.10 per cent, up from around 6.05 per cent on Friday. The March three-month Euromark interest-rate contract on the Liffe eased by 0.05 point to 94.52 on strong volume on fading hopes for a rate reduction this week. The dollar traded around DM1.6950 early in the day, but strengthened on late short-covering to reach a high of DM1.7065. It ended at DM1.7050, up from DM1.6990 at Friday's close. In New York it finished at DM1.7080. Most traders expect the US currency to remain in a relatively narrow trading range between DM1.69 and DM1.73 until the year-end. The D-Mark also weakened against the French franc, although traders reported few flows and said that volume was thin. The French franc strengthened within its former narrow ERM fluctuation band against the D-Mark to a high of FFr3.421, before ending at FFr3.422, up from FFr3.424 on Friday. The Bank of France left its 6.20 per cent intervention rate unchanged at its latest open-market operation, injecting FFr9.8bn of liquidity into the money market. The Belgian franc closed at BFr20.94 to the D-Mark, down from BFr20.91 on Friday. The Danish krone finished at DKr3.923 per D-Mark, slipping from Friday's DKr3.913, while the Italian lira weakened in volatile trade to L989.4 from Friday's L985.8 close. The pound firmed against the D-Mark but lost some ground to the dollar. It closed at DM2.5425, up from a previous DM2.5400. Against the dollar, sterling ended at Dollars 1.4905, down from Dollars 1.4950. The latest UK price data, indicating continued low inflation pressures, rekindled hopes of further interest rate reductions but did little to weaken the pound. Industrial output in October rose 0.7 per cent, while manufacturing output was up 0.1 per cent, largely in line with market expectations. The short sterling futures contract reflected continued expectations of another near-term base rate cut. The March contract gained 4 basis points at 94.96, while the December contract, which expires tomorrow, was unchanged at 94.64. Traders are eyeing tomorrow's release of the November retail price index and November retail sales data for further clues on the inflation picture and the outlook for UK interest rates. 'There is a feeling that Wednesday could be the (Bank of England's) window of opportunity, if the numbers are good,' said a London money dealer. The market median forecast for RPI (ex-mortgage interest payments) is for an unchanged 2.8 per cent year-on-year. Retail sales are expected to have increased by 0.2 per cent on the month and by 3.6 per cent on the year. The sterling money market was relatively tight, traders said. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of around Pounds 1.65bn in the morning, and in early operations purchased bills totalling Pounds 1bn for resale to the market on January 4 at an interest rate of 5 13/32 per cent. In further operations, the Bank bought bills amounting to Pounds 222m at 5 3/8 per cent, followed by Pounds 42m of bills at the same rate in the afternoon. It provided late assistance of around Pounds 400m. The Japanese yen was little changed against the dollar, but observers said it is likely to continue its weakening trend against the US currency in coming months. It ended at Y108.95 to the dollar, up mildly from Y109.15 on Friday. It closed at Y108.98 in New York. With the Japanese economy all but ground to a halt, Mr Tony Baron, chief strategist at PaineWebber in London, is calling for continued sharp interest rate cuts by the Bank of Japan to stimulate growth. Mr Baron expects the 1.75 per cent official discount rate to be reduced to at least 1 per cent, if not lower. Moreover, as the US economy picks up and the Federal Reserve shifts towards a tightening bias, he expects the yen to drop to Y112 by the end of January and as low as Y125 by the end of 1994.</p>

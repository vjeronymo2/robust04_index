It also analyzed the impact of tax reform on  production and opertaion of Qinghai enterprises.    The State Council decided to introduce tax reform throughout  the country beginning 1 January this year. It is a  comprehensive and overall structural reform. The purpose of  this reform is to establish a new taxation system which  corresponds with China's national conditions and international  practice, gives expression to market economic demands, is  beneficial to macrocontrol and regulation, and is favorable to  economic development. To ensure the smooth implementation of  the new taxation system in Qinghai, taxation departments in the  province have run many training courses since October last year  for taxation cadres, factory directors and managers, as well as  financial and taxation personnel. These training courses have  enabled most taxation cadres to understood the importance of the  current taxation system reform and the main content of this  reform.    Now a new taxation system is being implemented. Because the  current taxation system reform involves a wide range of work and  is being carried out on a large scale, taxation departments in  the province have conducted propaganda among the people. But  some people still think that the introduction of this new  measure will cause price hikes. Some individual traders have  also raised their commodity prices, and this has caused  unhealthy results.    A person in charge of the provincial taxation bureau  explained: The current taxation system reform is mainly aimed at  adjusting the tax structure, but the overall tax rate is not  rising. In a socialist market economy, organizing revenue for  the state still remains the most important and basic task. As  the state is facing financial difficulties at present,  delegating powers to the lower levels and allowing more profit  retention for them are difficult to avoid. Therefore taxation  system reform is conducive to strengthening the central  authorities' macrocontrol and regulatory ability and is  beneficial to increasing the two proportions [expansion unknown].    The current taxation system reform will, in varying degrees,  cause a change in the composition of tax sources and revenues.  To put it more specifically, revenues will change between tax  categories, revenues in different tax categories will increase  or decrease, and taxation rates in different trades will also  increase or decrease. Naturally, taxation rates in different  enterprises will increase or decrease, too. All these are  normal, and this kind of structural adjustment is inevitable.  Merging some old tax categories, adopting some new tax  categories, and reforming some of the existing tax categories so  that categories and sources will change and tax collections from  different trades will also change are structural adjustments  which will not affect the total volume of taxation. Therefore,  taken as a whole, the total volume of taxation will not  increase, thus, enterprises' tax burden will not increase,  either.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: Debts push Vard deeper into the red Vard, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, yesterday reported substantially heavier losses for 1993 with a pre-tax deficit of NKr361.04m (Dollars 48.75m), against NKr229.47m a year earlier. Vard blamed its debt burden on a substantially weaker performance by Kloster Cruise, its cruise unit, and heavier foreign currency losses. Group operating profit rose to NKr568.86m from NKr459.33m. Revenue increased to NKr7.3bn from NKr5.47bn, but operating expenses swelled to NKr6.24bn from NKr4.67bn following a jump in depreciation to NKr494m from NKr341m. Vard charged net financial items and foreign currency losses of NKr841.73m against NKr589.38m in charges the previous year. Miami-based Kloster Cruise said net contributions from the ships in its fleet rose to Dollars 294m from Dollars 248m in the previous year, but that financial expenses had increased to Dollars 89.1m from Dollars 56.3m. Net losses, before currency adjustments and other items, more than tripled to Dollars 19.5m from Dollars 6.4m. Kloster's Norwegian Cruise Line's load factor for 1993 was very satisfactory, Vard said, and surpassed the previous year. However, prices achieved were not sufficient to compensate fully for larger interest costs and depreciations. Royal Viking Line's load factor was unchanged but prices fell due to stronger competition. Royal Cruise Line improved load factors and prices, but this was undermined by maintenance and repair costs. A plan to sell Royal Cruise and Royal Viking for Dollars 565m fell through earlier this year. The ferry division saw net profits plunge to NKr78.6m from NKr123.7m, despite a rise in operating income to NKr772.6m from NKr672.8m. Operating expenses rose to NKr458m from NKr342.3m. Vard said the division's results were, however, satisfactory.</p>

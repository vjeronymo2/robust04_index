			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOP TEAMSTERS GET ONLY BRIEF 'HI' FROM BUSH  </P> <P> Although he has openly embraced officials of the corruption-plagued Teamsters  Union in the past, President-elect Bush offered only the briefest of private  greetings to the union's leadership Tuesday when they attended a closed-door  meeting with his designated chief of staff, John H. Sununu, Bush aides said.  </P> <P> Sheila Tate, a spokeswoman for Bush, said: "The Teamsters people were meeting  with Sununu and the President-elect simply stopped by briefly. The purpose was  to thank them for their support during the election campaign."  </P> <P> A transition team source said that Bush "literally popped his head in the door  and said 'Hi' " and left without making any substantive comments to union  President William J. McCarthy and other top officials of the International  Brotherhood of Teamsters, whose top leadership faces a civil trial next month  for alleged racketeering.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Won't Intercede  </P> <P> Sununu was said to have warned the group that the executive branch would not  intercede in the pending trial, which stems from a suit filed by the Justice  Department in June. In filing the suit in federal court in New York, U.S. Atty.  Rudolph W. Giuliani charged that the Teamsters were deeply involved in  organized crime, and he sought to use the federal Racketeer Influenced and  Corrupt Organizations law to "take back the Teamsters from the Mafia."  </P> <P> A source said that among those at the 20-minute session in Sununu's office were  Teamsters Vice Presidents Joseph W. Morgan and Daniel C. Ligurotis and the  union's general counsel, James T. Grady.  </P> <P> Bush was not present when Sununu warned the men against discussing the RICO  case, a transition source said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Top Priority  </P> <P> McCarthy has taken as his No. 1 priority beating the suit against himself and  the top Teamsters officials. If successful, the suit would force out the  union's top leadership and order a new, government-supervised election on  grounds that the present leaders are either linked to organized crime or have  done nothing about such links.  </P> <P> Bush declined to meet publicly with the Teamsters officials, although in 1981  and 1985 he appeared before the group to thank union leaders for their  political support. The Teamsters were the only major union to support Bush and  Vice President-elect Dan Quayle and, unlike most unions, also backed the  Reagan-Bush tickets in 1980 and 1984.  </P> <P> One source suggested that the Sununu meeting was meant to mollify Teamsters  officials irked at Bush's absence.  </P></p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries (5): Opportunity for much-needed reforms - Finland: Banking MR Christopher Wegelius is famous on two fronts in Finland: as a world-class equestrian and as head of Skopbank, the clearing bank for Finland's savings banks. While Finns talk proudly of the show-jumping prizes which he won, it is in banking that he came a cropper after Skopbank foundered in the worst banking disaster in Finland's post-war history. Mr Wegelius rose from managing director to the position of chief general manager and chairman of the board at Skopbank in 1990. The bank already had a reputation for its aggressive buying and selling of its minority shareholdings in Finnish companies. However, Skopbank's luck ran out with its exposure to Tampella, a loss-making forestry group which the bank had hoped to return to profit. Skopbank was hit by losses on its share portfolio, and the Bank of Finland was forced to step in and supervise a FM1.8bn injection of capital by the savings banks to cover Skopbank's potential losses in November 1990. 'In the end, that wasn't enough and the situation grew worse' admits a Bank of Finland official. Skopbank faced an acute liquidity crisis as its interbank lines were cut. In September 1991, the Bank of Finland took control in an attempt to limit the damage to Finland's reputation in the international financial markets. 'The central bank simply had to take over Skopbank - it was worried about how Skopbank's collapse might affect Finnish borrowers in the international capital markets,' says Mr Jyrki Laakso, head of the international department at the Finnish Bankers' Association. 'If Skopbank had faced a very serious funding problem it could have spread to affect the whole of the Finnish banking system,' says Mr Kaarlo Jannari, the new chairman and chief executive officer at Skopbank where he is on 'temporary leave' from the Bank of Finland. Mr Jannari was head of the Bank of Finland's financial markets department, monitoring risk in the banking system, but took over after Mr Wegelius resigned and the Bank of Finland came to the rescue. The Bank of Finland set up three separate holding companies: one owns the shares in Skopbank itself; a second, Solidium, contains all of Skopbank's shareholdings and outstanding loans to Tampella; and the third, Sponda, contains Skopbank's largest real estate holdings. Today, the Bank of Finland is the majority shareholder of Skopbank with 52.9 per cent of the share capital and 63.6 per cent of the voting power. Finland's savings banks, who between them used to control 78.6 per cent of the share capital and 91.7 per cent of the votes, have had their total holding reduced to 37.1 per cent of the share capital and 33.4 per cent of the votes. The remaining shares (formerly corresponding to 21.4 per cent of the capital and 8.3 per cent of the votes, but now representing 10.1 per cent of the capital and 3 per cent of the votes) are publicly owned. The Bank of Finland is keen to find a new owner for Skopbank since the country's central bank can no longer be seen as wholly neutral in the money market while it has a controlling stake in a bank. 'Skopbank's main attraction is its links with the savings bank network,' says one securities analyst. So far, three suitors have emerged: Union Bank of Finland, Okobank (the co-operative banking group) and Postipankki (the post office bank). The three are expected to submit their bids and outline their plans in March before serious negotiations begin. For Union Bank of Finland, which has a strong corporate customer base and a large retail market concentrated mainly in the big cities, co-operation with the savings banks through Skopbank could provide it with a wider regional network. That could prove an advantage if Union Bank of Finland were to link up with an insurance group - as it is quite likely to do in future - since it would provide greater access for selling insurance products outside the main cities. The co-operative banking organisation has traditionally been the sworn enemy of the savings banks outside the main cities. 'Out in the countryside, the only banks you see are the savings banks and the co-operative banks as they have the largest regional networks, and that's where they fight their trench warfare,' says one banker. He adds that while these two banking groups answer for about 60 per cent of Finland's total individual deposits nationwide, in the countryside their share is closer to 90 per cent. Analysts believe that a link-up between the co-operative and savings banks would provide the opportunity for a much-needed rationalisation in an overbanked - and overstaffed - market. But merging co-operative and savings banks would not be easy, not merely because the two banking groups are so hostile to each other. Legally it is impossible at present to merge the two kinds of banking structures, but that could change soon. A government committee is currently preparing new legislation which would enable savings and co-operative banks to merge or to convert into commercial banks. Skopbank's other suitor is Postipankki, the state-owned post office bank. While Postipankki has only a few dozen branches nationwide, it has access to a wider market over the post office counters. Bankers point out that Postipankki may be considering whether it would be cheaper to have its own network (in other words the savings banks) than to continue with its post office branch network. The Skopbank affair erupted at a time when Finland's banks were facing terrible problems as a result of the recession and low interest margins, and the combination of these factors is prompting several changes in the banking sector. For a start, there are plans to set up a state deposit guarantee fund. This would provide a back-up to the existing deposit guarantee funds (for the commercial, savings and co-operative banks) which each have between FM200m-400m available to bail out troubled members. The central bank is keen to set up a new fund so that if a bank fails and uses up the appropriate deposit guarantee fund, the state can step in with the necessary money. The idea is that eventually the relevant group of banks would have to pay back the money to the state. When it comes to exposure, bankers hope that risks will be reduced in future. The Bank of Finland criticises the previous Skopbank management for having a strategy which was 'too risk-prone and speculative'. Skopbank's problem was its overall exposure to Tampella: Finnish banks are not allowed to own more than 10 per cent in a company, but Skopbank succeeded in circumventing those rules by building up its stake via associated companies. Bankers are keen to adopt EC banking regulations which would allow a bank to own 100 per cent of a non-financial company, as long as it does not account for more than 10 per cent of the bank's capital. 'If this rule was applied in Finland it would be quite prudent,' says Mr Jannari. He argues that when the Finnish financial markets were deregulated in the mid-1980s, there should have been a simultaneous improvement in the Finnish banking supervision and regulatory legislation to fit the new environment, with particular attention paid to risk concentration and capital adequacy. Already, the decline in banks' profitability stemming from the dramatic rise in credit losses has forced the Banking Supervision Board to introduce new reporting requirements. There are two main changes: Banks have to report large exposures twice a year, rather than once a year (as was the case before 1990); and Non-performing loans must be reported monthly, whereas banks did not have to report these at all before. A non-performing loan is defined as one where there has been no interest payment for 90 days or amortisation. 'It was important to standardise the definition of non-performing loans because these grew dramatically last year,' says Mr Risto Maattanen, deputy director-general of the Banking Supervision Board. Although the market is not informed of the monthly figures, the banks do have to report their non-performing loans in their annual reports now, which is a new step. 'We can't change the economic environment, but the least we can do is be honest to ourselves and the public. There is not a single problem-free bank and we see it as a very dangerous situation as a whole' says Mr Maattanen. Banking analyst Mr Roger Kempe of Evli Securities welcomes the changes which have been introduced so far. 'The banking supervision has strengthened its grip and is demanding more information so that it has a stronger control over the banks,' he says. 'Sometimes in the past, it seemed as though the banks didn't give out the information that was important, but now the rules have changed and the banking supervision has become very strict and demanding.' Currently under the control of the Ministry of Finance, the banking supervision may soon be placed under the wing of the central bank and given the task of supervising Finland's banking and insurance markets. The latter are monitored by the Ministry of Social Affairs now, but it would make more sense to combine regulation of the two sectors under one roof to allow a more comprehensive monitoring of the markets.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: IFI posts L175bn for half year IFI, the quoted Italian holding company controlled by the Agnelli family, yesterday reported a consolidated profit before tax of L175bn (Dollars 107m) for the six months to September 30. It is the first time IFI has presented consolidated figures for the half year so there is no comparative figure for the first six months of 1993-94. For the whole of 1993-94, IFI recorded a consolidated loss of L285bn, mainly because of heavy losses at Fiat, the automotive and industrial group. The absence of a dividend payment by Fiat hit IFI parent company profit in the first half. It fell to L27.2bn before tax from L155bn a year earlier. IFI controls 30 per cent of Fiat, including an indirect stake through the Agnellis' other quoted holding company, Ifil. The company said since September 30 it had realised a parent company capital gain of L34bn on the conversion of bonds into shares in Fiat and Unicem, the cement subsidiary, and had received a 1994 dividend of L4bn from Exor, the French investment company. IFI said net parent company profit for 1994-95 was likely to be lower than the L100.2bn profit in the previous year, but enough to allow a dividend payment at least equal to the 1993-94 payout of L30.3bn. More than 80 per cent of IFI's shares are controlled by the private Agnelli holding company.</p>

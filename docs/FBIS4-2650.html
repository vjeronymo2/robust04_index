			<p>BFN     [Text] In light of the new circumstances emerging in the  province's current grain and cooking oil markets, Vice Governor  Sun Kuiwen pointed out at the 8 April provincial emergency  telephone conference on stabilizing prices and market supply of  grain: Governments at all levels should adopt resolute measures  to further stabilize grain and cooking oil prices. Grain and  cooking oil prices have gradually gone up since late March. In  particular, there has been a relatively big fluctuation in grain  and cooking oil prices recently.    Vice Governor Sun Kuiwen pointed out: The current price  fluctuation on grain and cooking oil markets have primarily  resulted from the price increase in other provinces and from the  state's hiked grain procurement prices. It is by no means caused  by the lack of grain and processing capacity. There is an  extremely ample supply of grain and a good assortment of grains  in the province. By the end of March, the province has laid up  24.5 billion jin of grain. This amount of stored grain is  capable of meeting the demands for two years or so, if  calculated according to the province's consumption in a normal  year. Of this, the stored soybean is 3 billion jin, that can  produce 450 million jin of soya-bean oil, also capable of  meeting the province's consumption of more than 2 years.  Therefore, the provincial government hopes that the vast numbers  of grain producers, dealers, and consumers will clear their  minds of doubt, have a correct understanding of the grain and  cooking oil markets situation, and overcome the abnormal  mentality.    Vice Governor Sun Kuiwen demanded: All localities in the  province should strengthen market management, resolutely check  the rising trend of prices of grain and cooking oil, and  stabilize prices. All localities should give full play to the  role of state grain departments as the main channel to ensure  the supply of grain. Grain and cooking oil processing  enterprises should ensure the quality of finished grain products  and cooking oil products in line with market demands and should  ensure the timely supply. All grain shops should improve grain  dealing business. Efforts should be made to ensure the supply  of grain and cooking oil to large- and medium-sized cities, to  industrial and mining areas, and to poverty-stricken areas.  Continued efforts should be made to ensure the supply of grain  and cooking oil to colleges, universities, and secondary  specialized schools as well as to the troops. New methods  should be carried out in terms of grain and cooking oil prices.  The provincial government has decided to comprehensively set  the market supply prices by giving consideration to the  necessary factors of all counties and cities. All grain  departments and all other units and individuals dealing grain  and cooking oil must follow the grain and cooking oil prices set  by local governments and must hang out their shingles to sell  grain and cooking oil. At the same time, the grain and cooking  oil prices in all localities should not be higher than the 4  April local price levels of other varieties. In addition, all  departments should coordinate with one another to resolutely and  severely deal with all price violation behaviors. All localities  should strengthen leadership and establish strict responsibility  system to successfully stabilize the grain and cooking oil  prices.</p>

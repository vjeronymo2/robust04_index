			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Canada plans to ease stock issuing rules CANADIAN SECURITIES regulators plan to make it easier for international foreign companies to issue stock in Canada by amending prospectus regulations. If the plan goes through, big companies will be able to sell up to 10 per cent of a global equity issue in Canada without issuing a separate Canadian prospectus. The Canadian investment industry has long complained that the costly prospectus system and other restrictions have deprived them and Canadian investors of lucrative opportunities. The new policy will mean that provincial regulators will accept foreign prospectuses as long as they meet basic disclosure requirements.</p>

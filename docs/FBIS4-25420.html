			<p>BFN     [Text] Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee Political Bureau  member and Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee secretary, wound  up a fruitful visit to Germany last week.    This reporter interviewed Comrade Xie Fei over the telephone  on Guangdong-German economic cooperation prospects.    After winding up a fruitful visit to Germany and Denmark,  the  Guangdong Provincial Economic Investigation Delegation headed by  Xie Fei, arrived back in Guangzhou last week.    In Germany, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who had invited  Comrade Xie Fei to visit Germany, held a banquet in honor of  Comrade Xie Fei and his entourage in Bonn. The two sides held  cordial talks on expanding friendly relations of cooperation  between China and Germany, especially between Guangdong and  Germany.    In Germany, Comrade Xie Fei and his entourage had extensive  contacts with personages from Germany's industrial, commercial,  and banking circles, and held talks with entrepreneurs and  financiers from the German Industrial and Economic Federation,  Berlin Industrial and Commercial Federation, and Bremen  Industrial and Commercial Federation and with chief executives  of Germany's (BAOMA) Joint-Stock Company, Siemens Company, and  (JINMAKE) Company. Comrade Xie Fei briefed German friends on  Guangdong's economic development, investment environment, and  projects awaiting foreign investment. Comrade Xie Fei also held  conscientious trade talks with the German friends.    People of all walks of life in Germany expressed profound  appreciation of as well as interest in the excellent economic  cooperation opportunities offered by Guangdong.    After the Guangdong delegation returned to Guangzhou from  Germany, this reporter interviewed Comrade Xie Fei on what  Guangdong should do to expand economic cooperation with Germany.    During the interview, Comrade Xie Fei told this reporter:  Germany's advanced science, technology, managerial expertise, as  well as high economic efficiency are useful to Guangdong's  modernization drive. Guangdong should, in the years ahead,  strive to expand economic cooperation with Germany in four main  areas.    [Begin Xie Fei recording] We should expand economic  cooperation with Germany in light of Guangdong's actual  conditions. To this end, first and foremost, we should expand  Guangdong-German economic cooperation in a number of selected  areas, such as enterprise management, communications,  telecommunication, environmental protection, and so on, in which  Germany has excelled. We should also set up more joint venture  enterprises with Germany and invite more capital from Germany.  Second, we should study and draw on Germany's advanced capital  construction experiences with an eye to upgrading Guangdong's  capital construction and large-scale modern production. To this  end, we should send more personnel to Germany to learn relevant  expertise. I believe that we will be able to learn a great deal  from Germany in many areas. Third, we should forge closer  bilateral trade ties with Germany on the basis of enhanced  mutual understanding, hold more trade promotion fairs, and carry  out more similar activities in Germany to make it more  convenient for the German businesspeople and entrepreneurs to  come to and invest in Guangdong. Germany has a large number of  small and medium-sized enterprises engaging in modern  production. These German enterprises have expressed profound  interest in investing in Guangdong. We should try to provide  German entrepreneurs with more and better services and  sufficient information in this regard, and invite them to come  to have a look at Guangdong's investment environment with their  own eyes. Fourth, we should provide more cooperation projects  for and hold more trade talks with the German business community  and expand cooperation with German financial and banking  circles. Germany has agreed to provide more loans on  preferential terms to help Guangdong build environmental  protection projects. I can foresee great potential in this area  of bilateral cooperation. We should strive to improve work in  this connection. In a nutshell, in my view, it is all the more  necessary for Guangdong to expand cooperation with and learn  more from Germany, as well as other advanced countries in the  world. We should strive to expand pluralistic opening up to the  outside world and make redoubled efforts to step up economic  cooperation in depth and breadth with all advanced countries in  the world. Only by so doing will we finally optimize  Guangdong's industrial structure. I'm full of confidence about  the Guangdong-Germany economic cooperation.    Last year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited Guangdong, at  which  time we discussed a host of trade and cooperation issues. I  believe that we should take last year's visit to Guangdong as a  point of departure and strive to make every possible endeavor to  push forward bilateral trade and cooperation. Since last year,  Guangdong has sent many a delegation to Germany and forged  extensive ties with the German business community. The recent  visit to Germany has undoubtedly enhanced our confidence in the  Guangdong-Germany cooperation in the years ahead. [end recording]</p>

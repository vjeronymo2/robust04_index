			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: JAZZ  </P> <P> As jazz greats gathered in New York on Wednesday to pay final respects to  trumpeter Roy Eldridge, they learned that another jazz trumpeter, Woody Shaw,  had lost his left arm in a freak accident. Shaw, 44, who is legally blind,  tumbled down a flight of stairs at a Brooklyn subway station Monday morning and  rolled off the platform into the path of an oncoming train. His left arm was so  badly mangled that doctors had to amputate it. The accident was revealed by the  pastor conducting Eldridge's funeral service. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

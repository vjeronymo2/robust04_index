			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Observer: Dual purpose Visitors to the US Treasury are better off leaving their guns at home. Unfortunately, Charles Corry, the head of USX, owner of the country's biggest steelmaker, forgot that simple rule last week and now faces a maximum penalty of 180 days in jail. It's an easy enough mistake for the modern business executive to make. Corry regularly lugs a .32 calibre pistol around in his briefcase. Well, who doesn't these days? The snag is, he is only licensed to carry it in his home state of Pennsylvania. Surprising as it may be, Washington DC has strict gun laws  - everything is relative  - and the state doesn't take kindly to visitors toting firearms. Corry's concealed weapon showed up on a scanner as he entered the Treasury, leading to his prompt arrest. He will be explaining himself in court in January.</p>

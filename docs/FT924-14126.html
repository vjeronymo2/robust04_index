			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / International Equities: Companies find the gloss has faded from foreign listing when securities markets were meant to go 'global' - getting a listing abroad was all the rage. Investors around the world wanted to buy shares in foreign companies, ran the theory, so what better way to sell shares to them than list on their local exchanges? For many companies, however, this proved expensive and time-consuming. Like many theories of the globalisation era, experience has shown it to be overly simplistic. Recent experience suggests the high-water mark of foreign listings has passed. In London the number of foreign companies seeking a listing peaked at 84 in 1984, falling to 38 in 1990. Last year there were 20 and this year so far eight. There is a steady flow of companies delisting, on the other hand. That may be because of merger or takeover or because the amount of trading did not live up to the companies' hopes. Whatever the reason, at 533 the number of overseas listed companies could be past its peak. This phenomenon is not restricted to London. UK companies are pulling back from foreign listings. Aegis, a media buying company, last week said it was giving up its listings in Paris and New York, to save itself Pounds 250,000 a year in compliance costs. Tokyo, meanwhile, suffered the indignity last month of losing five big foreign listings, including GM, Philips and News Corp. It is not too hard to see why these companies' ambitions were frustrated. Most foreign shares are bought by institutions and these investors generally have access to a foreign company's domestic market. The replacement of floor-trading by screens, the greater flow of information internationally and the advent of broker-dealers with salesforces spanning the globe means companies no longer have the same need to list on foreign markets. A second reason is that liquidity has not developed in most off-shore markets. It turns out that foreign investors value liquidity, and the chance to trade at prices determined by domestic investors, more than they value the ability to trade when domestic markets are shut or the convenience of having foreign companies sitting alongside domestic ones on local exchanges. Foreign listings are not about to vanish. They are still used by consumer product companies and others for marketing reasons, for instance. For companies wanting to raise money, rather than just create a new market for their shares, it may be useful to go through the disciplines of complying with local prospectus requirements. That is especially true in the US, the world's largest domestic capital market. Compliance with Securities and Exchange Commission regulations and US accounting practices is a stiff requirement which many companies are prepared to fulfil - even though there is now a growing private market for companies which are exempt under Rule 144a. Unless and until the SEC relaxes its disclosure requirements, this is likely to remain the case.</p>

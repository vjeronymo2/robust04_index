			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Coming soon to a tiny disc near you / A look at new video storage methods Some of the world's top high-technology companies are now working on ways to put a high-resolution, two-hour film on a 3.5 inch disc that you can pop into your video Walkman or your multimedia player/computer/TV/game machine. A key element in future multimedia systems will be the medium itself - the means by which files containing data and graphics are stored and retrieved. As any computer user knows, graphic data files can get extremely large. Even something as simple as a 8 x 10 colour portrait fills up tens of megabytes. And the same motion picture that fits nicely on a rental tape is far too big for the largest personal computer hard discs. The high-tech industries of Japan, battered by the strong yen and devastated by plummeting consumer sales are looking for their next 'killer' product. They need something to succeed the VCR. As the chairman of one high-technology company says: 'Everyone has a VCR . . . and they never wear out.' What is needed, both as a VCR replacement and a basic element of multimedia systems, is a data storage method that combines very large size with the breathtaking data transfer speed demanded by both real-time video playback and advanced 3D video games. In the last decade compact discs, using optical recording techniques have completely supplanted the needle-and-groove recording technology that was introduced by Edison and survived, admittedly with sophisticated enhancements, for most of this century. Those same techniques can and have been applied to video recording. But there are problems. Pioneer's laser disc format has been on the market for years and still provides the only alternative to video tape for high-resolution recording. But laser discs are large, cumbersome and unlike videotape, cannot be erased and re-used. A consortium of consumer electronics makers in Europe and Japan, last year developed what they call the video CD. The same sized as a compact disc, it can play back pre-recorded movies on equipment designed for it. But video CDs have their own problems. They sacrifice resolution and picture quality and require two or three discs for a single feature film. Unlike videotape, they are not rewritable. The not-yet-developed, next generation video storage medium must meet several requirements. In addition, there are features that, while not absolutely essential from a technical point of view, may be very important from the standpoint of market success. High resolution. The closer we get to the time when current video standards will be supplanted by high-definition TV, the less likely that the market will be satisfied with present standards of quality. High capacity. The largest hard disc drives currently available for personal computers can only store about 15 or 20 minutes of high quality video even using the latest compression methods. High speed. To play back full motion video in real time requires more than just the capacity to store the data. The recorded data must be transferred a sufficiently high rate of speed. MPEG-2, currently the most advanced compression standard requires a data transfer rate of nearly 10 megabits per second. Record capability. A major reason for the success of video tape cassettes is the ability to record as well as play back. Most industry watchers agree that laser discs would have a much larger market share if users could record material on them. Compact discs replaced records, but have not replaced audio tape cassettes for just this reason. And when Sony Corporation launched its mini disc (MD) format, it found a way to provide the ability to record as well as play back pre-recorded material. There are currently three basic types of optical disc recording technologies. The first method, used for CDs, pre-recorded MDs and laser discs, impresses information on to a disc by burning pits into the recording surface. To get an idea of the size of these pits, imagine a CD blown up to the size of a football field. Each pit would then be about as large as a grain of sand. This type of disc has several advantages. Duplicates can be stamped out at low cost, much as records used to be pressed. The discs are durable and can stand up to relatively careless handling. Capacity is comparable to a large hard disc drive. CD-ROMs (compact discs used as read-only memory) are becoming quite popular with computer users and software vendors. But CDs can only be written once; they cannot be re-recorded and while more than adequate for audio applications, they lack the capacity to store and play-back full-length motion pictures on a single disc. Magneto Optical (MO) discs, the second type, use both optical and magnetic recording techniques. Erasable and rewritable, they offer relatively high capacity up to about one-third that of a CD. To produce MD recorders, Sony fell back on this technology. Pre-recorded MDs use the same basic technology as CDs. The smaller size is achieved by using different standards and methods for compressing the data on the disc. But you cannot erase a pre-recorded MD. Recordable MDs, even though they can be played back on the same equipment, use MO technology. The third type is the phase-change optical disc which uses a laser at varying levels of power to alter the structure of the recording surface from an amorphous state to a crystalline state and vice versa. Phase change discs are fast and recordable, but current phase-change disc drives cost about five times as much as MO drives. Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp. has been supplying drives of this type to commercial customers for several years and recently announced technical improvements that could make it possible to put 6 gigabytes of data on a single 5.25 inch disc. Toshiba Corp. has no drives of this type on the market but last month demonstrated a prototype that had the capacity of a CD, was recordable and erasable and could record and play back 20 minutes of full-motion video with MPEG-2 compression in real time. Other companies have been extending the optical disc state of the art in the last few weeks. IBM Corp. in the US, demonstrated in May an optical disc recording system that increased capacity tenfold. IBM's approach was direct, it simply combined ten discs into a composite sandwich. To write to or read from a particular disc in the sandwich the laser's point of focus is changed. Which technology is going to emerge on top of the heap in a few years is hard to say. In addition to the basic types outlined above there are likely to be advances in technology that cut across several categories. A number of corporate and university laboratories around the world are in a race to develop a low-cost, low-power semiconductor laser that emits a blue-violet beam. Because blue light has a shorter wavelength than red, a blue laser could burn smaller pits into the surface of a CD. Smaller pits spaced closer together take up less space. More pits equals more capacity, equals longer recording time. All optical recording systems use lasers so a commercially successful blue laser could increase the capacity of almost any optical recording system four fold. Hitachi researchers just reported the results of an experiment designed to get blue laser results using conventional red lasers. What the experimenters did was force light from a red laser through an optical fiber with a diameter that was only a tenth of the wavelength of the light beam. A high-tech version of passing a camel through the eye of a needle, the feat is admittedly many years from any practical application. But if successful, the method could be used to carve out pits from the recording surface of an optical disc that are even smaller than pits produced by a blue laser. In May, Sony announced a breakthrough that could increase the capacity of any optical disc that stores information in the form of pits. In principle, what Sony researchers did is simple. Where conventional CDs vary the size and spacing of pits to record information, Sony's experimental makes the centre-to-centre distance between pits constant, then varies both the left and right edges independently. Because the new scheme allows a greater number of variations for each pit, it allows more information to be placed on a disc - at least twice as much. Another significant element of future optical storage systems for video applications is data compression. Although data compression algorithms - the precise mathematical expression of the compression scheme - are quite complex, the underlying principle is simple. Both motion pictures and video recordings produce the illusion of motion by presenting a series of still pictures (frames) so fast that the human eye cannot detect the difference. But the difference between successive frames may not be large. Just as animated sequences do not require a new drawing for each frame, compression systems allow the recording of frame-to-frame changes. The idea is not to waste disc space on picture elements that have not changed from one frame to the next. MPEG-2 is the most advanced current standard, but newer methods will soon be coming. Stay tuned.</p>

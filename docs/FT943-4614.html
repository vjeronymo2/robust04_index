			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Diplomacy reigns in the unarmed struggle: The advance of peace in Ireland As the smoke of battle clears following the IRA's ceasefire announcement, the peace strategy being followed by the British and Irish governments is emerging through the haze. It looked as though the process had gone awry on Tuesday when London dismissed as 'premature' a historic meeting in Dublin between Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. While Mr Reynolds eagerly accepted Mr Adams' assurance that the IRA had ended its terrorist campaign, Mr John Major continued to demand guarantees that there would be no return to violence. Meanwhile, in a theatrical confrontation in Downing Street, Mr Ian Paisley, Ulster's single most popular Unionist leader, was ejected from the cabinet room for refusing to accept that Mr John Major does not tell lies. The dramatic series of events prompted reports of renewed tensions between London and Dublin amid speculation that Mr Reynolds wishes to move much faster towards all-party talks on Northern Ireland than Mr Major thinks wise. There are clear differences of perspective between London and Dublin, not least because most of the carnage inflicted by the IRA has been within the UK's borders. The view from Dublin is also coloured by the historical fact that all the Irish political parties except Labour are descended from the old Sinn Fein party which campaigned for independence from Britain. Perhaps because of these links the Irish government is more convinced than London of the permanence of the Sinn Fein leader's change of heart, and less concerned about a possible slide back to violence. In spite of their differences the two governments are moving in tandem towards the dual objective of entrenching Sinn Fein within the democratic process while demolishing unionist suspicions of a sell-out to the IRA. The British government was obliged to deprecate the speed with which Mr Reynolds moved to meet Mr Adams because of the widespread distaste for the Sinn Fein leader among unionists and Tory rightwingers. But ministers are aware that the ceasefire declaration was opposed by a hardline faction in the IRA, and that it could collapse unless Mr Adams is able to show results from the so-called 'unarmed struggle.' For the same reason the government has reduced security in Northern Ireland, and would not be greatly unhappy to see Mr Adams make a second propaganda visit to the US, although it would formally urge President Clinton not to grant a visa. Mr Major also accepts that Mr Adams cannot deliver the guarantee of a 'permanent' end to violence that London originally demanded because that would be regarded by the hardliners in the IRA as tantamount to surrender. Ministers remain hopeful that a form of words can be agreed, although leading republicans say that further clarification is unlikely in the near future. Mr Major's pre-planned confrontation with Mr Paisley was intended to isolate his hardline Democratic Unionist party by demonstrating that threats and bluster will achieve nothing. Mr Major also wanted to provide a contrast between the DUP and the more constructive role played by Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party. There were signs yesterday that the strategy was working. Mr Paisley compared Mr Major to Adolf Hitler, but ruled out taking his struggle to the streets. Mr Ken Maginnis, a senior UUP MP, accused Mr Paisley of 'harming the cause of unionism', confirming that the UUP will continue to go along with Mr Major. The big prize, however, is the prospect of a reciprocal ceasefire by the loyalist terrorist organisations. British ministers hope Mr Major's brusque rejection of Mr Paisley's attack on his integrity will reinforce the government's insistence that no secret deals have been done with the IRA. The indications are that the loyalist paramilitaries would probably call a halt to violence if fears of a 'sell-out' could be assuaged. Unionist leaders with paramilitary links warned yesterday that Tuesday's nationalist summit in Dublin was being interpreted by some as evidence of IRA influence. Officials in both capitals say that the peace process is at an extremely delicate stage and warn that an upsurge in loyalist violence or a republican refusal to clarify the ceasefire could cause a breakdown. Nonetheless, work is continuing on an inter-governmental 'framework' agreement, expected in the autumn, which will make detailed proposals for the future. If the ceasefire holds, that will be when the real tough talking starts. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, told members of the Orange Order last night that there was no question of the British and Irish governments imposing a solution on the people of the province. He said in Belfast's Comber Orange Hall, that joint authority against the people's will would be incompatible with the principle of consent. A crowd of protesters gathered outside but the meeting ended without incident.</p>

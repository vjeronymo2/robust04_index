			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / IMF team set for Venezuela A team from the International Monetary Fund is scheduled to begin a two-week visit to Venezuela on Monday, just asthe country's international monetary reserves have fallen sharply and the government has restricted the sale of foreign exchange to the public. Mr Julio Sosa, Venezuela's minister of finance, said the government's liquid reserves stood at more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) and it would be 'precipitate' to discuss a standby arrangement with the IMF now. But Mr Miguel Rodriguez, minister of planning and president of Venezuela's central bank from 1989 to 1993, this week recommended that the government begin negotiating a standby arrangement with the fund immediately. Mr Rodriguez, the main architect of the Perez government's free-market programme, criticised the central bank's recent decision to establish daily auctions at which banks and exchange houses can buy limited volumes of US dollars. Venezuela has returned to this 'abominable' practice, while exchange controls have been abolished in other parts of Latin America, he said. The auctions, which were meant to reduce sales of foreign exchange, immediately led to the development of a dual-rate system.</p>

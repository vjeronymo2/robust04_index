			<p>931113 FT  13 NOV 93 / EU, S Korea in chemicals agreement THE European Union and South Korea yesterday announced an agreement on intellectual property rights covering EU pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals. The announcement followed the annual EU-Korean ministerial meeting between Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, in Seoul. Sir Leon also asked South Korea to open its rice market as part of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - something Seoul has persistently refused to do, demanding an exception to the all-tariffication rule.</p>

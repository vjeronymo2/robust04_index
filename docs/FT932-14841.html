			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Rail strike will close network after union rejects BR's plea BRITAIN'S railway network faces shutdown today in the second 24-hour strike in a fortnight, in spite of last-minute efforts by British Rail management urging staff to work as normal. BR says the strike will cost a further Pounds 10m in lost gross revenue and will threaten long-term business contracts. The action follows the acrimonious breakdown of talks on Wednesday between BR and the main RMT rail union which is demanding a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies and a moratorium on contract work ahead of the industry's privatisation. Yesterday BR management encouraged staff to reconsider their strike action. The RMT commented last night: 'They tried that tactic last time and it did not work. And it will not work now.' Members of Aslef, the drivers' union, are also on strike today over changes in their national agreement, in spite of talks with BR last night that were described as 'constructive'. The BR-Aslef negotiations were adjourned after 75 minutes and will be resumed on Monday. Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's personnel director, said there was a 'willingness on both sides to find a solution', but Aslef said it was too late to call off its 24-hour strike. In the Commons, Mr John Major, the prime minister, denounced the strike as 'utterly futile' and a 'throwback to the 1960s'. The government and the Confederation of British Industry urged people to try and work as normal, although car parking restrictions will not be lifted. Many people will work from home. In London, the Underground and the buses are running as normal. BR fears that many business customers and individual travellers will stop using the railway network. The Royal Mail said it was hiring four extra flights capable of carrying 400,000 letters to boost the network of 32 chartered aircraft that already carry mail around Britain. National Express, the coach company, said extra coaches were being laid on for cross-Pennine routes; those linking London with Scotland; and the main commuter routes into London from the south coast, Cambridge and Milton Keynes. Gatwick airport is providing extra coaches for the link between the airport and Victoria station in London. BR-union talks derailed, Page 12</p>

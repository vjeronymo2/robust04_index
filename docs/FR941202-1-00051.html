			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> E. Highlights of Proposed Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subtitle D of Title I of the FASA names and amends the Brooks Automatic Data Processing Act (40 U.S.C. 759(f)), under which the Board hears and decides protests. Subtitle D of Title II of the FASA amends the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601&hyph;613), which gives the Board jurisdiction to hear and decide contract disputes. The proposed revisions to the Board's rules contain changes necessitated by the amendment of both the Brooks Act and the Contract Disputes Act. In addition, Section 155 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 8287) authorized the Board to review decisions regarding the qualification of firms to enter into energy savings contracts. The Foreword to the rules now includes a statement that, in conducting such reviews, the Board will apply the rules pertinent to protests to the extent practicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A definition of ``prevailing party'' (&sect;6101.1(b)(12)) has been added to the rules to conform to section 1435(b) of the FASA. In a protest, a ``prevailing party'' is one who has demonstrated that a challenged action of a Federal agency violates a statute or regulation or the conditions of a delegation of procurement authority. Similarly, the definition of ``protest'' (&sect;6101.1(b)(13)) has been changed to that specified in section 1438 of the Act. Finally, in order to conform to the language prescribed in section 1437 of the Act, the term ``working day'' (&sect;6101.1(b)(16)) is now defined as any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or ``legal'' (rather than ``Federal'') holiday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Computing Time <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6101.2(c) has been revised to parallel the changes required by section 1433 of the FASA. This section provides that when a period of time prescribed or allowed in the rules is less than 11 days, intervening Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are not counted; in other words, only working days are counted. When the time period is 11 days or more, intervening Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays are counted, i.e., all calendar days are counted. The revision states that the only exceptions are the 5-day period after a debriefing date and the 10-day period after contract award for filing a protest that requests a suspension hearing; for these, all calendar days are counted. This computation change affects three other sections of the current rules: (1) Section 6101.19(a)(2) has been amended to provided that a protest which requests a suspension hearing must be filed no later than 10 calendar days after contract award or 5 calendar days after the debriefing date; (2) Section 6101.19(a)(3) has been amended to provide that the hearing on the merits of a protest shall commence no later than 35 calendar days after the protest is filed (rather than 25 working days); and (3) Section 6101.29(b) now provides that a decision on the merits of a protest shall be decided no later than 65 calendar days after the protest is filed (rather than 45 working days). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Small Claims and Accelerated Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The small claims dollar threshold has been changed from $100,000 to $50,000 (&sect;6101.13(a)), and the accelerated procedure dollar threshold has been changed from $50,000 to $10,000 (&sect;6101.14(a)). These changes parallel the amendments to sections 608(a) and 607(f) of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 by subsections 2351 (c) and (d) of the FASA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Dismissals; Sanctions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6101.28(a)(2) has been added to conform to the language specified in Section 1434 of the FASA. The proposed rule provides that the Board may dismiss a protest that it determines is frivolous; has been brought or pursued in bad faith; or does not state on its face a valid basis for protest. Section 6101.18(b) has been amended to provide that the Board may impose appropriate sanctions if it expressly finds that (1) a protest or portion of a protest is frivolous or has been brought or pursued in bad faith; or (2) that any person has willfully abused the Board's process during the course of a protest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

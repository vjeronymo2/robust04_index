			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Opposition refuses to back independent pay review body - Teachers' Pay LABOUR leaders were accused of being in fear of the biggest teachers' union (NUT) in the Commons last night when they refused to back the establishment of an independent review body for teachers' pay. Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, repeatedly clashed with ministers and Conservative backbenchers when he claimed that there could be no guarantee that the review body would be genuinely independent. The government secured a majority of 110 (310-200) to defeat a Labour 'reasoned amendment' seeking to deny a second reading to the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions (No. 2) Bill because it gave 'unacceptable powers' to the education secretary to give directions to the review body. The Bill was then given an unopposed second reading. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the education secretary, contended that a 'silent majority' of the NUT agreed with the other five teaching unions in favouring the establishment of a pay review body for teachers. He reaffirmed that in the event of industrial action being threatened or taken the government would not activate the teachers' pay review body. Mr Clarke forecast that when the new body became operative, teachers would move to the same position as the Royal College of Nursing and regard strike action as 'extinct'. He gave an assurance that ministerial powers would not be used to give the pay review body a financial remit, although it would be possible for it to be asked to have regard to 'affordability'. Mr Clarke insisted that the establishment of the review body would lift the professional status of teachers, and acknowledged the need to improve the position of the successful classroom teacher who was not interested in moving to a non-teaching post. Mr Straw condemned the way in which the Government had 'demeaned' teachers over the past 12 years, and quoted comments by Conservative party members admitting that there was a crisis of confidence in the profession. To Labour cheers he said ministers regarded the state education service as one for 'other peoples' children and not their own'. Challenged about the attitude of Labour MPs to the proposed review body, he said 'We are in favour of the practice of review bodies where they are agreed between the parties'. Labour MPs, he emphasised, were 'very sceptical indeed' about whether the proposals in the Bill would ensure the independence of the review body. Mr Straw dismissed Conservative allegations that Labour MPs had always supported strikes by public sector workers as a 'complete calumny'. He said: 'I defer to nobody in my view that, so far as possible, industrial action should be avoided inside schools'. Sir Norman Fowler (C Sutton Coldfield) contended that Mr Straw's speech amounted to saying 'if the NUT agrees with the review body so will we - if not we won't'. Closing the debate, Mr Tim Eggar, education minister, accused a minority of the NUT of being absolutely determined that teachers should be able to take industrial action 'at the drop of a hat'. Mr Clarke apologised for describing readers of the Daily Mirror as 'morons. Mr Derek Fatchett, from Labour's front bench, said Mr Clarke's attack on the newspaper's readers cast doubt on his ability to behave rationally.</p>

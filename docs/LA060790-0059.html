			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE GRANTS WATER ORDINANCE FOES A 2ND CHANCE  </P> <P> Opponents of Ventura's stringent water conservation ordinance got a second  chance to challenge the law Wednesday when a Superior Court judge ruled that  they could correct mistakes in a lawsuit they filed in April.  </P> <P> The suit, filed by local attorney Lindsay Nielson, alleges that the ordinance  -- setting penalties for households that use too much water -- violates  residents' constitutional right to equal protection because a family of four is  allowed the same amount as a person living alone.  </P> <P> The suit also argues that the city should have done an environmental impact  report before adopting the ordinance.  </P> <P> It is the first legal challenge to a water conservation ordinance in California  since a statewide drought began four years ago, City Atty. Peter Bulens said.  </P> <P> The suit, however, contained one serious flaw: it challenged the wrong  ordinance.  </P> <P> Calling it a typing error, Nielson asked Bulens to allow him to amend the  mistake, but Bulens refused and asked Judge Melinda Johnson to dismiss the  suit.  </P> <P> After a hearing that lasted about 60 seconds, Johnson agreed that the suit was  flawed but granted Nielson 30 days to fix it.  </P> <P> She also ruled that Nielson neglected to sign the ordinance and said the suit  didn't show that Nielsen had "failed to exhaust all administrative remedies"  before going to court.  </P> <P> Nielson said he expected Johnson's ruling and was confident that he could bring  back a complaint that would stand up in court. "We've made some errors but  we'll straighten up things," he said.  </P> <P> "That the city wouldn't allow us to do the amendments just stretches things out  and makes us waste a lot of time, but it's their prerogative and I totally  understand it."  </P> <P> Assistant City Atty. Mike Dougherty, who appeared in court Wednesday, said the  city challenged Nielson's bid to amend his "poorly drafted" complaint because  "had I agreed, I would have waived a defense the city has, which is that the  statute of limitations on the ordinance expired."  </P> <P> Had Johnson not allowed the amendments, Nielson would have not been able to  file a new suit because the period for challenging a new ordinance expired in  30 days.  </P></p>

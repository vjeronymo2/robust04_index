			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Bundesbank caught in a rates quandary ECONOMISTS who dared to speculate on the direction of German interest rates last week are now pondering the question of where German monetary policy goes from here after the decision not to cut rates. The question is delicate at a time when there is suspicion in some European capitals that the Bundesbank takes pleasure in wrong-footing those who try to guess the timing and scope of future interest rate moves. The economic factors governing policy are conflicting - inflation is on the way down, according to Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist and member of the policymaking directorate, and this should lead to lower interest rates. But money supply growth - the yardstick by which the German central bank steers its interest rate policy - is running well above the bank's target range. Price stability and the defence of the German currency have long been at the core of Bundesbank policy. But there is another factor - the worst downturn in Germany since the second world war. Mr Issing declared last Friday that monetary policy would increasingly take its cue from the German recession, implying that the Bundesbank wanted to do its bit to alleviate the problems suffered by German industry. In practice, however, Mr Issing's concern about the recession is likely to mean that interest rates will eventually come down, but only at a slow pace. Comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president and president elect of the Bundesbank, also point to lower rates and concern for the wider economy. Mr Tietmeyer said recently that further appreciation of the D-Mark within Europe was undesirable in the light of German exporters' need to remain competitive. But the Bundesbank finds itself between a rock and hard place. On the one hand it wants to cut rates, which would help alleviate the recession. On the other, despite signs inflation is on its way down, the Bundesbank is still constrained by money supply growth. As it never tires of explaining when setting out its ideological stall, current money supply growth is the determinant of inflation two or three years down the road. To some extent, the latest M3, or broad money, figure is distorted - chiefly by the effect of the Bundesbank's interventions in the currency markets in recent months. This will feed through into the August number and will ensure that for a fifth month M3 growth will exceed the target. 'The big problem is that the Bundesbank has not successfully dealt with an increase in money supply which dates back to German reunification (in 1990),' says Mr Joachim Fels, economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt 'The reason we have high inflation now is because of monetary growth several years ago.' The Bundesbank's room for manoeuvre is helped by the widening of fluctuation bands within the exchange rate mechanism. The most likely next step is a cut of 50 basis points at most in the discount rate. This is currently at 6.75 per cent and a cut from this level could be justified on 'technical grounds' because of the narrow margin between this rate and current money market rates. 'The Bundesbank likes to engage in practical psychology,' says Mr Fels. 'It must strive to keep hopes of further interest rate cuts alive. The only way it can do this is by giving the market less than it expects, and more slowly.'</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Mexico to loosen curbs on labour The Mexican government is to reform the federal labour law in an effort to increase worker productivity. The new law would scrap the seniority clause that restricts the ability of some companies to promote workers. It would also speed resolution of disputes between management and unions by replacing the current labour conciliation and arbitration panel with more streamlined tribunals. The president has also sent Congress new laws to allow foreigners to operate trucks and buses in Mexico, and would permit foreign investment in maritime transport. The law also extends the maximum concession for private toll roads to 50 years. 'What we are seeing are the internal changes that are necessary to compete under the North American Free Trade Agreement,' says Mr Mario Dehesa, an economist with Grupo Financiero Serfin. 'We cannot compete with our hands tied behind our backs.' Mexico's labour arbitration panels can take two years to resolve cases, which is usually not in the interest of either the workers or management. The panels are heavily influenced by the government, which can generally resolve high profile labour disputes as it wishes. The proposed reforms to the labour law will be sent to Congress before December 15, a senior government official said. They were welcomed by Mexico's business community, which sees the complicated and detailed regulations as an obstacle to productivity. Labour unions are believed to be opposed to some of the changes.</p>

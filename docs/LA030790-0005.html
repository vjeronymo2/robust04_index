			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WHITE ENROLLMENT DROPS AGAIN, NEW CENSUS SHOWS  </P> <P> The latest ethnic census of students in the San Diego Unified School District  shows the number of whites continues to decline, dropping to 39% this year from  41.4% a year ago and from 43% in 1988.  </P> <P> Latino enrollment continues to show large increases, rising to 25.6% from 23.2%  a year ago.  </P> <P> Black enrollment remained steady at 16.2%, Filipino enrollment remained at 8%  and Indochinese enrollment rose to 7.7% from 7.6% a year ago, the report  indicates.  </P> <P> The latest figures continue a trend that has seen white enrollment decline from  more than 80,000 students in 1976 to 46,000, while minority enrollment has  increased from 41,000 to 72,000.  </P> <P> Total district enrollment is 118,600 students, now exceeding 1976 levels, after  having dropped to fewer than 110,000 students in the early 1980s. White  enrollment is even smaller in the district's 107 elementary schools, at 37.8%.  The drop compounds district problems in maintaining integration programs and  puts greater pressure on administrators to boost achievement of Latino and  black students, who lag behind Asian and white students.  </P> <P> Throughout the county, 57% of all students are white, 23.2% Latino, 8.3% black,  5% Filipino and 4.9% Indochinese.  </P> <P> San Diego city schools trustees Tuesday asked Supt. Tom Payzant for additional  data on whether white enrollment is dropping proportionately to school  population growth in the northern areas of the city, which are covered by the  suburban San Dieguito and Poway school districts.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> ARGUMENT BREWS OVER WATER RULES  </P> <P> Ventura and its largest water supplier, the Casitas Municipal Water District,  are battling over whose water conservation rules apply inside the city limits.  </P> <P> Although Ventura has reduced its reliance on Lake Casitas water by 30% this  year, the dispute is prompting Casitas directors to consider rationing  Ventura's supply.  </P> <P> "We're kind of at loggerheads with them, but we're still negotiating," said  James W. Coultas, Casitas board president. "We feel it would be unfair to allow  things inside the city limits we wouldn't allow outside."  </P> <P> Ventura officials says Casitas may not have the legal right to impose its rules  inside the city, he said.  </P> <P> The Casitas water district, which includes about half the city west of Mills  Road, provides 40% of Ventura's water supply.  </P> <P> The district and the city imposed different bans on water hookups in April.  </P> <P> Ventura's hookup ban exempts some building projects that Casitas refuses to  allow for at least another year in the Ojai Valley. Lots for single family  houses, business expansions and affordable housing projects that can still  receive city water are denied by Casitas unless issued a promise letter before  April.  </P> <P> 'We are continuing to talk to Casitas about our concerns about the  differences," said Carole Green, city spokeswoman. 'We are certainly complying  with their ordinance and our ordinance."  </P> <P> While Ventura has not promised water to any projects Casitas would deny,  Coultas said city officials have indicated they may do so soon.

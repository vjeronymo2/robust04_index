Mr. Ople clearly detailed the heated and dramatic  exchanges over the national budget in his long article about it  in the Bulletin.    The hard work of Mr. De Venecia, the Speaker of the House,  on  the budget debates deserves high praise. And his team of  legislators hardly had any sleep during the debates on the  budget bill while they were working on their respective  assignments. At the top of the list are the two seasoned  lawmakers, Rony Zamora and Mr. Raul Daza, of the Liberal Party.    Likewise, on the Senate side, a lot can be said about the  leadership qualities of Mr. Ed Angara, the President of the  Senate. Neither did the senators have any sleep during the past  week. Maceda and Ople are the most conscientious of all. Not  far behind those two are F. Tatad, Tito Sotto, and Mr. Boy  Herrera, who despite all obstacles, did not cease scrutinizing  and commenting on the budget. So also with the four female  senators, S. Rasul, L. Shahani, Gloria Macapagal and Coseteng,  all active in studying, questioning and streamlining the  national budget.    It seems that there were no lazy legislators in the House  and  the Senate. Everyone was hard at work. Thus, there will be no  resentment during the upcoming long vacation of the legislature.    The controversial CDF (Countryside Development Fund) was  also  included in the budget. The decision-making powers of President  Ramos have increased concerning what is dear to him. The  President now has the authority to utilize this fund wherever or  whenever there is calamity, destruction, or extreme deprivation  in society.    Apparently the legislature has full confidence in Mr. Ramos  and deservedly so. Ramos does not convey the image of a man  desirous of acquisitions. And this image must not be ruined  even if he prefers to be surrounded by people eager to wheel and  deal.    Of all the provisions in the budget, the countryside funds  are the most important. It is a new concept that can help  considerably in improving the economy in the provinces. There  are some people who believe that it should be plainly labelled  `pork-barrel.' In areas where the fund is wisely spent, the  residents are pleased. They view the government as caring and  loving. Feeder roads, schoolhouses, Artesian wells...These are  some of the things that can be funded by the CDF.    Without this (i.e., the CDF), our senators and congressmen  are just like mannequins. They will simply have to wait on the  good graces of the President or of the Cabinet members. And  many of the Cabinet members have one qualification for office:  Arrogance.    The education budget is barely adequate. It should have been  much bigger; however, there are still other priorities. The  national budget is huge; hence, Vizons-Chato, Parayno, and  whoever becomes the `Pagcor', must expedite tax collection for  the country's needs. And those of you who are economically  well-off, do pay your taxes for our future's sake.</p>

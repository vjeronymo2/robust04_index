			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONTOYA DEAL WORTH $1.45 MILLION  </P> <P> Did someone say Max Montoya's reported $650,000-a-year contract makes him the  highest-paid Raider offensive lineman ever?  </P> <P> Actually, he'll make more than that.  </P> <P> A source familiar with the details of the contract said it's a two-year,  $1.45-million deal, composed of:  </P> <P>  -- A $50,000 "relocation" bonus.  </P> <P>  -- A $550,000 salary plus a $100,000 reporting bonus this season.  </P> <P>  -- A $650,000 salary plus a $100,000 reporting bonus in 1991.  </P> <P> On an annual basis, Montoya's contract beats the three-year, $1.8-million  package the 49ers gave Dave Waymer, the biggest Plan B total contract of this  off-season.

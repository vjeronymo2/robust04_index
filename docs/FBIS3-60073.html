			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Newspaper of the Airwaves, Second Edition" </F> newscast]    [Text] President Alberto Fujimori has announced that drug  trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, also known as El  Vaticano, will receive a life sentence. The president said that  the drug trafficker, who was deported from Colombia, was one of  the leading drug traffickers in Alto Huallaga and his capture is  comparable to Abimael Guzman's.    [Begin recording] [Fujimori] Chavez Penaherrera moved  approximately 30 tons of drugs monthly and had his own airport  in Campanilla. Every month he made approximately 40 flights and  collected a total of $30 million. He was the main cocaine  supplier for the Cali Cartel, which, in turn, exported almost 90  percent of that cocaine to the (United States). In short, this  has truly been a harsh blow to the drug trade.    [Unidentified reporter] What sentence will he get?    [Fujimori] We have passed very timely legislation on drug  trafficking. Now we can give El Vaticano the maximum sentence:  life in prison. There can be no doubt of that. I believe that  for narcoterrorism, El Vaticano's capture is comparable to that  of Abimael Guzman.    [Reporter] [question indistinct]    [Fujimori] I repeat, two. (La Calena and Calavera) are  brothers who have already been captured. [Editorial note: `La  Calena' is Chavez Penaherrera's sister Berta Chavez and  `Calavera' is Chavez Penaherrera's brother Humberto] There is  an entire network of people who are involved and they have  either been captured or are being investigated. This capture  constitutes a terrible setback for narcoterrorism. [end  recording]    This is what President Fujimori said at the closing of the  academic year at the National Fine Arts School. The president  announced that a new fine arts institute is going to be built.</p>

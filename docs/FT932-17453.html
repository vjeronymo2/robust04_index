			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Printing groups face more charges FOUR Japanese printing companies were indicted yesterday on charges of violating an anti-monopoly law by rigging bids for special seal supply contracts with a government agency, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. The indictment, brought by the Tokyo High Public Prosecutor's Office, follows criminal charges filed against the four in late February by the Fair Trade Commission, Japan's anti-monopoly watchdog. The latest indictment suggests the authorities are taking a firmer stand against activities seen as limiting competition unfairly. It comes amid indications that Japan's large construction companies routinely donated a proportion of proceeds from public works contracts to the ruling Liberal Democratic party, operating in a cosy club-like culture. Dai Nippon Printing, Japan's largest printing company, Toppan Moore, Hitachi Information Systems and Kobayashi Kirokushi are charged with illegally arranging the winners of contracts to supply the social insurance agency with seals fixed to postcards sent to notify recipients of pension pay-ments. The prosecutors claim that by fixing the bids the companies earned about Y1.59bn (Pounds 9.1m). They are believed to have continued to rig bids despite an FTC order last April to stop. Their defiance led the Prosecutor's Office, which has already brought criminal charges against 10 officials of the four companies directly involved in the bid rigging, to allege the companies themselves had violated Article 3 of the anti-monopoly law, which bans practices unfairly limiting transactions. Under anti-monopoly rules which came into effect in January the companies could face fines of up to Y100m, up from the previous maximum of Y5m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] After signing the Chapultepec Declaration this  morning in Government House, and despite the fact that he does  not agree with "the unfounded campaigns directed at personal  reputations," President Juan Carlos Wasmosy stated that his  administration is committed to the unrestricted free development  of the press.    In the Independence Hall of Government House the chief of  state stressed that the signing of the document was another way  of following up on his democratic convictions, as well as on his  pledge to the Paraguayan people that he would comply with the  Constitution and see to it that it was complied with.    "Before signing this document, I have with satisfaction  verified that its contents perfectly reflect the reality of my  country regarding freedom of expression," the chief of state  emphasized.    Wasmosy recalled a saying of former U.S. President Thomas  Jefferson, who said that if he had to choose between a  government and a free press, he would not hesitate to opt for  the latter at the expense of the former.    "He stressed this at a time when as president of the United  States he was the favorite target of a series of cruel  pamphlets. The names of those yellow publications have already  been forgotten, while the figure of Jefferson continues to grow  in the esteem of his people," the chief of state said, alluding  to his current situation with respect to a certain sector of the  media.    "I cannot find a better maxim than this one to describe my  feelings regarding the media," he said.    Wasmosy expressed his disagreement with what he termed  "personal slander campaigns," although he did not mention  specifics. He did, however, allege "that at no time can there be  any doubt about the commitment" of his administration "to  maintain and encourage unrestricted freedom."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance Secretary Gianfranco Fini </F> by Alessandro Caprettini in Rome; date not given: "Fini:  `United So as Not To Lose Votes'" --first paragraph is  L'INDIPENDENTE introduction]    [Text] No message, perish the thought, but [National  Alliance, AN leader] Gianfranco Fini does have a suggestion for  [League Secretary] Bossi and the people of the League, who will  be holding their rally at Pontida today: "Look ahead.... Stop  steering by the stars, otherwise you run the risk of losing your  bearings." And if there is one thing that the AN leader wants  to avoid, it is this government running onto the rocks. If  anything, his dream is of the executive going from strength to  strength and a close pact between Forza Italia, League, and the  AN.    [Caprettini] Is it a single majority party that you would  like to see emerge, Fini?    [Fini] I see a single party as a difficult goal to achieve,  almost impossible, at least for the time being. But I think  there is a case for forming a single electoral group. Take the  local elections: Some second ballots have the AN and Forza  Italia versus the League. These are wasted opportunities. The  same thing happened in the general election. We lost out.  Meanwhile, they have made a deal on the Left....    [Caprettini] [Interior Minister] Maroni seems willing to  consider your proposal, but not Bossi. Do you see signs of a  split in the League?    [Fini] No. I think they are speaking different languages  owing to the fact that Maroni is working to strengthen the  majority from his position as a minister, while Bossi is  claiming greater freedom of action as secretary. The main thing  is for them not to start playing clever....    [Caprettini] How do you explain Bossi's sorties?    [Fini] He is going through an unsettling period, with the  election defeat in a lot of northern towns, such as Verona and  Como, and the break with Miglio, which has left his federalist  flank very exposed. Then, above all, he has a strategic  problem. Until 26 March it was easy for him to present himself  as an alternative to the system....    [Caprettini] You are making allowances....    [Fini] No, it is just that I understand what he is going  through at the moment. I respect the man who has come to a  crossroads.    [Caprettini] But, now that you know him better, what do you  think of Bossi?    [Fini] He says what he thinks. He is not at all  "constructed." The speeches that he is giving at the moment are  an admission of the crisis that the League is going through.  However, my comment is that it is important for them to choose  a course of action once and for all, looking ahead and avoiding  clever tricks and antics.... For instance, I do not like his  launching the idea of an independentist current within the  League when he knows perfectly well that there is a definite  government agreement on the unity of the state. His  announcement of a labor party with a nudge and a wink to the  Left, while even Maroni was tugging at his sleeve, strikes me as  out of place. I appreciate that he feels caught between the  devil and the deep blue sea, but I should like to understand  what his real intentions are.    [Caprettini] Will he make them clear at Pontida today?    [Fini] I will be interested to see, but I do not have great  hopes. These rallies usually serve the purpose of galvanizing  the grass roots. His appeal will be more to party pride.    [Caprettini] Bossi fears Berlusconi, but you do not. Why  not?    [Fini] The identity of the AN is now well established. For a  couple of months, we sailed through a storm of allegations, but  we confirmed our strength in the European elections, and in many  cities, such as Rome, we have maintained our leading position.  This is why I do not fear deals with Forza Italia.    [Caprettini] But Bossi would have none of it....    [Fini] True, he justifies his stance on the grounds that the  League has to defend its identity. I remember I told him: "You  can get away with it in the European elections, where there is  proportional representation, but you will be running an enormous  risk in the local elections." The outcome has proved me right,  even leaving aside the fact that where there are AN and Forza  Italia candidates in the second ballot, the League's electorate  will end up by opting for us....    [Caprettini] Are you quite sure?    [Fini] Sure I am sure! The majority of the League's  electorate does not have a labor-voting soul. These are people  who voted for the League because it was the sole representative  of free-market tendencies. What is more, was Maroni not  supposed to be the party's left wing? And is he not the  staunchest supporter of the three-way electoral deal?    [Caprettini] Meanwhile, however, there is friction between  AN  and the League as regards regional electoral reform....    [Fini] Yes, and here I must put my foot down. [Institutional  Reform Minister] Speroni and the League must not think that they  can solve their problems by offloading them onto the government.  Regional electoral laws? Impossible, not least because the  regional governments elected in 1990 still have parties that  have since been wiped out in positions of strength, while other  parties -- such as Forza Italia -- are not represented. What  needs drafting, therefore, is a national bill, maybe framework  legislation.... But it is inconceivable that it should be  others -- some of them dead and buried -- who decide.    [Caprettini] What should be done about reforming the  parliamentary election system?    [Fini] Here we must remember that [Radical leader]  Pannella's  referendum is just around the corner. So what should we do?  Either we draft a bill or we go ahead with the referendum. And  if the choice should be the British system, how can we avoid  confronting the issue of an electoral deal at least within the  majority? Because it strikes me as obvious that, in either  case, we shall have to go back to the polls....</p>

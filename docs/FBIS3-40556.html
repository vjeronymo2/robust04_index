			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "American Minister's Visit to Pakistan"] </F>   [Text] Ms. Robin Raphael, the U. S. assistant secretary for  South Asian affairs, has arrived in Pakistan to start  negotiations with Pakistani government officials and political  leaders. On her arrival in Pakistan on Sunday, she met with the  acting President Mr. Wasim Sajjad, Prime Minister Benazir  Bhutto, and opposition leader Nawaz Sharif. Ms. Raphael's  meeting with Benazir Bhutto is considered very important, and U.  S. Ambassador John Minjo and Pakistani Foreign Secretary  Sheharyar Khan were also present at the meeting. It was learned  that these talks began with discussion of India-Pakistan  relations and the Kashmir problem. The United States had assured  that it would support efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue in  the United Nations. Ms. Raphael said that the Kashmir issue  would be resolved according to the UN resolutions. The United  States had advised that the nuclear programs in South Asian  countries be frozen, rolled back, and then destroyed. It was  assured that no pressure would be put on any country  unilaterally to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. If  what Ms. Raphael has said represents the Clinton  administration's policy, then we should understand that U. S.  policy on Pakistan is changing.    Pakistan and America have very old relations, and Pakistan  still desires good relations. However, we cannot deny that it  was the United States that brought about the coolness in the  bilateral relations. It has always tried to take advantage of  Pakistan's friendships through some agreements, and has never  considered Pakistan's needs and interests. It is especially true  when we had problems with India, and during trying times, the  United States not only left Pakistan alone, but also took steps  to benefit India.    In the context of the nuclear program, the U. S. policy  seems  to want to make India a powerful country in this region. Under  the Pressler Amendment, military and economic aid to Pakistan  has remained suspended. A few months ago, the United States  threatened that it would declare Pakistan a terrorist nation  just to please India. Therefore, believing that the United  States has changed its policy over Kashmir's nuclear program and  other issues could be premature. Since the United States itself  is responsible for the tension and cool relations between the  two countries, it should take the initiative in improving this  relationship, and must provide facts to support its intentions.</p>

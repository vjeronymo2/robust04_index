			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has concluded that a reasonable amount of flexibility exists in the Section 404 regulatory program to protect wetlands in Alaska from adverse impacts, while allowing wetlands development in appropriate circumstances. The flexibility of the Section 404 regulatory program is evident in the review process for individual permits, the application of general permits and other authorizing mechanisms, and the statistical record of the permit program in Alaska. Consequently, EPA has concluded that the additional ``flexibility'' offered by the proposed rule, i.e., eliminating the avoidance and compensatory mitigation requirements, is overly broad and unwarranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The existing flexibility in the section 404 permitting program is reflected in permitting statistics. First, it is important to note that the section 404 regulatory program does not prohibit development in wetlands or other waters of the U.S. In the U.S., as many as 60,000 discharges per year are authorized under the section 404 program. Well over 80% of all actions subject to section 404 are authorized by the Corps via general permits, which authorize categories of activities to proceed without an individual permit application. General permits efficiently allow actions with minimal impacts to proceed with little if any administrative burden, while allowing regulators and others to concentrate attention on activities with the potential for significant impacts. At present, there are 36 nationwide general permits that authorize such activities as placement of outfall structures, road crossings, utility line backfill, boat ramps, farm buildings, and minor discharges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Alaska, roughly 900 discharges are authorized annually under Section 404. On average, general permits account for over 70% of these authorized actions. In addition to the nationwide general permits, the Alaska District currently has 21 regional general permits in effect in the State, four of which apply Statewide. Response times for general permits that require action by the Corps average 11 days in Alaska.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For those activities that require individual permits, the Alaska District's denial rate for individual permits is only four percent. Although about 35% of these applications may be withdrawn by the applicant, in most cases, withdrawals of individual permits are not tantamount to denial. For example, a number of withdrawn actions are due to reduction of project impacts to the point that a general permit is applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permit decisions are generally made within 60&hyph;90 days from the date an application is complete. However, larger or controversial projects may take 120 days or more to evaluate. More lengthy permit reviews generally occur in instances when the project site is located in an environmentally sensitive area such as high value wetlands, where there is strong opposition from the public or local governments, or it is determined that an Environmental Impact Statement is necessary. During fiscal year 1993, the Alaska District completed its evaluations of individual permit applications in an average time of 106 days. However, the average evaluation time for all permit actions, including general permits, was 37 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corps Alaska District has worked with the State of Alaska to coordinate the timing of the State and Federal review of proposed permit actions. The State's coastal zone questionnaire is included with all Corps application packages; the Corps and the State share the lead for setting up pre-application coordination meetings with interested State and Federal resource agencies; the State has agreed to accept the Corps application as application for State 401 Water Quality Certification whenever the Corps determines the activity could result in a discharge to waters of the U.S.; the District includes State public notices with its public notice and handles State legal notices (but not payment) for the activity; the District mails an advance copy of complete applications to the State 401 and Coastal Zone Management (CZM) agencies prior to going to public notice; the District notifies the CZM offices of all actions advertised the previous week; and the State has agreed to accept the District's determination for minor permit modifications subject to expedited review (the State may reverse this determination and require a full State review whenever they determine this to be appropriate).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regarding other authorizing mechanisms, the Corps District Engineers uses general permits and alternative permit processing procedures such as letters of permission, regional general permits, and joint procedures. It is intended that these alternative procedures be used in instances where there are minimal impacts and/or adequate environmental safeguards in order to: (1) Reduce delay and/or (2) avoid duplication of efforts where other agencies have ongoing permit programs for activities also regulated by the Corps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to note that the Corps is presently developing two rulemakings to further address the concerns of timeliness and accuracy of permit decisions. The first proposal would generally require the Corps to reach a permit decision in a maximum of 90 days. The second proposal would establish an administrative appeals process for jurisdictional determinations, permit denials, and administrative penalties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

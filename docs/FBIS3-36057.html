			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 01, BNS--The Representative Assembly of  Estonia's Russian-speaking Population proposes to arrange this  year a forum of the country's democratic forces to mark the 50th  anniversary of Estonia's liberation from fascist occupation.    The assembly suggests that the forum work out a program for  joint action under the motto, "For healing the society, against  nationalism, interethnic animosity and moral degradation."    "The seemingly eradicated fascism is again raising its head,  sometimes under the guise of false liberalism, sometimes hiding  behind patriotic slogans, and sometimes even quite openly," the  assembly said in a statement adopted at its Jan. 29 session.  "Not to notice it is dangerous; not to take action, criminal."    The assembly calls on all Estonian social and political  forces to aim their efforts at stabilizing the society,  improving interethnic relations and "guaranteeing human rights  in reality."</p>

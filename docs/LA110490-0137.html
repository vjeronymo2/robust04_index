			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE READERS RESPOND TO 'MOVIEMAKERS, MOVIE CRITICS AND YOU';  </P> <P> THE CHICKEN OR THE EGG  </P> <P> The comments defining the moviemakers' primary audience as the "under-25 age  group" seem to more reflect their decision to play to that group than the fact  that anyone over 25 is less interested and will spend less money to go to the  movies.  </P> <P> Maybe the decrease in interest among those of us in that category is because  Hollywood doesn't try for something beyond violence, motor car chases,  bed-hopping, etc. There are some really good films, but one has to be on the  alert and search. That's where the critic comes in.  </P> <P> MARILYN AVERY, Calabasas  </P></p>

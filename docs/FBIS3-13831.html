During the  visit, the king will meet with His Majesty Sultan Qabus  Bin-Sa'id. On Wednesday [23 March], the king will head for Doha  on a visit to Qatar to meet with His Highness Shaykh Hamad  Bin-Khalifah Al Thani.    King Husayn will be accompanied, during this tour, by an  official delegation including Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam  al-Majali, Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, and a  number of advisers and ministers.    Yesterday, the king met with Nasir Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz,  ambassador of the State of Qatar in Amman, and reviewed with him  the fraternal ties and the current Arab situation.    Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said that King Husayn's  visit to Oman and Qatar comes within the framework of the  fraternal ties between Jordanian and these two countries. In a  statement to AL-RA'Y, Dr. al-'Anani said: Jordan has called for  a review of the nature of inter-Arab relations, which must be  based on mutual respect, and for restoring these relations apart  from the impact of the oil era and the misinterpretation of the  Jordanian stand during the Gulf war. He added that Jordan has  explained its position many times.    Dr. al-'Anani noted that Jordanian-Qatari relations have  witnessed significant improvement since the Gulf war, adding  that the joint economic agreement has been renewed and many  agreements in the fields of education, trade exchange, and  information have been revived.    Regarding relations with Oman, Dr. al-'Anani said that our  bilateral relations are cordial and fraternal, noting that  coordination between the two countries has never stopped.    The information minister spoke about Jordan's international  role with regard to its forces taking part in UN peacekeeping  missions. He said that this role will develop with time due to  increasing respect for the reputation of these forces because of  their high efficiency, capability, and discipline.    Dr. al-'Anani said the decision to suspend the peace talks  was made after coordination among the Arab delegations following  the massacre of the Ibrahimi Mosque. He noted that the massacre  has spoiled the general atmosphere of the talks and underscored  basic issues that must be raised before continuing the talks,  the most important of which is the security of the Palestinians.  He said that the decision to return to the negotiating table  will be made after coordination with these states.    Dr. al-'Anani said that Jordan has always called for an end  to the human rights violations perpetrated by Israel against the  Palestinians, noting that these practices contradict the peace  process.    The information minister reiterated the need for continuous  consultation between Jordan and the PLO, noting that His Majesty  King Husayn has always stressed this. He added that the king  also stressed that consultation and coordination should be held  within the framework of the peace process itself, not the  post-peace stages.</p>

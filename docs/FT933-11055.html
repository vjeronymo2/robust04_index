			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Major sets date to testify at Iraq arms probe: Lord Justice Scott tells Jimmy Burns which present and former ministers he would like to give evidence MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, is to give evidence in public to the inquiry into arms exports to Iraq on January 17, it was announced yesterday. Mr Major released a copy of a letter sent yesterday in reply to one sent to him on July 14 by Sir Richard Scott, the Appeal Court judge, who is presiding over the inquiry, inviting him to appear as witness in the week beginning December 13. The change of date was agreed to fit in with Mr Major's other December engagements. The prime minister is expected to be questioned about the extent to which he knew about crucial Whitehall decisions relating to arms exports while he was foreign secretary and later as chancellor. In an interview with the Financial Times yesterday - his first since he was chosen to lead the inquiry last December - Sir Richard outlined a list of present and former ministers he wants to give evidence before Christmas. They include: Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister; former foreign office ministers Mr Timothy Renton, Lord Howe, Mr William Waldegrave, Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr David Mellor and Mr Tristan Garel-Jones; former trade ministers Mr Peter Lilley and Mr Alan Clark; and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The judge has not ruled out taking evidence from two former heads of the Ministry of Defence's defence exports sales organisation - Sir James Blyth, now chief executive of Boots, and Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive of Vickers. He is yet to take a decision on Sir John Cuckney, who was chairman of International Military Services, the government-owned defence sales company, between 1974-85. Sir Richard has asked for additional documents - believed to include CIA material - from the Gonzalez Congressional banking committee in the US, which has been looking at the financing of an alleged covert Iraqi procurement network in the 1980s. Sir Richard said the inquiry had taken longer than he had expected and described it as looking 'into a very murky and inaccurate crystal ball'  - the world of arms trading and the machinery of Whitehall. He now planned to have his report completed by the end of March, not by Christmas as originally thought. In his letter to Mr Major, Sir Richard said delays in obtaining some government documents had 'hindered the efficiency of the questioning of witnesses'. But he emphasised: 'I have not had any impression of any deliberate attempts to withhold information, no civil servants or ministers have dragged their feet about appearing as witnesses. 'As to the answering of questions by witnesses, some witnesses have been forthcoming and extrovert in the way they answer questions and some have not. One knows that as a judge from witness-box appearances. At the end of the day, one has to consider the evidence as a whole and make one's mind up as to what to make of it.' Sir Richard will use the inquiry's summer recess to begin writing his introduction to the report and to sift through additional documents. He said it was too early to be drawn on the report's conclusions and warned against exaggerated expectations concerning its potential political fall-out. 'I do not see myself as holding a gun pointing at the heart of government.' Sir Richard said he did not think his terms of reference include proposals for anti-secrecy laws such as a freedom of information act or rules on public immunity certificates, which are used by the government to restrict access to confidential documents. 'I find it quite unlikely that I am going to be recommending any sort of legislation on (public immunity) . . . because I think it is essentially the sort of area that ought to be left to be developed flexibly,' he said. But he indicated that the evidence he had heard pointed to the need for reform of exports and licensing procedures and a conclusion which could act as an incentive for ministers and civil servants to govern more openly in future. One of the main reasons for the delay in the inquiry's proceedings had been his discovery that companies may have been been getting round legal restrictions on arms exports to Iraq by obtaining 'open licences' to export to other Middle East countries such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia, which are not subject to the stricter licensing regime and can be used as diversionary routes. He was only now beginning to get the documentation on open licensing contracts from government departments. 'I do not know how far the implications of this extend, but this is plainly an area which could quite possibly have been used for a number of exports to Iraq, without any breach of statutory export regulations.' Sir Richard rejected the argument that his report should not consider matters of ethics and public accountability in the government's handling of its export policy to Iraq. 'I think government should be prepared to share with the public, on whose behalf they govern, its concerns and aims and the reasons why important decisions are taken. 'I know, that in many cases that is not practical for reasons of security and other overriding national interest that may from time to time arise, but as a general proposition, I do not think that government (policy), on behalf of the public, that is kept from the public, is to be recommended.' Sir Richard said he had been 'persuaded' by MI5 and MI6 that it would be wrong to identify intelligence officers who had appeared as witnesses in private or reveal the content of their evidence in his report where it related to their operations. Additional intelligence information made available to the judge includes that on the Iraqi supergun project. 'I think the personal safety of some of the witnesses would be put at risk (if they were identified) and that is not a risk I am prepared at any degree to run. If you are going to have intelligence agencies and secret services, they had better be kept secret. Otherwise there is no point in having them at all.' Even so he said the government had 'certainly shown itself to be over-secretive in the handling of documents' - a reference to last year's Matrix Churchill trial in which the government's had tried to keep classified documents from defence counsel. 'All the documents which have come to us have various differing degrees of confidentiality or secrecy, according to government criteria. I do not regard myself bound by any of these criteria. I have said that to government and I think they accept that position.' He said he no reason to doubt the government's pledge that the report would be published as written by him and without any 'cuts' by government departments. What will not be made available to the public will be an appendix of evidence gathered from intelligence agents. Sir Richard rejected criticism of the inquiry's cost - 'a good deal cheaper than a court case' - and dismissed suggestions that it involved time-wasting: itably involves the time and co-operation' of Whitehall. Sir Richard said: 'The reason the inquiry was set up in the first place was because of a serious degree of public disquiet over what had been happening in government in connection with arms to Iraq. If the inquiry is going to serve its proper function, I think it is necessary that the nettle is grasped and that the maximum part is held in public.' He added: 'If you are going to have an inquiry, you had better have a thorough one and put up with the price that has to be paid for that thoroughness.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- At a session today of the  assembly of the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) Prime  Minister-designate Borislav Mikelic proposed a new Krajina  government and outlined its program.    According to Mikelic's proposal for a multiparty cabinet,  Milan Babic would become a new foreign minister, Rade Tanjga  defense minister, and Ilija Prijic interior minister.    Milivoj Kricka, minister of energy and mining, and Ljubisa  Budic, minister of urban planning, construction, and housing,  who were in Djordje Bjegovic's cabinet, are expected to keep  their posts in the new government.    Boro Rasuo has been proposed for the post of information  minister and Uros Funduk for the post of justice minister.  Stevan Djuric and Ratko Veselinovic have been proposed for the  posts of health and development and industry ministers.    Other candidates are Dragutin Polic (culture and religion),  Milan Padjen (transport and communications), and Stevan Ratkovic  (education).    Milos Vojinovic has been proposed for the post of sport and  physical education minister, Simo Sijan for the post of  agriculture minister, and Mile Bosnic for the post of trade  minister.    Mikelic proposed the assembly nominate three deputy prime  ministers, while several vacated posts leave a possibility of  including representatives of the Serbian Radical Party in the  government.    Addressing the deputies, Mikelic said that "at a time  between  war and peace in which Krajina has found itself, the priority  tasks are defense and the economic recovery of the country." He  stressed that the most difficult phase was "behind us," which  does not mean that there will be no more pressures on the RSK.    Speaking about Krajina's foreign policy, he said that a  political solution for relations with Croatia could be found  only through negotiations, and that at the end the people of  Krajina would decide about their future in a referendum. They  will no doubt decide to live together with other Serb countries,  i.e., states, Mikelic stressed.    In connection with that, he stressed that the reintegration  of Krajina into Croatia is only wishful thinking on Tudjman's  part. Mikelic believes that a speedy international recognition  and the division of assets between the RSK and Croatia mark the  path toward the end of the state of war.    Mikelic spoke in favor of the Serb Army of Krajina becoming  a  professional army. When an effective defense system is  established, many experts will be have more time to help  relaunch production, which is currently employing only 36,000  workers. Before the war, 127,000 people worked in industry,  agriculture, and other branches of economy. This figure best  illustrates the current state of the economy. Therefore,  speaking about the economic policy for this year, Mikelic  specified steps that need to be taken, especially in agriculture.    He paid particular attention to the strengthening and the  building of a law-governed state, the efficiency of the  administrative and judicial bodies, and the creation of  conditions for a market economy and entrepreneurship.    As regards pensioners, he will urge that one of the  conditions for the resumption of the process of negotiations  with Croatia be that Croatia should pay out pensions to those  people who were contributing to the pension fund of the Republic  of Croatia; these number 40,000. As the second condition for  the resumption of the process of negotiations, he demanded the  abolition of UN Security Council resolution 820.    Mikelic also urged the creation of conditions for the return  of around 350,000 refugees from the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia and abroad.    Mikelic's economic program is based on close links with the  Republic of Serbia and Yugoslavia. In this connection he said  that the republic of Serb Krajina must harmonize its laws with  Yugoslavia, so that the process of the overall economic, social,  and spiritual integration should speed up.    The assembly is continuing the session by discussing the  program and the government appointments.</p>

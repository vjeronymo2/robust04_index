			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Output hit by recession on the Continent: Manufacturing production falls 0.4% THE INDUSTRIAL recovery faltered during the summer as recession in continental Europe caused manufacturing industry's production to drop in the three months to the end of August. The Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that manufacturing output fell by a seasonally-adjusted 0.4 per cent in August and was only 1.1 per cent higher than in August last year. Because of strong output by gas, electricity and water companies and robust production in the crude oil and natural gas sectors, overall industrial production increased marginally by 0.1 per cent in August and was 2.3 per cent higher than in August last year. Taking figures for the latest three months, which the CSO regards as a better guide to overall developments, manufacturing output in the June to August period was 0.7 per cent lower than in the previous three months but 1.2 per cent up on the same period of last year. Overall production was up 0.8 per cent compared with March to May, reflecting a 17.7 per cent jump in oil and natural gas production as most of the UK's oil fields returned to full production after summer maintainance shutdowns. It also reflected a 4.3 per cent rise in electricity, gas and water supply, as a result of increased demand because of the cooler-than-average summer. Total industrial production rose 2.6 per cent in June to August compared with the same months last year. In the latest period, production by the mining and quarrying industries increased 14.2 per cent, reflecting 24.3 per cent growth in oil and natural gas extraction which more than offset a 26 per cent decline in coal output. Electricity, gas and water output in the three months was 6 per cent higher than the year before. CSO statisticians said industrial production in the latest three months may have been slightly depressed by the late May bank holiday which resulted in continuing plant holidays in June. But they scaled back their estimate of the annual trend growth in output to about 1 per cent in August from 1.5 per cent in July and around 5 per cent between March and May this year. The Treasury was relatively unruffled by the decline in output, explaining it reflected 'in large part the weakness in export markets'. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said he believed that the UK was 'still on course' to deliver growth of about 3 per cent by the middle of next year. However, the CSO figures showed that only one of the broad manufacturing subsectors increased its output in the latest three months. This was the coke, nuclear fuels and petrol refining sector which increased production by 2.3 per cent compared with March to May. The textiles, leather and clothing industries reported unchanged output with other broad subsectors reporting declines of up to 2 per cent in the case of basic metals and metal products.</p>

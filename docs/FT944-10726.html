			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sears Tower ownership transferred to trust Sears, Roebuck is transferring ownership of its landmark Sears Tower in Chicago, the world's tallest building, to a trust. Although it attracts 1.5m tourists a year, the tower has been a financial burden to the group. The US retail and insurance group, which is seeking cash for an expensive corporate restructuring, took out the existing mortgages on the 110-storey tower in 1990 after attempts to sell the building failed. The tower, built in 1970, was financed near the height of the US property boom and has suffered from high vacancy rates and competition from newer offices. Local property specialists estimate the tower's value at less than half of the mortgage amount, or about Dollars 400m. The arrangement frees Sears from interest payments on Dollars 850m in mortgage debt, which in recent years have far exceeded rental income from the tower. The company said the debt restructuring would result in a Dollars 195m after-tax extraordinary gain in the fourth quarter, or about 50 cents a share. In addition, it expects to save about Dollars 75m a year in interest expenses. Although the tower is now 75 per cent leased, income still does not cover taxes and operating costs. Under the two-phase restructuring agreement, ownership of the tower and its related mortgages will pass to a trust that benefits AEW Partners, a Boston-based partnership of pension plans managed by Aldrich, Eastman and Waltch. AEW becomes responsible for overall management of the tower. AEW is secondary mortgage holder on the tower, with Metropolitan Life Insurance holding Dollars 600m of the tower's debt. In the second phase, AEW Partners will take ownership of the tower in 2003, a year earlier than under the previous mortgage agreement. AEW Partners will in 2005 have to meet the Dollars 600m mortgage commitment to Metropolitan Life.</p>

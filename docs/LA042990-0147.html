She designed more than 200 projects, mostly  residential, and was known for her use of natural materials and careful  integration of outdoor and indoor space.  </P> <P> Julia Morgan, the best known of the four, had an engineering degree from UC  Berkeley and was the first woman to graduate from the prestigious Ecole des  Beaux Arts. Among her more than 700 projects, Morgan designed the Hearst Castle  at San Simeon, the former Herald-Examiner building and five YMCAs in Los  Angeles, as well as homes for actress Marion Davis.  </P></p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Books: A mistress of repartee - AC Grayling on a remarkable portrait of salon life in 18th century Paris MADAME DU DEFFAND AND HER WORLD by Benedetta Craveri Halban Pounds 20, 481 pages Paris was a place of scandal during the period of the duc d'Orlean's regency in the early 18th century. Orgies were held in the Regent's rooms every evening, involving behaviour so lubricious that its contemporary chroniclers dared not name it. At the height of the Regent's excesses, shortly before his death, a young newly-married woman joined his bacchanalia and became his mistress. She was a sparklingly vivacious, witty woman with beautiful eyes: Marie de Vichy-Champrond, marquise du Deffand. This was a spectacular arrival on the social scene for a young woman not long out of convent school, not long married - and not long separated from her milk-sop husband. It presaged the rising of a new star in the French social firmament. Mme du Deffand became one of Paris's great salon hostesses, and because of her friendships with D'Alembert, Voltaire, the duchesse de Choiseul, and especially with Horace Walpole, she made substantial contributions to one of the 18th-century's richest literary traditions: the art of letter-writing. In this translation of her much-praised biography, Benedetta Craveri paints an extraordinarily rich portrait of Mme du Deffand and her world. It is not a biography in the straightforward sense, so it proves an advantage to know the outlines of Mme du Deffand's life before reading Craveri, whose primary concern is with the nuances of the marquise's complex relationships and their even more complex setting. Craveri explores both through the marquise's vast surviving correspondence, which shimmers with historical and literary fascinations. Mme du Deffand was born into an aristocratic family at Champrond in 1697. At her convent she preached irreligion to her fellow-pupils, so the Mother Abbess summoned the great Massillon to correct her. He failed, commenting as he left 'She is charming]' Her parents married her to a cousin, the marquis du Deffand, but they soon separated, whereupon Mme du Deffand began her career of dissipation. After the Regent's death she was for a long time a companion of the royal duchesse du Maine, who kept court at her chateau at Sceaux. The chief pastime there was theatricals. Here Mme du Deffand established her reputation as a wit and mistress of repartee; and here she enjoyed the best years of her long-standing affair with Jean-Francois Henault, president of the parlement of Paris. It was only in middle-age that Mme du Deffand established her own salon, based in the secular wing of the convent of St Joseph in Paris. Its handsome apartments were famously decorated in buttercup yellow watered silk decorated with flame-coloured bows, which visitors came from all over Europe to admire. It was a salon for aristocrats, not savants; with the exceptions of her lifelong friend Voltaire, D'Alembert - whom for a time she loved - and, briefly, Rousseau, she hated the philosophes, holding it against Diderot that he was such an ill-mannered lout that he used inadvertently to kick Catherine the Great's shins while explaining points of philosophy to her. Instead, her salon entertained aristocrats increasingly at odds with the new world of the Enlightenment, who looked back to the manners and values of the days of Louis XIV. At the age of 55 Mme du Deffand went blind. (Voltaire said 'she has been punished whereby she made others sin.') She employed Julie de Lespinasse to help her run her salon. While the clever and lovely Julie was at her side, the literati still attended; but then Mme du Deffand discovered that Julie and D'Alembert were having an affair, and that the literati arrived early to spend time with Julie on her own; so the women quarrelled, and Julie left, taking the literati with her. But the greatest was yet to be. Horace Walpole, gothic novelist son of the British Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole, became an habitue of Mme du Deffand's salon, and she - though 20 years his senior - fell in love with him. Walpole did not return the sentiment, but was drawn to her nonetheless by her intelligence and perceptive wit. As a result he drew her best work from her, in the form of letters. By his prompting and example he made Mme du Deffand reveal in her letters a high order of literary talent. Mme du Deffand suffered terribly from what she called ennui and she is one of the first true chroniclers of ennui as an existential agony. But despite it, she took by sheer force of character and intellect a position at the centre of French 18th century life, her intimate record of which is not only one of the great literary achievements of the time, but a great historical document.</p>

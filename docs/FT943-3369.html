			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: DRS Data shares drop 58% on fall in sales Shares in DRS Data &amp; Research Services, the scanning equipment manufacturer which came to the market in May, fell by 58 per cent yesterday after the company warned that uncertainty in education, the group's biggest market, had led to lower than expected sales. Shares in the Milton Keynes-based company closed 56p lower at 40p. The shares were placed in May at 110p, valuing the company at Pounds 40m. Mr John MacArthur, chairman, said that in the first months of the year sales into schools, which accounted for 70 per cent of turnover, were 6 per cent above the same period last year. However, by the end of the 28-week period sales into schools were down by 14 per cent. Turnover for the 28 weeks to July 15 fell from Pounds 6.87m to Pounds 5.76m. Mr MacArthur said he expected sales to schools to represent a 'smaller proportion of our growth in the future.' DRS was seeking to broaden its product base as well as expanding into other areas, including the health sector. DRS supplies scanners which can capture hand-written data, such as ticks on multiple-choice forms, for processing by computers. Pre-tax profits stood at Pounds 1.48m (Pounds 1.54m). Earnings per share were 3.19p (3.82p) and a 1p dividend is being paid.</p>

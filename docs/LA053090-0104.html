			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUEL LEAK PROMPTS NASA TO SCRUB LAUNCH OF SHUTTLE;  </P> <P> SPACE: ENGINEERS NOTICE THE PROBLEM WHEN THEY BEGIN PUMPING LIQUID HYDROGEN  INTO COLUMBIA. A NEW LIFTOFF TIME COULD BE ANNOUNCED TODAY.  </P> <P> The launch of the space shuttle Columbia was scrubbed Tuesday when liquid  hydrogen began leaking into the craft's engine compartment shortly after  engineers started pumping the highly explosive fuel into the shuttle's main  tank in preparation for a night launch.  </P> <P> The launch, already two weeks behind schedule, was postponed for at least 24  hours, but it probably will be delayed longer than that because it could take  some time for engineers to determine the cause of the leakage, officials said.  </P> <P> Although liquid hydrogen is explosive when it comes into contact with liquid  oxygen -- the other component in the shuttle's main fuel system -- engineers  insisted Tuesday that the vehicle was not in danger of exploding because the  problem was detected when only a trace amount of vapor was found in the engine  compartment.  </P> <P> "They shut it down to be safe," said Patricia Phillips, a spokeswoman for the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration. "You simply cannot have excess  hydrogen in what amounts to a controlled explosion at liftoff."  </P> <P> Engineers were to work through the night to try to determine the nature of the  problem, and a new launch date was expected to be announced sometime today.  </P> <P> The launch had been set for 9:38 p.m. PDT. The 10-day mission is the first to  be devoted to a single scientific discipline. The crew had not boarded Columbia  when the launch was scrubbed at 3:25 p.m.  </P> <P> Manned by seven astronauts, the largest crew since the January, 1986,  Challenger explosion, Columbia will be carrying the Astro observatory: three  ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray telescope that will photograph the  universe at wavelengths normally obscured by the Earth's atmosphere.  </P> <P> The astronauts will operate the four telescopes around the clock for nine days,  and perhaps 10 if their maneuvering fuel holds out, before packing them up and  bringing them home for reuse on a later shuttle mission.  </P> <P> Over the course of their mission, the astronauts are scheduled to make as many  as 300 separate observations of objects ranging from Comet Austin, which last  week made its closest approach to Earth, to quasars at the edge of the universe  -- and all at wavelengths that, because they are absorbed by the atmosphere,  have rarely been studied by astronomers in the past.  </P> <P> On this fourth shuttle mission of 1990 and the 36th overall, the astronauts  also will conduct an astronomy lesson from space for high school students, and  payload specialist Ronald A. Parise will use a ham radio to attempt to make  contact with cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station Mir.  </P> <P> The two spacecraft will have to be within 2,400 miles of each other for Parise  to make contact. If the attempt is successful, it will mark the first time that  astronauts and cosmonauts have had a direct radio link. In the historic 1975  Apollo-Soyuz linkup, all communications between the two craft were handled  through ground communications centers.  </P> <P> Columbia commander Vance D. Brand, who was a crew member on that linkup, has  been brushing up on his Russian for the occasion.  </P> <P> Brand, 58, a former aviator in the Marine Corps, will be making his fourth  space flight. In addition to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, he was commander of the  fifth shuttle mission in 1982, which was the first to launch a commercial  satellite, and commander of a 1984 mission.  </P> <P> Pilot Guy S. Gardner, 42, is an Air Force officer who flew 177 combat missions  in Southeast Asia in 1972 before becoming a test pilot instructor. This will be  his second shuttle flight; he was pilot of a Defense Department mission in  December, 1988.  </P> <P> Mission specialist John M. (Mike) Lounge, 43, is chief of the Space Station  Support Office, which is designing the Freedom space station. He will be making  his third shuttle flight. He was a mission specialist on an August, 1985,  flight in which an Australian communications satellite was launched and an  American satellite repaired.  </P> <P> The remaining four crew members all have doctorates in astronomy or  astrophysics.  </P> <P> Mission specialist Jeffrey Hoffman, 45, will be making his second flight. In  April, 1985, he made the first unscheduled spacewalk in an unsuccessful attempt  to rescue the malfunctioning Syncom IV-3 communications satellite.  </P> <P> Parker, 53, also will be making his second flight. A Caltech graduate, he  worked on the first Spacelab mission in November, 1983.  </P> <P> Parise, 38, and Samuel T. Durrance, 46, will be the first non-astronauts to fly  on the shuttle since the Challenger accident. Parise is an employee of Computer  Sciences Corp. of Silver Spring, Md. Durrance is a faculty member at Johns  Hopkins University in Baltimore.  </P> <P> Maugh reported from Kennedy Space Center and Dye from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

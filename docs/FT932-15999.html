			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / BMW to assemble cars in Vietnam BMW, THE GERMAN luxury carmaker, plans to assemble cars in Vietnam from next year, in a venture signalling the increased pace of the country's economic change. The company has signed an agreement to set up a sales, parts and service network in Vietnam, and intends to assemble up to 200 cars a year. The initial number of units is modest but Mr Bernd Wiegand, managing director for BMW Asia, said the decision was 'strategic' and reflected the company's confidence in the development of Vietnam and the availability of qualified labour. Manufacturing will be confined to the 316i and the 520i models, to be built out of assembly kits shipped from Germany. Some parts will be manufactured locally. The venture is important in Vietnam's quest for foreign investment, backed by radical economic reforms as the country moves away from central planning and state control, but hampered by a US embargo on business with the communist country and by poor infrastructure. Many foreign manufacturers, however, are attracted by a cheap labour force and by opportunities when the US ban is fully lifted and funding from international financial institutions begins to flow. Vietnam's motor industry is in its infancy and the road network in need of upgrading and repair, but many Vietnamese have cash savings which could be used to buy vehicles as the economy grows. The agreement with Vietnam Motors Corporation is a Dollars 10m (Pounds 7m) joint venture, 70 per cent owned by Columbian Motors of the Philippines (assembler of Japanese and South Korean cars in the Philippines) and 30 per cent by Hoa Binh, a state-owned bus manufacturer based in Hanoi.

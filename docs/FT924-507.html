			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Kembrey cuts losses back to Pounds 114,000 Kembrey, maker of electrical connectors and accessories, has cut its loss in the six months ended October 3 1992 to Pounds 114,000 after exceptional charges. That is set against the deficit of Pounds 517,000 in the second half of last year, after a Pounds 170,000 profit in the first. 'We expect the full year's figures to show a significant reduction in the losses of the previous year', said Mr David Burnet, chairman. He said the improvement over the second half arose mainly from reductions in interest to Pounds 382,000 (Pounds 439,000), losses from discontinued businesses at Pounds 152,000 (Pounds 365,000), and exceptional charges to Pounds 121,000 (Pounds 168,000).</p>

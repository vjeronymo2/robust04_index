			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Pakistan Dollars 1.7bn private-sector power deal THE Pakistan government and power authorities have signed a Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 890m) contract with a western consortium clearing the way for building a 1,292MW oil-fired power station at Hub Chowki, 50km west of Karachi. The project is the first undertaken by the private sector under the government's restructuring programme. By the time it is completed in four years, it will boost the country's power capacity by over 15 per cent. The contract, which has been under negotiation for more than four years, was signed by Mr SR Poonegar, secretary of the Water and Power Ministry; Mr Mumtaz Hameed, chairman of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), and Mr Mohammed Alireza, chairman of the Hab River Power Group (HubCo), set up to operate the power station. Mr Alireza is chairman of Saudi Arabia's Xenel Industries, the Hab project's chief sponsoring company. A project official, noting the deal has been nearly sewn up twice before, stressed that this time it had been signed, not just initialled. The stumbling block had been western bankers' concerns over the threat that Islamic, or interest-free, banking rules could have for the project. They had withheld a pledge to provide Dollars 360m in commercial finance for the scheme, but been assured under the implementation agreement in the overall contract that their investment would be protected, even if the Pakistan Supreme Court upheld an Islamic court ruling that charging interest was against the tenets of Islam. The other two aspects of the deal were the power purchase accord, covering the commercial tariffs at which HubCo will sell electricity into the national grid, and the fuel buying agreement, covering deliveries by the Pakistan State Oil Company of imported oil needed to run the power station. The project is being undertaken on a build-own-operate basis with the sponsors running the company as a self-contained, private-sector utility alongside the state-owned Wapda. The scheme was structured by the World Bank, which will provide one-third of the financing under its Private Sector Energy Development Fund. This provides long-term finance at commercial rates, with an upfront grace period. Its purpose is to broaden the private-sector equity investment in the new power company. The first power from the four 323MW units is expected in 40 months. Chief equipment suppliers are Japan's Mitsui (consortium leader), IHI of Japan (boilers), Ansaldo of Italy (turbines), and Campenon Bernard of France (civil engineering).

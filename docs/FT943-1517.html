			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Strong sales help Spandex score Pounds 3.3m Spandex, the distributor of computerised sign-making equipment, increased pre-tax profits by a third to Pounds 3.3m in the first half on the back of strong sales in most of its main markets. Turnover rose 17 per cent to Pounds 33.9m, with an underlying rise of 11 per cent boosted by the acquisition in March of what is now Spandex France. Earnings per share increased by 37 per cent to 6.3p (4.6p) and the interim dividend edged up to 0.75p (0.7p). Mr Charles Dobson, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Performance in all territories continues to advance and as the economic climate improves Spandex will benefit further.' In the UK sales overall were up by 21 per cent. Sign-making computers surged by 58 per cent, which the company attributed partly to the release of pent-up demand previously stifled by economic uncertainty. The increase also reflected the introduction of the Gerber Edge product. Sales in Germany rose by 6 per cent in local currency terms and Spandex is to spend Pounds 2.1m on a warehouse which should be completed in the first quarter of next year. The net interest bill fell from Pounds 293,000 to Pounds 67,000. Increased capital expenditure will push up gearing in the short term, but the company stressed that:'The expected rise in net debt is foreseen as being well within historic highs.' The shares, which have trebled in the last two years, added 5p to an all-time high of 280p.</p>

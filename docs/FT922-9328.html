			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Midland's twin tribunal The advantage in the battle for Midland seems to have switched to the Hongkong Bank. It is now almost certain that its bid will come under the jurisdiction of Brussels, while any bid from Lloyds will be referred to the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission. With luck, HSBC's bid could run its full course before a Lloyds offer was even cleared. Lloyds would thus be free to withdraw on the grounds that its preconditions had not been met. But it would surely be tempted to stand its ground as a spoiling tactic, whether or not it believed in its ability to convince the MMC. Midland's shareholders would then be in a quandary. The Lloyds bid is not only worth more than HSBC's, it also makes better strategic sense for both banks. But the final competition policy decision could go either way. Though Lloyds will be able to muster a strong lobby, the discreet support of other clearing banks worried about the introduction of fresh capital to an overcrowded market could be more of a hindrance than a help. It would amount to a collective plea by the industry to limit competition, which the MMC would surely find hard to swallow. Meanwhile HSBC would have a firm offer on the table, worth 30p more than Midland's share price yesterday thanks to a strong Hong Kong market. At this level it would be hard for the HSBC to justify an increase to its own shareholders, who have mistrusted the plan from the start. HSBC has underperformed its quoted Hang Seng Bank subsidiary by over 20 per cent since bid talks were revealed in March. It is scarcely likely that Midland holders could get out for cash at the current bid value if the deal went through. That explains why Midland's price is languishing at 389p. The time may be coming for holders to consider selling in the market.</p>

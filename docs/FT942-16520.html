			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Zulus defiant at S Africa summit: ANC prepares to tighten emergency measures in Natal South Africa's political crisis deepened yesterday after a summit between the country's top leaders failed to agree on ways to stop pre-election violence. After almost 12 hours of talks at an eastern Transvaal game reserve, the country's four most important political leaders - President FW de Klerk, Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha Freedom party leader, and Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini - admitted they had made little progress in resolving their differences. Chief Buthelezi and Mr Mandela openly quarrelled during a press conference which followed the meeting and King Goodwill made it clear he would advise the Zulu people to boycott the elections to be held on April 26-28. The failure of the meeting, one of the most important in four years of peace talks, could exacerbate violence in the troubled Natal province, where tension is high after the recent imposition of a state of emergency. ANC officials said last night they expected to tighten emergency measures in Natal almost immediately, which could provoke further violence. The four leaders said they would set up a task force to continue seeking solutions to the problems which have provoked violence between their supporters. However, ANC and Inkatha officials said privately this was largely a face-saving measure and no progress was made at yesterday's talks. Mr Mandela said repeatedly he had 'no exaggerated expectation' that the task force could reach a settlement. 'The (Zulu) king's reservations cannot properly be addressed by a task force but only by a government of national unity,' which would take power after the election. In a tough statement Chief Buthelezi said: 'Progress could not be made on most of the fundamental issues tabled by the king and the Inkatha Freedom party.' Earlier, King Goodwill had asserted his people's 'claim to sovereignty and self-determination' for KwaZulu, the self-governing homeland in Natal. ANC officials had hoped the king would prove more conciliatory than Chief Buthelezi, seen as the driving force in the demand for an autonomous KwaZulu. The ANC had hoped to divide King Goodwill from Chief Buthelezi, his uncle and chief political adviser, by offering the king a separate peace guaranteeing his status and income. However the move appeared to have backfired with the king and Chief Buthelezi emerging from the meeting equally defiant. As the king was speaking at the summit, the ANC warned of impending assassination attempts on its leaders. A statement implicated Inkatha in what it called 'a comprehensive plan of intimidation and violence'. Blood brothers, Weekend I</p>

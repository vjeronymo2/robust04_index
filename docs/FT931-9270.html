			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Bronfman family sells its jewels to ease the strain / A look at the disposal of MacMillan Bloedel and John Labatt TWO firm conclusions can be drawn from the sudden sale last week of two jewels in the business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family. First, the disposal, in quick succession, of controlling stakes in MacMillan Bloedel, the big west coast forestry company, and John Labatt, which brews more than four out of every ten beers drunk in Canada, is clear evidence that one of North America's biggest agglomerations of family wealth is shrinking. Second, with its coffers set to swell by almost CDollars 2bn (Pounds 1bn), the sprawling web of resource, industrial, financial and property companies is in better shape today than it was last Monday. But the Macblo and Labatt deals also leave some awkward questions unanswered. Outsiders have been left wondering why the group was in quite such a hurry to make the disposals. Nor do they know whether the CDollars 2bn will be enough to relieve whatever strains there may be in parts of the domain hidden from public view. The Bronfman fortune, built on brothers Peter and Edward's inheritance from the founders of the Seagram drinks empire, consists of about 30 public companies, which until recently had a value equal to roughly 6 per cent of listings on the Toronto stock exchange, The 'Toronto' or 'Edper' Bronfmans, as Edward and Peter are known, are cousins of the family which today controls Seagram, but their businesses are entirely separate. Edper's senior managers -  themselves substantial shareholders in the family's holding companies -  insist that last week's deals were not forced on them. 'Did we sell out in panic or in urgent need? The answer is an emphatic no,' says Mr Bob Harding, president of Hees International, the Bronfmans' merchant banking arm. 'Our game plan is to simplify and streamline the group and these two sales are part of that process.' Macblo, which has suffered heavy losses in the past two years, is generating less cash than other pulp and paper companies controlled by Noranda, its immediate parent. The sale will substantially improve Noranda's balance sheet. Bronfman officials insist that the 38 per cent stake in Labatt wasn't even for sale until Wood Gundy, the Canadian securities firm, suddenly came up with a proposal for a 'bought deal'. Wood Gundy confirms that it turned down an invitation to join the dealer group which bought the Macblo shares, but was so impressed by the enthusiasm from investors that it quickly put together the Labatt deal. Furthermore, the Bronfman managers say that the problem areas of the group are under control. An Ontario court is expected to approve a restructuring plan for Bramalea, the debt-laden property developer, within the next month or so. The group is also 'guardedly optimistic' that a financial institution will be found to buy a big slice of ailing Royal Trust, Canada's second-biggest trust and loan company. Mr Trevor Eyton, chairman of Brascan, another Bronfman holding company, says companies throughout the group have raised CDollars 2bn in equity, CDollars 5bn by asset sales and CDollars 5bn in non-bank term debt in the past few years. 'We have built the group based on equity in diverse public companies and not on short-term debt.' Mr Eyton adds. It will be an uphill struggle, though, to reassure an investment community which has been alienated by the impenetrable structure of the Bronfman group and its penchant for cavalier treatment of outside shareholders. Analysts question why Macblo was put on the block just as the forest-product cycle shows signs of turning up. As for Labatt, rumours have swirled for some time of a deal with a US brewer. The Bronfmans may have got a better price for the two by waiting a little longer. Both deals, which were among the biggest equity offerings ever by Canadian companies, were done at prevailing market prices. But investors who have bought the shares will pay in three instalments over the next two years, giving a net present value about 6 per cent below market. In each case, the offering was sold out almost instantly. One Toronto analyst concludes that the Bronfmans are 'selling some of the better assets to finance some of the weaker ones'. The concern is less with operating units, such as Noranda, than with companies higher up the ladder like Hees, Edper Enterprises and Pagurian. Despite the high profile of Bronfman operating companies in Canadian business, the precise links between them are unclear. A hallmark of the Bronfman structure is the intricate cross-holdings of preferred shares issued in a 'cascading' pattern, from one layer to the next, to finance the group's expansion over the past 15 years. To this end, a host of little-known private companies has been interposed between the public units. As one analyst puts it, 'there's no debt, but still lots of leverage'. Labatt, for instance, holds some CDollars 250m in preferred shares issued by other Bronfman companies. The strains in the property and financial-services arms, as well as fears that other troublesome investments may be lurking away from the public eye, have raised questions about the value of preferred shares held by the holding companies. Investors will keep an especially close watch on preferred dividends declared by Bronfman companies in the months ahead. For the moment at least, Mr Eyton says there are no plans for further asset sales. Noranda in profit, Page 19</p>

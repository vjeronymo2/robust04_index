			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television The scandalous treatment of remand prisoners in British gaols became clear to me when a friend was remanded in Brixton. We were not allowed to give him nail scissors (there was one pair for the whole wing), nor a gadget for playing solo bridge (it contained playing card symbols, and cards were banned). Visits were very limited but the staff could not or would not say on the phone whether the quota was used up, so we had to travel all the way to the prison every time on the off chance. All this with someone who was innocent, given that British law considers everyone innocent until proved guilty. A large number of remand prisoners are not found guilty and are released. The invaluable series Taking Liberties is investigating this disgraceful situation (8.00 BBC2). Today's True Stories documentary observes methods used at the Cassel Hospital in south London where 50 or so mental patients stay for up to a year, treated more with therapy than drugs. They help with the running of the house and build up strong relationships. Best comedy of the evening is almost certain to be the repeat of Porridge (9.30 BBC1).</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS STILL IN MOUND OF TROUBLE;  </P> <P> TWO TWO-RUN HOME RUNS OFF PETRY HELP BREWERS, 7-4  </P> <P> Chuck Finley tested his sprained toe Wednesday afternoon, throwing off an  imaginary mound in the outfield and fielding bunts during a pregame workout.  His toe responded favorably, and he termed his progress "encouraging."  </P> <P> A couple of hours later, however, reality set in at Anaheim Stadium, and  discouraging was the best word to describe the Angels' status.  </P> <P> Dan Petry, starting in place of Finley, had to throw off a real mound to real  hitters, and his fielding prowess wasn't a factor. Veteran Robin Yount and  rookie George Canale each hit a two-run homer off Petry as Milwaukee defeated  the Angels, 7-4, before a crowd of 22,459.  </P> <P> Finley, who has already missed two weeks, may be on the road to recovery. But  it's probably too late for the Angels, who are in need of a major turnaround if  they are to keep their division title hopes alive.  </P> <P> In fact, the Brewers might have pulled the plug Wednesday night, considering  that the Oakland Athletics had already won in the afternoon. The third-place  Angels trail the A's by 5 1/2 games with only 23 games remaining. If Oakland  wins half of its final 22 games, the Angels would have to win 17 to tie.  </P> <P> "It's extremely important to stay optimistic, to go out and do the best job on  a day-to-day basis," Manager Doug Rader said. "It's fashionable to become  disheartened early, but to our people's credit, they don't seem to give in to  that kind of thinking."  </P> <P> While they may not be conceding anything yet, there are some subtle signs of  frustration in the Big A these days. Rader, who has made a determined effort to  say all the right things all season long, let a bit of paranoia escape before  the game when a television broadcaster mentioned that some members of the media  already had written off his team.  </P> <P> "They wrote us off on day one," Rader said. "They didn't give us a ghost of a  chance. And now, most of those people are probably happy because they can say  they were right all along.  </P> <P> "But we don't see it that way. We're only four games behind in the loss  column."  </P> <P> Make it five.  </P> <P> What the Angels did see was their chances for the American League West title  dwindle Wednesday night when a quartet of Angel pitchers couldn't make up for  the loss of one Finley. And Brewer pitcher Chris Bosio completely stifled the  Angel offense for eight innings.  </P> <P> A solo homer by Wally Joyner, his 14th, in the seventh was all the Angels could  do against Bosio until the ninth, when they mustered a last-gasp, four-single,  three-run outburst that cut the Brewers' lead to three.  </P> <P> Reliever Dan Plesac came in to get the last two outs and pick up his 29th save  of the season. As a result, Bosio (15-9) earned his eighth victory in his last  11 decisions.  </P> <P> "Chuck (Finley) is having a great year, and it's certainly nice to throw him  out there every fifth game," third baseman Jack Howell said. "But we've  overcome a lot of other things this season, and now's the time to kick it in  and let it out.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's anyone on this team who doesn't believe (a division  title) is still attainable."  </P> <P> That goal slipped further from the Angels' reach, due primarily to Bosio. The  second Angel batter of the game, Max Venable, dumped a fly-ball double down the  left-field line, but then Bosio retired 13 in a row before Howell dropped a  broken-bat single into center field in the fifth.  </P> <P> "It took us a long time before we were disciplined enough to stay back on his  breaking ball," Rader said. "We just weren't able to get any runs early."  </P> <P> The Angels mounted their mini-rally in the ninth, when Venable picked up his  second hit of the game -- and fourth in two nights -- and Claudell Washington  marked his return to the lineup with a single. Joyner forced Washington, but  singles by Chili Davis and Brian Downing made the Angels' inability to hold off  the Brewers early in the game that much harder to bear.  </P> <P> "Petry made a couple of pitches early that cost him," Rader said. "He got one  up to Yount and another one up to Canale."  </P> <P> Petry was making his 271st major league start, but only his fourth of this  season. And the Brewers had him reeling before he had a chance to get  comfortable.  </P> <P> Mike Felder led off the game with a single to left and promptly stole second.  Two outs later, Yount slugged a homer to left, and Milwaukee had a 2-0  advantage. Since the All-Star break, the veteran center fielder is hitting  almost .350 with eight homers and 39 RBIs.  </P> <P> Petry settled down and allowed only one single through the next two innings,  but the Brewers went to the long ball again in the fourth to build a four-run  lead, and this time, youth was served. After rookie Greg Vaughn drew a one-out  walk, Canale, 24, got his first major league hit, an opposite-field shot over  the wall in left-center.  </P> <P> Rich Monteleone came in to pitch the fifth, and Petry was left with a  less-than-impressive line: four innings pitched, four hits, four runs, three  walks, one strikeout and two home runs.  </P> <P> Monteleone gave up three consecutive singles -- and the Brewers' fifth run --  in the fifth. He was followed to the mound by Sherman Corbett, who surrendered  two more runs in the eighth on a double by Charlie O'Brien, two ground-outs and  a solo homer by shortstop Bill Spiers.  </P> <P> Pitcher No. 4, Greg Minton, escaped unscathed, but the game -- and maybe even  the season -- was a lost cause by then.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> The Angels acquired journeyman minor league catcher Ron Tingley Wednesday from  Cleveland's triple-A affiliate in Colorado Springs for a player to be named  later. The move came just in time. Tingley, who played for Angel Manager Doug  Rader in Hawaii (then San Diego's triple-A team), will help fill the void left  by backup catcher Bill Schroeder, who is lost for the season. Schroeder  underwent a diagnostic test on his sore right elbow Wednesday and will undergo  arthroscopic surgery Monday to remove bone spurs. Starting catcher Lance  Parrish, who has been bothered by a nagging left knee injury, will be in the  hospital today, receiving diagnostic tests to determine the extent of the  problem. "We're at the point that we're lucky to get (Tingley)," Rader said.  "He's a so-so hitter, but he's a hell of a catcher and thrower." Tingley, 30,  was drafted in the 10th round by San Diego in 1977 and made his major league  debut with the Padres in 1982. His next major league appearance came last year  with Cleveland. Tingley, who hit .257 with six home runs and 38 RBIs for  Colorado Springs, said the trade was a dream come true.  </P> <P> Claudell Washington, who left the team last weekend and returned home to  Orinda, Calif., for "personal reasons," rejoined the Angels Wednesday. "It was  a stress-related family matter," Washington said, declining to elaborate beyond  that. "I think everything's going to be OK, though." Washington, who also  missed nine games in May when his daughter was seriously injured in a household  accident, said he has never been through a year so fraught with off-the-field  distractions. "In 16 years, I've never been through anything like this," he  said. "It's been a rough season. But I'm back now and ready to go anytime they  need me." Washington entered the game in the seventh inning as a defensive  replacement in right field.  </P> <P> Left-hander Chuck Finley worked out in the outfield before Wednesday night's  game, making defensive moves and fielding bunts, and said the strained toe on  his left foot felt pretty good. "We wanted him to move to field balls and do  quick stuff when he wouldn't have time to think to protect it," pitching coach  Marcel Lachemann said. Finley passed the test and will throw off a mound again  today and probably pitch batting practice soon.  </P></p>

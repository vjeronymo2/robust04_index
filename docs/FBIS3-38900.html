			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Bo Stenstrom: "Ahtisaari's Long Final Dash </F> Worked!"]    [Text] It was the undecided voters who yesterday  determined the election outcome in Martti Ahtisaari's favor. On  the day the trend was against Elisabeth Rehn, even though no  other candidate could have offered better resistance!    Anyone who thinks that there will be improved employment and  a decreased need for local government savings because Ahtisaari  is entering office is going to be disappointed, even though  sufficient people have felt enough of the effects of the current  crisis not to be able to vote for an incumbent minister.    Rehn might have been able to strengthen her incredible  campaign with a little more social liberalism alongside her  concern for the activities of small businessmen; these can  easily be reconciled.    Unfortunately not even the economic upswing will be  sufficiently visible in the employment sector. On the other  hand mistaken action could widen the gulf between a public  sector deficit economy and a growing market economy.    Something important has happened on the political scene,  even  if Elisabeth Rehn did not make it all the way. The fact that  she got as far as she did is confirmation of a change which will  also have an effect on Ahtisaari's republic.    Despite the fact that the language question was one of the  marginal factors that toppled Rehn, her success showed how  widespread bilingualism and the openness that also exists among  monolingual citizens actually are.    The Social Democratic Party's campaign for Ahtisaari was  able  to play on both strings of the language issue, and this had a  not unimportant effect in northern and eastern Finland, despite  the Center Party's support for Rehn. If Ahtisaari himself had  been linguistically narrow-minded, this would have prevented him  from becoming president -- something for the supporters of  "Finnishness" and future presidential candidates to ponder.    A large -- but not large enough -- number of women were  carried along by the "Rehn phenomenon." There is always a  minority above the mumbling masses which leaves its mark on the  spirit of the age. It is a sign of the times that there are now  more girls than boys in senior high school, more women than men  in colleges. Growing numbers of women are living in one-person  households and growing numbers of women are shouldering an often  heavy economic and social responsibility for their own lives.  Why should they not help themselves to their share of political  life?    More than different halves of the brain, changes to the  traditionally so hierarchical management structures of companies  and organizations are having their effect. With a new company  culture women now have a more level playing field.    Rehn has inspired women for the March elections next year  and  they have at the same time become a more attractive proposition  for the political parties, even though this will not mean that  the problems will be easier to solve.    As the new president, Ahtisaari will have more to learn than  did Mauno Koivisto. Koivisto had been prime minister at a time  of change and he had been prime minister on another occasion.    Coming from what is potentially the biggest party does have  some political advantage, but it also represents a risk.  Koivisto had a striking degree of personal integrity --  something that Ahtisaari should also demonstrate for his own  reckoning after an election campaign that does not make this  task any easier.    The most important current issue is the EU [European Union]  negotiations. Will the president give in to a EU offer or will  he remain firm on government demands -- and to what extent?  Will he be able to help the prime minister to keep the  government together in the conflicting pressures that will  surround an offer from the EU?    How will he deal with a possible delay to membership or a no  to membership from the government?    Given the greater degree of parliamentary government and the  changed foreign affairs arena it would be good if Martti  Ahtisaari were to begain as soon as possible to create his own  Foreign Affairs Council as a forum in which the party leaders  can reach agreement on fundamental foreign policy questions so  that they do not become a source of divisive political  disagreements.    The people have had their say. Martti Ahtisaari as head of  state is a new element in the picture. The new presidential  election system could have divided the country if there had been  other finalists in the second round -- now it is back to  everyday life in a united Finland!</p>

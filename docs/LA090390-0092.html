			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BACK TO SCHOOL;  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> GWC OFFERS ARTS CLASSES TO FILL GAP AT HIGH SCHOOLS  </P> <P> As spending cuts in Sacramento have prompted local school districts to shrink  or eliminate elective classes, many high schools have been left with the  skeletal remains of once burgeoning arts programs.  </P> <P> To help restore what has been lost from those programs -- and then some --  Golden West College this fall is offering an array of art, dance, music and  theater classes for high school students.  </P> <P> The college's Academy of the Arts program, introduced in January as a joint  endeavor with the Huntington Beach Union High School District, this semester is  expanding to attract high school students from throughout Orange County.  </P> <P> "We want to give those kids who are really interested in the arts opportunities  that we can no longer give at the high school level," said Steve Schwartz, the  high school district's fine arts coordinator who originated the program.  Schwartz coordinates the Academy of the Arts along with John Wordes, Golden  West's associate dean of business and arts.  </P> <P> In addition to program reductions, high school students interested in the arts  have had limited opportunities to pursue them because the state's increasing  requirements for math, English and other core academic subjects have squeezed  out many elective openings, officials said.  </P> <P> Students and program coordinators say the courses not only compensate for  slashed school programs but offer high school students a chance to learn the  arts in a more intimate and professional atmosphere.  </P> <P> Last semester, 53 students attended three classes given through the Academy of  the Arts program. The cost is $10 per class, and students receive college  credit for courses taken, Wordes said.  </P> <P> This fall, the college is offering six classes, and Wordes said he expects  between 85 and 100 students will attend.  </P> <P> "Nothing like this is offered in high school," said Penelope Pauley, who  enrolled in the program's acting class last semester and performed in the  summer musical "Grease." "There are too many (students) and not enough  concern."  </P> <P> Pauley said that, as a Marina High School senior last spring, she had been  frustrated by the school's limited training and facilities. For example, there  is only one theater among the district's six schools.  </P> <P> "It's obvious that there is not as much allocation of funds (for the arts) as  there should be. . . . And it's not just theater. The band and choir suffer,  too. We all lose out." JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

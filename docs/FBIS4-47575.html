			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L.F. Pisareva, V. Vasilyev and L.T. Filimonova, </F> Scientific Research Institute of Oncology, Tomsk Scientific  Center, Siberian Department, Russian Academy of Medical  Sciences; UDC 616-006.04-036.2-07:313.13(571.1)]    [Abstract]  A survey of cancer statistics for the 1980-1990 decade in  Western Siberia has shown an overall pattern of increase in  morbidity and mortality, consonant with the pattern of the rest  of the Russian Federation. The changes affected both the urban  and--especially--the rural areas of the 5 regions under  consideration: Altay Kray and the Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, Tomsk  and Omsk oblasts. Considerable variation was evident among the  territories, with the maximum increase (24.2%) seen in the  Tomsk Oblast and the smallest increment (6.0%) in Kemerovo  Oblast. In general, the incidence of gastric and uterine cancers  diminished during the decade, but lung, breast and hematopoietic  malignancies and resultant deaths were on the increase. These  changes in cancer epidemiology signal that the pattern in  Western Siberia is beginning to approximate that evident in the  Russian Federation as a whole. In addition to industrial  pollution and other anthropogenic factors, global etiologic  factors must also be considered in assessing the changing  patterns evident in Siberian cancer epidemiology.

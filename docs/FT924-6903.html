			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Japan's leaders warned on budget delay TWO of Japan's most powerful economic policymakers yesterday warned political leaders that they risked seriously damaging already fragile business confidence by the prolonged delay in enacting a special budget to boost the economy. Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor of the Bank of Japan, and Mr Takeshi Noda, the head of the Economic Planning Agency, both warned that the delay to the Japanese parliament's debate on the budget risked deepening the economic downturn. The budget, which is needed to enact the Y10,700bn (Pounds 56.8bn) emergency spending package announced in August, is being held up by a dispute between the ruling Liberal Democratic party and the opposition over which LDP leaders will testify over their involvement in the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal. Further talks yesterday between the LDP and the opposition failed to break the deadlock. Opposition parties insist they will not convene the parliamentary budget committee until the LDP agrees to at least five leaders giving sworn testimony to the legislature. Mr Noda, presenting a gloomy agency report on the economic outlook, said: 'Public distrust in politics is a big factor in undermining business sentiment. From the people's point of view the government and the ruling party - not just the opposition - are responsible for the impasse.' Mr Mieno warned that a delay would greatly affect business and stock market sentiment. In a rare comment upon the politics of economic policy, he remarked: 'We really hope the Diet discussion on the budget will start as soon as possible.' He said many hard-pressed companies were anxiously waiting for benefits of the emergency package to flow through. However, he said he was not considering a cut in the official discount rate, although he acknowledged the economy was still in the midst of a painful adjustment. He also said the Bank of Japan had no plans to offer financial support to a banking industry body set up recently designed to reduce the banks' bad loans. A senior Economic Planning Agency official warned that the economy was so fragile it was only being supported by public works spending and housing investment. Meanwhile, even though the special supplementary budget has not been passed through parliament, pressure is mounting on the Ministry of Finance to deliver a further fiscal stimulus through the 1993 budget. Concern that small companies may face a credit crunch from banks' increasingly cautious approach to lending is an important factor behind the ministry of finance's decision to sanction a 10 per cent rise next year in the fiscal investment and loan programme, the so-called second budget. The ministry has agreed appropriations from the budget should rise to Y45,000bn next year.</p>

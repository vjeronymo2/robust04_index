How to unload the heavy historical burdens  from their backs and compete with enterprises in other economic  sectors by proceeding from the same starting line, thus creating  greater wealth in the rivalry in the market economy, is a  pressing question that they must solve as soon as possible.    Beyond question, the state-owned enterprises should be  credited with their contributions to China's prosperity today  and the current solid material foundation for reform and  opening. However, with the continuing in-depth development of  the economic structural reform and the establishment of the  socialist market economy, the state- owned enterprises have been  facing more and more difficulties in their operations and the  key problem is the slow growth of their economic results.    Between 1980 and 1992, the taxable profits made by the  state-owned industrial enterprises increased by only 110  percent, which was markedly lower than the 314-percent growth  rate marked by collective enterprises and the growth rate of  enterprises in other categories, whose taxable profits  multiplied 33.5 times. Some state-owned enterprises even found  it hard to make further development and a large number of  state-owned enterprises in some trades incurred business losses  to a serious degree. Of course, the difficult conditions in  which the state-owned enterprises are now bogged down were  caused by the problems of the long-standing monolithic planned  economy. It is still undeniable that the heavy historical  burden borne by the state-owned enterprises is also a major  reason why it is so hard for the huge dragon to soar vigorously.    How do we unload the burden? The only option is reform and  problems should be solved by both the state and the enterprises  themselves. According to expert analysis, the historical burden  carried by the state-owned enterprises includes four major  parts, namely: The debt burden; insufficient accumulation for  paying retirement pensions to old workers; transfers of  redundant personnel, their unemployment and reemployment; and  the social welfare undertakings run by the enterprises.    It is necessary to relieve the state-owned enterprises of  their historical burdens and create necessary conditions for the  innovation of their management system. This top-priority issue  is to rationalize and adjust the asset-liability structure of  the enterprises and thus relieve them of their debt burdens in  order to enable them to join the fair competition in the market.  The current measure for achieving this purpose is to change the  loans offered to the enterprises in place of government  appropriations into state investments according to certain  limits and proportions, thus increasing the state assets in the  enterprises. Debts in other forms may also be changed into  stock rights in different ways. Efforts should be made to seek  some new ways to raise and distribute funds for worker's  retirement pensions and other labor insurance compensations  through some insurance institutions in society, thus solving the  state-owned enterprises' difficulties in paying pensions to  retired workers. In the course of auctioning and merging  enterprises and transforming the enterprise property rights  system, a certain proportion of assets in the state-owned  enterprises can be used to keep a social security fund. This  method can be used on a trial basis. Thus, the burden on the  back of the enterprise can be unloaded and workers can be freed  from concern over their livelihood after retirement.    Overstaffing is another problem caused by the long-standing  planned economic structure in the state-owned enterprises. If  this problem is not solved, fair competition on an equal footing  among enterprises of all types will become empty talk. In order  to resolve this problem, the department concerned has decided  that the redundant personnel arising in the course of enterprise  reforms should mainly be transferred to the tertiary industry.  The government will give certain favorable treatment in the  fields of taxation, credit, and real estate. At the same time,  some people will be encouraged to seek new jobs in township and  town enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, and private  enterprises; or will be encouraged to seek new jobs by  themselves. In order to change the situation in which  state-owned enterprises have to run social welfare undertakings,  the state has explicitly decided that nonproductive undertakings  will be gradually separated from the enterprises. Over a long  period of time, the enterprises have had to run schools for  their workers' children and various service undertakings and  perform various social welfare functions. Such undertakings  should be made independent from the enterprises as soon as  possible. Some of them should be taken over by the local  governments; some can be run by community organizations; and  others can be run by new service enterprises.    The huge dragon will eventually soar high. In the coming  year, through the reform of their organizational and management  structures, they will certainly be able to stand various stern  tests in the competition in the market economy.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Concern on threat to wages councils PAY WILL fall significantly if wages councils, which set minimum rates for 2.5m workers, are abolished, according to research commissioned by the Trades Union Congress. The government has argued that wages councils have become 'irrelevant' and that their abolition will have little effect on pay rates. But researchers from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the London School of Economics argue in a paper prepared for presentation at a TUC conference tomorrow, that many workers will face a small cut in pay and a small number will face a large cut. The Commons committee examining the Employment Bill is today expected to approve the clause which abolishes the councils cover-ing retailing, catering, hairdressing and clothing manufacture. Unions are strongly contesting abolition and they might lodge a formal complaint with the European Commission on the grounds of discrimination against women. Women make up 80 per cent of employees covered by the councils. The research concluded that pay would fall after studying residential care homes for the elderly, a low paid industry not covered by wages councils. The research also challenged the government view that, because 80 per cent of wages council workers live in households with at least one other earner, there will be no significant impact on poverty. The study found that a higher proportion of single parents are found in wages council industries than in the working population as a whole - 20.3 per cent compared with 13.8 per cent. It also found that a reduction in earnings for these workers will increase their dependence on state benefits and therefore raise public spending. The study also found little evidence that new jobs would be created by abolition of councils. Government economists now accept that few jobs are likely to be created, but that is based on the assumption that pay rates change very little. One economist said: 'If what these researchers say about pay reductions is true then there could be new jobs.'</p>

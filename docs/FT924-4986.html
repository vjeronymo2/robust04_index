			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Property: How to make life less rewarding for Burglar Bill - Charles Patmore looks at ways to keep your home safer DO NOT spend your money on elaborate locks and bolts, whatever home security advertisements claim, because burglars say that locks rarely stop them. This is a surprising but consistent finding from a growing body of research based on interviews with burglars themselves. But while you cannot stop burglars once they have picked your home, the same research offers clear guidance for avoiding getting chosen in the first place. Cambridge University researcher Dr Trevor Bennett pioneered this research through interviewing convicted burglars. By discussing video recordings of houses or going for walks with them, he investigated their rationale for choosing particular homes. 'They just weren't interested in whether there were security locks, for instance, or certain types of window,' Bennett says. 'They generally said that they would be able to overcome any problems that these aspects of the house represented. So, beyond a minimum level of security, locks give only limited benefit.' If there were troublesome locks, for instance, the burglars said there were invariably other points for entry. As one put it: 'if you want to get in, you will get in. There's no lock in the world going to stop you.' Deterring them from choosing your house is, therefore, likely to be more effective. 'Whether a house seemed occupied was the factor which influenced burglars' decision-making most', says Bennett. 'From what they told us, effective deterrents would be things like house lights programmed to go on and off at random at night, and all the old advice about removing milk bottles and not giving cues that you're on holiday.' But the burglar also needs the opportunity to operate unseen. Anything which hides suspicious actions from view helps him, be it thick front hedges, porches, or unhindered access to the rear of the house. Bennett notes: 'Stopping them getting round the back is very important. 'Very many burglaries occur round the back of the premises. Burglars say this is because of the cover which the house gives them. So, gates to prevent rear access to the dwelling may be effective. Besides blocking rear access, try making your home's exterior appear open to surveillance by neighbours. That might mean some loss of privacy but, as Bennett points out, thick hedges and high walls mean privacy for burglars, too. Although burglars seek homes which are empty, where they can work on doors or windows unobserved, and without burglar alarms or dogs - conventional wisdom, which burglars themselves confirm - a house also must look as if it contains goods worth stealing. 'Burglars make an overall assessment of the life-style of the people who live there from many, many, says Bennett. 'Rather than signs of affluence, burglars look more for care over maintenance of the property. 'Often, they mentioned recent painting and repairs to us. Their logic seems to be: 'If people care about the outside of their property, they're probably home-lovers who'll buy nice things for inside their homes as well. If they don't care about the outside, that's probably reflected inside as well'.' There is a final, crucial influence on your home's vulnerability - how it compares with neighbouring houses. 'We found burglars made an advance decision to commit a burglary somewhere,' says Bennett. 'They would then go to one particular area and select a house just from among those dwellings. And the most attractive within that small group of dwellings would be the one that they would go for. So, targets which were difficult would be bypassed till they found something which was suitable.' Burglars say suitable houses are so plentiful that problematic ones can be bypassed with ease. As one of Bennett's informants put it: 'Why bother with a house with an alarm when there are hundreds without them?' On this reasoning, assess your home's vulnerability by taking a stroll down your street. Make your own burglar's short-list of houses which combine good maintenance with such giveaways as concealed access to doors or windows and no alarms. If your house fails the test, then remedy the situation. But what if everyone takes precautions? It is a pertinent question because whole housing estates are being designed where each home features every crime prevention feature conceivable. Two years ago, for instance, ten south-east police forces launched the 'Secured by Design' initiative which offers a police approval logo for new properties with sufficient crime prevention features. New estates can only achieve this logo if they protect every individual house. The overall lay-out must also promote mutual surveillance. Lighting must be good. Footpaths which give access along the backs of houses are excluded. Some builders even plan a deliberate age mix of residents, so there will be people around on the estate at all hours. If everyone shares the same precautions, though, won't this cancel out their effectiveness and simply make everyone equally vulnerable? Or would burglary be displaced altogether to other neighbourhoods? 'I can't answer that with certainty,' says Inspector John Houlgate, who works on the Secured by Design scheme at Scotland Yard. 'It's arguable that once everybody has a burglar alarm, it will cease to be a deterrent. But, at the moment, there are enough soft targets elsewhere and I think the burglar would move to other, easier neighbourhoods.' Estates designed with anti-crime features create an uneasy, intimidating environment for burglars. Some may be deterred altogether. Others may still tackle a house, but in future avoid that estate. 'It may not deter every determined thief,' says Houlgate. 'But they know places where they feel comfortable and unnoticed and, conversely, where they feel the eyes of the world on them. We deter a percentage every time with every measure we take.'</p>

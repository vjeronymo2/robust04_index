			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Francisco Santos] </F>   [Text] If it wins the elections, the PT [Workers Party]  will impose a temporary tax on large fortunes, in order to  create a fund destined to finance projects for the creation of a  large number of jobs. This information was supplied yesterday  to FOLHA by economist Jose Marcio Camargo, one of the designers  of the party economic policy.    The tax, which will be collected only in 1996, is one of the  sources of money that the PT intends to use to create 8 million  jobs during its government term. The party also intends to  transfer 10 million workers from the informal to the formal  sector of the economy.    According to Camargo, the fund to be created with the tax on  fortunes will feed on the profits of the investments that were  made.    Camargo added that another fund, which will be created in  1996, will serve the same purpose, but no decision has yet been  made on the source from which the money for it will be obtained.    Before creating this fund, the government will reportedly  finance infrastructure projects for creating jobs with money  from the budget and from social funds.    PT economists were due to meet last night in Rio de Janeiro,  under federal PT Deputy for Sao Paulo Aloizio Mercadante, to  debate the program for jobs creation and the party macroeconomic  program.</p>

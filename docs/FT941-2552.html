			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Books: Good Works go wrong - Fiction A CHANGE OF CLIMATE by Hilary Mantel Viking Pounds 15, 342 pages Hilary Mantel is generally agreed to be one of the most interesting and accomplished of the younger - or perhaps the middle - generation of our novelists. Her last book, A Place of Greater Safety, was praised for its portrait of Revolutionary France and won the Sunday Express prize as well as a few grumbles about its extreme length. A Change of Climate is certain to consolidate this reputation. It tells of Ralph and Anna Eldred who have devoted their lives to what used to be called Good Works. He is director of a charitable trust in Norfolk and London, and his wife assists and endorses him and runs their family of four children. As Kit, the eldest, says, 'My father is so bloody saintly it would make you sick, but the trouble is it's real, it's all real. My mother . . . she's saintly too'. The lives of the Eldreds unravel in the course of an East Anglian summer when their 20-year secret at last escapes. In the mid-1950s the Eldreds had been sent to South Africa to work with a mission. First they lived outside Pretoria in a freehold black township which, like Sophiatown and Lady Selborne at that time, was to be razed by the apartheid government. They became politically involved, were arrested and jailed and eventually deported across the border to Bechuanaland. There, in a wretched place on the edge of the Kalahari, they encountered catastrophe - a horrific tragedy the nature of which I imagine most reviewers will choose not to reveal. Hilary Mantel's novel sets itself to describe, and to understand, the effect of this event on the subsequent lives of the Eldred family. Ralph as a young man had believed in 'the complex perfectibility of the human heart'. He is, and remains, a good man: 'If we are not to be mere animals, or babies, we must always choose and choose to do good'. He struggles to make sense of the episode in the Bechuanaland bush and to come to terms with any responsibility: 'I accept that I made choices and they were wrong, but then I think, too, that our lives have been ruined by malign chance. I do not see any pattern here, any sense, any reason why this had to happen . . .' Back in Norfolk, his innocence still guarded by Anna, he determines to keep going - which, as his wise sister warns him, is typical of a man and will be at the expense of the people around him. Because - as she also believes - women turn inwards; they fall ill; and, in Anna's case, they are destroyed. Don't worry, Anna says, she won't be a problem, 'We're professional Christians, aren't we, Ralph and me?' But one day, as the children approach adulthood and her husband falls in love with a simpler, less anguished woman, she cracks. This is, I hope it is clear, a serious and intelligent novel about difficult themes - the nature of evil, of forgiveness, of suppression, of acceptance. Not that there is anything laboured or theoretical about the depiction of these philosophies. The Eldred family is particularly well done, the children and their friends all vividly and sympathetically realised. Ms Mantel evidently has an equal familiarity with both Norfolk and southern Africa: she catches, for instance, the embarrassed ambivalence of well-meaning foreigners when they encounter the African reality - 'The village men were meagre, spiritless and skinny. The women were great tubes of fat, blown out with carbohydrate . . . Their voices were harsh, monotonous, somehow triumphal. God help me, Anna thought: but I don't like them, perhaps I fear them. These feelings were a violation of everything she expected from herself, of all her principles and habits of mind . . .' My only hesitation is that, because the novelist's beam plays over so many characters, Ralph and Anna both remain a fraction under-exposed. They remain always at a certain distance. We recognise them, but we do not enter their private lives, and so we are impressed where we should be moved. Many readers will, I am sure, disagree with me.</p>

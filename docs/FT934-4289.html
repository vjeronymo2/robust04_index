			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: The child as a thinker Sir, After all the recent hand-wringing and talk of moral teaching how refreshing to read Christian Tyler's interview with Karin Murris in which she stresses the importance of teaching children to think (Private View, November 27/28). Towards the end of my teaching career in a south London school the thing that depressed me most was the growing mindlessness among pupils - a kind of animality, so unthinking that it often led to self-induced injury, as well as harm to others. Children lived in a dream world of pop and pap, aware only of the values inculcated by trivia and video nasties. How can anyone instil morality until such children learn to think clearly. In contrast, the article by John Willman in the same issue ('Things can be done: hand-wringing over the James Bulger case is misplaced') was faint-hearted and unimaginative. Even if there is not enough money for universal provision, at least we could provide it for priority areas. Having done so, we must make sure that the very best teachers are appointed to work in them. They could make a tremendous difference to a child's future (partly because problem children - and families - would be spotted earlier). By primary school age the damage has been left too long unchecked. Diana Schomberg, 27 Gloucester Circus, London SE10 8RY</p>

The  meeting will discuss the situation in Somalia and ways to  coordinate the positions of the factions with the aim of  effecting national reconciliation before the United States and  European forces withdraw from Somalia by the end of March.    Abshir announced that Somalia is passing through a critical  stage and that the U.S. and European forces have begun their  withdrawal.    Noting that Egypt is helping the United Nations to find a  solution to the problem, he stressed Somalia's need for this  role in its quest for peace and national reconciliation. He  voiced the hope that the Somali leaders will show the necessary  sense of responsibility to restore peace and security in the  country and establish a central authority. He said that when  this has been done, free elections can be held supervised by the  Arab countries, United Nations, OAU, and ICO [Islamic Conference  Organization] to ensure they are fair.</p>

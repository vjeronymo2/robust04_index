			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by environment reporter Ole Mathismoen: </F> ``Agreements Do Not Solve Environment Crisis'']    [Text] Self-Delusion: People are signing  environmental agreements as never before. But we are fooling  ourselves if we think this means action.    Last week the European countries agreed on a new sulphur  pollution protocol. Emissions which come down over Norway in the  form of acid rain and kill more and more of Norwegian nature,  shall be reduced further over the next 10 years. The agreement  will be formally signed in Oslo in June. The great agreement on  climate from the environment summit in Rio in 1992 will go into  effect in a couple of weeks. Just before Christmas the  sister-agreement on biological variety went into effect after  having been ratified by 30 national assemblies.  <H5>  Applause and Honor </H5>   Environment bureaucrats are applauding each other. Never  before have agreements gone into effect at such a rapid pace. It  is hardly two years ago that the accords were signed. And new  protocols and regional agreements concerning various small and  large environmental problems are being signed all over the world.    However, it would be a fatal mistake in judgement to applaud  too loudly. Certainly, paper formalities resulting from  environmental efforts are being crowned by victory more often in  the 1990's than was common before. But it is a long step from  the signing of the agreement to the matter being acted upon.  Only a few of the 50 to 60 important environmental agreements in  the world have strong built-in mechanisms for follow-up and  control. This year's edition of the ``Green Globe Yearbook''  also shows that the follow-up is poor even for those agreements  that have the best built-in mechanisms for follow-up.    The world's environmental agreements can be roughly divided  into two categories. In one there are the large accords and  framework agreements. These are most suitable for politicians  who want to calm an environmentally preoccupied public opinion.  The great accords on climate and biological variety from Rio are  good examples of this. Without new supplementary protocols for  the most part these are without any value for the global  environment.  <H5>  Action </H5>   The other type of agreement are those targeting specific  actions. Unfortunately, these are a small minority, but all the  more important. The best known of these is the Montreal protocol  from 1987 with a later addendum whose goal was to phase out  emission of gases harmful to the ozone layer. This agreement has  been clearly spelled out. It stipulates definite deadlines for  all the 131 participating countries. Still, by the deadline of  September of last year, only 23 percent of these countries had  reported on what they were in fact doing and what results they  had achieved. Because it is assumed that most countries would  report any action taken on what they had promised to do, the low  percentage of reporting countries is taken as a sign that many  are not following up. Because this is an agreement with  important consequences for industry, the lack of action in  individual countries will affect their ability to compete. That  is why the great industrialized countries have taken the  initiative and proposed introducing strict punishment for the  shirkers. Having received a warning those countries might be  excluded from the agreement. This means a loss of both prestige  and money from the ``ozone fund.''    The new sulphur agreement belongs to this latter group.  True,  the text of the agreement offers no opportunity for the imposing  of sanctions, but because reduced sulphur emissions in the  future will be very costly the 28 participating countries will  monitor each other closely. Shirking means advantages for one's  own industry. The sulphur agreement is also very modern. It is a  model for future environment agreements in which each country is  charged with measures according to how great their emissions are  and to the amount of damage they cause. That means saying  goodbye to the old-fashioned principle in which all countries  must reduce their pollution by the same percentage no matter  what the cost and what effect it has. The new sulphur agreement  takes as its point of departure the amount of sulpher oxide the  various countries are contributing and the amount of damage  caused by these emissions according to simulations by computer  models.    So far our global society has been able to draft a good  agreement either for very definite objectives, such as, for  example, how to decrease the emission of gases that break down  the ozone layer or for controlling problems that are strictly  geographically limited, for instance acid rain in Europe.    However, our answer to the really large and serious problems  that place the world in the middle of a serious environmental  crisis, is to come up with loose, totally irrelevant nonbinding  agreements. To mention just a few; the population explosion,  poverty, cutting down the rain forest in the south and the  irreplaceable conifer forest in the north, the loss of several  hundred plant and animal species every year, the danger of a  changed climate as a result of global warming ....    So far the world has not been mature enough to take the  environmental crisis completely seriously. The meeting in Rio in  1992 started a trend. But such trends are without value unless  they lead to definite action. And to achieve action, obviously  some sort of voluntary force is needed. So far many of the  environmental agreements and negotiations around them have been  a singular form of ritual dance, mostly suited only to sooth a  worried public opinion. The most pessimistic people say that we  must wait for a total environmental collapse before the world  will react. Another alternative is to put some teeth into the  agreements. To do that we need a vigilant public opinion which  will not settle for weak agreements with weak follow-up.</p>

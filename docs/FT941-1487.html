			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Bonn and Paris plan EU ostpolitik Germany and France will launch a joint initiative to develop a common European 'ostpolitik' during their consecutive presidencies of the European Union in 1994 and 1995, Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said last night. The two governments have agreed to co-ordinate their EU policies for the year from July 1, and the strategy towards central and eastern Europe is top of the German agenda. Mr Kinkel spelt out details in an important statement of Bonn's European strategy to the French institute for international relations in Paris. His five-point programme for an EU ostpolitik would put opening of the west European market as its highest priority, combined with maximum involvement of the associated states in central and eastern Europe in the EU's common foreign and security policy. While he spelt out support for Russia as a key element of any policy, he stressed the need for a coherent EU policy towards Ukraine. 'The economic crisis (in Ukraine) and the tensions with Russia affect us directly,' he said. 'They could have far-reaching consequences. . . We must act together to ensure Ukraine is brought rapidly within our European co-operation system.' He called at the same time for a 'coherent' EU policy towards the Baltic republics, intended to 'draw these countries ever closer to the Union'. Russian troops must be withdrawn on time. He also outlined an initiative with Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, to launch a 'Europe-wide Marshall Plan of the mind' for eastern Europe, to promote all forms of scientific and university exchanges, bringing thousands of students and scientists into west European universities, and sending western teachers to the east. The two nations will also press to make the Maastricht treaty a reality, for more energetic promotion of a European security policy as a pillar of the Atlantic alliance; and for an active Mediterranean policy, to promote development in the Maghreb region.

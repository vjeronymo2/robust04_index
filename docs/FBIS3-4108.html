			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 22 (CNS) -- Deputy of the National  People's Congress, Mr. Wang Zhongying, who is also a senior  engineer of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, said  in an exclusive interview with this agency that by the year  2000, more than 50 percent of 45 key varieties of mineral  resources in China will have been exhausted. If the current  excessive exploitation of such resources continued, the shortage  of natural resources would further restrict the national economy  in the next century.    According to Mr. Wang, China can be called a big country of  natural resources, but at the same time it was a small country  in this sector when such resources were calculated based on per  capita possession with its per capita water resources accounting  for only one-eighth of the world average. Owing to  imperfections of legislation, the destructive exploitation of  natural resources was rampant in many places in the country.  The panning of gold, for example, achieved a mere ten percent  exploitation rate in some places, resulting in great losses.    Mr. Wang said that small-sized coalpits accounted for 30 to  40 percent of the total number in the country, leading not only  to a low rate of exploitation and usage but also frequent  accidents. He warned that if there was no improvement in its  exploitation of coal, China would face a serious shortage of  such resources by the year 2005, though the country now ranked  among the leading countries in the world in terms of coal  reserves.    According to this expert, China has 70 to 80 percent of the  proven rare-earth reserves in the world. He criticized  Guangdong, Guangxi and Jiangxi, which are rich in this mineral,  for their mismanagement of exploitation of these natural  deposits and for their devaluing the export prices of these  minerals against each other among themselves with rare-earth  prices dropping to RMB 40,000 per tonne from RMB 80,000 per  tonne one year ago.    Mr. Wang called on all parties concerned to pay greater  attention to the protection and proper use of the limited  mineral resources in the country, saying that the resources  issue should be considered a basic national policy such as the  population and environment issues.</p>

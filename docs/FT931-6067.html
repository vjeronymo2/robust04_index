			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Letter: How the government has made life more difficult for many exporters Sir, I was very pleased to see the article by lvor Owen, 'Minister defends ECGD sell-off' (February 23), regarding the comments made by Richard Needham, the trade minister, on the privatisation of the bulk of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. It is also encouraging to perceive that Mr Needham is concerned about the vital nature of credit insurance to the UK economy, the balance of payments and employment. But there are several points that require expansion. The minister has said that the reinsurance arrangements to NCM, which bought the short-term credit arm of the ECGD, would be continued without any time limit. This is not generally understood and indeed represents a significant step forward. Second, while it may be true that NCM has secured adequate reinsurance treaties, the reinsurance market has shrunk and other would-be competitors might find it difficult to obtain reinsurance. Third, while supporting any initiative to help our beleaguered export industry, it seems strange that government reinsurance is available only to a Dutch-owned company and not to any of the other competitors in the market. This is a matter which is being looked at in Brussels right now. Experience from our members would suggest that, while welcoming the privatisation of this arm of ECGD, the government has probably made life more difficult for many exporters in terms of the range of markets covered and the lack of support for other companies wishing to enter the market. In spite of the minister's confident assertion, it does appear that availability of cover for traditional UK markets has been restricted or withdrawn, and appeals to the DTI on this matter have largely fallen on deaf ears.

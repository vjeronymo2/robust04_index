			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fall on renewed rate rise fears US Treasury prices fell across the maturity range yesterday following a stronger than expected purchasing managers' report, which raised fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates sooner, rather than later. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/8 at 93, yielding 8.055 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 99 29/32 , to yield 6.909 per cent. Prices weakened after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported its index of business activity rose to 59.7 per cent in October, from 58.2 per cent in September. Analysts had expected a rise of only 59.0 per cent. The market was particularly disturbed by the big jump in the NAPM's prices index, which rose from 77.1 per cent to 79.9 per cent, an indication that inflationary pressures may be building up in the manufacturing sector. Inflation-sensitive investors were not reassured by the comments of Mr Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the NAPM, who said that companies were reporting difficulties in passing on higher materials prices to consumers. The data sparked immediate selling of bonds as analysts judged that the NAPM figures only increased the likelihood that the Fed would put up interest rates at the next available opportunity. Although most analysts still believe that the Fed will wait until its next open market committee meeting on November 15 before tightening monetary policy, the NAPM numbers heightened speculation over how large any rate increase might be. Although a few analysts said the Fed, in the wake of the NAPM report, might raise rates by as much as 100 basis points (bringing the target on the Fed funds rate to 5 3/4 per cent), the consensus on Wall Street remained that any increase would more likely be of 50 basis points. Later in the day, prices weakened further amid reports of futures-related selling, and some selling by dealers hedging against a decline in the price of mortgage-backed securities. With several countries closed for All Saints' holiday, activity in most European government bond markets was subdued, with prices range-trading in thin volume. UK gilts proved the main exception, rallying sharply after the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report calmed fears of a near-term monetary tightening. In recent days, market participants had grown increasingly nervous about the possibility that Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, might decide on another base rate increase at their meeting today. However, after the report some dealers said they now expect the next rate rise in early 1995. The December long gilt futures contract rose as high as 101 1/4 before closing around 101, up  13/32 on the day. At the short end of the yield curve, the December short sterling future rose 0.07 to 93.57. The gains were partly attributed to a scramble by trading accounts to cover short positions. Although traders reported some investor buying, they said most of the activity took place in the futures market. German government bonds followed the US bond market lower, then tracked gilts higher and rallied into the close. The December bund futures contract on Liffe briefly breached technical support at 89.00 to fall to 88.95, but that triggered heavy buying which carried the contract to 89.39. It slipped back in after-hours trading to around 89.11, unchanged on the day. Bunds are likely to make little headway this week, with fresh 10-year government supply looming early next week. Swedish bonds weakened amid jitters ahead of today's budget statement by Mr Goran Persson, the finance minister. The yield on the government bond due 2005 rose 11 basis points to 11.09 per cent. Mr Persson is widely expected to detail the SKr61bn in budget cuts which the Social Democrats announced during the election campaign. However, some dealers were hoping he would announce additional measures to tackle Sweden's budget deficit after Moody's, the rating agency, last week placed its Aa2 debt rating under review for possible downgrading.</p>

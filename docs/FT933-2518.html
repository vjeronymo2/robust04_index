			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Keating gives pro-independence speech to mark Australia House anniversary MR Paul Keating, Australia's prime minister, said yesterday that most Britons would find it 'unexceptional and inoffensive' for Australia to sever its links with the British monarchy and become a republic, write Alexander Nicoll and Ivor Owen. In a speech marking the 75th anniversary of Australia House, the country's High Commission in London, Mr Keating sought to portray an Australian change to a republic as a normal step for a nation forging a new identity in the Asia-Pacific region. Mr Keating discussed the issue over lunch with Mr John Major, UK prime minister, who said afterwards that he would not be involved in advising Queen Elizabeth II on the ending of her role as Australia's head of state. It was a matter for the Queen and Australia's ministers and people, Mr Major said. The two premiers emphasised the warmth of relations between the two countries. Britain's tabloid press has interpreted the republican moves as an attack on the Queen and has sprung to her defence, portraying Mr Keating as a rude publicity-seeker. But he is expected to receive a warm welcome when he visits Balmoral in Scotland today for private discussions with her. Asked why he thought British people would support the Australian bid for a republic, Mr Keating said a constitution democratically chosen would always have the respect of a democratic people. 'So I do not think it is a matter of trying to put a dipstick into British opinions, but rather looking at Britain's long-running respect for democratic process and practices,' he said.</p>

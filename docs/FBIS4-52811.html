			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Foreign  Ministry ordered the partial withdrawal of embassy staff family  members and Korean residents from Yemen on Monday.    Yi Yang, director-general for Middle East and African  affairs, said 25 out of 39 Koreans, including family members of  the mission staff and residents, will leave Sanaa on Monday  while ambassador Cho Kyu-tae and 14 others will stay behind.    If the armed conflict gripping the country intensifies, the  Ministry plans to pull out all embassy staff, he said.    "The withdrawal right now is for those who wished to leave.  It's in case the situation there suddenly worsens," Yi said.    Except for an evening curfew, all public offices, schools  and  banks are said to be operating normally in the capital city of  Sanaa.</p>

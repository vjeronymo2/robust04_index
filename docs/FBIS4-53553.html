			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Japan declared Friday [20  May] it will join an international economic embargo against  Haiti to help oust its military government from power and  restore civilian rule.    Japan will stop loans and investment to Haiti's military  authorities in line with U.N. Security Council Resolution 917,  adopted on May 6, Foreign Ministry officials said.    The Japanese Government has already banned flights between  Japan and Haiti except for regular passenger flights, and has  also taken measures to prevent Haiti military leaders from  entering Japan, under the U.N. sanctions, it said.    Tokyo will also abide by a trade embargo against the  Caribbean state which takes effect at Saturday midnight, it said.    Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said in a  statement that Japan strongly hopes leaders of the Haiti  military will take immediate steps to restore democracy.    The Security Council unanimously voted on May 6 to tighten  sanctions against Haiti's military rulers to force them to allow  the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and  restore democracy.    The resolution calls for banning entry of Haiti military  leaders into all U.N. member countries, and embargoes exports to  Haiti except for medical goods and food.    It also recommends U.N. member countries to ensure that the  Haiti military and its leaders cannot use their funds and  financial resources.    The Haiti Army ousted Aristide, Haiti's first democratically  elected president, in a coup in September 1991.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kakh member Barukh Marzel has declared from his  hiding place that the four Kakh members who are hiding from the  security forces this morning started a hunger strike to protest  what they term the government's witch hunt against them.    David Axelrod, the Kahana Hay spokesman who resides in Kfar  Tapuah, told our correspondent Gil Litman that yesterday he  received an order restricting his movements and banning him from  entering Hebron and Qiryat Arba'. He was also ordered to return  his army-issued weapon to the IDF. Axelrod told our  correspondent he will not obey the two orders and that he  intends to come to Qiryat Arba' in order to visit the grave of  Barukh Goldstein. Axelrod claims he should keep his weapon for  self-defense purposes.</p>

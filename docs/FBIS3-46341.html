			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Yang Zhenwu (2799 2182 2976), </F> Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu Zhenying  (0491 2182 5391), and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149 1627)]    [Text] Beijing, 22 Jan (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a  theoretical course attended by leading cadres of democratic  parties, the All China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and  people without party affiliation, which closed on 22 January, Li  Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and chairman of the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference [CPPCC], noted: Building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is the greatest common ground of contemporary  Chinese people, and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on the united  front in the new period is the newest fruit of Marxism. He  stressed: In studying the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to persistently  integrate theory with practice, pay attention to investigating  new problems, and sum up new experience.    The ceremony for completion of the course, presided over by  Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and president of the Central Party  School, was held at Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai this afternoon.  During the 3-week study course, comrades have systematically  studied Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,"  discussed it in line with reality, and heard a report on the  current economic situation presented by Zhu Rongji, member of  the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau and vice premier.    At the ceremony, Wan Guoquan, executive vice chairman of the  Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction  Association [CDNCA], who also attended the study course, gave a  briefing on the studies and discussions during the course. Wang  Yiming, deputy director of the State Bureau of Technology  Supervision; He Luli, vice chairwoman of the Central Committee  of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and  vice mayor of Beijing Municipality; Lu Ming, vice chairman of  the CDNCA Central Committee and vice governor of Gansu Province;  and Zhao Weizhi, vice chairman of the Central Committee of the  Jiusan Society, successively talked about what they had learned  in the course. They summed up their rewards from participating  in it, saying: "This study at the beginning of the year will  drive us forward throughout the year and benefit our whole  lives." They maintained: The political basis of the system of  multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the  leadership of the CPC is the supporting and upholding of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line. As close and  friendly parties with the CPC, the democratic parties and the  CPC have treated each other with sincerity, and have shared weal  and woe. Only on the basis of this greatest common ground can  they participate in the administration and discussion of state  affairs, and constantly push the cause of the united front  forward.    Having heard the remarks of course members, Li Ruihuan said:  The common ground is the basis of unity and unification, the  goal of joint struggle, and the norm of standardized behavior.  The day of the extensive formation of this common ground is the  day when the people's cause advances triumphantly. After  reviewing the historical process of the new democratic  revolution and the construction of socialism, he pointed out:  Building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the  hard-earned common ground of contemporary Chinese people. As an  important member of the CPC's first-generation central leading  collective and the nucleus of the second-generation central  leading collective, Comrade Deng Xiaoping relied on his rich  experience, extraordinary wisdom, and outstanding courage and  resourcefulness as well as his historical position to integrate  the basic tenets of Marxism with the newly-developed situation  of today; to correctly sum up historical experiences; pool the  creativeness of the people; and thus put forward the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In compliance  with this theory, the Chinese people advanced bravely to bring  about a tremendous change in China's appearance; to maintain  high economic growth; markedly improve their living standards;  increase overall national strength by the day; constantly  promote China's international position; and steadily proceed  with the great cause of national reunification over the past  decade or so, despite many difficulties in their progress and  the changeable international situation. This is obvious to all  and universally acknowledged. The Chinese people have the  profound personal understanding that they have benefited from  these facts. It is an historical inevitability that building  socialism with Chinese characteristics will become the greatest  common ground of the Chinese people.    Li Ruihuan said: The united front is a unity of  similarities and dissimilarities. The greatest and most  important similarity among the Chinese people today is building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. This similarity is,  namely, the common ground. Only by recognizing and adhering to  this common ground can the united front retain its soul, and  keep consolidating and expanding. By adhering to this common  ground, we can "keep vigilance against right deviation" -- right  deviation means disregarding socialism and deviating from the  socialist course; we can also "guard against `left' deviation"  by adhering to this common ground -- `left' deviation means  denying Chinese characteristics, ignoring the development of the  times, and sticking to some outdated and even seriously  distorted concepts. Only by thoroughly grasping and correctly  understanding the essence and gist of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics can we constantly enhance and  scrupulously abide by the steadfastness of this common ground;  and, on the basis of this greatest common ground, better promote  and expand the cause of the united front, unite more people, and  further diversify ways and methods of work, so as to make  greater contributions to the revitalization of China and the  reunification of the motherland.    He continued: Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping is the concentrated exposition of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. It has comprehensively, correctly, and vividly  addressed Comrade Deng Xiaoping's methods to recognize a series  of important problems in the cause of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics, his ideological viewpoints, and the  threads of thought that form these viewpoints. The book is the  best teaching material and a powerful weapon for positively,  correctly, and comprehensively following through with the  party's basic line. Mastering this book is not only the CPC's  fundamental measure to strengthen the construction of  ideological theory, but also an important way to launch self-  education in the patriotic united front and enhance the common  ground.    Li Ruihuan said: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th  CPC Central Committee was held, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has led  the CPC to bring order out of chaos and brought about a great  historical change. He has established the ideological line of  emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts; corrected  the erroneous principle of "taking class struggle as the key  link"; accomplished the strategic shift in the CPC and state's  work emphasis; launched the great cause of reform and opening  up; made the decision to build a socialist market economic  system; set the goals that reform of the political system must  proceed in line with reform of the economic system and that a  socialist democracy be established; stressed the need to uphold  the party's basic line and that will not waver in it for 100  hundred years; put forward the criterion of "conducive to three  causes" [conducive to developing the productive forces of our  socialist society, increasing the overall strength of our  socialist country, and improving the people's living standards];  defined the form of coexistence of various forms of ownership  with public ownership as the dominating force; expounded the  viewpoint that science and technology constitute a primary  productive force; affirmed that intellectuals are a part of the  working class; created the magnificent idea of "peaceful  reunification; one country, two systems," and others. This  series of new ideas, theses, and summings-up are general  political principles of vital importance to the overall  situation, which generally sweep away the dense fog around the  cause of China's socialist construction and point out the  navigation route. In the meantime, all of these expositions are  closely related to the united front; they constitute an overall  background for the united front in the new era and produce a  very far-reaching influence on the quality, scope, targets,  missions, role, and methods of the united front's work.  Conforming to the situation and needs of reform, opening up,  and the modernization drive in the new era, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping also proposed a series of viewpoints, principles, and  policies with the features of this era on united front work,  adding brand-new contents to the CPC's treasure house of theory  on the united front. For example, the viewpoint that the united  front has developed into the most extensive league of the entire  socialist laborers and patriots who support socialism and the  reunification of the motherland; the viewpoint that a broad  scope of the united front, instead of a narrow one, is  appropriate and favorable; the viewpoint that multi- party  cooperation under CPC leadership is a feature and advantage of  China's political system, and that in a leading and ruling  position in the state's political life, the CPC should all the  more solicit and accept criticism and supervision from all  aspects, including democratic parties; the viewpoint that the  CPPCC is an important organization for consolidating and  expanding China's patriotic united front as well as an important  form of China's political system in demonstrating socialist  democracy, and others. In short, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has  adhered to Comrade Mao Zedong's correct views on the united  front. He has provided supplements to inadequate areas and  implemented things which could not be done. He has also  corrected some mistakes and put forward a series of viewpoints  never mentioned by Comrade Mao Zedong according to the new  situation. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's exposition on the united  front work in the new period is an important component part of  the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,  and is also a great invention of integrating the basic theory of  Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought for the united front  work with China's present actual situation. It has an extremely  important guiding significance to our doing a good job in the  united front work in the new period and developing and  perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation under the  leadership of the CPC and the political consultative system.    Li Ruihuan emphatically pointed out: Our study of the theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is not for  showing, but is to have a good grasp of this sharp weapon to  solve actual problems in reform, opening up, and the  modernization drive. Only by firmly combining theory with  practice can we increase our interest, study the theory in an  intensive manner, and apply it permanently.    He said: When we stress the need to combine theory with  practice, it does not mean we can pay no attention to studying  books. However, we must study books in an intensive manner,  study useful things, and study for the purpose of application.  In studying the Marxist theory, leading cadres must first study  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's works. The greatest feature of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory is that his theory is aimed at practical  things. He never wrote an article for the purpose of writing  something. Most of his articles are based on his research work  and are aimed at solving conspicuous and actual problems in some  fields during a specific period. His articles can explain the  profound things in simple terms and can be read easily. His  articles hold extremely profound truth with universal  significance. However, to truly understand and grasp the  essence of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory is not an easy thing.  We must make great efforts to have a good grasp of the essence  of his works.    He pointed out: Studying the new situation and summing up  new experiences under the guidance of theory are to meet the  need of our work, and are also very important ways to integrate  theory with practice. At present, we are striving to establish  a socialist market economic structure. This is a great social  system engineering, which calls for carrying out profound  transformation of our country's existing economic structure and  necessary reform of certain inappropriate things in the  superstructure. There are many problems which must be promptly  solved in the course of transformation and reform, including  both theoretical problems and problems in our actual work. Some  problems can be considered as having been solved under past  conditions, but they cannot be considered as having been solved  in the new situation; some problems seem to have been solved  theoretically, but they are out of line with practice; and some  problems seem to be nonexistent in general terms, but they are  still problems which must be solved if we study the situation in  a deep-going manner. Therefore, we must study and sum up those  problems in a penetrating way with the guidance of the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In a certain  sense, the course of establishing a socialist market economic  structure is a course of study--practice--summing up experiences  and restudy--practice again--summing up experiences again. It  is a course of combining theory with practice to constantly  deepen our understanding, to gradually improve our experiences,  and to enhance our consciousness of work day by day. Meanwhile,  it is also a course of constantly enriching and developing the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In  the past, the CPC and various democratic parties worked with  concerted efforts in good coordination. The theory and practice  of the united front work have constantly been enriched and  developed. In the future, we must inherit and carry forward  this good tradition, create and sum up more new experiences, and  jointly open up a new situation for the united front work.

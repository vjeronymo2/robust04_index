			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LANDRY DELAYS DECISION ON AIKMAN  </P> <P> Dallas Coach Tom Landry, back from a Hill Country vacation, said today the  Cowboys won't decide until February whether they will make UCLA's Troy Aikman  the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft.  </P> <P> Aikman led the Bruins to a 17-3 victory on Monday over the Arkansas Razorbacks  and was named the most valuable offensive player of the 53rd annual Cotton  Bowl.  </P> <P> Landry watched on television while celebrating the New Year with his family.  </P> <P> "I thought Troy did a good job of taking what Arkansas gave him," Landry said.  "They took away the deep pass, so he threw the short passes well. He did a good  job of directing the team. UCLA had a good running game and that helped."  </P> <P> Landry wouldn't say Aikman was a Cowboy yet, however.  </P> <P> "People say it would be a mistake to take him now without exploring all the  possibilities of having a first choice," Landry said. "Troy is a definite  prospect, but we ought to look overall into what is best for the team."  </P> <P> Landry said, "We've got plenty of time to make the pick. We have to finish off  some things from last season this month.  </P> <P> "I'd say we should be ready to make a decision around then. Once we do make our  choice and if it is Troy, then we'd like to sign him as soon as we could to get  him into quarterback school."  </P></p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Observer: Party line It is hard to know who was more gloomy about Russia's prospects - Vladimir Bukovsky, one of Russia's most famed dissidents, or Vasily Aksyonov, the emigre writer. 'The more often I come to this country the less hope I have of its revival,' moaned Bukovsky to a meeting of Russian scholars yesterday. Aksyonov opined that Russia's renaissance was impossible without the West's assistance. Neither of these two distinguished writers, who quit Russia because of their anti-communist beliefs, saw much to celebrate on their return. Bukovsky said that his country's revival was impossible while it was still being led by former communists, or 'kleptocrats' as he prefers to call them. This sort of talk clearly upset Sergei Stankevich, one of President Yeltsin's aides, who angrily insisted that Russia would revive, would not need Western assistance to do so, and would find its own 'Euro-Asiatic way' to a glorious future.</p>

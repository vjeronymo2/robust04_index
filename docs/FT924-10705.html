			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Brazil makes history with impeachment trial LATIN America's first impeachment trial gets fully under way today with the questioning of President Fernando Collor's lawyers before the Brazilian Senate. Mr Collor, the first directly elected president of Brazil for 30 years, was suspended from office a month ago after a popular movement and landslide Congressional vote in favour of his impeachment trial over allegations that he had masterminded a multi-million-dollar corruption scheme. Brazil now has an acting president, Mr Itamar Franco, who has stepped up from the vice-presidency, but Mr Collor, if absolved of the charges against him, could return to power. The national television news reports the activities of both men. Brazilian cartoonists depict Mr Collor as a phantom haunting the presidential palace. Still living in the capital, he seems to hope Mr Franco's government will be so disastrous that the public will clamour for his return. As he left office on October 2, Mr Collor told jeering crowds: 'I will return.' Those close to him say he still cannot believe his downfall. Demands for a helicopter and a large staff of aides and security guards have provoked charges that he is trying to mount a parallel government. Mr Collor has almost no chance of escaping victorious from the senate trial. The 81-member senate has always been heavily weighted against him and one senator described the forthcoming trial as 'like being thrown to the lions'. The Senate has six months to conclude the trial. Mr Collor is not expected to appear personally but will send lawyers, who are said to have been paid Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 307,000) to handle the case. In his 96-page defence, presented this week, the strategy is to blame everything on Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, Mr Collor's former friend and campaign treasurer, who is alleged to have run the corruption scheme. The document argues a lack of proof to link Mr Collor to Mr Farias. However, the latter's lawyers say he will not allow himself to be made the scapegoat. A 'corruption manual' (in the form of a computer disc seized by the police from Mr Farias's office) known as 'the PC doctrine' is reported to show the president's clear involvement. Mr Aristides Junqueira, attorney-general, said: 'The fact that Collor has transferred all blame for possible crimes to PC (Mr Farias) does not make him innocent.' Mr Junqueira will decide by November 6 whether to recommend criminal charges, though he has already said it is unlikely that Mr Collor will go to jail. The defence claims that the equivalent of Dollars 6.5m found by investigations to have been spent by Mr Collor on such things as his wife's wardrobe and a grandiose landscaping scheme was, in fact, the remains of a Dollars 5m loan raised in Uruguay for his electoral campaign. This so-called Uruguay operation is widely seen as discredited, and the original contract has never been unearthed. The Senate has demanded access to his bank accounts and telephone records, and will hear 17 witnesses, including Mr Marclio Marques Moreira, former economy minister, called by Mr Collor. The Senate's verdict is expected by mid-January. If found guilty, Mr Collor will be prevented from holding public office for eight years.</p>

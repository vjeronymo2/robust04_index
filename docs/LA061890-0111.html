The CBOE will build and operate the main computer for the system  and Reuters will build the network that provides traders access to the markets'  computer.  </P> <P> Other exchanges, specifically the New York Stock Exchange and the Tokyo  Exchange, have been invited to join the system, officials said.  </P></p>

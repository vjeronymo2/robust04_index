			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The ability of Slovakia's new government  to sustain a viable coalition is the subject of recent  commentaries in the Slovak and Czech press, with some observers  expressing optimistic views and others showing considerable  doubts. Writing in the independent Bratislava daily NARODNA  OBRODA of 27 March, Jan Fuelle argues that the new government  coalition's success in accomplishing its avowed  mission--preparing an early election and laying the foundation  for Slovakia's economic stabilization--depends, among other  things, on its being able to establish a framework for the  emergence of "meaningful and viable" political groupings having  clearly defined programs. Such a framework, he suggests, would  resemble the Western-type division of political forces into  left-wing, center, and right-wing parties.    Anyone looking at the composition of the new Slovak  Government and at the prominent politicians whose influence made  its creation possible, says Fuelle, would be struck by the fact  that these men represent quite disparate, even contradictory,  political views and that few apparent personal ties or, perhaps,  common convictions bind them together. He writes:    "Until recently, Jozef Moravcik was foreign affairs  minister;  his predecessor in that office was Milan Knazko [currently  chairman of the Alliance of Democrats of Slovakia]. At one time,  Ludovit Cernak [currently chairman of the National Democratic  Party] held the post of economy minister in the same government  and, half a year ago, he signed a coalition agreement in the  same room in which, last Monday night, he signed another  agreement, this time with different partners and for a different  purpose. Roman Kovac [former deputy prime minister and a  prominent Movement for a Democratic Slovakia member] who also  took part in the Monday signing ceremony, witnessed, while  participating in the previous government's decision making, the  expulsion of Milan Knazko, only to have the same fate overtake  him. Jan Carnogursky [chairman of the Christian Democratic  Movement, KDH] vehemently attacked the government, which  included Jozef Moravcik, Milan Knazko, and Ludovit Cernak, as  well as Roman Kovac; on the KDH election posters in 1990 one  could read the slogan, `Let's Contain Communism.' Now, the  former communist Peter Weiss could be seen sitting side by side  with Carnogursky as he signed a document which mandated that,  among other things, an SDL [Party of the Democratic Left] member  be in charge of the Defense Ministry while a KDH member be  entrusted with the Interior Ministry."    But to focus on this seemingly "absurd situation," suggests  Fuelle, would be to miss the really significant point:  "Politicians with such disparate views have been able to reach  agreement." This, Fuelle believes, is a clear sign that by  having managed to arrive at a number of compromises, they have  adopted a truly democratic approach to the solution of the  governmental crisis. Still, he continues, "so far all they have  agreed on have been signatures" on the coalition document. The  difficult moves "are yet to be made." To strengthen Slovak  democracy, they must be "capable of additional compromises."  Their larger mission must include the task of "regrouping" the  existing Slovak political arrangements. For unlike the  democratic Western countries, he argues, the Slovak political  spectrum lacks a consolidated center. Missing between "a strong  left" and "an emerging right" is "a viable center party." Being,  by their own admission, moderate politicians of centrist  orientation, the leaders of the forces behind the new coalition  government--Fuelle mentions Cernak, Knazko, and Moravcik--now  have a chance to create such a missing political entity, a  center party that would "claim as its members many well-known  and experienced politicians." Fuelle thinks that this can be  accomplished by integration--primarily the integration of groups  that have broken off from Meciar's HZDS--and "by finding  partners abroad," i.e., association with parallel European  political institutions. Should this succeed, he reasons, such a  party "could play still another role--the role of a balancing  factor."    Peter Weiss, SDL leader and one of the architects of the  anti-Meciar coalition, feels that this coalition is capable of  offering to the Slovak voters a government that not only  tolerates plurality of views among its members but is resolved  to forge, out of this diversity, a "pragmatic" program aimed  specifically at bringing the country out of its current  political and economic impasse. In an interview appearing in the  30 March issue of Prague's DENNI TELEGRAF, Weiss sounds a  cautiously optimistic note concerning the coalition's future.  "We do not consider ourselves defeated in advance," he says,  "and are not pessimists. Quite the contrary, we see a realistic  chance in this lineup of being able to play at least a drawn  game with the HZDS." And when he describes the strategy that the  coalition is adopting as its own, Weiss echoes Fuelle's point  about close relations among coalition parties that favor  compromise solutions and about approximating Western models. The  coalition, he stresses, is taking "the path of normal  cooperation among political parties patterned after those that  exist in the West. Precisely therein lies the alternative to  populist and excessively nationalist policies, to  confrontational and intransigent policies, to the policy of  searching for an enemy," which he ascribes to the Meciar regime.    In contrast to Fuelle and Weiss, Slovak journalist and  political analyst Egon T. Lansky views the coalition's prospects  with pessimism. In the Prague English-language weekly newspaper  PROGNOSIS of 31 March, Lansky reviews the events leading to the  mid-March negotiations formation of the Moravcik government and  concludes that, in spite of all appearances, the opposition to  Meciar remains internally divided. This, Lansky argues, is the  result of instability and confusion that has plagued Slovak  politics "since the Communists turned capitalists" in 1989. Ever  since that time, the Slovak political scene has been  characterized by "complete lack of both political vision and  distinguished personalities." Consequently, attempts at  presenting a realistic political program for the country have  been frustrated. It is doubtful, Lansky continues, whether one  can expect a turn to the better now. While the anti-Meciar  forces have finally been able to form a unified front, he  writes, "uniting against Meciar is not enough" and, what is  worse, the old "divisions and animosities" still seem to  persist. "The lines dividing communists and anticommunists,  nationalists and democrats (the few there are), as well as  ultranationalists, Catholic nationalists, and less nationalist  nationalists, often run across rather than between political  groups," even for the Hungarians, "whom everyone needs" but with  whom "few want to cooperate." Considering this "irrationality of  Slovak politics," Lansky holds out little hope for the success  of the coalition government. He sees no real possibility of  reaching what Fuelle calls "additional compromises" and thus for  the emergence of a stabilizing political center. "Chances are,"  he writes, "that even new elections will not bring a decisive  change toward a stable, more democratic, and, above all, viable  government." Slovakia after the elections, he adds, is likely to  have "a weak government that is incapable of tackling the  serious social and economic problems "--or Meciar could possibly  return to power. Faced with these alternatives, Lansky admits  that he is "not sure" which of the two "is worse."</p>

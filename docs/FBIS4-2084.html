			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- China is trying to  maintain a sustained and quick economic development on a stable  and healthy basis, Vice-President Rong Yiren told a delegation  led by Shoji Umemura, president of Japan's Nikko Securities  Co.Ltd, here this morning.    Nikko Securities, one of Japan's leading securities  companies, has helped raise overseas funds for the Bank of  China, China International Trust and Investment Corporation  (CITIC) and some of China's local trust and investment  corporations.    Rong said he was pleased that Nikko securities made efforts  to expand its business in China and to plunge into China's  burgeoning securities market.    He also expressed his appreciation for Nikko's promoting  Sino- Japanese cooperation in finance and securities.    Rong said that China's 15-year-long reform and opening-up  had  earned global admiration, while coming across some problems.    China is trying to maintain a sustained and quick as well as  stable and healthy economic growth, Rong said.    It is in the interests of China and Japan, two friendly  neighbors, to strengthen cooperation in every field, Rong added,  hoping that Nikko does yet more to promote Sino-Japanese  economic, especially financial and securities, cooperation.    Sho ji Umemura said Nikko is willing to continue its  collaboration with China and further bilateral economic  exchanges.    Sho ji Umemura and his party came to China at CITIC's  invitation.    Wei Mingyi, CITIC's chairman, also took part in the meeting.</p>

Politicians,  observers, and media analysts consider this summit the most  prominent event of the year given that it may activate the  Middle East peace process and achieve positive, honorable, and  satisfactory results on all tracks.    The fact that 4,000 reporters from all over the world are  flocking to Geneva gives an idea of the attention given by the  world community to this summit and the great aspirations raised  by it. The sincere hope that the results of this summit will be  translated on the ground into a just and comprehensive peace in  the region and into prosperity in the post-peace era. This  large-scale concern over the Syrian-U.S. summit is evidence of  the entire world's yearning to achieve a firm peace in the  Middle East, the principal supporter of which is Syria.    The world community is fully aware that separate deals do  not  achieve peace but increase tension. It is also aware that  Syria's call for a just, comprehensive, and honorable peace  based on Security Council resolutions opens the road toward real  stability in the region.    There is no doubt that the entire world is sick and tired of  Israel's repressive and inhuman acts inside the occupied Arab  territories. These acts worry the human conscience and cause it  to question the purpose behind the international silence over  Israel's serious violations of international principles and laws  and the point behind the super powers' use of double standards.    Israel is imposing a tight siege on the occupied  territories.  The Israeli Army and Zionist settlers are destroying Arab  neighborhoods, scorching property owned by Palestinians, and  killing Palestinians. Moreover, Israel rejects the Security  Council resolutions and insists on occupation and expansion and  on obstructing the peace efforts. All this constitutes a real  threat not only to Middle East peace but to world peace as well,  given the impact the Middle East has throughout the world.    It is worth noting that this world concern focuses on the  need for Israel to submit to the resolutions of international  legitimacy and to frankly announce that the Golan is Syrian  territory, from which Israel should fully withdraw. This is a  sign that Syria's sincere efforts to achieve peace have born  fruit. The world community never cast doubts on the Arab's  intentions, but is casting doubts on Israel's intentions and is  denouncing its intransigent stands. The world community went  beyond this, noting that President al-Asad's stands are  principled stands that cannot be bargained over.    The world's great politicians always take international  public opinion into consideration. International public opinion  demands a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East that  removes the Israeli occupation and restores to the Palestinians  their national legitimate rights, the most important of which is  their right to self-determination.    Certainly, President al-Asad, who has been known as a man of  principle and decisionmaking, will not only represent Syria but  will represent all the Arabs as well. He will be the staunch  defender of the principles of right, justice, and fairness,  without which there can be no peace in the Middle East.    Peace contradicts occupation and occupation contradicts  dignity. A stable and firm peace must be based on justice and  dignity. Justice stipulates the full withdrawal of Israel from  all the occupied Arab territories. Dignity stipulates the  restoration of the Palestinian people right to regain their  freedom and self-determination.    The Arab-Israeli conflict has many important and serious  aspects. These include Israel's withdrawal from the occupied  territories, the Palestinian people's rights, the issues of  refugees, evacuees, displaced people, and deportees. All of  these aspects are collective and their solutions lie in  implementing Security Council resolutions and entrenching the  principles of international law. The success of the summit,  which is important to the entire world, is contingent on its  success in tackling these issues.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: British Gas at new peak AGGRESSIVE buying in both cash and traded options markets drove British Gas to an all-time high in very heavy turnover. The shares ended 11 1/2 ahead at 314 1/2 p, after a day's peak of 315p. Turnover reached 14.2m. Energy specialists said the shares had responded to a handful of large buying orders in midsession, most notably the purchase of a block of 1.5m shares at 313p. It was also suggested that marketmakers had sought to hedge positions in the traded options market. Turnover in British Gas traded options totalled 586 contracts. There were hints that at least one influential broking house had shifted to a positive stance on the shares, although this could not be confirmed. British Gas, along with other utility issues, is viewed by fund managers as one of the market's best defensive stocks.</p>

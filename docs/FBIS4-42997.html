			<p>BFN     [Text] Heidelberg -- This evening French President  Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed to the  young people of their countries to support European unification.  At a meeting of young people from France and Germany in  Heidelberg, both statesmen emphasized that Europe's unification  ensures peace and freedom for future generations.    Addressing about 6,000 young people, Mitterrand stressed  that  numerous rivalries and passions separated the Germans and the  French in the past. The things that divide them must be  overcome with an "invincible will." Franco-German  reconciliation after World War II has paved the way for Europe.  The European Union was founded by 12 states in Maastricht.  Soon it will include 16 countries. "In the 21st century, we  must think of the whole of Europe," the president stressed.  Mitterrand pointed out that every country should "maintain its  identity and be proud of its history," and "we must now develop  a common history."    Kohl called on the young people to support the vision of  united Europe with all their strength. Without the  Franco-German partnership after World War II, the work of  European unification would not have been initiated. The  chancellor assessed the fact that so many young people  participated in the meeting, which took place under the slogan  "Shaping Europe," as proof that the two peoples have become  friends. Kohl called on the young people to prevent a return of  the evil specters of nationalism of the past. Every generation  is facing this challenge anew.    Young people from German and French sports and other clubs,  school and town partnerships, participants in exchange programs,  and soldiers from the Franco-German brigade are participating in  the meeting, which was also attended by the foreign ministers of  both countries, Klaus Kinkel and Alain Juppe, and French  Minister for Youth and Sports Michele Alliot-Marie and her  German counterpart Angela Merkel. In the evening, Mitterrand  and Kohl discussed ideas about a future Europe with 200 young  people at the youth festival which was accompanied by musical  and artistic events.</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Lottery money will not replace public spending, PM pledges The strongest assurance yet was given by the prime minister yesterday that the billions of pounds to be raised by the National Lottery for good causes would not replace government spending. Mr John Major told the English Heritage Conference in London: 'On the government's side - Treasury, please note - we will make no case-by-case reductions on conventional public spending programmes to take account of awards from the lottery.' The lottery, due to be launched on November 19, could raise Pounds 9bn over the next six years. 'The money raised by the lottery will not replace existing government spending,' Mr Major emphasised in response to a long-standing fear. He envisaged that the lottery, to be run by the Camelot consortium, would mainly aid capital schemes. 'Projects must benefit primarily the public good rather than private gain, and must be financially viable,' he said. He was determined that the whole country would share in the opportunities once only available to a privileged few. 'I strongly believe man cannot live by GDP alone,' the prime minister said. The money raised by the National Lottery will go equally to the arts, charities, a millennium fund, the national heritage and sports. Mr Major said the designated distributing bodies would decide where the money would be spent. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow national heritage secretary, said she was still worried that some ministers would have few qualms about using lottery proceeds to replace statutory funding programmes. At the conference, Mr Major outlined some of the possibilities for the fund designed to mark the millennium. They could range from engineering and construction projects to ways to help the environment and equipping village halls with computers.</p>

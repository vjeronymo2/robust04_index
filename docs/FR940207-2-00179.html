			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 10. The Series will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The Series will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholders reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the Series as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Series' per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Series. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Series' net asset value and public offering price will present each class of shares separately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when shares of a particular class may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Fund to agree to conform to these standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees of the Fund with respect to the multi-class arrangement will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the trustees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply SEC approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that may be made pursuant to the rule 12b-1 distribution plans or a Shareholder Service Plan in reliance on the exemptive order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the trustees of the Fund including a majority of the independent trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by the Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the trustees, and the trustees shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. If the Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b-1 plans (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a Shareholder Services Plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the Target Class shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The trustees shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class or shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class shares will convert into New Target Class shares. A New Target Class or New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in any manner that the trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class shares or New Purchase Class shares shall be borne solely by the Adviser and Distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c-10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

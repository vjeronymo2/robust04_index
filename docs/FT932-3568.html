			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Howard favours Sunday opening MR MICHAEL HOWARD, home secretary, yesterday came down firmly in favour of deregulating Sunday shop opening hours, saying that he did not believe any other alternative would work. Mr Howard said, however, that MPs would still be given a choice of four options for reforming Britain's widely-discredited Sunday trading laws and hinted that he was prepared to listen to arguments for a compromise solution. Speaking on BBC Television, Mr Howard made clear his preference for extending the Conservatives' free-market economics to the high street. The Home Office will publish a draft Sunday trading bill before the Commons recess which starts at the end of next month. The four choices are: Total deregulation with shops able to open on Sundays like any other day. Partial deregulation with larger shops restricted to six hours opening and smaller shops totally deregulated. Limiting opening to convenience stores and sales of emergency supplies. A complex compromise that would allow all shops to open on the four Sundays before Christmas but only certain categories of shops to open on other Sundays.</p>

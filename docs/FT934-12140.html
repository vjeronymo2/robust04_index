			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Tumim warns of jail overcrowding PRISON overcrowding will undermine the significant improvements made in the country's jails and reduce their impact in cutting crime, Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons, warned yesterday following the publication of his annual report. Judge Tumim said that a lot of prisons were beginning to play a crime prevention role by encouraging prisoners to lead law-abiding lives and learn something positive. Overcrowding would mean a return to 'warehousing' of prisoners who came out as bad as they went in. 'There is a real risk of going back to overcrowded jails and crisis management which would be disastrous,' he said. Judge Tumim's report says that the prison building programme has created a number of new prisons with model regimes which function well. However, many prisoners are still held in Victorian prisons on cramped urban sites. These lack the space and facilities to occupy prisoners' time constructively, he said. Judge Tumim commends the progress made on improving sanitary and catering arrangements in prisons. But this has sometimes been at the expense of upgrading or creating facilities for out-of-cell activity, he says. He added that the privatisation of the management at some prisons appears to have encouraged prison staff to be more innovative and flexible in their work. 'This may produce a growing recognition that establishments could be run more effectively, with more humane lives for prisoners, more job satisfaction and greater value for money, if staff . . . are used more flexibly and sensibly,' he added. The report condemns the handling by the Prison Service of the contracting out of prison education services. Report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons. HMSO. Pounds 9.80.</p>

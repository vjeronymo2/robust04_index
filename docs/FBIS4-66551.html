			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 7--The Janata Dal-Ajit [JD-A]  leader, Mr. Rasheed Masood, today announced the merger of his  party with the Samajwadi Party led by the Uttar Pradesh Chief  Minister, Mr. Mulayam Singh Yadav. The formal decision was taken  at a national convention of the JD-A held here today, which was  later addressed by Mr. Mulayam Singh.    The merger at the national level is likely to have its  impact  on the arithmetic in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly also and  indications are that a section of Janata Dal MLAs [members of  Legislative Assembly] in the State will formally join the SP-BSP  [Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party] Government. Claiming that  a majority of the 27 Dal MLAs were in favour of merging with the  Samajwadi Party, the Uttar Pradesh JD-A secretary, Mr.  Kailashnath Singh Yadav, said that a formal announcement in this  regard will be made soon.    Addressing a packed audience of JD-A workers from various  districts of Western Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Mulayam Singh stressed  his party's role in "containing and combating" the forces of  communalism led by the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]. Extolling  the virtues of the Charan Singh, Mr. Yadav extended an open  invitation to all the followers of Ram Manohar Lohia and Charan  Singh to join the Samajwadi Party.    Source of strength: Even though the merger moves  were anticipated for over a fortnight now, Mr. Mulayam Singh was  visibly excited at the convention. Considering that the  Samajwadi Party is relatively weak in the Western districts of  Uttar Pradesh, the entry of Mr. Masood into the fold is indeed a  great source of strength for the party, said his close associate.    Describing that the JD-A decision to merge with the SP as  one  conditioned by the "ground realities in Uttar Pradesh" where the  SP had emerged "as the centre of anti-communal forces," Mr.  Masood claimed that the entire rank and file of the Janata Dal-A  were with him.    Referring to the possibility of JD MLAs joining the SP, Mr.  Masood appeared confident of a majority falling in line.  However, he added that for strategic reasons of not exposing the  27 strong State legislature party to a split, the MLAs were kept  away from today's convention. Contesting Mr. Ajit Singh's claims  that majority of the legislature party was with him to join the  Congress(I), the Masood camp claimed all but five MLAs out of 27  were inclined to join the Mulayam Singh Government.    Fellow MP [member of Parliament], Mr. Upendranath Verma  submitted a note of dissent on the "timing of the merger."  Though Mr. Masood claimed that the merger decision had the  approval of Mr. Verma and the third JD-A MP, Mr. Ram Sunder Das,  both of them were conspicuous by their absence at the convention.</p>

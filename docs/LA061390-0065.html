			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VERLAINE UNPLUGS HIS GUITAR FOR SOLO TOUR;  </P> <P> ROCK: THE SEMINAL SONGWRITER-GUITARIST WITH A LONG HISTORY OF AMPLIFIED  EXCURSIONS GOES ACOUSTIC IN SOUTHLAND TOUR.  </P> <P> In an ideal universe, all rock albums would be titled "Adventure," or at least  would try to live up to that label. To Tom Verlaine, whose seminal '70s band  Television did indeed claim "Adventure" as the title to its second LP, that's  the whole point of the music.  </P> <P> "It always surprises me when I hear so many bands sounding like so many other  bands," Verlaine said in a recent phone interview from his Manhattan apartment.  "I always felt like there was an obligation to either do something fresh or to  do something that somehow was like making something for yourself, really to  surprise yourself."  </P> <P> With Television then and in a solo career dotted with infrequent pulses of  brilliance, the singer/songwriter/guitarist has created a body of songs that so  sharply delineate interior emotional landscapes that they can seem like dreams  held in place with a spike.  </P> <P> Using a standard rock instrumentation, Verlaine's recordings construct  multitiered architectures of sound, inhabited by a fearless fretboard style  that shoves his electric guitar beyond the boundaries of musical reason.  </P> <P> In light of his history of amplified excursions, Verlaine's current move  certainly qualifies as adventurous. He has embarked on a solo acoustic tour,  which began Tuesday at San Juan Capistrano's Coach House and continues tonight  at Bogart's in Long Beach and Thursday and Friday at McCabe's -- with  intentions of issuing an equally acoustic album later this year. But while at  odds with practically everything he has put on record, the acoustic side is  nothing new to Verlaine.  </P> <P> "All the songs in the last bunch of years are written on acoustic guitar, and I  started playing acoustic shows in '85 in Europe," he said, "It just had a  certain appeal to me. Maybe it's an intimacy factor. It really puts you into  your voice. And it actually puts you into your body in a way that electric  music doesn't. It's a mystery to me, but it's something I like to hear and do."  </P> <P> He initially wanted to do an acoustic album in 1984, but the idea was turned  down by his record label, Phonogram in Britain. That proved to be the least of  his troubles with the label, which, Verlaine claims, refused to issue one  completed album and grievously remixed and delayed his last two releases,  "Flash Light" and "The Wonder." The latter, recorded in 1988, wasn't issued in  Europe until earlier this year, and remains unreleased in the United States.  </P> <P> If Verlaine's songs seem to be born of a dreamlike reverie, that isn't far from  the actual source for many of them. "Pillow" on "The Wonder" is a haunting  lullaby made up of fragmentary scenes from a relationship, some observed by a  dove outside the couple's window.  </P> <P> "A lot of the ideas I get seem to be when I'm falling asleep at night,"  Verlaine said. "I often hit this place where sometimes I can remember and  sometimes I can't, but something goes on there. And sometimes it's literally  like there's a bird there that you're having a conversation with. Often there's  music there as well.  </P> <P> "If I can wake myself out of it, or generally I kind of double up out of it --  it's a weird state -- I'll go to the tape deck and hum a melody, then fall  asleep, and the next day I'll hear it and it'll bring some of that back."  </P> <P> When not working on music or traveling -- he likes extended visits out of New  York, such as the two months he spent in L.A. last year -- Verlaine pursues a  fascination with the byways taken by the human mind. He says he once spent five  months studying various psychoanalytic theories.  </P> <P> "Or I hit moods where I want to learn about how somebody thought things that  could be so foreign to me. It could be a poet, a theorist, a linguist, or a  composer that grabs you. I was reading some letters by Liszt, and this guy's  outlook is just so totally different from anything you would imagine for  yourself, very courteous but ferocious, a strong character.  </P> <P> "I don't think these interests color what I write. But I think that it helps  keep your brain strong by studying outlooks that are so foreign to your own. I  try to work out 'How and why did this person ever develop this?' "  </P> <P> And if someone were to pore over Verlaine's own works with such an intent?  </P> <P> "I think they'd say, 'Well, this guy's method was chaos.' "  </P></p>

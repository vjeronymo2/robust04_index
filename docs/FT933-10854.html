			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Strategy on jobs 'beats EC rivals' THE UK government is 'winning the argument' with its European partners about how to combat unemployment by reducing employment regulation and increasing labour flexibility, according to Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary. He was speaking yesterday as the Treasury and his own department released separate submissions to European Commission reviews of competition and employment. The Treasury submission says that improving skills and productivity is not, as often argued, in conflict with reducing the high cost and strict regulation of labour. 'On the contrary, if the costs of employment are too high, profits are reduced and investment in both capital goods and human skills is held back,' the report states. 'For many unemployed people the chance to return to work is more important than the nature of the work or its terms and conditions. Temporary or part-time jobs can be a route back into work, enabling people to move into more traditional full-time jobs later if they wish,' it continues. It says that EC labour costs rose by 4 per cent per year during the 1980s compared with 0 to 1 per cent in the US and Japan. Also, public social security and healthcare as a proportion of GDP is nearly twice as high in the EC compared with Japan and more than 60 per cent higher than in the US. The Treasury strongly rejects the idea that there should be a provision in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to control the imports of goods from economies with low labour costs. It recommends instead that the EC should do more to remove the barriers to enterprise and monitor more carefully the effects on jobs and competition of all new regulations. The employment department submission to the Social Affairs Directorate General's green paper review of employment legislation, due in the autumn, said that co-operation between member states was usually preferable to legislation. Where legislation is necessary it should only be drawn up after much wider consultation than is customary and should just set a general framework allowing individual countries to fill in details.</p>

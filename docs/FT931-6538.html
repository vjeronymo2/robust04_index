			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Public services LAST WEEK'S report on the collapse of the London Ambulance Service's new computer for despatching vehicles to emergencies makes sorry reading. The computer system crashed after a series of management failures, plunging the capital's ambulance service into chaos. The LAS chairman has resigned and reforms are under way, but there are lessons here for all the public services. In the health service, as in other key public services, the government has delegated management responsibility to a series of quangos. These are usually dominated by professional managers and by business executives; elected representatives of the local community have often been excluded. The aim is to work along more businesslike lines, giving managers more freedom. Much of this revolution in the management of public services is valuable and long-overdue. It has also required determination, given the opposition of many who work in the public services. But in its haste to force through change, the government has given inadequate attention to the question of accountability. It is not enough for public services to be efficient: they must be accountable to those who pay for them. This accountability can often be exercised through choice. Parents, for example, can choose between different state schools, patients between competing family doctors. But where there is a monopoly - as, currently, with the ambulance service - mechanisms are needed to ensure that the taxpayer who pays the piper calls the tune. That was manifestly not the case under the arrangements for managing London's ambulances. It was obvious to patients, doctors and hospital administrators that the service was quite inadequate. Yet the LAS board failed to remedy those defects: it demanded too little information to make informed judgments; and it was too ready to accept the assurances of senior managers that problems were being resolved. The regional health authority responsible for the ambulance service was reluctant to interfere, since it had delegated responsibility to the LAS board. The problems were exacerbated by a management style which created a 'fear of failure', mistakenly believed to be modelled on best private-sector practice. This put undue pressure on managers to meet over-ambitious targets and to ignore obvious difficulties. It also undervalued good communications between managers and staff, leaving an atmosphere of mistrust. If similar failures are to be avoided in the future, the government must ensure that clear lines of managerial and public accountability are established when responsibility for services is delegated to quangos. With similar reforms now mooted for the police, it would be unforgiveable if the lessons of the London Ambulance Service were not learnt.</p>

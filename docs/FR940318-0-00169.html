			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These solvents, unlike class I and II compounds, do not contribute to stratospheric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ozone depletion, and generally have short atmospheric lifetimes. Yet many of the organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvents are regulated as VOCs because they can contribute to ground-level ozone formation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, certain of the organic solvents are toxic to human health and are subject to waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling standards under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workplace standards set by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, xylene and toluene may be used as substitutes but are, once they become wastes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated under RCRA as listed or characteristic wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other chlorinated solvents.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to MCF and CFC&hyph;113, the three other commonly used chlorinated solvents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are trichloroethylene (``TCE''), methylene chloride (``meth''), and perchloroethylene (``perc'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unlike MCF and CFC&hyph;113, these chlorinated solvents have very short atmospheric lifetimes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and are not considered to contribute to ozone depletion. However, all three have known  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity problems and are regulated as Hazardous Air Pollutants under section 112 of title III  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Clean Air Act. They are also subject to waste handling standards under RCRA and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workplace standards set by OSHA. Additionally, TCE and perc exhibit photochemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactivity, and are regulated as smog precursors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The phaseout of CFC&hyph;113 and MCF has prompted a renewed interest in meth, TCE,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and perc, despite these toxicity concerns. The three solvents are mostly viewed as potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> metal cleaning substitutes, especially since they can be used in conventional vapor degreasing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. In fact, these three solvents were the preferred industrial solvents until concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about their toxicity and anticipated lowering of the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (PELs) resulted in a switch by some users to MCF.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to such concerns, equipment vendors have now developed equipment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using these solvents that significantly limit their emissions. The availability of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment has prompted environmental agencies in other western countries, such as Germany,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to relax restrictions on the use of these chemicals. Such equipment, although expensive, can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now be purchased in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> No-clean alternatives.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No-clean alternatives involve the use of fluxes or cutting oils that need not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed after the manufactured part is fully formed. It offers an efficient solution to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning problem, since it sidesteps the need for cleaning altogether. This type of substitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represents one of the few process changes possible in the solvents cleaning sector. Water-removable products are products where the soils or fluxes can be removed using water as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to other types of chemical solvents. In electronics cleaning, where these two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches are in more widespread use, no-clean or water-removable alternatives rely either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on special fluxes or on a soldering process that eliminates or reduces the residues otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed through the cleaning step.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In metal preparations, an increasing common process change is to use vanishing oils.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These oils are refined mineral spirits, usually odorless, that flash off after the metal forming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> step is completed thus eliminating the need for cleaning. Technically, this process can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred to as a ``no-clean'' process, although that term is usually reserved for electronics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Perfluorocarbons.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are fully fluorinated compounds, unlike either CFCs, HCFCs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or HFCs. Perfluorocarbons presently employed or being investigated for commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications for cleaning are C5F12, C6F12, C6F14, C7F16, C8F18, C5F11NO, C6F13NO,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C7F15NO, and C8F16.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These compounds are being discussed as part of innovative cleaning and drying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems to replace ozone-depleting solvents used in cleaning. These systems would use an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aqueous or solvent cleaner bath with PFCs for rinsing and/or drying. Although the PFCs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technically are being used as drying agents in this system, it is due to the replacement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFC&hyph;113 as a cleaner that the PFCs are being used, which is why PFCs are addressed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent cleaning sector. PFCs also have solvent displacement properties (including for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> displacement of water), that may make their use necessary. Although these systems have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical potential to meet a number of cleaning needs, the expense of the PFCs may limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> widespread commercial interest in systems that use these compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The environmental characteristics of concern for these compounds are high global  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warming potential (5,000&hyph;10,000 times greater than CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and long atmospheric lifetimes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3,000&hyph;5,000 years). Although the actual contributions to global warming depend upon the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantities of PFCs emitted, the warming effects of PFCs are essentially irreversible. In other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respects, PFCs are benign and are generally nontoxic, nonflammable, and do not contribute to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground-level ozone formation. Environmental concerns associated with use of PFCs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in the comment response section of this preamble, section III.D. Technology for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containment and recycling of PFCs is commercially available and is recommended by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to offset any possible adverse environmental effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Monochlorotoluene/benzotrifluorides.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Monochlorotoluene and benzotrifluorides are of commercial interest as solvent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes in a variety of cleaning applications. These compounds can be used either in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> isolation or in various mixtures, depending on desired chemical properties. The Agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> still receiving toxicity and exposure information on these formulations and will issue a SNAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination for these substitutes when SNAP review is complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

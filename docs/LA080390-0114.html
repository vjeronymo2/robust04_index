			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Sprinter Carl Lewis, the world record-holder at 100 meters, is expected to be  sidelined for the next three weeks after suffering a leg injury during a New  York track meet in last week, Tom Tellez said.  </P> <P> Tellez, coach at the University of Houston, said Lewis was to run in Brussels  this weekend.  </P> <P> "It's more of a cramp than a pull," Tellez said. "It's not as bad as a pull,  but you still have some bleeding in the muscle."  </P> <P> The Associated Press quoted an unidentified source as saying Lewis would not  race Ben Johnson this year in a showdown of the world's two fastest sprinters.  Johnson defeated Lewis in the 1988 Olympic 100 final but was subsequently  disqualified for two years after testing positive for steroids.  </P> <P> Johnson's ban ends Sept. 24 and a series of match races between the sprinters  was discussed.  </P></p>

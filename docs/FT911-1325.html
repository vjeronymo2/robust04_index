			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Wagons-Lits slips more than 60% in year NET PROFIT at Wagons-Lits, the Franco-Belgian tourism group, fell by more than 60 per cent last year, hit by increased debt and continuing difficulties with Europcar, its British car-hire subsidiary, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The group's net profits tumbled from BFr1.46bn (Dollars 40.7m) to BFr547m in 1990, the second successive year in which profits have declined. In 1988 the group made BFr2.68bn after tax. Operating profit also dropped last year, from BFr3.1bn to BFr2.49bn, although turnover rose slightly to BFr98.9bn, compared with BFr96.4bn. The company is proposing to cut its dividend from BFr129 to BFr100 a share. The results were also hit by an increase in the debt linked to Wagons-Lits' stake in Sodexho, the French catering group, which was sold earlier this year, and reduced margins in the original railway sleeping and dining-car operations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Major General Ilan Biran, commander of Central  Command, today decided to impose a closure on Jericho to allow  the heads of the Palestinian police in the city to organize.  The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] wishes to make sure that all  the Palestinian policemen stationed in the city are clear on  their authorities and powers pertaining to Israeli citizens  traveling inside Jericho. The decision came in the wake of a  series of incidents over the past few days, including this  morning's incident.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  the Yemeni Presidential Council chairman, arrived in Doha  Airport at 1230 today on a visit to the sisterly State of Qatar.    His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir of the  State of Qatar, led those who received brother President Salih.  [passage omitted on reception ceremony]    President Salih made a statement to the press in which he  said: I am pleased to visit the sisterly State of Qatar and to  meet with my brother His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al  Thani, amir of Qatar.    During this visit, we will discuss several issues that  concern our warm fraternal relations and the spheres of  cooperation between our two sisterly countries. I am satisfied  with the continuous progress in these relations, which reflects  the aspirations of the two fraternal peoples. Discussions will  also deal with regional developments and issues that concern the  region and the Arab nation.    During this visit, I will brief my brother Shaykh Khalifah  on  developments in our country and the efforts made to overcome the  political crisis that is endangering unity and stability in our  country. We appreciate the efforts the brothers are making  toward bolstering Yemeni unity in its capacity as a pan-Arab  achievement that should be preserved in order to entrench peace  and stability in the region.    I express the appreciation of our country -- its leadership,  government, and people -- for our brothers in Qatar, led by His  Highness Shaykh Khalifah, for their fraternal positions toward  our country, and their pan-Arab eagerness to safeguard the  Yemeni unity.    We appreciate the Qatari brothers' support for development  in  Yemen, which is something that demonstrates the depth of warm  fraternal bilateral relations. [passage omitted]</p>

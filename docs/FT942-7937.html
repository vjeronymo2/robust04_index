			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / The Markets: Unloading coffee stocks - Commodity Market Report Representatives of coffee-producing countries accounting for more than 90 per cent of world output gather in London today for a two-day meeting on ways of releasing up to 2.5m bags (60kg each) of beans stored under their export retention scheme. Last October the producers began stockpiling amounts equal to 20 per cent of exports in an attempt to revive sagging prices. Thanks to the price surge since then, at first encouraged by the scheme but subsequently fuelled by a genuine supply shortage, retention has been suspended for both the chiefly Latin American arabica beans and the coarser robustas that mostly come from Africa. And last month trigger prices were passed for the release of retention stocks of both types of beans. With prices at five-year highs the task of agreeing on release arrangements will be less onerous than it might have been, but the producers will still be anxious to ensure that the process does not damage the new-found buoyancy. The meeting will also allow them to assess this year's price rises of 82 per cent for robustas and 75 per cent for arabicas. On Wednesday the World Gold Council, a promotional organisation financed by some mining companies, will give its verdict on international gold market trends in the first quarter of 1994. Its views are unlikely to be much different from those of Gold Fields Minerals Services, the consultancy organisation, which, when launching its influential annual gold market survey two weeks ago, suggested that the 'gold gap' - between newly-mined gold plus scrap returned to the market on the supply side, and fabrication demand and bar hoarding on the other - had narrowed from an unprecedented 700 tonnes in the first quarter of last year to 300 tonnes in the first three months of 1994. To fill that gap either gold had to be released by holders, particularly the central banks that own so much of it, or prices must go up.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           WEEKLY PRICE CHANGES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Latest   Change     Year           1994                         prices   on week     ago      High       Low  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Dollars            Dollars   Dollars   Dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gold per troy oz.       384.20    +3.85    375.15    396.50     369.50 Silver per troy oz      373.50p  +12.00    295.50p   384.50p    335.50p  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Dollars            Dollars   Dollars   Dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium 99.7% (cash)  1341.5    +16.0    1120.0    1325.50   1107.50 Copper Grade A (cash)   2223.5    +34.5    1184.0    2189.00   1731.50 Lead (cash)              477.5     -4.5    255.75     510.50     426.0 Nickel (cash)           6390.0   +100.0    5662.5       6290    5210.0 Zinc SHG (cash)          966.0     +9.0     953.0       1014     900.5 Tin (cash)              5550.0    +45.0    5450.0     5650.0    4730.0  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Pounds             Pounds     Pounds    Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cocoa Futures Jul          947      -10       664        969       859  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Dollars            Dollars   Dollars   Dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Coffee Futures Jul        2184     +227       947       2247      1175 Sugar (LDP Raw)         293.10    +0.70     300.0      296.2     252.9  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Pounds             Pounds     Pounds     Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Barley Futures Sep       98.25    +0.85     106.1      97.40     92.65 Wheat Futures Jun       114.25    +1.20     138.6     117.50     97.80 Cotton Outlook A Index   86.40c   +0.70     59.85c     86.40c    62.45c Wool (64s Super)           428p      +6       367p       428p      342p  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Dollars            Dollars   Dollars    Dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Oil (Brent Blend)       16.405x   +0.40     18.42     15.995      13.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Per tonne unless otherwise stated. p Pence/kg. c Cents lb. x July  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

The  obstacles were placed in the streets by demonstrating public  transportation workers, who are staging a strike to demand a  reduction in fuel prices.    Trucks loaded with troops were deployed following orders  from  police headquarters, which received instructions from Government  Minister Alfredo Mendieta, according to reliable sources.    The transportation workers are surrounding those vehicles  that form roadblocks along several roads. The demonstration  could become violent after negotiations between government and  transportation representatives have hit a stalemate.    [Paris AFP in Spanish at 0243 GMT on 26 January transmits a  related 155-word, Managua-datelined report that says union  leader Gustavo Aguiluz has announced that "two taxi drivers were  wounded by gunfire and another was beaten." After noting that  10 demonstrators have been arrested, the AFP report adds that  Aguiluz "reported police excesses and asked for the Human Rights  Commission to intervene." The report also says a local radio  station "reported a shootout between members of different  cooperative unions, but the station mentioned nothing about  casualties or the reason for the clash."]</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGISTRATION OF ASSAULT GUNS  </P> <P> The National Rifle Assn. has shown that its understanding of "civil  disobedience" is about as accurate as its interpretation of the Second  Amendment.  </P> <P> The basic element, as demonstrated by Thoreau, Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther  King Jr., is that you accept the punishment after openly disobeying the "bad"  law.  </P> <P> Surreptitiously breaking the law, by not registering their assault weapons, has  another name. It is called "crime," and its practitioners are criminals to the  same extent as those who they claim to protect us from.  </P> <P> DAVID S. ROBINSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Cookery: The best of British in the open air - Philippa Davenport flies the flag for traditional picnic fare - as long as the weather holds FOR YEARS now, most British picnickers have failed to fly the flag. When France reigned supreme in matters gastronomic, we spread gingham cloths with sticks of bread, ripe soft cheeses, pots of rillettes or other pates and a few cornichons. Then came the fashion for gazpacho and potato-packed Spanish omelettes. The Italian phase began with Parma ham wound round grissini, and mozzarella with tomatoes and basil. More recently rocket, focaccia, sun dried tomatoes and bresaola have been to the fore. Squeezed somewhere in between were Greco-Turkish and Middle Eastern favourites, including dolmades, spanakopitta, felafel and pitta breads stuffed with bulgar wheat and parsley salad. The Mediterranean circuit thus completed, is it not time to return home? Nostalgia for Betjemanesque picnics with sand in the sandwiches prompted me recently to put some childhood memories into edible practice and I rejoiced to rediscover just how appetising our own native picnic offerings can be. The traditional picnic sandwich made with alternate slices of good brown and white bread, sliced nanny-thin, cut into triangles, crustless or not as you wish, is satisfying and truly delicious when filled with such things as potted shrimps and watercress, tomato with mint, roast chicken and York ham with lettuce, and cucumber with Marmite. So too are jam sandwiches, particularly when made with greengage jam sprinkled with walnuts laid on bread spread with cream cheese or butter seasoned with orange zest. Also well worth reviving in picnic circles are individual meat pies small enough to fit into the palm of your hand; hard-boiled eggs served with screws of greaseproof paper containing Maldon salt and chopped fresh herbs in which to dip the eggs as you shell and eat them; and the partnership of fruit-laden luncheon cake with wedges of hard English farmhouse cheeses. After years of absence such treats seem almost novel now to the young born into a quiche and pizza society, and these British picnic foods are distinguished by one undeniable advantage over most other options: they are easy to pack and unpack and relatively unmessy to eat whether you are sprawled on the grass or beach or are forced to sit sardine-fashion packed into the car. No mean consideration given our climate. LITTLE LAMB PIES (makes 14-15 small pies) Individual pies like these should comfort the shivering after a dip in the Atlantic briny. They could be tucked neatly into the saddlebags of riders and cyclists, and might prove welcome slipped in alongside the pocket hip-flasks on the Glorious Twelfth. 1-1 1/4 lb neck fillet of lamb; 1 small onion; 4-6oz mushrooms; a generous knob of butter; a little lemon juice; fresh chopped mint;  1/4 teaspoon curry powder;  1/2 teaspoon flour; lightly chilled shortcrust pastry made with 12oz plain white flour, 3oz each butter and lard, a good seasoning of salt and freshly ground black pepper and about 4 tablespoons cold water to bind; beaten egg to seal and glaze the pies. Rub the lamb with pepper, brush it with lemon juice and let it marinate for a few hours. Then grill it until browned without and juicily pink and tender within - about six minutes on each side. Let the meat cool before dicing it. (Dicing gives the pie much better texture than mincing or whizzing the meat in a food processor.) Chop the mushrooms quite small and saute them in a little butter until tender and reduced in bulk. Remove them from the pan. Add a little more butter and the finely chopped onion and cook until the onion is thoroughly softened. Stir in the deliberately small quantity of spices. The idea is to season the dish interestingly, not to 'curry' it. Sprinkle on the flour, pour on 2-3 fl oz water or stock and the juices that run from the lamb when you chop it. Cook, stirring continuously, until the gravy thickens and clings to the onion stickily. The mixture should be moist, not wet, lubricant enough to bind the filling ingredients and prevent them from drying out during baking. Draw the pan away from the heat. Stir in the mushrooms and lamb. Season with salt, pepper and two tablespoons chopped mint and mix well. Roll out the pastry and cut half of it into rounds large enough to line mince pie tins or similar. Lay the pastry in the tins and spoon the (by now cold) filling into them. Cover with lids cut from the remaining pastry. Damp the pastry edges with beaten egg and pinch to seal securely. Glaze and make steam slits. Slide the pie tins on to a pre-heated baking tray and bake at 400` F (200` C) gas mark 6 for about 30 minutes until the pastry is brown and crisp on top and set firm underneath with no hint of sogginess.</p>

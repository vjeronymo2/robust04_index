			<p>BFN     [Text] Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec held a press  conference in Hanoi before leaving for Hue and Ho Chi Minh City.  Here is our report.    It is the first visit to Vietnam by the Czech foreign  minister, and the foreign minister of an Eastern European  country since the disintegration of the Eastern European  countries. Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec spoke to newsmen  about the significance and objectives of his visit to Vietnam.    [Begin Zieleniec recording in English] Now I finish the  third  day of my visit in Vietnam. We feel that this is an important  visit for the Czech Republic. I have met my colleague Foreign  Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and Minister of Trade Le Van Triet. I  have met Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and President and Speaker of  Parliament Nong Duc Manh. These were useful and important talks  for us. You know that the Czech Republic has traditional  contact with Vietnam. There are many people here in Vietnam who  know us, who speak our language, who study in my country. And  there are also quite a considerable number of people in my  country who know very well of Vietnam. This is a good basis for  mutual relations. There were big changes in both countries in  the last years. It is important to find new conditions, new  ways for cooperation. It is important to find new contact for  economic and trade cooperation. This is the reason for which we  discussed especially economic programs. We discussed the whole  set of treaty which is needed for proper cooperation between our  business communities. We discussed also political issues. We  exchanged views on developments in both countries. We discussed  also our views on the issues connected with discussion about  human rights and other issues. I think this visit shows that  relations between my country and Vietnam has very big potential,  and it is possible to continue traditional intensive contact and  good cooperation, also after changes in my country and in  Vietnam. [end recording]    On the first day in Hanoi, the Czech businessmen attended  the  Vietnam-Czech economic seminar held in Hanoi by the Vietnam  Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Czech Embassy. Foreign  Minister Zieleniec attended the seminar. Both Czech and  Vietnamese businessmen discovered great possibilities for  economic and trade cooperation. Mr.Rudolf Baranic, president of  the Association of Czech Businessmen said:    [Begin (Baranic) recording in Czech fading into English  translation] The balance of trade between Czech and Vietnam has  reduced over the last few years due to main changes in the Czech  Republic. Czech's export to Vietnam has been reduced by half,  and Vietnam's export to Czech reduced by one fourth. However,  there are possibilities to further improve the trade balance  between the two countries. Most interesting is that almost all  those who are involved in export activities to the Czech  Republic were Vietnamese who had studied and worked in the  country. There are many Vietnamese who know the Czech language.  It is an advantage in cooperative relations between the two  countries. [end recording]    At the press conference in Hanoi, the Czech foreign minister  also said that he was not the first high-ranking Czech official  to visit Vietnam. A delegation of the Czech minister and trade  and industry, and a parliamentary delegation have visited  Vietnam. The Czech minister of labor also plans to Vietnam and  is expected to sign an important agreement on labor cooperation  between the two countries. The Czech Republic will continue  helping Vietnam in education and personnel training. As with  previous delegations, the Czech delegation discussed the  completion of a trade agreement between the two countries, and  agreement on investment guarantee and promotion, and the  agreement on avoidance of double taxation.</p>

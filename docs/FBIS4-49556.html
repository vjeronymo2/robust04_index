			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 7 (CNS) -- The State Council recently  decided that in the case of Sino-foreign jointly-funded power  plants, the foreign side is not allowed to ask for a return  higher than 12 percent for their investment and that excessive  demands will not be accepted by the Chinese side.    Some provinces and municipalities had in the past agreed to  the demand of too high a rate of return on investment and other  harsh terms in order to seek an early success for negotiated  items, such a phenomenon causing the great concern of the State  Council.    The State Council has in principle fixed a rate of return at  between 11 percent and 12 percent. Demands higher than this  will not be accepted by the Chinese side.    China last year saw RMB 52.2 billion [renminbi] investment  in  power construction with newly installed capacity put at 12  million kilowatts. Some RMB 60 billion capital will be put into  this sector this year and the newly installed capacity is  expected to be little bit higher than last year.    China now has a per capita provision of 600 kilowatts-hour  (kwh) while that in the United States is over 5,000 kwh and that  in Hong Kong, Japan and Britain is more than 2,000 kwhs. China  is determined to increase its total installed capacity to 1.2  billion kilowatts in a bid to catch up with the level in medium  developed countries.    Coal-fired, hydroelectric and nuclear power will be  constructed simultaneously and foreign investment in this sector  is welcome.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / German jobless total below 4m German unemployment dipped below the psychological barrier of 4m in March, boosting hopes that the west German economy is gradually emerging from recession. Unadjusted unemployment in western Germany fell by 0.3 per cent, from 2.74m to 2.64m, taking the unemployment rate to 8.5 per cent of the labour force. In eastern Germany, unemployment fell by 0.5 per cent, from 1.3m to 1.26m, or 16.8 per cent of the workforce. Seasonally adjusted unemployment in west Germany rose by 20,000 to 2.57m in March, but this was a slower rate of increase than in March last year when seasonally adjusted unemployment rose by 40,000 over the previous month. However, Mr Bernhard Jagoda, the president of the Labour office, said the March fall in unadjusted unemployment reflected 'the usual spring pick-up,' adding that economists expected the jobless total to rise a further 400,000 by year end.</p>

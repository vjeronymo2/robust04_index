			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Rover sales rise as rivals suffer ROVER GROUP was the only large vehicle maker to increase sales in continental Europe in the first half of the year. They rose 5 per cent to 65,500. The British Aerospace subsidiary also increased its worldwide sales by 13 per cent in the period - helped by a 44 per cent sales rise in Japan, where the new-car market is suffering the first notable reverse in its history. Rover's Japanese sales rise is from a small base - up from 4,300 to 6,200 - but Rover executives see it as cause for further celebration following Honda's decision to sell the Land Rover Discovery model in Japan badged as a Honda - the first time a western manufacturer's model has received such an endorsement. Helped by sharp increases in other export markets outside Europe, Rover's total sales in the first half rose to 202,100 from 178,300 in the same period a year ago. UK sales were up 14 per cent, at 119,700, and export sales were 12 per cent higher at 82,400. Rover's total export sales outside Europe were up 54 per cent, to 16,900 units. The increase in continental European sales came in the face of estimates from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association last week that the combined total sales in 17 west European markets were down by 17.5 per cent in the first half of the year. In spite of the collapse in the German new-car market, where sales were down more than 20 per cent in the first half, Rover increased its sales in Germany by 6 per cent and plans to double the size of its German dealer network over the next two years.</p>

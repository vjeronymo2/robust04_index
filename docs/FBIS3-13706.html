			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political </F> adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and head of the  Palestinian delegation to negotiations with Israel, by Sa'id  Mu'addi, place and date not given; from the "With the Events"  program -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, U.S. President Bill  Clinton and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin have called on Yasir  'Arafat to resume the negotiations without preconditions. What  is your comment?    [Sha'th] My comment is that we are not setting impossible  conditions, nor do we want to delay these negotiations. We are  aware that these negotiations are our path to a just peace. In  other words, these negotiations are the way leading to the  beginning of the Israeli troop withdrawal and the arrival of the  Palestinian police force. In the long run, this is the genuine  security tool for our Palestinian people and all regional  states. We are not setting difficult or impossible conditions.  We would not have asked for the issuance of a UN Security  Council resolution setting a mechanism of specific security  measures if it had not been for this appalling massacre in  Hebron. Such a resolution could have been issued two weeks ago.  There has been a two-week delay in the issuance of the  resolution. Tomorrow, this resolution will be put to the vote.  Those who want a swift resumption of the negotiations should  see that this resolution is approved by the UN Security Council  tomorrow, Friday, so we can begin implementation of the  mechanism of security measures and so we can return to the  negotiations.    [Mu'addi] What point have the consultations, contacts, and  efforts to resume the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations reached?    [Sha'th] Efforts are continuing on all levels. Contacts were  held in Tunis last week with Dennis Ross, an Israeli delegation,  a Russian Foreign Ministry envoy, a Norwegian Foreign Ministry  envoy, and others. Here in Egypt, too, contacts are being led  by Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. Efforts are also continuous in  Washington. All efforts aim at securing the resumption of the  negotiations. However, this resumption must be accompanied by  security measures, which are neither irrelevant, difficult, nor  impossible. Such measures are necessary to provide security for  the Palestinian people so we can go ahead with the peace process.    [Mu'addi] Is the Palestinian side awaiting the UN Security  Council resolution and a U.S. response to the Palestinian  demands?    [Sha'th] The issuance of the UN Security Council resolution  with U.S. approval is a very important matter. This is because  this resolution includes some executive measures, including the  responsibility of the United States and Russia in their capacity  as the cosponsors of the Madrid peace conference, in following  up the implementation of these measures. Therefore, we believe  that the issuance of this resolution tomorrow will provide an  important opportunity for meeting our demand to resume the peace  process and achieve security at the same time.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  proposed that Palestinian policemen who resigned during the  intifadah be recalled so that they may be deployed in the Hebron  area. What is your comment?    [Sha'th] As I said before, many of the measures that have  been taken by Prime Minister Rabin and the Israeli Government  are part of a sound orientation toward admitting that the  Palestinian people face a real security problem. However, the  proposed solutions are not the required ones. For example,  regarding the Palestinian police force, why should we recall  previous Palestinian policemen when the Declaration of  Principles [DOP] we signed in Washington provides for the  deployment of a Palestinian police force affiliated with the  Palestinian authority throughout the West Bank and Gaza -- in  Gaza to implement the agreement and in the West Bank to  implement so-called early empowerment. We want to see the DOP  implemented. Its implementation should begin with the immediate  deployment of the Palestinian police force instead of recalling  old police personnel, some of whom, anyway, could be fit to join  the new police. This is desirable.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, thank you very much for this  interview.    [Sha'th] Thank you.</p>

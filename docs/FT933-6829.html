			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: PWA rejects offer for routes PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines, has rejected Air Canada's offer to buy its international routes for CDollars 200m (USDollars 151m) and assumption of CDollars 800m debt and lease obligations, writes Robert Gibbens. PWA said its directors decided the offer would 'adversely affect' the interests of shareholders, creditors, employees and customers. Mr Rhys Eyton, PWA chairman, said the net purchase price would really be CDollars 100m for routes generating CDollars 1.4bn annual revenues. Also, PWA would be left with 23 surplus aircraft. Total cost of downsizing Canadian Airlines to a domestic and trans-border carrier would be CDollars 440m, he said.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA believes this structure is consistent with the absence of any requirement that maintenance plans under section 175A address pollution transport. Thus, the only provision in the Act that requires states to prevent emissions within their borders that interfere with maintenance in another state downwind is section 110(a)(2)(D). This may be particularly important due to the staggered attainment deadlines under section 181 for ozone. As is the case in the northeast, severe areas with longer attainment deadlines may be located upwind of less polluted nonattainment areas with shorter attainment deadlines. Even if the downwind areas can attain on time, the upwind areas may continue to generate substantial emissions interfering with downwind maintenance until or even beyond the upwind area's longer attainment deadline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed generally above, EPA believes it has authority to act under section 110(k)(5) at any time, even prior to submission of attainment demonstrations under section 182, to require submission of measures EPA believes are necessary for compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D). See 59 FR at 21730 (explaining EPA's independent basis to issue SIP call under section 110(k)(5) to adopt measures necessary for compliance with maintenance aspect of section 110(a)(2)(D)). It is especially important that EPA act now, because the LEV program depends on vehicle fleet turnover that will take an unusually long time to generate the needed emissions reductions. If EPA waits for the states to develop their attainment plans, and where applicable, their maintenance plans, the opportunity to ensure that necessary emissions reductions from the LEV program are achieved beginning in 1999 and growing thereafter may be irrevocably lost. Any delay in beginning the fleet turnover to LEV vehicles in model year 1999 will diminish the emissions benefits in the years following. It is therefore necessary for the states to act now to adopt OTC LEV and appropriate for EPA to make a finding of substantial inadequacy now with respect to that program for the purposes of maintenance. For the same reasons discussed generally above, EPA believes an environmentally conservative approach to evaluating the need for the LEV program to avoid interference with maintenance is warranted here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that maintenance is a proper consideration under section 184(c), too. To be sure, that provision references timely attainment and omits maintenance. However, section 184(c)(5) provides for an EPA finding of substantial inadequacy under section 110(k)(5) that states' SIPs do not meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D), which specifically prohibits emissions in states from interfering with maintenance in downwind states. Moreover, EPA believes there is an adequate basis to reasonably interpret section 184(c) to include maintenance. Specifically, EPA believes that it should understand ``attainment'' to include ``maintenance'' where the issue is whether measures are ``necessary'' to comply with pollution transport requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The very emphasis on the ``necessary'' standard under section 184 supports this conclusion. In contrast, EPA's recent determination that ``attainment'' under section 182(f) does not include maintenance involved a different standard. There, EPA's Conformity General Preamble explained that the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemption test in section 182(f)(1)(A) where additional NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions ``would not contribute to attainment'' does not involve maintenance considerations. See 59 FR 31238. EPA stated that Congress could reasonably have believed it appropriate to require states to impose specified requirements on NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  sources for areas in nonattainment, but that states might decide for themselves whether to impose such controls for maintenance purposes, even if such controls would ``contribute'' to maintenance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA noted, however, that this distinction might not apply where the test is whether control measures are ``necessary'' for attainment and maintenance is not referenced, as here.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where measures are ``necessary'' for maintenance, EPA does not believe it makes sense to let states decide for themselves whether to adopt the measures. Inherent in the ``necessary'' determination under section 184 is the conclusion that the states really have no choice: They need to adopt the measure in order to avoid interfering with downwind maintenance. Unlike the section 182(f) ``contributes'' context, as long as EPA determines that it is necessary, there really is no choice. It seems less reasonable to believe Congress intended that section 184 would not reach a measure in fact necessary for maintenance, when the result of a failure to implement the measure would therefore be downwind areas' relapse into nonattainment, perhaps shortly after the attainment dates in subpart 2. Where the necessary standard applies in the interstate pollution context, EPA believes it is sensible to understand ``attainment'' to include ``maintenance.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, EPA believes its discussion of section 176A in its April 26 proposal identifies an additional statutory basis to support this sensible conclusion. That is, the OTR in section 184 is established under section 184(a) ``within the meaning of section 176A(a).'' Section 176A authorizes a transport commission under that provision to ``[r]ecommend to the Administrator such measures as the Commission determines to be necessary to ensure that the plans for the relevant states meet the requirements of section [110(a)(2)(D)].'' This presumably includes both the attainment and maintenance aspects of section 110(a)(2)(D). In all other respects, EPA's obligations in response to a transport commission under section 176A are less strict than under section 184. It would therefore be odd if section 176A required EPA to consider maintenance in response to a commission's recommendations, but that EPA would not be required to do so under section 184. This is particularly so since it seems foolhardy to consider measures necessary for attainment at the exclusion of those necessary for maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, it seems reasonable to interpret the OTC under section 184 as a creature of both sections 184 and 176A. Section 184 simply adds stringency to EPA's obligations in responding to recommendations from the OTC, since Congress specifically identified the serious transport problem between the many northeast states as surely deserving the attention of such a regional commission. Thus, it makes sense to believe that Congress intended the particular dates in section 184 to highlight the specific deadlines in the subpart 2 ozone program that the OTC is specifically charged with addressing. But in so doing it does not seem as reasonable to believe that Congress intended to displace the more general authority of a commission under section 176A to make recommendations concerning the maintenance aspects of section 110(a)(2)(D). Thus, EPA believes it is most reasonable to understand the references in section 184(c) to attainment to include maintenance through section 176A, as well. Even if operating under sections 176A, 110(k)(5), and 110(a)(2)(D) directly, EPA believes it may issue a SIP call at this time under section 110(k)(5) requiring states to adopt the OTC LEV program as necessary to avoid interfering with maintenance in other states.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

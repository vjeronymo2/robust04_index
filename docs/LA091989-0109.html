			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUIT OUTLINES HOW LINCOLN ALLEGEDLY GENERATED PHONY PROFITS FOR PARENT  </P> <P> Hidden Valley Ranch, 8,576 acres of undeveloped land southwest of Phoenix, is  largely barren and, as its name implies, is difficult to reach.  </P> <P> But what was hidden from most observers was not so much the valley as the way  that its owner, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, allegedly used the land to generate  phony profits from fraudulent transactions, according to the $1.1-billion  racketeering lawsuit that federal regulators filed last week against Charles H.  Keating and other former operators of the Irvine thrift.  </P> <P> The bogus profits boosted the amount that Lincoln forwarded to its parent,  American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, ostensibly to pay its share of corporate  taxes, the suit claims.  </P> <P> The tax-sharing plan was one of the ways in which the parent firm allegedly  drained Lincoln funds to fuel American Continental's speculative real estate  deals and enrich its owners, the suit contends.  </P> <P> Insiders benefited, the suit alleges, from excessive loans made by Lincoln to  companies that they controlled and from American Continental's stock value,  boosted by the unusually healthy financial results that Lincoln was posting  with inflated revenue. Keating sold some of his stock in 1987, for instance,  for $3.3 million, which was in addition to his $2-million salary.  </P> <P> Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after American Continental filed  for bankruptcy, saying the S&amp;L was being operated in an unsafe manner.  Experts predict that Lincoln will be the nation's costliest S&amp;L bailout,  costing taxpayers up to $2.5 billion.  </P> <P> Tax-sharing plans allow a subsidiary to send its share of taxes to its parent,  which pays the entire tax bill for the holding company and all subsidiaries.  </P> <P> Under Lincoln's arrangement with its parent, the suit alleges, Lincoln funneled  federally insured deposits into a series of questionable deals that created  artificial profits -- and allowed the S&amp;L to ship a total of $94.8 million  to its parent for taxes over three years.  </P> <P> But Lincoln didn't have any taxable income for those years and, therefore,  didn't owe any taxes, the suit claims. Nor did American Continental use the  money that Lincoln forwarded under the tax-sharing plan to pay taxes, the suit  alleges. "The true but hidden purpose of the arrangement was to allow ACC to  siphon funds from . . . Lincoln for the enrichment of ACC," Keating and his  family and associates, the suit states.  </P> <P> The Hidden Valley deals, as well as other transactions cited in the suit, also  helped Lincoln get around regulations designed to limit its ownership interests  in real estate and securities, the suit claims. Because the transactions were  shams arranged by insiders, the suit states, Lincoln never really sold its  investments and still controlled those assets.  </P> <P> A spokesman for American Continental would not comment on allegations in the  suit, saying the company would make its response in court.  </P> <P> Corporate executives previously denied all wrongdoing, specifically stating  that loans and sales that Lincoln made were not contrivances to hide unlawful  direct investments. They have said repeatedly that regulators had spent the  past four years reviewing their records and even approved some transactions.  Nothing in the lawsuit, one spokesman said last week, comes as a surprise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> All Loans Defaulted  </P> <P> A Lincoln subsidiary bought the vacant Hidden Valley land for about $28.6  million and, from October, 1986, through June, 1988, sold three-quarters of it  in the 10 transactions. It recorded a profit of nearly $82.1 million, which  resulted in $31 million being sent to American Continental for taxes.  </P> <P> The transactions characteristically involved "straw" men who borrowed the  entire purchase price directly or indirectly from Lincoln to buy the property,  the suit said. And Lincoln assumed the risk of possible losses because the  borrowers were allowed to limit their risk of default to the property itself,  the suit said. All the loans defaulted, the suit said.  </P> <P> In one of those transactions, Ernest C. Garcia went to Keating and his  associates for a loan early in 1987 to buy the remaining stock in a Phoenix  real estate development and investment banking firm, according to the lawsuit.  Garcia already owned 20% of what now is called E. C. Garcia &amp; Co.  </P> <P> A major condition for providing the loan, however, was Garcia's agreement to  buy or arrange for the purchase of a 1,000-acre parcel of Hidden Valley for $14  million, the suit claims.  </P> <P> Garcia could not or would not buy the parcel, but he arranged for  Westcontinental Mortgage &amp; Investment Corp. to buy the parcel and satisfy  Keating's demand, a requirement that allegedly violated federal law.  </P> <P> On March 30, 1987, Lincoln loaned Garcia $20.2 million. While Garcia used a  "significant" portion of the loan to buy Garcia Co. stock, the suit alleges, he  also loaned Westcontinental $3.5 million on the same day for that company's  down payment on the Hidden Valley property.  </P> <P> At the same time, Westcontinental borrowed $10.5 million from a Lincoln  subsidiary for the remaining amount owed.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 30 Apr (MENA) -- President Muhammad Husni  Mubarak has addressed an appeal to Yemeni leaders to stop the  fighting among the Yemeni Armed Forces.    In his appeal, the president warned that the persistence of  the armed clashes will further aggravate the situation and  inflict grave harm on fraternal Yemen's present and future.    President Mubarak called on the Yemeni leaders to return the  northern and southern armed troops to their positions to stop  the ongoing fighting that has killed and wounded hundreds in the  past few days.    The president called on President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, in  his capacity as president and higher commander of the Armed  Forces, to intervene with his wisdom to stop the fighting in the  northern part of the country and to organize matters in a manner  that averts friction and provocation and preserves Yemen's unity  and the higher interests of its sons.    Concluding his appeal, President Mubarak appealed to the  Yemeni leaders to restrain themselves, engage in a rational and  logical dialogue, and respond to efforts to preserve Yemen's  wellbeing and the unity of its sons.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Businesses 'cutting company cars' PERKS such as company cars have been cut during the recession, according to a survey of personnel staff by Reward Group, the employment consultancy. The survey - based on returns from more than 4,000 members of the Institute of Personnel Management - differs from findings recently published by the Confederation of British Industry, which indicated that employee benefits had not generally been cut. Reward says provision of company cars has fallen this year to 25 per cent of respondents compared with 31 per cent last year. Cars were also being changed less frequently.

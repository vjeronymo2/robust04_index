			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / UK Company News: MTL falls to Pounds 2m despite pound's fall Pre-tax profits of MTL Instruments, the USM-quoted maker of electronic measuring devices, fell by Pounds 1.15m to Pounds 2.1m in the half-year to end-June. The comparative, originally reported as Pounds 2.2m, was restated to comply with FRS 3. Turnover, however, rose by 15 per cent from Pounds 9.29m to Pounds 10.7m. The improvement, the directors said, reflected strong recovery in the US and continued growth in Europe. The weaker pound had benefited both sales and profits. Earnings per share were 7.4p (11.6p) and the interim dividend is 1.7p (1.6p).</p>

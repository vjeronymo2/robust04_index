			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Agency Implementing Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 110(a)(2)(E)(i) of the NHPA requires that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agency have procedures for compliance with Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 106 that are consistent with the Council's regulations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the National Park Service, and the Council share oversight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this provision, since the Secretary is charged with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing guidance on implementing Section 110  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities. The Council wishes to encourage Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to develop such procedures to adapt the Section 106  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process to their particular needs and to better integrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 106 into their regular planning processes. Subpart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B of the revised regulations sets forth criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluating consistency; outlines a process for Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of such procedures; and defines the consequences of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council finding regarding consistency. Does the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process meet the need for agency program oversight? Are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there ways the regulations could better encourage Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to adopt the required procedures in a timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner? Are there better alternatives to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistency standards and review process? Are the criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to meet the objective on achieving internal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agency procedures that effectively implement Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 106?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Exemption of Certain Undertakings From the Section 106  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of the development of agency procedures to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 106, the proposed regulations include a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision that will allow agencies to waive the Section 106  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review for categories of undertakings which generally would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have an effect on historic properties. Since the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categorical exclusions has been a major component of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NEPA process, there is the potential that this provision may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be confusing. Further, approval of such a listing may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorrectly infer that the exemption of a class of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertakings means that an included undertaking could never  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in adverse effect to historic properties. Should the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for categorical exemptions be included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised regulations? Should they be further distinguished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from NEPA categorical exclusions to avoid confusion? Are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the criteria for categorical exemptions too broad or too  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> narrow? Should parties other than the agency and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council be able to require individual Section 106 reviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for undertakings previously listed as categorical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusions?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Regulation Versus Guidance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When surveyed, users of the current Section 106 regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally requested more specificity and guidance on various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the regulations. The revised regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respond to that concern. Are the regulatory provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficiently detailed or have they become too specific?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where should any changes be made? Should some existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material or additional material be set forth in appendices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the regulations or in separate, subsequently issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance documents?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Public Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations rely heavily on increased access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the public to the Section 106 process to offset the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council's reduced role in individual cases. These enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities for public involvement anticipate both a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater public role in shaping decisions regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment of effects on historic properties and a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> active watchdog function for the public to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures are followed and decisions are made properly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conversely, expanded public participation can impose burdens  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on Federal planning processes and adequate opportunities for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public input often require that extra efforts and time be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expended by Federal officials. The revised regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attempt to strike a balance between these two extremes, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an emphasis on public access to the process. Has this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balance been struck effectively? Are there specific places  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where public notification or participation should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strengthened or reduced? Should the regulations be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific on public participation or should additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance be provided in less formal channels, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance documents?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Role of Certain Interested Parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations seek to clarify and enhance the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involvement of individuals and organizations that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant interests in the negotiating process designed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid or minimize adverse effects (See Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 800.10(b)(1)). One such group is owners of properties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by the undertaking and whose interests may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacted by decisions made in the Section 106 process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding the avoidance or mitigation of the undertaking's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse effects on historic properties. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations allow all owners of affected properties to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in negotiations for a Memorandum of Agreement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided that the Council can limit participation to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative if the number of owners desiring to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate becomes unwieldy. Is this a reasonable balance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of access and procedural efficiency? Should only owners of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historic properties be given this status? How broadly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should ``affected'' be defined?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Substitution of State and Local Review Processes for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulations allow a Certified Local Government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (CLG), as established under Section 101(c)(1) of the NHPA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assume the role of the State Historic Preservation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Officer (SHPO) in the Section 106 review when the Council,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SHPO, and local government are in agreement. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations delete this provision, in the interest of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoiding too many variations on the Section 106 process and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resultant confusion. Should the current role of CLGs be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained? Should it be expanded to allow review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures established under local law and administered by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CLG to substitute for the Council's regulations? Should the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations require Federal agencies to routinely consult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with CLGs in addition to or in lieu of consultation with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SHPOs? The current regulations allow State review systems to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute for the Federal process under certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances. The revised regulations delete this. Should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it be retained and, if so, should it be modified from its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current form?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

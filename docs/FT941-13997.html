			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Great waste Sir, You report ('Transport executives win aid for rail sell-off costs', January 15/16) that the Department of Transport is to make available grants to passenger transport executives which will 'continue indefinitely . . . to offset the extra costs caused by railway privatisation'. Can someone remind me why railway privatisation was thought to be such a good idea? I can only remember two reasons: first, that it was impossible to make any more public money available for railway subsidies; second, that privatisation would reduce costs through efficiency gains. If neither argument now applies, a great deal of public money is being spent on reorganisation to no public benefit. William Wallace, 49 St James's Drive, Wandsworth Common, London SW17 7RN</p>

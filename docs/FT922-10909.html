			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / ANC document sets moderate tone THE African National Congress yesterday released a draft economic policy document marked by a moderate tone and a promise to eschew rigid ideologies in favour of pragmatism. The document, due to be debated at the organisation's first policy conference on May 28-31, again raises the vexed issue of nationalisation, but promises flexibility. For the first time, the paper mentions the possibility of reducing the role of the public sector through privatisation, previously a bogey of the left. It promises that the post-apartheid tax structure will 'reflect the need to create incentives for investment and expansion' though it supports a new land tax and suggests expropriation of land, with compensation, to make amends to blacks evicted under apartheid. Meanwhile, South African political groups took a further step towards setting up a multi-racial interim government when a sub-committee of the constitutional negotiating forum, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), agreed on a cabinet-level council to act as an interim executive until a new constitution is agreed.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Mail group to spend Pounds 20m on tabloid supplements ASSOCIATED Newspapers is launching new tabloid supplements for its three main titles the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and the Evening Standard in London. Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers, said the initiative, which will cost about Pounds 20m in its first year, would be partly paid for by cost-cutting and a significant reduction in the group's television advertising, which totalled more than Pounds 11m last year. The new supplements, with 48 pages and full colour, represent a departure for the middle market and are likely to intensify competition when they are launched in October. The Daily Mail supplement will accompany the Saturday edition. It will be aimed at the family and include seven days of television listings. The new Mail on Sunday section will feature reviews and have longer pieces of what Mr Hardy called 'reportage', aiming to increase the paper's appeal to broadsheet readers. The Evening Standard's supplement will be published on Friday and include the week's television listings. Mr Hardy said that five years ago the Daily Mail had an average of 40 pages with an advertising ratio of 38 per cent. Now the paper has an average of 64 pages with 32 per cent advertising. He added: 'We have also hardened the advertising rates which is an enormous achievement during the recession.' During the same five-year period the Daily Mail's circulation has marginally increased. In January 1989 it was 1.7366m and in June 1993, the latest official figures, it was 1.7455m. Average circulation for the Mail on Sunday between January and March 1989 was 1.977m, and from March to June this year the figure was 1.985m. Immediate rivals such as the Daily Express and Sunday Express lost circulation during this period.</p>

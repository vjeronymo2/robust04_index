			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / BBB Design losses increase midway The recession has continued to hit USM-quoted BBB Design Group, resulting in pre-tax losses up from Pounds 56,000 to Pounds 189,000 for the half-year to October 31. Turnover fell from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 836,000. For the first time, the company's design, publishing and marketing activities failed to make a profits contribution, with turnover falling by 39 per cent. The company has, however, continued to cut costs and concentrate efforts and resources on new business development. After tax credits of Pounds 42,000 (Pounds 19,000), net losses were Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 37,000) or 1.77p (0.45p) per share. Again no interim dividend is declared.</p>

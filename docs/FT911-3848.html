			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Guinness Mahon losses soar GUINNESS MAHON, the merchant banking group which is 65 per cent owned by the Bank of Yokohama, warned yesterday that it would report a heavy loss in its interim results because of mounting bad debts. The company is making a Pounds 30m provision for loan losses, and will report an after-tax loss of Pounds 35m for the six months ending March 31. An interim dividend is unlikely to be declared. The group will seek to raise Pounds 50m through a rights issue. This will have the full support of the Bank of Yokohama. The Pounds 50m will more than double the Pounds 45m level to which Guinness Mahon's capital has been reduced by the losses. Mr Geoffrey Bell, chairman of Guinness Mahon, said yesterday that the losses had been incurred mainly because of the bank's policy of lending to the property and small company sectors, both of which had been badly hit by the recession. The bank had also lent Pounds 5m to Polly Peck, which collapsed last year. The provisions were decided on after a team from Bank of Yokohama came to the UK to examine the Guinness Mahon loan book, Mr Bell said. It was decided to deal conservatively with all possible losses to avoid having to make further provisions later on. No management changes are planned, but Mr Bell said that the Bank of Yokohama would be placing more people in London to keep a closer watch on operations. The Japanese have three representatives on Guinness Mahon's 12-person board. The news triggered a sharp fall in Guinness Mahon's share price. The stock closed at 42p, down 8p on the day. This compares with the 146p per share paid by Bank of Yokohama. The Japanese group bought its stake for Pounds 95m in 1989 in the first significant acquisition of a merchant bank by a bank from Japan. Guinness Mahon's other leading shareholder is publisher Mr Robert Maxwell with 9 per cent. Last year, Guinness Mahon announced losses for the 12 months of Pounds 7.5m and cut its dividend.</p>

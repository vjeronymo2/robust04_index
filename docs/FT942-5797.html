			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Survey of Belgium (2): Flemings, Walloons, Germans - Pluralist Belgium has loosened its unitary ties in favour of federalism. Emma Tucker asks if it will work Just over a year ago a complex and protracted process reached its conclusion in Belgium. The small country, with a population of barely 10m, completed its change from a highly centralised, unitary state into a federation of regions and language communities. The country's divisions have many permutations. There are two main cultural communities - the Flemish and the French, plus a smaller German community. These occupy three distinct regions - Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels. The risk with federalism is one of duplication and hence inefficiency. As a Walloon government official put it: 'There is a danger that we have complicated the set-up so much, that it has become ineffective.' But one year on, the verdict on fully-fledged federalism is so far, so good. Rather than complicating the process of government, the new system has made it simpler. 'Thirty to forty years of Belgium as a unitary state did not work,' says Xavier Mabille, a Belgian political analyst. 'There is less risk of doubling now than before.' The process towards federalism began way back in 1970 when the existence of two main cultural communities and three regions was recognised under the constitution. In 1980 the communities were given, in addition to cultural responsibilities such as language-use and the arts, responsibility for areas that could be dealt with at the 'personal' level. This covered policies for the elderly and the handicapped, for example. Meanwhile, regional institutions were given responsibility for areas such as the environment, rural development and the economy. In 1988, powers for both the communities and the regions were enlarged to include education, public works, transport, science policy and oversight of the communes and provinces within the regions. The communities and regions were also given responsibility for their own finances. Last year, the transition was completed. Under an agreement known as the St Michael accords, Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels were granted their own, directly elected parliaments. The parliamentary bodies of the communities were also to be elected directly. Significantly, powers over foreign trade, agriculture, scientific policy and some aspects of international relations were transferred to the regions and the language communities. Since last year many of the fears of those who distrusted federalism have been allayed. 'I would have preferred not to live in a Federal State, but in a regional one,' says Mr Charles Picque, president of the Brussels region. 'But we have to live with it, and organise our structures around it.' Of all the administrators facing last year's dramatic changes, those in the Brussels region probably had most to fear. As a bilingual region - part of it is Dutch speaking, while most in the capital speak French - the stresses were likely to show up more here than elsewhere. 'With two communities, there is a temptation for separatism,' says Mr Picque. But for all his doubts, and even during a long recession, such forces have remained at bay. More troubling in the short term, are the economic implications of federalism, if Belgium the federal state - a keen and dedicated member of the European Union - is to meet the convergence criteria for monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty. One fear of Mr Peter Praet, senior economist at Kredietbank, Belgium's leading bank, is that the new arrangements will make it very difficult for Belgium to meet Maastricht's stringent demands, particularly on control of the budget. The real test will come in 1996, by which time Belgium, in order to take part in a single currency, will have to have reduced its notoriously run-away government deficit to just 3 per cent of GDP. The new federalism also throws up potential problems for foreign policy. Since last year, Belgium's three regions have had the right to sign treaties with other nations. Indeed, Flanders - the most chauvinistic of the three regions - has already signed a treaty on water with the Netherlands. Inevitably, such a devolution diminishes the standing of the Federal government. Attitudes towards these new powers vary from region to region. Mr Luc van den Brande, president of the government of Flanders, is an enthusiast. The right to sign treaties will, he says, 'do much to stimulate and facilitate relations between Flanders and its European and international partners'. In line with this, Flanders has set up a network of 70 economic representatives over five continents. It also has its own diplomats in Vienna, The Hague, Washington, Tokyo and Brussels. His approach contrasts sharply with that of Mr Picque. 'It may be possible for us to sign treaties with other nations, but it is unlikely that the UK or France would bother to sign treaties with a region,' he says. As far as Brussels is concerned, it will continue to operate through the Federal government's embassies. Another problem is that of transfers of resources. With regions free to collect certain taxes, there is a danger of a two-tier system developing in and around Brussels. Those who are wealthy enough to commute are gradually moving out of the Brussels region, to set up home just over the border in Flanders where taxes are lower. As a result, the tax base in Brussels is gradually shrinking, leaving the regional government short of funds and creating resentment that it has to pay for the city's infrastructure used daily by high numbers of 'free-riders'. Many of these areas could in the future create resentments and tensions. Further, the ambitions of the regions differ widely. With Wallonia and Brussels more or less content with the current set-up, Mr van den Brande has publicly stated his desire for a totally independent Flanders. Three things however, should act as a brake on the separatist forces. Firstly the monarchy, very much a symbol of Belgian's unity. Secondly, the city of Brussels and the problem of how, if total independence should be granted to the regions, the city would be split. Thirdly, there is the Belgian people's common history and a high level of intermarriage. These aspects, together with the lack of any religious tension, should ensure that at least for the time being, the loose federation will continue to thrive.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A federal judge in Miami denied motions by Eastern Airlines unions to dismiss a  $1.5-billion suit filed before the current strike began on March 4 and accusing  the unions of racketeering, extortion and fraud, a spokesman for the airline  said. Robin Matell said U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler told lawyers on  both sides that he had rejected the unions' contention that the suit was  without merit and should be dismissed. A spokesman for the striking  International Assn. of Machinists said the union had not confirmed the report  and had no comment on it. Spokesmen for the pilots and flight attendants unions  were unavailable. Meanwhile, the strike by the machinists entered its sixth  week while pilots and flight attendants continued to honor the picket lines.  Eastern has been virtually grounded by the walkout. The airline has since filed  for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors.  </P></p>

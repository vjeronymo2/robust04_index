			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Books: Beach boy troubles WOULDN'T IT BE NICE? MY OWN STORY by Brian Wilson Bloomsbury Pounds 17.99, 390 pages WITH SOME rock musicians, you can hear their doom in the music. Janis Joplin's voice, Keith Moon's drumming, Jimi Hendrix's guitar - self-destruction provided them with a steady back beat. There is very little such evidence in Brian Wilson's work although, as his autobiography proves, the founder and creative force behind the Beach Boys has led a tortured existence of drug use, schizophrenia and legal tangles that belies his music's resolute sunniness. Wilson, born in 1942, was raised in a modest LA suburb, the sort of place that provided legions of well-scrubbed teenagers for the early years of rock 'n roll. His childhood, however, was anything but sunshine and the girl next door. His father was a bitter, failed musician who abused Wilson horribly; not surprisingly, the boy became moody and withdrawn, his only solace coming from the family piano. In 1961 he organised his brothers Carl and Dennis, cousin Mike Love and friend Al Jardine into the band that was to be The Beach Boys. They seemed to be going nowhere until it was suggested that Brian, who hated the ocean and did not even have a driver's licence, focus his already prodigious talents on the teen fads of surfing and hot rodding. His next effort, written when he was 19, charted. The rest, as they say, is history. A string of singles like 'Help Me Rhonda' and 'I Get Around' broke all sorts of sales figures. By the time he was 24, with the Pets Sounds album, the group's best, Wilson had earned his place as one of the most prodigiously talented writers and producers of the rock era. All was not sweetness and light, however, and the patterns of mental illness and substance abuse that were to plague his later years had already been established. To make matters worse, rock changed, with psychedelia and R&amp;B swamping the surfing sound. Wilson tried to keep up, but then went into a creative and personal slump that saw him at one point spend almost three years in bed, ballooning up to 340 pounds and suffering from schizophrenia intensified by massive drug use. The low point came in 1982 when the rest of The Beach Boys, who had started out as little more than a backing band for Brian, fired him from the group. Rock martyrdom was avoided with the intercession of Dr Eugene Landy, an unorthodox psychologist who bundled Wilson off to a Hawaiian retreat and took him through a radical cure that has brought him back to life. Wouldn't It Be Nice? is a morbidly fascinating read, especially the early sections, with their blend of the American Dream of rock stardom and the American Nightmare of the fractured family. Where the book proves far less interesting is in its later chapters, which deal with Wilson's recovery and the incessant squabbles between The Beach Boys and Dr Landy. Though Wilson had some mighty battles to fight in order to save his mind and his life, you cannot help but wish that he would seem more aware that, unlike most troubled souls, he was able to face his demons at an idyllic Hawaiian retreat surrounded by a squad of psychologists, nutritionists and personal trainers with a half-million dollar budget.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Export cover moves aim to hold up market share BRITAIN NEEDS to double its capital goods exports to countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to Pounds 20bn a year within a decade if it is to maintain its market share, according to government estimates. Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said yesterday there was 'every chance' of Britain being able to achieve this rate of growth, in what he described as the one area of world trade where Britain's percentage share had recently contracted. His comments came as he set out the detail behind the two-pronged Budget announcement of fresh cuts in export insurance premium rates and Pounds 1.3bn of additional export credit cover in certain markets over the next three years. He said premiums had been re-evaluated to make sure Britain was competitive. But he warned: 'Obviously we are not going to be the cheapest in every market in the world.' The biggest reductions - of up to 45 per cent - were being implemented for Singapore and Taiwan. Cuts of up to 35 per cent will apply in Hong Kong, South Korea and Malaysia. Exporters to China, India, Indonesia and Oman will benefit from reductions of up to 25 per cent. Mr Needham said he could see no evidence 'at the moment' that Britain's commercial relationship with China was being damaged by differences over Hong Kong. Iran was one of a number of countries where premium rates were being increased - in its case by up to 10 per cent. This was attributed to problems regarding negotiations over sovereign loan guarantees. China and Indonesia were named as beneficiaries of the Pounds 1.3bn in extra export credit cover, of which Pounds 300m is to be available in the coming financial year. On the question of the lack of government arrangements for reinsurance against political risks after 1994, Mr Needham said the government did not want to be in the position of having 'inadequate' reinsurance cover, although it believed this should be provided by the private sector if possible.</p>

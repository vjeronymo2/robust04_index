			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / No credit for lenders on debt advice: Sir George Blunden's fight to help consumers with money troubles A FULL-SCALE confrontation between building societies and consumer-debt advice bodies is looming in the wake of remarks last week by Sir George Blunden, chairman of the Money Advice Trust. Sir George, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, pointed the finger at some well-known high street names for not chipping in with adequate help for the money advice scheme set up last year to help consumers with serious debt problems. It is the second time in just over six months that he has publicly identified building societies for their failure to provide cash for his project. When the scheme was established, high-street retailers, banks and building societies were expected to put up cash. But several lenders, especially the large building societies, are apparently sceptical about the trust. It emerged at the time of publication last week of the first annual report of the Money Advice Trust that private-sector donations towards its debt counselling operations have lagged far below target. The trust now hints that it may be forced to push for a statutory levy. There are seven money advice centres, but the trust wants to double their number and create a national telephone debt advice service. It also envisages a regional network of Money Advice Support Units working within Citizens' Advice Bureaux and a system for training money advice workers nationally. All these plans are now being hampered by lack of cash. 'They (the centres) have not been a roaring success, but they have not been a failure either,' says Sir George. Last year, its first in operation, the trust was given Pounds 250,000 by the private sector, against its target of Pounds 3m. However it has pledges of Pounds 800,000 to come this year and next. Donations from the English banks have been good, but Sir George expresses deep disappointment elsewhere. The most meagre donors have been the Scottish banks. They have contributed only Pounds 2,500 between them, a figure which Sir George describes as bitterly disappointing. The electricity industry has given Pounds 2,500. Support from retailers has been patchy, though there have been significant contributions from Kingfisher and GE Capital, one of the main suppliers of storecard and retail credit. The unspoken implication is that some institutions are turning their backs on the debt problem. Problems with home loans probably cause the most acute difficulties for families. Building societies, which now have 290,000 mortgage customers who are more than six months in arrears, are singled out by Sir George. He says some societies seem to prefer to make donations for money advice locally rather than nationally. As a result, local authorities may simply trim their spending on debt counselling. Many societies prefer to see debt advice carried out in-house by their own staff. Sir George says that for it to be fully effective, debt counselling should be done independently in Citizens' Advice Bureaux. One especial target for criticism is Halifax Building Society, the country's largest mortgage lender. Halifax claims to be putting Pounds 250,000 into debt counselling this year, but Sir George says that it is spending the money in ways which the trust does not want. Halifax takes a robust line against these criticisms. It claims that if building society funds were given to money advice centres, the societies would simply be underwriting the mistakes of less responsible lenders. It also challenges Sir George's idea that consumers can be helped by debt counselling head-on. The society says: 'There is little evidence that the provision of 'money advice support' actually makes a difference to the practical contribution that can be offered at a local level or any difference to the ability of individuals to repay outstanding debts.' Halifax says it will fight any attempt to impose a statutory levy for money advice centres - it says the levy would have to be passed on to borrowers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 27 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--It is  learned from authoritative departments that by the end of 1994,  191 enterprises in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong, will be  closed down or merged with other enterprises, or their  production will be stopped or changed, to reduce pollution of  the Huai He and to keep the water of the river clean.    Mass media here have disclosed that the water of the Huai He  valley is seriously polluted and nearly 50 percent of river  sections have become useless; in some areas, polluted water has  been used to irrigate land over a long period resulting in a  decrease in grain output and the content of pollutants in  agricultural produce exceeding safety standards; the output and  variety of fish and shrimp have decreased; and disputes over  pollution between different localities have become more and more  conspicuous. In dry seasons, plants often have to suspend  production. The shortage of water resources has become more and  more serious and control over the Huai He brooks no delay.    A meeting on enforcing laws to protect the environment of  the  Huai He valley was held in Bengbu, Anhui, from 24-26 May.  Besides laws and regulations on prevention and treatment of  pollution to be revised this year, provisions concerning crimes  in causing pollution will be added. The formulation of  "Regulations on Prevention and Treatment of Pollution in the  Huai He Valley" is also being discussed.</p>

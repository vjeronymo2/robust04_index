			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Mood lifts in west German manufacturing A clear improvement in business conditions during April has boosted optimism and production plans among west German manufacturers, according to a leading economics institute. Rising output in the chemicals sector, and a surge in the region's first-quarter trade surplus, reported separately yesterday, provided further evidence of economic recovery. Findings from the Munich-based Ifo institute's latest monthly poll of industry showed new orders rising and inventories shrinking. Some manufacturers reported an increase in unfilled orders even though output had been stepped up. According to the DIW institute in Berlin, pan-German gross domestic product showed its first real year-on-year increase for 12 months in the three months to the end of March. DIW said most of the 1.9 per cent growth came from an unexpected surge in private spending. While many indicators showed the gloom lifting rapidly, the German central bank appears anxious that expectations do not run too far ahead of reality. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said on Monday that it was difficult to assess exactly the strength of the recovery. 'At the moment it seems to me that the mood in business is rather better than the facts justify,' he said. The Ifo poll, one of Germany's most trusted economic barometers, also showed fading optimism among wholesalers and retailers - a widely-forecast consequence of falling real incomes. Although negative reports still predominated among manufacturers, with suppliers of investment goods and consumer durables clearly less satisfied with current conditions, the institute said poll participants overall showed 'considerably strengthened' optimism on the outlook for the next six months. Most hopes were focused on improving exports, particularly among suppliers of semi-finished products and raw materials, which are typically among the first to detect the onset or easing of a recession. The VCI chemicals industry association, for example, yesterday reported a 3.6 per cent rise in output from west German factories in the first quarter. A 6.5 per cent increase in foreign demand more than offset a 2.6 per cent decline in the home market, although prices continued to fall. The association said it expected increasing momentum from markets outside Germany, but no significant growth at home. Strengthening exports showed up in a pan-German trade surplus for the first three months of DM19bn (Pounds 7.6bn), compared with DM9bn in the comparable part of last year.</p>

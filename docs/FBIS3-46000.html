			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Tian Huiming (3944 1920 2494): "Economists </F> Discuss the Significance of the Publication of the Book Series  `Reform Faces a New Century'"]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Xue Muqiao,  the noted 90-year old economist who seldom goes outdoors, turned  up at the Jinglun Hotel, Beijing, on 20 January and met with  economic experts Liu Guoguang, Wu Jinglian, Zhang Zhuoyuan, Li  Jiange, and others, to discussthe practical significance of  publication of the book series "Reform Faces a New Century."    The series consists of eight books, and its chief editor is  Xue Muqiao and its deputy chief editors Liu Guoguang and Wu  Jinglian. Its editorial committee includes economists Zhang  Zhuoyuan and Dai Yuanchen, and a number of middle-aged and young  economic experts including Li Jiange, Zhou Xiaochuan, Guo  Shuqing, and Lou Jiwei.    These experts and scholars have personally participated in  designing and putting into practice China's reform plans over  the past dozen years or more, so the series possesses the  characteristics of integrating theory and practice and of being  exceedingly functional.    Xue Muqiao wrote a preface to the series. He reviewed the  course of new China's construction and reform and found that  arguments have mainly centered on two main lines: First, the  question of whether to take economic development or class  struggle as the central task. Second, the question of whether  the pattern of economic structure should be the allocation of  resources by planning or by the market. We should say there is  already common consensus on these two questions now. As this  century is drawing to a close and the next is unfolding,  economic theorists should make good preparations and can seize  the opportunity for all time to push China's reform and lay a  foundation for take-off in the next century.    At the meeting of economists, Wu Jinglian said: The most  important moment of reform, which I have looked forward to for  many years, has finally come. Given so many new reform measures  and numerous big and small things, it is necessary to seriously  study and carefully design reform plans. If we are just a  little careless, it will probably lead to disturbances.    He Yang argued that it is no longer practical to run the  economy through the methods of formalism, mass movements, and  administrative orders, instead, economic and legal means should  be used, and that what is important is strengthening study of  market economic theories.    Zhou Xiaochuan said that the fruits of economic theory study  over the years have been incorporated into central documents,  directly influencing economic life, and that forward-looking  economic theories will inevitably play an important role in  China's reform.    Li Jiange told this reporter that the problem of inflation  in  the economy is absolutely not caused by the pushing forward of  reform, and that reform is intended to suppress inflation, and  this view must be clearly elaborated theoretically.</p>

			<p>FBI   Academy   <F P=102> PA2006002494 Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 13 Jun 94 p 13 </F> <F P=103> PA2006002494 </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City UNOMASUNO </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] With the conviction that drug trafficking is a  worldwide problem that should be attacked jointly, the Mexican  state has called for the establishment of a common front to  combat this activity, because drug trafficking needs to be  combated with great efforts and increasingly larger economic and  human resources, the Attorney General's Office (PGR) has stated.    Thus, Mexico and the United States must continue to support  joint strategies without violating the sovereignty of either  country to combat drug trafficking.    During the inauguration of a training course for PGR agents,  at installations of the FBI Academy in Virginia, the United  States, Rene Paz Horta, National Counternarcotics Institute  (INCD) commissioner, said the intensification of efforts and the  support of other nations strengthen the task of combating drug  trafficking and related crimes, which he described as "among the  most serious scourges of humanity."    Representing Attorney General Humberto Benitez Trevino, who  is responsible for counternarcotics efforts in the country, Paz  said the training of PGR agents will help find solutions to this  problem and reflects the two countries' willingness to cooperate.    During the ceremony to inaugurate courses for PGR agents at  the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, Paz said Mexico and the  United States must continue to promote joint strategies, without  violating the sovereignty of either nation, to fight drug  trafficking.    The INCD commissioner said there is a firm conviction that  drug trafficking is a worldwide problem that must be confronted  jointly. He added this experience reinforces the hope of  establishing a united front to combat this type of crime while  respecting each other, their ethical values, and the law.    He added the Mexican state headed by President Carlos  Salinas  de Gortari has promoted the establishment of a common front  against crime, because the antidrug fight requires tremendous  efforts and increasingly larger economic and human resources.    Paz said it is painful to see thousands of human beings,  particularly young ones, fall victim to drugs. He highlighted  the need to expand rehabilitation programs for adults as well as  the people's participation in preventive efforts.</p>

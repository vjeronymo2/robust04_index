			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Troubles Dog Private Firms"] </F>   [Text] There might be at least another 1 million Chinese  joining the troops of self-employed businessmen this year.    And, predicted the State Administration for Industry and  Commerce, the number of private firms in the country could reach  more than 300,000, up 26 percent from last year.    "But, private businesses are now more at the mercy of  outside  interference," said an official with the administration's  Department of Individual and Private Enterprises.    Private businesses have become a major source of State  revenue, and to protect them China should promptly deal with the  many difficulties they face, said the official, who declined to  be named.    He noted that the country is awaiting more stringent  official  tax policies on self-employed businessmen and privately owned  firms.    The administration believes there are many arbitrary levies  on private businesses.    Besides the regular income taxes levied by the State  Administration of Taxation, private businesses in some provinces  must pay at least 100 other assessments by other official  departments.    These practices create a heavy financial burden on daily  business operations.    Such charges -- often in the name of improving urban  infrastructure, transportation and management -- often exceed  taxes owed to the State.    "The government should ban these financial levies while  strengthening the management of tax collection from private  businessmen and individual firms," the official noted.    By doing so, cash-starved local governments can raise enough  revenue to develop their local economies.    However, some local governments prefer to impose extra  levies  on private businesses instead of improving tax collection, said  analysts with the Ministry of Internal Trade.    Such practices have left many loopholes for some individual  businessmen and privately owned firms to evade taxes, they added.    The State Administration for Industry and Commerce would not  release figures on tax evasion by individual businesses.    However, it does claim that the tax levies on individual  businessmen and private firms are much better than its  expectations.    The administration's figures show that self-employed  businessmen and privately owned firms turned over to the State  more than 29.3 billion yuan ($3.37 billion) in taxes last year,  up 6.3 billion yuan ($724 million) from 1992.    At present, the State Administration of Taxation levies  income taxes only on self-employed businessmen, and the tax  treatment it applies to individual business firms is the same as  that for State enterprises.    By the end of last year, the country had nearly 17.7 million  individual business households, up 15.2 percent from a year  earlier.    It also had 238,000 privately owned firms, up 70.4 percent.</p>

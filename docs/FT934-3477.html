			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (4): Shared costs help L&amp;G to win - Case study, the BP consumer products buy-in In the early hours of Wednesday, May 26, contracts were finally exchanged on the sale of BP Nutrition's consumer products division to a management buy-in team led by Legal &amp; General Ventures, in a deal worth Pounds 272m. The transaction was significant, not only because of its size - it still ranks as the biggest unquoted equity deal this year - but also because it was one of the most fiercely contested with no fewer than four teams bidding for the mandate. BP put the whole of BP Nutrition, with annual sales of Pounds 2.9bn, on the auction block early in 1992, as part of the drive to refocus on its core oil and gas businesses and cut debt. The consumer foods division was was sold to Sara Lee, the US group, at the end of December. By that stage, the consumer products division, a leading supplier of 'own label' household detergents, cleaners and personal care products to European supermarkets, was also attracting considerable City attention. Consumer products includes Manchester-based Robert McBride in the UK, Yplon in Belgium and Solaro in Italy. Its 12 factories employ more than 4,000 people and although profits have not been disclosed, its margins on turnover of Pounds 350m last year are believed to be high. 'We started looking at consumer products way before the deal was done,' said Mr Adrian Johnson, a director of Legal &amp; General Ventures, which put the winning consortium together. The Legal &amp; General Ventures-led consortium was one of four preferred bidders, whose names were shortlisted by SG Warburg on behalf of BP at the start of 1993 to enter the final round. The three others were led by Phildrew Ventures and Citicorp Venture Capital; Electra, working with the Canadian trade buyer, CCL; and Mercury Asset Management, with Montagu Private Equity. Over the next two months, all four bidders undertook due diligence while negotiating with potential financial partners and puting together their final teams. As Mr Charles Peal, managing director of Legal &amp; General Ventures, points out, one of the consequences of the competitive auction procedure was that the unsuccessful bidders ran up 'seven-figure costs' conducting due diligence. Mr Peal said Legal &amp; General Ventures limited its own downside risk to Pounds 30,000 by sharing costs with its three other equity partners, and by tying some of the fees to success of its bid. When the sealed final bids were opened in early April, three of them, including Legal &amp; General Ventures, are believed to have been around the same level, with the fourth bid lagging some way behind. But the Legal &amp; General Ventures team believe the unified structure of their consortium, and the fact that they had already signed-up Mr Michael Handley, the former divisional managing director of RHM, to become managing director of the new company, gave them a decisive edge. 'Our transaction was a genuine management buy-in,' said Mr Peal, 'that gave us a lot of credibility.' In addition, the consortium persuaded Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks group, to lead the buy-in team by becoming non-executive chairman of off-the-shelf company formed to complete the purchase - Templeco Sixteen. On April 6, the Legal &amp; General Ventures team were summoned back to BP headquarters and told they had just a three-week exclusivity period to get the funding for the deal in place, tie-up the the paperwork and agree the sale. Those weeks were extremely hectic for Mr Johnson and his Legal &amp; General Venture colleagues, Paul Southwell and Ivan Heywood; and they were made worse when, two days into the exclusivity period, the Bishopsgate bomb demolished the offices of Norton Rose, the lead banks' solicitors, and the offices of Phoneix Fund Managers, one of the equity partners. BP, says Mr Johnson, was sympathetic, but did not formally extend the deadline. Nevertheless the complex transaction - involving equity, bank and mezzanine debt - eventually went ahead, albeit a little later than originally planned. The deal was structured as follows: Equity: The bulk of the Pounds 115m in equity funding for the deal was provided by Legal &amp; General Ventures (Pounds 50.5m) and its trans-Atlantic partner, Lehman Brothers (Pounds 50.5m). The Pounds 14m balance came from Phoenix Fund Managers, Ontario Teachers Pension Fund and Barclays Development Capital. Legal &amp; General Venture subsequently sold Pounds 22m of equity to one of the major UK venture capitalists. Following the deal, management will also be invited to become shareholders with up to a 10 per cent equity stake. Bank Debt: A syndicate of four banks, led by the Bank of Scotland's Edinburgh team (the Bank of Scotland's London team backed another of the bidders), underwrote Pounds 115m of senior debt. The other main underwriters were Bank of Tokyo, Barclays and Morgan Grenfell. Mezzanine Debt: A further Pounds 30 of mezzanine financing was provided by Mithras, an investment trust managed by Legal &amp; General Ventures, and co-underwritten by Intermediate Capital Group. In addition, the banking syndicate provided Pounds 12m of working capital. Since completing the buy-in, the Legal &amp; General Ventures team has provided much of the senior management at the new company, with Mr Ivan Heywood acting as locum finance director until the arrival of Mr Terry Monks from MB Caradon. Now, the prime objective is to build the business from its current base in order to float it on the stock exchange in about three years. The BP consumer products buy-in has also generated some controversy. Some critics maintain that it demonstrates that the dearth of big quality deals is forcing financial buyers into unhealthy competitive auctions, pushing target prices up while increasing investor risks and reducing returns. However, Charles Peal, of Legal &amp; General Ventures, thinks the deal was one-of-a-kind. 'We had been through a period when a lot of the competition had not done a large deal for a long time,' he said. Although he believes some buy-in/out opportunities will generate competing bids, he thinks most market players would think twice now before entering another four-way bid-battle.</p>

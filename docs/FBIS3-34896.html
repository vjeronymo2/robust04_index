These  preliminary talks relate to the composition of the Palestinian  police force which will be deployed in the area following the  Israeli withdrawal. Other discussions relating in particular to  the transfer of civilian powers and the release of the  Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons (almost 9,000 according  to the PLO, more according to the United Nations), are also due  to start shortly.    Mordekhay Drori, ambassador at the Israeli Mission to the  European Communities, assesses the development of the peace  process in the region. While the impetus of reconciliation does  not seem to be waning between the Palestinians and Israelis, he  reaffirmed the enormity of the task still to be accomplished.    [Gosset] Are you still optimistic about the peace process as  a whole?    [Drori] Optimistic, but also cautious. People underestimate  the difficulty, especially the practical difficulty, of the  solutions to be found for the many problems between us and the  Arab world. Moreover, it is much more complicated with the  Palestinians than with the Syrians. With the Palestinians, we  are intertwined with each other, there are no borders. And, in  addition to that, there are economic problems.    With Syria, the problems are less complicated because there  are borders. But the solution to these problems is extremely  complicated because we do not really know what the Syrians' real  intentions are, whether they agree to sign a peace agreement  with all that that involves: Diplomatic and cultural relations,  trade. Or whether they just want one agreement without any other  purpose. When we have the answer to this very complex question,  we can move forward.    [Gosset] With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad finally had to abandon his dreams of  strategic parity with Israel. And he probably realized that he  could be seriously outclassed...    [Drori] That did have a decisive influence. It is one of the  keys to the Near East affair. Whether willingly or unwillingly,  the Arab countries relied militarily, economically, and  politically on the Soviet Union. Because of its collapse, they  no longer have that support. If a new conflict arose, they  could no longer count on that unconditional aid. This fear has  virtually abolished the risk of a military attack by the Arab  countries on Israel. In addition, there is only one superpower  left in the world -- the United States. The Syrians have clearly  understood that if they wish to be integrated into the  international world and develop their economy, they must find a  means of reconciliation with Washington. And this  reconciliation depends on the peace agreement with Israel.    [Gosset] Many economic development projects have been  mentioned. Which are those which can really be implemented?    [Drori] For a European, it is very difficult to appreciate  the lack of multiregional infrastructure in the Middle East.    For you, it is perfectly natural to take your car and drive  from Brussels to Paris, or to telephone from one country to  another, and to watch foreign television channels. All that is  desperately lacking in the Middle East because the countries in  the region -- especially Israel -- have been cut off from each  other. I therefore do not see any regional development and  development among countries unless there are regional activities.    Several fundamental projects ought to remain: Road and  railroad communications, telecommunications, joint projects in  the energy sphere. One problem has a very marked political  character, and that is water: Because there is an overall  shortage, and a fair distribution of this resource in the region  is needed.    It is clear that all this can only develop if there is an  agreement in the region. But we must not expect the peace  agreement to be signed in order to make preparations. We must  start now.    [Gosset] Following the peace agreement between Egypt and  Israel in 1979, did this kind of development take place  subsequently, even on a limited scale?    [Drori] No, unfortunately not, aside from a few exceptions.  We bought and still buy Egyptian oil. But that did not go  further, mainly for political reasons: Egypt being the only  Arab country to have signed a peace agreement with Israel, there  were reservations about giving too obvious a character to that  agreement. Also, it was not possible to launch a real regional  project if the other countries stayed away.    [Gosset] What is the impact of the economic boycott by Arab  countries on the Israeli economy?    [Drori] There are no figures and I think that those who give  figures are mistaken (the figure of $3 million has sometimes  been mentioned -- L'ECHO editor's note), because it is  impossible to cost deals which have never been made for fear of  the boycott.    Let us not talk about the "primary" boycott, in other words  the boycott between Israel and the Arab countries. The main  problem is the "secondary" boycott, in other words all the  entrepreneurs and all the companies which have been threatened  with not being able to do business if they did business with  Israel. In view of the size of the Arab countries, the choice  has mainly been made in favor of the Arab countries. Examining  the present trend, I think that this kind of boycott is being  weakened. It has not stopped but should vanish if there is a  general agreement.    [Gosset] How does Israel manage to handle the arrival of new  immigrants?    [Drori] An immigrant who arrives in Israel receives housing  from the government. Or he is helped to pay his rent for one or  two years. He receives an allowance during the period in which  he is looking for work. It is a huge burden, but we are used to  it because we have always faced immigration and the country is  organized accordingly.    Around 500,000 people have arrived and several hundred  thousand more are expected. In the long term, it is an  extraordinary source of wealth, because many of them are highly  qualified: Engineers, doctors... Professions which require  years of training. In the short term, when you see, for  instance, 5,000 doctors arriving, which will double the number  of practitioners in the country, there has to be retraining --  which is sometimes tragic in the personal sphere, but necessary  at national level -- and work has to be created for others.  This all requires an enormous amount of work, which has borne  fruit because unemployment resulting from immigration has fallen.</p>

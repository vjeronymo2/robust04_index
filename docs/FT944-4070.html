			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / UK Property Review (7): Crocodile tears over new controls - The Retail Sector / Owners of existing shops are smirking. Even developers are not exactly distraught Ask any developer his worst nightmare and he will conjure up images of planners, conservationists and a government 'committed to protecting the future'. Ask an investor for utopia and he will conjure up planners, conservationists. . . etc. Much of the wailing over strict new controls on shopping centres are crocodile tears. Restrict supply of any property and the value of existing buildings rises. The Labour government learned this lesson in the 1960s after a ban on new London offices. That is why owners of existing shops are smirking. Even developers are not exactly distraught. Apart from rare cases such as in Dumplington in Manchester, few had any intention of building more centres. The country is almost saturated with shopping malls. Even food stores have nearly reached their peak. Tesco and Sainsbury have chose to return to town centres rather than be driven in by planners as some campaigners insist. What really irritates the industry is the poor reasoning and lack of research behind the government's moves. The call for fewer car journeys without investment in public transport is a major bone of contention. A national policy also cannot cope with local variations, says Richard Wright of Jones Lang Wootton, president-elect of the British Council for Shopping Centres and a witness before the Select Committee which backs controls on shopping centres. Meanwhile, back on the high street a strange thing is happening: rents have stopped falling. Retailing leads the property sector in and out of recession because of the speed with which shoppers respond to tax and interest-rate changes. So the slow, if steady, revival in spending levels is now impacting on values. Richard Ellis highlights the relationship in a simple graph. This shows how rents, after a time lag, have followed the rise and fall of GDP for the past 20 years. The present rises are not spectacular; prime rents increased 0.6 per cent in the year to June, according to Healey &amp; Baker's Prime report. But this is the first year-on-year increase since 1990, and the recovery will continue through 1994 and cross over the vital threshold next year by exceeding inflation, says H&amp;B. 'We expect retailers to start expanding their floor space, which coupled with a gradual tightening in supply will produce further rent increases,' says Graham Chase of Erdman Lewis. He expects a 3-4 per cent national average increase in the year to May 1995. But like the varying local conditions which should be used to test the case for each new shopping centre, there are big differences in sectors of the retail market. London and the south-east are expected to top the growth league, partly because they have been hardest hit by recession, says Erdman Lewis. Central London is the only area in the country where rents remain below 1987 levels but this is being eroded through an influx of overseas spenders and a lack of new property. Paul Griffiths, investment director at Chesterton, picks out prime high streets where rents have fallen back over the years as a target for institutional money. It will take another year or 18 months for rent rises to work their way through to reviews, however. There is also little to buy at the moment. This scarcity - particularly of property around 3,500 sq ft - and a lack of new development would help drive up rents over the next two years even without a surge in demand, adds H&amp;B. As in other sectors, secondary stock will be a big problem. Until all available prime space is used up it will languish in an increasingly polarised market. One irony in the debate over shopping constraint is that out-of-town retailing has led the market in performance. In East Anglia and the north, H&amp;B says rents rose 8.4 per cent and almost 8 per cent respectively compared with a national sector increase of 5.5 per cent in the first half of 1994. Retail warehouses can absorb such rises because they are considerably more profitable than high street stores, despite the fact that costs have risen 43 per cent since 1990 compared with in-town increases averaging 3 per cent, according to a special study by Chesterton Research.</p>

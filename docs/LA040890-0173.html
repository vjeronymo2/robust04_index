			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HINTS FROM HELOISE: FOR EASTER, DECORATING HOLLOW SHELLS IS BEST WAY TO AVOID  WASTING EGGS  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: My children like to decorate Easter eggs but I hate to waste  three or four dozen good eggs. Any suggestions?  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE, Kansas City, Mo.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: One of my favorite traditions here in San Antonio is cascarones  -- decorated hollow egg shells. They're simple to make and should be just the  thing you're looking for.  </P> <P> Whenever you use fresh eggs, don't crack the shells -- blow them out instead.  This takes a little more time than just cracking them, but it's easy to do. Be  sure the egg is clean, then poke a pin hole in the small end of the shell.  Next, using a knife or spoon, gently crack a small dime-size circle at the  other end and carefully remove it.  </P> <P> Be sure to remove the inner "skin" that lines the eggshell so that the egg can  come out. Hold the egg over a cup or bowl and blow into the pin hole, forcing  the egg out the broken end.  </P> <P> Run water gently into the empty shell to rinse it, blow out the water and set  it aside to dry thoroughly.  </P> <P> The empty shells can be dyed, painted or decorated with markers the same as  hard-cooked eggs. Just be sure to handle them gently. Close the open end by  pasting a small piece of colored tissue paper over it.  </P> <P> Traditional cascarones are filled with confetti before the end is sealed.  Breaking the egg and sprinkling the confetti on someone is supposed to bring  good luck.  </P> <P> Start several weeks ahead to make sure you have plenty of eggshells, knowing  that you can have your Easter eggs and eat them too.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR READERS: Easter will soon be here and so will the traditional Easter-egg  hunts. Children will be searching here and there, Easter baskets in hand, for  those colorful Easter eggs.  </P> <P> Adults should be aware that special precautions need to be taken when storing  hard-cooked Easter eggs before and after the hunt.  </P> <P> Hard-cooked eggs should be cooled and refrigerated immediately or they just may  become a source of food poisoning. This is also true for foods containing eggs,  like egg salad, deviled eggs and potato salad. If the Easter eggs are destined  to become a side dish, make sure they are not left at room temperature for more  than two hours.  </P> <P> If you hide hard-cooked eggs for an Easter-egg hunt or display them in a  centerpiece, either follow the two-hour rule or do not eat them.  </P> <P> Here's to a happy and safe Easter for you and yours.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: How can I get spaghetti-sauce stains out of my children's vinyl  place mats?  </P> <P>  -- CHERI, Houston, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR CHERI: Soak the place mats in an enzyme stain-remover bleach mixed with a  little detergent and warm water. Follow the directions on the box for amounts.  After soaking, scrub the spots with a brush and then rinse thoroughly.  </P> <P> If the stains remain, put the place mats outside on a hot, sunny day and let  the sun bleach them out.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: As a young, working homemaker I've learned to cook quick, easy  meals for my family but I still have one problem -- planning interesting,  well-balanced menus. I've been getting ideas, though, by looking at the frozen  dinners in the supermarket.  </P> <P> Each dinner has a meat, a starch and one or two vegetables. I make a note of  the different combinations, then duplicate them on my own. This helps me avoid  repetitious meals and my family enjoys the variety.  </P> <P>  -- SALLY, Rockwall, Tex.  </P> <P> DEAR HELOISE: This may sound trivial, but my children and I would really  appreciate some help. Is there any way to keep peanut butter and jelly  sandwiches (their favorites) from getting soggy in their lunch boxes?  </P> <P>  -- PAT, Oxnard  </P> <P> DEAR PAT: Not trivial at all to a true peanut butter and jelly lover. Spread  peanut butter on both pieces of bread, then add the jelly. The peanut butter  will keep the jelly from soaking through.  </P> <P> I'm sure other peanut butter and jelly lovers have hints too, so please share  them.  </P> <P>  -- HELOISE  </P> <P>  Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio,  Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints  received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.  </P> <P> </P></p>

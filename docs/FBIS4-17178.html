			<p>BFN     [Text] The suspension of central heating in our homes has  not yet accelerated the clearance of our debt to Russia's  Gazprom. As we were told by the Belarusian State Company for  Gas Transportation and Delivery Beltranshaz, over the first  three and a half months of this year, we amassed 165 billion  rubles [R] in debt, while our total [word indistinct] now stands  at R331 billion. We will likely be able to service our debts  with gas suppliers only after unification with the Russian  monetary system. For a while, our republic receives energy  resources in full volume, though, in line with the agreement, we  should clear our debts by 1 June because, beginning 1 July, gas  will be delivered to us only according to advance payments.</p>

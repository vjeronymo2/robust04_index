Tunis is the first stop on the  tour.    In a statement shortly before leaving for the Tunisian  capital, the Greek foreign minister stressed that the European  Union [EU] and the Greek Presidency's presence in the Middle  East may contribute at this crucial time. He added: An effort  will be made so as not to lose everything that has been achieved  toward a permanent, peaceful solution to the Middle East problem.    The foreign minister is visiting the Middle East in his  capacity as the president of the EU Council of Foreign  Ministers. EU Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek is accompanying  him.    Today, the foreign minister will meet the Tunisian president  and foreign minister as well as PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat.  Tomorrow, Papoulias will go to Jordan for talks with King  Husayn. On Thursday [3 March], he will go to Israel for talks  with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres, and Palestinian representatives. On  Friday, the foreign minister will visit Egypt for talks with  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and the secretary general of  the Arab League.

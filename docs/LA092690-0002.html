			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL THAT ANYONE CAN ASK FOR  </P> <P> The Senate Judiciary Committee is expected Thursday to approve the nomination  of Judge David H. Souter to the U.S. Supreme Court and send it to the Senate  floor. There, his confirmation seems virtually assured.  </P> <P> Thus far, the only serious opposition to Souter's nomination has come from  feminist and other civil rights groups concerned over his refusal to declare  his position on any challenge to Roe vs. Wade. To those who hold that  reproductive rights are a fundamental human liberty -- and The Times is among  them -- Souter's reticence on this question is troubling. But, in this instance  at least, such anxiety should not be decisive.  </P> <P> Americans invest more confidence in their judges, particularly those on the  Supreme Court, than any other people on Earth. We expect them to exhibit "the  wisdom of Solomon," forgetting that in the most celebrated of the cases Solomon  adjudicated, he got lucky. If the mother in that famous dispute had been half  as lacking in conscience as her opponent, king and litigants would have been  left looking at a dismembered baby. But Solomon, having thought deeply on the  nature of maternal love, trusted that, at the moment of truth, it would reveal  itself.  </P> <P> Historical experience suggests that the selection of Supreme Court justices  entails just such an informed leap of faith. Senators must determine whether  the nominee holds to humane and legally sound principles of constitutional and  human rights, then trust that the future justice will apply them in an  intelligent, unbiased and open-minded fashion. To do otherwise would be to  return the court to the turbulent days of the 19th Century, when the Senate  rejected more than one in four nominees, often for vindictive and venal  reasons.  </P> <P> Judge Souter has affirmed his basic belief that "the due process clause of the  14th Amendment does recognize and does protect an unenumerated right to  privacy" to which he attaches a "fundamental importance." Similarly, his other  responses mark him as a well-qualified and pragmatic centrist, fully in the  mainstream of American legal thought.  </P> <P> At this moment, that is all a Senator, or anyone else, has a right to ask.  </P></p>

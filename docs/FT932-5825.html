			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Output continues to expand MANUFACTURING output expanded for the fourth month in succession in May, the latest monthly survey of UK purchasing managers shows, Emma Tucker writes. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said its Purchasing Managers' Index recorded a level of 53 per cent in May. This was slightly less than in April but a level above 50 per cent indicates that manufacturing output is still expanding. The index is based on a weighted average of movements of several components including new orders, output and employment. The institute, which represents UK purchasing managers with overall spending power of Pounds 250bn a year, said many companies had reported an increase in levels of employment.</p>

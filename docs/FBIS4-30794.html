			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of </F> Bosnia-Herzegovina, addressing participants in the constituent  assembly of the B-H Federation in Sarajevo on 30 May -- live]    [Text] Esteemed deputies, today's session of the  Constituent Assembly of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina  aimed at reaching decisions of great importance for the  implementation of the constitutional provisions concerning  executive organs of the federation, the territorial organization  of the cantons, and other important issues concerning the  setting up of the system of state organization [words  indistinct] regarding the adoption of these decisions we are  running a bit behind the schedule envisaged by the draft  provisions of the federal constitution. However, we live and  work under conditions of war, which makes it very difficult  indeed to solve numerous, very sensitive issues within a short  period of time, within 30 days or so, and at the same time deal  with many other issues imposed on us by the incidents of war.    Although lately there has been an abundance of events that  (?pretended) to be that, to be not only important, but also  historic, there is no doubt that the Washington Agreement and  the adopted Federation Constitution will find their place among  these events. In brief, it is in fact these events that mark a  qualitatively new stage characterized by essentially different  relations and a much faster pace of development. It is very  important that we preserve and further develop this new  qualitatively new component, and at the same time step up the  dynamics of the process that has begun.    The Washington Agreement and the adoption of the Federation  Constitution represent an exceptionally important breakthrough  in unblocking relations caused by the aggression. First of all  there is a shift in the balance of power in the political and  military spheres, which had significantly shifted to the  advantage of the aggressor prior to the conclusion of the  Washington Agreement.    The setting up of the Federation has facilitated the  consolidation of relations between Bosniaks and Croats and the  unified stand toward aggressive Serbian nationalism. This in  turn facilitates a strategic change in relations not only in  Bosnia-Herzegovina but also further afield in the region. At  this moment this is the only real way to effectively oppose the  idea of the creation of a great Serbia. This orientation has  already yielded some results.    There were, however, some risks that the process to  implement  the Washington Agreement would be blocked. The Vienna Agreement  had removed that danger and instead of a new blockade, we now  have an open path to implement the federal Constitution and  realize the entire political project deriving from the  Washington Agreement.    Proceeding from the standpoints of the Constituent Assembly,  we have reached concurrence on several very important issues,  proposals that will enable the assembly to adopt decisions  needed to definitely realize [word indistinct] the Federation in  actual life. First, we have agreed on the national composition  of the incumbents to the federation's executive branch. These  proposals are already known and there is no need for me to  repeat them here. The proposals are based on provisions of the  Federation Constitution and the provisions of the Constitutional  Law on Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    We bore in mind the fact that in the transitional period,  within constitutionally determined rights and duties, the  constitutional organs of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the organs of the Federation will function simultaneously.  However, the national composition of the federal incumbents is  not the only important issue. At this moment it is extremely  important that the people who are to carry out these duties are  firmly, sincerely, and personally committed to the consistent  implementation of the Washington Agreement. Their readiness to  work resolutely on the implementation of the constitutional  setup of the Federation as a whole is especially important.    It is not redundant to stress that every person proposed  for these posts from one nation must be acceptable to the other  nation. Incumbents for federal posts will however not perform  their duties only for the nation from which they come. They are  state officials who have constitutional rights, duties, and  responsibilities toward all peoples and all citizens. It is  therefore important that they are people who enjoy widespread  trust.    When we were creating conditions for the effective  implementation of the Constitution of the Federation we also  (?adopted) proposals for the territorial organization of the  cantons. This is a very important and sensitive issue. It took  a considerable amount of patience, effort, and understanding to  find acceptable solutions. It is in fact this issue that has  demonstrated that the concept of federation does not lead toward  rifts and divisions, but that it is opening up opportunities for  the reintegration of people and regions, respecting at the same  time the principles of national equality and the rights of the  Bosniaks and Croats to exercise the constitutional status of  constituent nations in all parts of the federation.    Regarding the Central Bosnian and the Neretva Cantons, one  should particularly stress that the proposed solutions are such  that it is in fact these two cantons that, instead of being  battlefields, can represent the backbone of the Federation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is one of those solutions that is  strengthening mutual trust among Bosniaks and Croats and  pointing to the readiness to set up the Federation and develop  it as a real expression of common, long-term, and vital  interests of the two peoples.    The issue of the territory of the Federation as whole is  directly connected to the territorial organization of the  cantons. Full agreement has also been reached on this issue.  The territory of the Federation is defined according to the  constitutional principle that the Federation will be set up in  those areas of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in which the  Bosniaks and Croats constitute a majority of the population.  The territories of the areas defined in this way encompass 55  percent of the total territory of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Sarajevo region, which makes up another  3 percent of the republic, is treated in a special way. In the  transitional period this region would be placed under the  administrative supervision of the international community and  the United Nations.    According to the map established by the Vienna Agreement,  there are 2,844,000 people living on the territory of the  Federation, according to data from 1991. Of these, the Bosniaks  make up 52.07 percent, the Croats 24.11 percent, the Serbs 16.93  percent, and members of other nations make up approximately 7  percent. In relation to the total number of the Bosniaks in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, 77.81 percent of the members of this nation  are living on the territory of the Federation. Of the total  number of the Bosnia- Herzegovina Croats, 90.12 percent of them  live on the territory of the Federation. Of the total number of  Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 35.25 percent live  on the territory of the Federation.    Of course, one cannot see from the statistical data on  ethnic  composition all the components important for the survival and  functioning of the territorial integrity of the federation.  However, the analysis of other elements shows that the territory  of the Federation satisfies the most vital political, economic,  defense, and other parameters necessary for the realistic  functioning of the Federation.    I would like to stress in particular that the aim of  creating  the Federation is not to establish some kind of exclusive space  for Bosniaks and Croats. On the contrary, I think that this is  only an important step in the search for a just and lasting  political solution that will bring peace back to this region,  and that will enable members of all nations to live free in all  parts of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and enjoy full  national equality and all human rights and freedoms.    It is in fact for these reasons that our invitation is  permanently open to the members of the Serbian nation to accept  the federal concept on the same principles that apply to the  Bosniaks and the Croats. This is (?fair) proposal that  represents a reasonable and acceptable alternative to the war  options. The members of the Serbian nation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina have every reason to react positively to this  proposal.    Esteemed deputies, the decisions that the parliament is  supposed to adopt today have great importance in the context of  the peace process that is again gaining pace and intensity with  the initiatives of the United States, Russia, and the European  Union. The realization of the Washington and Vienna Agreements  has already considerably contributed to the removal of the  imposed notion about three warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  A few day ago, at the meeting with the contact group in France,  we were formally and essentially one side, a side that  (?impressed) with its arguments and with constructive proposals  aimed at achieving a peaceful and just political solution.    The implementation of the Constitution of the Federation at  all levels, and (?organization), will contribute to the further  strengthening of such [words indistinct]. Of course, one should  not have any illusions that everything will go smoothly. Before  us is lies the important political duty of reestablishing mutual  trust with words and deeds, especially in the regions where past  events have had serious consequences. For the sake of truth and  political reality, one should say that there are forces in whose  interest it is to obstruct and even openly prevent these  positive efforts. It is our duty to prevent and eliminate these  extremists, because their existence and activities only serve  the aggressor and weaken our position.    Further (?consolidation) of the situation and relations in  the Federation in our view means above all a step closer to  peace. However, if the war option continues to be imposed on us,  then this is a precondition for our successful resistance  against aggression.    Esteemed Deputies, before this parliament are proposals on  which it must decide with much prudence, tolerance, and  political responsibility. By adopting the Constitution of the  Federation and supporting the Washington Agreement, this  assembly has already demonstrated these qualities. I believe  that the executive bodies that will be elected and appointed at  this session will have the same attitudes toward their future  duties. This particularly refers to the peace process; the  strengthening of the defense forces for the struggle against the  aggressor; the speedy establishment of other entities envisaged  by the federal constitution, at all levels; the further  consolidation of the situation on the territory controlled by  the legislative branch; the creation of conditions for the  survival of the population in areas particularly affected by the  war; and especially the care for refugees and displaced persons,  that is, the creation of conditions for their soonest return to  the places and homes that they had to leave.    I appeal to you to contribute with your decisions to the  even  more resolute and successful realization of these principles  that are of vital importance for every individual, every family,  and all peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Thank you. [applause]</p>

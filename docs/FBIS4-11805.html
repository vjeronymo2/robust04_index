			<p>BFN     [Text] France is pushing for a United Nation's resolution  regarding the easing of sanctions on the Gulf of Aqaba, the  French Ambassador in Amman Mr. Bernard Bajolet told THE STAR's  Hamdan al-Haj on Wednesday [30 March]. He said that France is  only interested in seeing sanctions work against Iraq, and not  in creating hardships for Jordan. He added that "Jordan's  suggestion of allowing UN inspection of ships only once they  reached shore and not on the high seas was very reasonable," and  that "France along with its European partners are taking the  Jordanian suggestion very seriously and presently discussing  it." The ambassador said the French navy is participating in UN  inspection of ships heading for Aqaba along with the Americans.</p>

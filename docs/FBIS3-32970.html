The uneventful approval of this reform by 120 votes to six,  with one abstention, allows President-elect Eduardo Frei  Ruiz-Tagle to take his oath for a six-year term on 11 March.  Chile thus returns to the traditional six-year presidential  terms that was applied until the coup d'etat of 11 September  1973.    The Constitution promulgated by the military junta in 1980  approved an eight-year term, which Frei described as "too long."    A four-year term without reelection was approved for  President Patricio Aylwin, but an agreement was finally reached  to reinstate the traditional six-year terms.    To approve this constitutional reform, the opposition and  the  ruling party had to vote together to comply with the high  quorums required to introduce any change in the Constitution  that was bequeathed by the military regime.    The session of the so-called Plenary Congress began shortly  before noon after a brief two-minute delay, even though most  legislators are on their summer vacations. The minimum quorum  required was met with 114 of the 166 legislators in attendance.    Those who voted against the reform were three conservative  National Renewal Party deputies, one Independent Democratic  Union deputy, dissident Socialist Party legislator Mario  Palestro, and Senator Ronald McIntyre, who represents the Navy's  stance and was not elected but appointed by former dictatorial  President General Augusto Pinochet.</p>

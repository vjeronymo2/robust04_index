			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> GREAT MUTINY BY DINERS HIGHLY UNLIKELY AT SANTA MONICA'S BRITISH RAAJ  </P> <P> There's a little corner of Santa Monica that will always be India. Once it was  an Indian restaurant called Shakun, which is still the name on the awning. Then  it was an Indian restaurant called Shanta, which is still the name on a brass  plate over the reception area.  </P> <P> Now it's called British Raaj. It's a stately but not overdone sort of place  (high ceilings, chandeliers, brass lamps) with waiters in white Moghul uniforms  and turbans. Photos of the old days in Colonial India hang on the wall,  accompanied by a charming text of personal reminiscence. Deja vu all over  again, and deja vu also with the menu, which is basically of the London-Indian  sort, full of dishes with names never heard in India, along the lines of lamb  Bombay and chicken Madras (here we even have lamb Kathmandu).  </P> <P> And you can bet your last rupee that British Raaj serves Moghlai-style food,  that mild, meaty, creamy, buttery style of cooking that hits your palate -- and  your metabolism -- like a ton of pillows. It's a very attractive cuisine if you  don't eat it too often; you can end up wondering whether you're suffering from  sensory overload or sensory deprivation.  </P> <P> For instance, I spent quite a while at one meal trying to decide which of two  dishes was lamb dahi (lamb cooked with yogurt) and which was lamb bhuna (fried  lamb with little or no sauce, according to my sources, but here another dish of  lamb cooked with yogurt). This was as far as I got: One of the dishes was a  little more sour than the other, which had the lighter-colored sauce.  </P> <P> There may also have been a subtle difference in the spices, but basically, if  we had also ordered, say, lamb korma (lamb with another yogurt sauce) the meal  would have been a conundrum plus butterfat. Even vegetarian dishes can get this  kind of treatment. Rani nargisi is balls of spinach in a staggeringly rich  sauce.  </P> <P> This kind of food, like a certain kind of French cooking, perhaps flatters our  palates on a rather primitive level: "Here, Mighty Chief, we have saved the  very fattest parts of the mastodon for you." And, of course, there ought to be  more variety in the flavors. Even the vindaloo dishes, which are supposed to be  in a vinegary sauce, are mild and very rich.  </P> <P> Fortunately there are a number of tandoori dishes at British Raaj, and they are  quite good, all with a bit of tomato, mushroom and onion on the side, a lemon  to squeeze on them, and more distinct spices than those rich sautees. The  combination of tikkas (pieces of chicken and lamb) is particularly nice.  </P> <P> There is one sauteed dish of more than usual interest, called Kashmiri lamb on  this menu, though there's probably a real name for it in Kashmir. It's mild and  rich and elusively flavored with cumin, but the sauce of peaches and raisins is  unusual and surprisingly successful.  </P> <P> The entrees come with a choice of salad with yogurt dressing or mulligatawny  soup. I'd take the soup, a thin bean puree with red pepper prominent among the  spices. There are two table chutneys, one much like applesauce complete with  cinnamon, and a peppery one with raw onions in it, a good foil for the rich  sautees.  </P> <P> The best of the appetizers is chol poori, a poori (call it a puffy fried  tortilla) to be eaten with garbanzos in a slightly hot tomato sauce. In the  shrimp poori, the sauce is a bit sweet rather than hot.  </P> <P> The samosas aren't quite as good. The meat samosa has a lot of heavily browned  ground meat in it, and a mild spice aroma dominated by clove, but it's pretty  dry. Something, anything, to dip it in, say a bit of yogurt, would make this a  lot easier to eat. The vegetable samosa is the ordinary peas and potatoes deal.  Onion bhajis, despite the name, are not mostly onions. They're little clumps of  vegetables -- peas and carrots as well as onions -- held together with batter.  They're deep-fried and, to tell the truth, a bit oily.  </P> <P> Dessert is not an Indian specialty, but apart from the syrupy condensed milk  balls called gulab jamun, British Raaj is likely to have a couple of good ice  creams, such as peach or pistachio. That might not sound like much for dessert,  but don't worry. If you've eaten an entree here, you've probably already given  your metabolism as much as it can handle.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: chol poori, $3.50; Kashmiri lamb, $12.95; combination of  tikkas (tandoori), $16; peach ice cream, $2.50.  </P> <P> British Raaj, 504 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica.

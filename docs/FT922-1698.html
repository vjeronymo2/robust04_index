			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Helping Perot prepare for power I WAS IN Vail, Colorado, last weekend, hobnobbing with the rich and powerful. I took the chairlift up Vail mountain. Swam a dozen lengths a day. Played tennis. Got face-burn. Rode a bay horse named Pete along a river-side trail at dusk. Bought a pair of shoes. Read Elmore Leonard. And met Ross Perot, the chirpy Texan gunslinger who has injected a gust of drama into the race for the White House. First, they looked me over. I was in the village, eating my dinner, struggling to make sense of The New York Times, when my table was surrounded by a dozen men in suits, some speaking into microphones or listening to ear-pieces, all carrying briefcases stuffed with documents, Ivy League types, not a Texan to be seen, so that I completely lost the drift of whatever it was I was eating. Elk, I suspect, though it could have been buck deer. They patted me down, checked my ID, asked me some questions. Satisfied, they led me to a table at the back of the restaurant and introduced me to Ross Perot. He was wearing a blue suit and a blue-striped tie. The reason he wanted to talk to me, said the man who would be president, was that one of his people had shown him last week's column, in which I outlined my plans for a British Board of Referenda. 'My people,' said Ross Perot, 'tell me that you share my belief in electronic town halls and on-line forums as a means to hash out national issues. That you, like me, advocate demographic databases and electronic conferencing so that groups of voters can listen to discussions, ask their questions, and then use touch-tone pads to vote on far-flung matters. That you understand teledemocracy - top-down, bottom-up links between voters and their president. That you are part of the vista of technopolitics. In short, that you are a can-do kinda boy with whom I might do business.' I said nothing. 'Tell me,' said Ross Perot, 'what is the one thing that will get me into the White House? Don't bother with issues, downtown stuff like that. And don't think in sound-bites. Stick to personal qualities. Take your time, boy. They'll keep your dinner hot.' 'Mr Perot,' I said. 'The one thing that will get you into the White House is preparation. Nothing is so small you can afford to overlook it. You must attend to every detail. 'Let me tell you what the late Marlene Dietrich told her orchestra in Las Vegas the night before she opened. She and the orchestra and her musical director, Burt Bacharach, had just completed 32 hours of strenuous preparation, and Bacharach had announced that rehearsals were over. 'But Dietrich was a perfectionist, and inexhaustible. So she addressed the orchestra. 'All right,' she said. 'Burt says rehearsals are over. It's time to stop, time to go, and Burt knows. He knows your union rules . . . He knows your freeways and your lawn sprinklers and your swimming pools and your televisions, your standards and your aspirations. And so you must go home to your little wives in your little houses in the hills or the San Fernando Valley. I am prepared and willing to stay here all night. All night and all tomorrow, too. To get it right. To justify this thing we are doing, this act of theatre. But no. Your pools and martinis and television sets and wives are waiting, so never mind. Never mind that we open tomorrow night before the most cynical audience in the world. And we are not ready for them. But go. Go home and relax. And as you do, think that we open tomorrow night, and tomorrow night will be . . . a disaster.' 'But it wasn't,' I said. 'Marlene was a triumph.' Perot was spell-bound. 'OK,' he said. 'Write me the sort of referendum question I should be asking as president.' He gave me a gold pen. 'Gun Control,' I wrote. 'President Perot says he wants to take guns out of the hands of violent people. Not all the people. Just drunks and crazies. Here's what he wants to do. Anyone who's had a cocktail or three and is caught handling a firearm will be sent down-river for 25 years. No ifs or buts. If you're in favour, vote 'Yes' on your touch-pad. If not, 'No.' But remember: we've got to make America safe for decent folk. Support President Perot. Vote 'Yes' for sanity.' When I showed Perot my question, he hissed through his teeth with glee. 'You'll do fine, boy,' he said. 'Welcome to the team.' Then he gave me Dollars 35,000 and sent me to finish my dinner.</p>

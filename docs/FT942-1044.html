			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Mexican minister offers to quit The Mexican political system was thrown into further disarray yesterday after Mr Jorge Carpizo, the powerful interior minister, offered to resign. President Carlos Salinas refused to accept the resignation and, yesterday afternoon, a government official said it could not be assumed that Mr Carpizo, who is in charge of national security and supervisor of the presidential election due in August, would resign. The minister, a volatile man widely respected for his political independence, said of his resignation that he was indignant and disillusioned that 'people in the most diverse sectors (of the country), despite the current situation of the country, are only fighting for themselves and for their group, not for Mexico. 'I am beginning not to be respected by one of the (political) parties, given that I cannot agree with the actions of some sectors of this party.' Mr Carpizo did not name the party but, in recent weeks, he has been angered by criticism from the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution of the fairness of the electoral system. He believes that this has called into question his own honesty and impartiality. Even so, Mr Carpizo's indignation with 'diverse sectors' of society indicates a frustration almost certainly extended to parts of the government and the ruling party, the PRI. Mr Carpizo has long been opposed by conservative forces in the party. The lawyer for Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, the kidnapped Mexican financier, has said on national television that his ransom would be paid, paving the way for his release within three days. Mr Harp, joint head of Banamex-Accival, the largest bank in Mexico, was seized in March. The kidnappers said in their latest communication that the ransom demand had been dropped to less than Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.5m). The lawyer agreed to pay an unspecified amount.</p>

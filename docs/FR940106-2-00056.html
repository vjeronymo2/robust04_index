			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Supplier Consultation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 1834(a)(10)(B) and 1842(b)(9)(A)(i) of the Act require that we consult with representatives of the suppliers likely to be affected by any change in payment before making a determination that a fee schedule amount(s) is not inherently reasonable by reason of its grossly excessive or deficient amount. On June 15, 1993, we met with representatives of suppliers of home blood glucose monitors (hereinafter referred to as supplier representatives) to discuss issues relating to Medicare payment for these devices. The following is a synopsis of the comments and concerns of the supplier representatives as expressed at this meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The supplier representatives were primarily concerned about the use of manufacturer rebate information in determining appropriate Medicare payment amounts for home blood glucose monitors. They maintained that the rebate programs are purely a marketing tool used by the manufacturers to promote the sale of their monitors, that the rebates do not relate in any way to the ``market price'' of the monitors, and that the rebate programs are not permanent and, therefore, should not be used as a basis for establishing payment amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, if a manufacturer's rebate is included in the charge listed on a claim submitted for reimbursement to Medicare, that rebate is to be clearly and specifically identified and is to be annotated as not reimbursable under Medicare. Payment is based on the lower of the actual charge for the equipment (the submitted charge less the rebate amount) or the fee schedule amount. However, as noted in the OIG report discussed above, in a majority of cases, the rebates are not reported on the claims submitted to Medicare, resulting in Medicare overpayments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Medicare payment amounts for home blood glucose monitors should not exceed the amounts paid by the general public for these devices. The price of a home blood glucose monitor less any available rebate amount represents the actual cost to the consumer for the device and is an appropriate basis for establishing Medicare payment amounts for these devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the case of home blood glucose monitors, manufacturer rebates are widespread and have been available for several years. The OIG reported that manufacturer rebates for home blood glucose monitors generally range from about $30 to $75 and that the duration of the rebate offer is continually extended, often lasting for more than 1 year or until a new model is introduced. Given the facts underlying the pricing of these monitors, the retail prices of home blood glucose monitors less the available rebate amounts are reasonable measures of the market value of these devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The supplier representatives maintained that some rebate programs are not available in some areas of the United States. However, the rebates listed in the Bruce Medical Supply catalog are available to all Medicare beneficiaries living in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The supplier representatives stated that we should consider establishing inherent reasonableness limits for blood glucose test strips, identified as code A4253 of the HCPCS. Medicare payment for these supplies is made on a reasonable charge basis. The Medicare carriers, therefore, have the authority to establish inherent reasonableness limits for code A4253. We are aware of several carriers that have established inherent reasonableness limits for this code.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Provisions of This Proposed Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on our own experience and the work of OIG, and after consulting with representatives of suppliers of home blood glucose monitors, we have determined that the fee schedule amounts for code E0607 are grossly excessive and are not inherently reasonable. In accordance with section 1842(b)(8) of the Act, we are proposing to replace the use of a fee schedule payment with special payment limits for code E0607. These special payment limits would not apply to home blood glucose monitors with special features (HCPCS code E0609).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Colombia, China, and Russia were formally accepted  yesterday as active members of the Pacific Basin Economic  Council (known in English by the acronym PBEC), which is  considered the world's most important business forum.    The formal inclusion of these nations occurred at the 27th  General Assembly of the organization held in Kuala Lumpur,  Malaysia. Important Colombian businessmen, accompanied by  Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos, attended the meeting.    "This is an important step in our policy of diversifying  outside the Paris-London-New York axis and getting closer to the  most dynamic region of the world and the one with the brightest  future," Santos said.    The PBEC is an organization that includes important  businessmen from Asia, Canada, United States, Mexico, and Chile  and whose goal is to expand the trading borders of PBEC member  countries. This organization is different from the Pacific  Economic Cooperation Conference (known by the English acronym  PECC), which is a governmental institution that Colombia joined  last March.    "The opportunities opened for the Colombian private sector  are immense because here we are dealing with the big leagues,"  said Guillermo Fernandez de Soto, president of the Chamber of  Commerce of Santa Fe de Bogota.    Meanwhile, Fernando Urrea, executive of the Colombian  Leonisa  Company and member of the Colombian delegation, said that "at  forums such as this one, we realize the valuable opportunities  that we businessmen have at our disposal to broaden our markets  and also realize that we must seek markets abroad instead of  waiting for them to come by the grace of God."  <H5>  Colombia, Very Attractive </H5>   Minister Juan Manuel Santos was invited to the General  Assembly's plenary session in his capacity as presidential  designate, along with the prime ministers of Malaysia and  Vietnam. In his speech, Santos explained the opportunities  offered by the Colombian economy and the privileged access to  international markets it has achieved through its integration  policy. "Colombia has become one of the most attractive houses  in a neighborhood that is becoming more interesting by the day  to foreign investment," the Colombian minister said in reference  to the nation's prominent position in Latin America.    He mentioned the struggle against drug trafficking that the  country has waged in the past years and requested greater  international cooperation for this battle. "We have lost our  most prominent politicians, our most honest judges, our most  courageous officers, and our best journalists, and this great  sacrifice has only reinforced our determination to eradicate  this scourge," he added.    Colombia's interest in joining the PBEC lies in the growing  importance of the area in the world economy. The 19 countries  that make up the PBEC produced 50 percent of world GNP in 1993  and registered an average growth rate of 3.7 percent. It is  expected that by the end of this decade these economies will  grow by more than $5 trillion, that is, more than one third of  the world's growth up to the year 2000.    The PBEC is made up of: Australia, Canada, Colombia, Chile,  China, Korea, the United States, Philippines, Hong Kong,  Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Russia,  Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan.</p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'PARENTAL NOTIFICATION' LAW  </P> <P> Once again, the U.S. Supreme Court, in its finite wisdom, has dealt women yet  another blow to their reproductive freedom via its upholding of Ohio's and  Minnesota's "Parental Notification" laws.  </P> <P> Please understand me.  </P> <P> I am completely in favor of having both parents and teen-agers involved when a  crisis pregnancy occurs. But for the highest court in the land to mandate the  "Ozzie and Harriet Syndrome" on today's teen-age women is very sad. To be faced  with an unwanted pregnancy is enough of an emotional trauma, but to add to that  having to, by law, tell a parent who may or may not be understanding or  supportive, or worse yet, to have to go before a judge on what amounts to a  very personal issue is unthinkable!  </P> <P> The day after the decision was handed down, the National Right to Life  Committee was quoted as calling it "a major victory for both parents and unborn  children." Too bad they can't ask young Spring Adams, who lived in one of the  "notification" states, how she feels about this law. After being raped by her  father, a single parent, she became pregnant. When she went to him to get  permission (by law) to terminate the pregnancy, he promptly shot her dead.  </P> <P> I predict two things will result from this decision: More babies will be having  babies, and more young women will be dying from self-induced or clandestine  abortions. I'm sure the Right to Life Committee is pleased.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER B. CRINER  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

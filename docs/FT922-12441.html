			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (At a glance): Germany is key to rate cut Hopes are high that the government can reduce interest rates following the re-election, but the key factor may be Germany. As the graph shows, the gap between UK and German interest rates is low by the standards of the last 13 years. Although UK inflation has fallen, it remains to be seen whether investors would accept a lower return on sterling than on mark deposits. Any substantial fall in UK rates may thus have to await action by the Bundesbank.</p>

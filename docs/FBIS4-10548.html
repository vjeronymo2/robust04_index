			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Paulo Sotero] </F>   [Text] Guadalajara -- After meeting with the creditor bank  committee, Central Bank President Pedro Malan said on 12 April  he is "confident about conclusion of a debt agreement" on 15  April. The meeting was prompted by the banks' concern that  Kenneth Dart, a U.S. entrepreneur who bought 3.5 percent ($1.4  billion) of the Brazilian debt and who refuses to accept the  agreement's terms, may take action to prevent the conclusion of  the agreement.    Washington's Arnold &amp; Porter lawyers, a firm advising  the  Central Bank in the negotiations with the bankers, warned  Brazilian authorities about the possibility of Dart's trying to  obtain a preliminary court decision suspending the exchange of  financial certificates through which the agreement will take  effect. "We have several lawyers at work in New York," Michael  Degraderied said on 8 April. A Citicorp executive, Degraderied  chairs the bank committee. Citibank Vice President William  Rhodes said Dart will not be able to prevent the agreement.    Brazilian authorities do not believe Dart will attempt to  impede the deal's implementation. But the government has taken  several precautions because it has not ruled out the possibility  of Dart taking legal action after the agreement's conclusion. On  12 April, while issuing the Bank of International Settlements  (BIS) an order to transfer approximately $2.8 billion in U.S.  Treasury certificates -- which will serve as initial collateral  for the agreement, the Central Bank took care to prevent the  certificates from being seized by an eventual legal embargo.    In New York, Dart spokesperson Melissa Krantz said the  entrepreneur maintains his opposition to the agreement's terms.  In order to avoid problems, Brazilian Ambassador Paulo Tarso  Flecha de Lima consulted in Washington with the White House and  the State Department about the possibility of the Clinton  administration invoking the International Economic Emergency  Powers Act [preceding five words in English] if Dart attempts to  impede the agreement.    Dart -- In Brasilia, the Central Bank said that if Dart  refuses to participate in the exchange of bonds, it will issue a  regulation allowing the use of the old certificates being held  by Dart for the purchase of state-run companies.</p>

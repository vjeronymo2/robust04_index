			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SUICIDE STIRS FEAR OF ADDED HEALTH FUND CUTS  </P> <P> A group of doctors and counselors warned Thursday that Los Angeles County could  face more cases like the AIDS patient who committed suicide in a Mid-City  shelter earlier this week if the Board of Supervisors approves further drastic  cuts in mental health programs.  </P> <P> Claiming that the county has few facilities that can simultaneously provide for  both the physical and mental needs of AIDS patients, the mental health  advocates said that those gripped by AIDS-related dementia would be even more  at risk if the county proceeds with $41.9 million in funding cutbacks.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, as the county held hearings into the threatened cutbacks, an AIDS  patient at the Casa de Nuestra Senora shelter opened fire at staffers in the  residence and then at police, holding officers at bay for four hours before  firing a fatal shot into his head.  </P> <P> Shelter workers said later that the patient, Alberto Alvizuri, 34, had been  gripped by worsening toxoplasmosis and AIDS dementia and was about to be  transferred to a hospital.  </P> <P> "This tragedy could be repeated throughout Los Angeles County as we lose more  services," said Dr. Ann Brand, president of the Assn. of Community Mental  Health Agencies of Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Sally Jue, a mental health program manager at AIDS Project Los Angeles, added  that "when (AIDS patients) become dangerous, most AIDS hospices and shelters  are just not equipped to handle them."  </P> <P> Jue said that as AIDS patients have been able to live longer with advances in  medicine, her facility has begun seeing increased cases of serious dementia  among them. Studies have shown that between 80% and 90% of AIDS patients  experience some form of dementia over the course of their fatal disease, Jue  said.  </P> <P> As a result, any cuts in mental health funding would come at the worst possible  time, said Jue and other mental health advocates. Diane Bloom, director of  counseling for the Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, said that her  agency has seen a 25% increase over the last three months in the number of AIDS  patients coming in with "immediate crises."  </P> <P> "We're not a crisis unit, but we're becoming one," she said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors took steps to offset the projected mental  health cuts with $8 million in new utility and hotel taxes and pleas to local  cities to come up with another $30 million.  </P> <P> Soon after the meeting, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley rejected that request.  </P></p>

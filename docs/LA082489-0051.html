			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA COUPLE FASHION CEDAR 'HOMES' FOR LETTERS;  </P> <P> MAILBOXES FOR ALL TASTES, EVEN POST-MODERN  </P> <P> In an area where few can afford a home, Melody Cole's houses are selling faster  than she can slap on the shutters.  </P> <P> They're made of cedar and come with flowered wallpaper, plush carpeting, lace  curtains and a roof with shingles.  </P> <P> But you can't live in them -- they're mailboxes.  </P> <P> "I guess it's sort of like the American Dream," said Cole who, along with her  husband Jim, owns Mail Mansions in nearby Belmont. "It's taking a practical,  plain item that is usually not paid attention to . . . and making it into  something more enjoyable.  </P> <P> "It's another little embellishment that makes a house a home."  </P> <P> Five years ago, Cole quit her job as an office manager to devote herself full  time to Mail Mansions.  </P> <P> Working furiously in her garage-turned-workshop, Cole made about 500 mailbox  houses last year, worth $30,000 in gross sales to the small company.  </P> <P> Although her husband does the heavy sawing and cutting, Cole assembles the  parts and does all the sanding, painting and finishing work.  </P> <P> To make the mailboxes as authentic as possible, Cole paints flowers along the  borders and inserts real glass in the windows.  </P> <P> "You think of a big house, well, this is just a little house," Cole said.  </P> <P> The mail is inserted through the house's door, which has a tiny ceramic  doorknob and opens with a cuckoo clock hinge.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Personal Touches  </P> <P> The mailboxes come in five styles -- cottage, Victorian, barn, bungalow and  cabin -- but Cole personalizes them by matching paint, carpet and wallpaper to  the buyer's home.  </P> <P> For some customers, however, that's not enough. One ham radio aficionado asked  Cole to add a tiny antenna on top of his mailbox.  </P> <P> Another had a miniature light installed inside to match the lights in his  house.  </P> <P> When Heidi Maslen added a bay window to the front of her San Mateo house, she  wanted a mailbox to match. She ordered a Victorian-style mailbox and brought  her blue-gray house paint along to guarantee an exact copy.  </P> <P> "They're just so cute," Maslen said. "They're so different from the standard  black mailbox that you always see."  </P> <P> Since Cole has a bachelor's degree in theater arts from San Francisco State  University, she knows how to make a flat surface appear three-dimensional.  </P> <P> By sponge-blotting the wood red or gray, Cole can make the mailboxes look like  they're made of brick or flagstone. She then simply paints on the mortar.  </P> <P> Each mailbox takes about 12 hours to do, Cole said. They range from $45 to  $165.  </P> <P> But it's not the money that drives Cole. She said she enjoys making something  that is such a part of a person's daily routine.  </P> <P> "It's something that you visit every day," she said. "If you think about it,  you don't have that many things that you have such regular contact with as your  mailbox."  </P></p>

A demonstration  plant, which was capable of processing up to 5 t/d as dewatered  sludge, was operated at the condition of high temperature and  high pressure (300C, 10 MPa). As a result, about a half of  organic materials in sludge (48%maf) were converted into  heavy  oil and a quarter of the heavy oil synthesized (11%maf)  were  separated from the reaction mixture by high pressure  distillation. Heating values of the heavy oils distilled were  37-39 MJ/kg.    From the calculation of energy balance on a practical scale,  it was estimated that 1.5 t/d of separated heavy oil could be  produced as surplus energy through the treatment of 60 t/d of  dewatered sewage sludge.  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   In Japan most of sewage sludge has been treated by  incineration. However, the costs of conventional incineration  methods are high because of their high energy consumption.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop economical  solutions to the sludge disposal problem, and one of these may  be a direct thermochemical liquefaction.    American researchers have developed the direct  thermochemical  liquefaction of organic wastes, including urban refuse,  agricultural wastes and sewage sludge, with synthesis gas and  catalyst.[.sup]1[/] The direct thermochemical liquefaction of  sewage sludge without reducing agent[.sup]2[/] and  methodology of oil separation from liquefied sewage  sludge[.sup]3[/] have been reported. The authors have  investigated the liquefaction of sewage sludge under pressurized  inert gas around 300C and tested a pilot-plant (0.5  t/d).[.sup]4-6[/]    Based on previous studies, a demonstration plant of sludge  liquefaction was designed and constructed.  <H5>  Experimental </H5>   A demonstration plant is schematically shown in Figure 1.  This plant was capable of processing up to 5 t/d as dewatered  sludge, equivalent to the sewage treatment scale for about  20,000 people. In this plant, the dewatered sludge was liquefied  and distilled under the condition of high temperature and high  pressure. The sludge was charged into the injection tank, which  involved the piston in itself, by sludge pump. Then, the sludge  was pressurized by high pressure water and conveyed into the  reactor (indiameter 0.43 m, height 7.25 m) continuously by using  two of the injection tanks by turns. The sludge was pre-heated  by the vapor of the distillate product at the lower part of the  reactor and heated to a given reaction temperature by the heat  medium from electric boiler at the upper part of the reactor.  The pressure in the reactor was kept at a given reaction  pressure, which was set near the saturated vapor pressure of  water at the reaction temperature. The reaction mixture, which  was almost like a liquid, was distilled while high temperature  and high pressure was maintained. The distillate and the  reaction gas was cooled down at the cooler and depressurized to  atmospheric pressure by let-down valve 1. The distillation  residue was also depressurized through let-down valve 2 and  flashed into the flash tank. The vapor sprung in the flash tank  was condensed at the condenser and was recovered (condensate  product). The bottom products were also obtained from the bottom  of the flash tank.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-32A>      Figure 1. Schematic Flowsheet of the Demonstration Plant </FIG>     Each product recovered (distillate, condensate, and bottom)  was separated into three phases, that is, heavy oil, solid  residue, and aqueous phase by means of a solvent extraction. The  procedure of the separation is indicated in Figure 2. In this  work, the definition of heavy oil is dichloromethane soluble  material.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-33A>      Figure 2. Separation Procedure of the Product </FIG>     Operating conditions and profile of starting materials are  listed in Table 1. Distillate ratio was defined by equation (1).    Distillate ratio (-) = mass flow rate of the distillate/mass  flow rate of the sludge (1)       Table 1.

These  sludges had been dewatered by a belt press dehydrator after  adding a polyelectrolyte coagulant.

Organic material yield was defined by equation (2).    Organic material yield (%) = weight of organic  material in  each phase/weight of organic material in the sludge x  100 (2)       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

Solid  residue  was hardly contained in the distillate. This result means that  about a half of organic materials in sludge were converted into  the heavy oil and a quarter of the heavy oil synthesized could  be separated into the distillate without a contamination of  solid residue. The composition of reaction gas was mainly carbon  dioxide (above 99 wt%).    Figure 3 shows the relationship between distillate ratio and  distillable heavy oil yield. Distillable heavy oil yield  increased with distillate ratio. However, the increase of  distillate ratio may cause a plugging of the distillation  residue in the pipe. It was supposed that upper limit of  distillate ratio was 0.5.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-34A>      Figure 3. Relationship Between Distillate Ratio and Distillable Heavy Oil Yield </FIG>     The heating values of the heavy oils are given in Table 3.  The heating values of the heavy oils in the distillate indicated  higher than those in the bottom. In other words, the heavy oil  of superior quality could selectively be separated by  distillation from components of heavy oils.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.

The results are  illustrated in Figure 4. The capacity of the plant in this  estimation is 60 t/d as dewatered sludge, equivalent to the  sewage treatment scale for about 200,000 people. It can be seen  from Figure 4 that the sludge is treated without any auxiliary  fuel. Furthermore, 1.5 tons of heavy oil are produced as surplus  energy. This heavy oil can be available for boiler fuel or  another application. In conclusion, the treatment of sewage  sludge by this method could be sufficiently profitable.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-35A>      Figure 4.

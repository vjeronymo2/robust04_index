			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Saddam makes himself PM Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sacked his prime minister yesterday and took over personally as head of a new government to tackle a grave economic crisis, Reuter reports from Baghdad. The ruling Revolution Command Council (RCC) said the change was needed because of the 'unjust (UN) embargo and the need for special effort on economic issues to protect the living standards of the people'. Prime Minister Ahmed Hussein Khudayyir was sacked after the Iraqi dinar plunged to new lows. There were no other big changes in the cabinet, but it was reported that Mr Saddam would have three deputy prime ministers.</p>

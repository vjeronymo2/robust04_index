			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Bulgaria plans rationalisation of bank system BULGARIA is to form a bank consolidation company to privatise banking and merge scores of small banks into a core of a dozen or fewer large establishments, Reuter reports. Officials of the new Bulgarian Bank Consolidation Company (BCC) said rationalising the system was essential for economic reforms to succeed. 'Currently, shares of state-owned firms are part of the holdings of 78 small banks dispersed throughout the country. They have to be merged into eight to 12 banks,' BCC said, adding all these banks, with small authorised capital and no experience in free market economics, were trying to struggle on with outdated socialist methods. The privatisation is expected to take three years.</p>

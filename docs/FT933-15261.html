			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Empty pockets hit imported dream / Explaining what has gone wrong with the Euro wonderland One of the cinema commercials running in Paris this summer features Zorro, the black-clad knight, who gallops on his trusty steed through the EuroDisneyland theme park to slip a crystal slipper on to Cinderella's dainty foot. The commercial is part of a promotion aimed at encouraging Parisians to visit the theme park in the evening. But there is an element of wishful thinking in the script for Euro Disney, which is in deep financial difficulty and desperately needs a Zorro. The group, which lost FFr1.08bn (Dollars 180m) in the winter half-year, yesterday warned that it was still losing money in the summer months. Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European leisure analyst at Morgan Stanley, now forecasts a net loss of FFr1.9bn for the year to September 30 and a FFr1.1bn loss for next year. 'The only solution is to find further external finance.' The chief cause of Euro Disney's operational difficulties is the recession. The number of people visiting the park in the April-June quarter was 3.1m, roughly the same as in that quarter in 1992. This figure was slightly below expectations, given that the park did not open until April 12 last year, but not seriously so. However the apparently stable figure of 3.1m disguises a steep decline in foreign attendance. The number of British visitors fell by 50 per cent to 310,000 this spring, with Italian visitors down by 25 per cent to 93,000. Travel companies attributed the fall to the devaluation of the pound and the lira against the French franc after the September currency crisis, which has triggered an overall decline in bookings to France. Euro Disney has managed to compensate for the fall in foreign attendance by attracting more French visitors. The number of domestic trippers rose to 1.5m this spring, 50 per cent up on the previous year. But many were given discounts, thereby reducing ticket revenue. French visitors are also less likely to spend heavily on food and drink in the park, or to stay in Euro Disney hotels. This, combined with a new strategy of offering cheaper souvenirs and food at the park, depressed revenue from merchandise sales and catering. Spending by guests at the hotels also fell, despite a 10 per cent increase in occupancy levels to 68.5 per cent. The company blames these operational problems on the temporary pressures of recession. It argues they should recede when the European economy recovers. The new management team, headed by Mr Philippe Bourguignon, who took over as chairman last autumn, admits that the original concept for the park was too close to Disney's US parks to suit European taste. The subsequent changes in merchandising, catering, hotel pricing and marketing have been designed to address this. But it will be difficult for Euro Disney to assess the impact until the recession ends. In the meantime the chief concern is the company's finances. Euro Disney's operational difficulties last year were aggravated by high French interest rates, which raised its interest bill by FFr200m above budget. The recent falls in French rates have helped, but the level of net debt  - at about FFr21bn - is far higher than expected. This is due partly to the revenue squeeze and partly to a shortfall in anticipated capital gains - the weak Paris property market has forced Euro Disney to delay its property development plans. Since the start of this year the company has been trying to renegotiate the terms of its debt repayments and leasing arrangements. The negotiations have been complicated by the deterioration in Euro Disney's financial position. Analysts now suspect that the company not only needs to revise the terms of its present financial arrangements, but also to raise additional capital, either from the banks or from Walt Disney. The US parent has agreed to provide financial support for until next spring, when the refinancing is expected to be completed. In the meantime Euro Disney has put the second phase on ice while it 'reassesses' the project. This decision clearly makes short-term sense, as the company cannot afford expensive expansion. But the second phase was expected not only to provide additional revenue, but extra business for the hotels. A lengthy delay may mean that Euro Disney takes even longer to struggle back into profit.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 4 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong's  property stocks are set to hit new highs despite the 80 percent  rise in property stock prices since last August, according to  Salomon Brothers, one of the world's leading investment banks.    In its latest Hong Kong property equity research paper, the  firm said strong earning growth from the swift land price rises  and the steep rent hikes from 1993 onwards should combine with  the expansion in the sector's price/earning ratios to take stock  prices to new highs.    The paper, entitled "Major Re-Rating Awaits Property Stocks  in 1994", said the key drivers of the re-rating will be the  dissipation of the fear that Hong Kong will suffer from a mass  exodus of residents and capital ahead of 1997 and the  realization that the property market is well supported by strong  incomes that China has helped generate and is not an asset  bubble.    China is a major source of long-term opportunities for Hong  Kong property companies and not a source of political risk,  which pressures immovable assets like property, the paper said.    Another factor pushing the re-rating is that the market is  starting to accept a valuation paradigm that values certain  quality property stocks on an earning multiple basis, which  recognizes these companies as generators of long-term earnings.    Salomon Brothers, in the Asia Pacific region outside Japan,  has branches or representative offices in Bangkok, Seoul,  Singapore and Taipei, with the regional headquarters in Hong  Kong.</p>

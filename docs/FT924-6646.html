			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Public pay rises may be under 1.5% LARGE GROUPS of public-sector workers will have to accept pay rises of less than the government limit of 1.5 per cent if the automatic 'incremental' pay rises that some groups are entitled to eat into pay bills. The issue of increments has been raised with the chancellor by Mr Andrew Smith, a shadow Treasury minister. Treasury officials have confirmed that the 1.5 per cent increase assumes no overall increase in the incremental payments - usually related to seniority  -enjoyed by nurses, most teachers and some local government workers. In normal years there is virtually no overall increase in increments as higher-grade workers move out to other jobs. Public-sector pay experts such as Mr Chris Trinder, of the Public Finance Foundation, say, though, that during recessions there is less movement out of the public sector and 'incremental drift'. Mr Trinder calculates that such incremental drift usually consumes about 0.5 per cent of the pay bill. Cohse, the health union, decided yesterday to take a sounding of membership reaction to the 1.5 per cent limit with a view to calling for industrial action.</p>

This twin mistake would  be "an irresponsible, blind and crucial error" that "we will  surely pay for", he said, stressing that new international  security arrangements should offer no scope for "new walls or  old nuclear umbrellas."    "The future of security in Europe depends on the success of  the development of market economies in East Europe and along the  southern coasts of the Mediterranean," he said. If this process  should collapse, he warned, all attempts to "build up  institutions" or "enact diplomatic designs" are doomed to  failure because "stable democracies do not bloom amid declining  economies, growing unemployment and poverty."    The West should not take fright at the difficulties of East  Europe and the southern Mediterranean, he said, recalling that  just a few decades ago it was unrealistic to aspire to the  levels of stability and prosperity achieved by the West thanks  to the determination and cooperation of all Western countries.  "The disappearance of the Soviet Union may have given the  impression that this close cooperation is no longer  indispensable. That is a mistaken impression," he said.    Andreatta went on to warn against a growing "nationalisation  of security perceptions. Dangers, of a lesser intensity than in  the past but not necessarily less imminent, are perceived  differently in different capitals," he said, explaining that  this posed difficulties in presenting a common front, as had  proved the case regarding former Yugoslavia.    Another key concern expressed by the minister is that  "transatlantic relations should not return to conflictual  games." He hailed the successful outcome of the GATT  re-negotiation talks as a move in the right direction, but  called for a sort of arbitration court (along the lines of the  European Court of Justice) to rule on trade and legislation  disputes between the United States and the European Union.    Returning to his central theme, Andreatta drove home the  need  for a recognition that "economic factors have become a component  of security, and not merely one of its instruments. The new  world order we are trying to build, with less optimism but no  less enthusiasm than a couple of years ago, cannot ignore  economic considerations," he said, pointing up the importance of  the new Partnership for Peace with East Europe including  economic programmes. This, in turn, called for a deepening of  links between the European Union and East European countries, he  said, recalling the recent Italo-British proposal to extend  cooperation to the second and third pillars of the Maastricht  Treaty, regarding political and justice links.    As for the Mediterranean, Andreatta said that the creation  of  a single market spanning its northern and southern rims should  be one of the main international objectives of this decade. He  stressed the importance of Western assistance -- with the  security pay-off this can bring -- being in the form of "trade,  not aid. The best form of assistance we can give is access to  our rich markets," he said.    He rejected the charge of Russian ultra-nationalist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, that the West's assistance to Russia masked  "colonisation" goals, stressing that its aim was to "expand the  global market. Having stable and satisfied neighbours" would  then contribute to greater security, he reiterated.    Moving closer to home, he said that "the end of Eastern  Socialism must not be replaced by the end of Western Socialism,"  explaining that the role of government should be one of  "support" that however stopped short of "interference" in the  workings of the market.

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Opinions differ on effects of possible UK rate cut INVESTORS in the UK government bond market again steered clear of 10 to 15-year stock - regarded as the most likely target for the next gilt auction, details of which the Bank of England is expected to announce on Friday. Although the Conservatives' drubbing at last week's parliamentary by-election and local government elections sparked talk of interest rate cuts, opinions were divided on whether this would happen and what effect it would have on the long end of the market. The futures contract reflected this split, falling by more than a quarter but then retracing most of its steps. If a cut came, it was expected to be in response to weak economic news rather than as an immediate political measure. PUBLICATION of the French mini-budget, which contained no surprises, did little to move government bonds. The yield spread between French and German 10-year stock stayed at about 41 basis points, while the futures contract fell through the 117 support level. This may indicate some nervousness ahead of the Danish referendum. One economist said it served as a reminder that French bonds had not yet made it to safe haven status. The short end performed better on persistent hopes of interest rate cuts. German government bonds held up better than most other continental European stocks yesterday in quiet trading. Hopes of a significant cut in the repo rate by the Bundesbank today have been well damped down. Forecasts ranged from 2 to 7 basis points, taking the rate a sliver below 7.7 per cent. Again, Dutch government bonds outperformed bunds on the back of a strong currency and hopes of interest rate cuts. The biggest gains came in Denmark, where an opinion poll showed a strengthening lead for the Maastricht Yes vote. This undid the damage inflicted on the market on Monday by a weekend poll showing the opposite. THE BEARS prevailed again in the Japanese government bond market, pushing the yield on the benchmark No 145 stock due 2002 above 4.5 per cent for the first time since January. While there were underlying factors - the lapse in the yen's strength against the dollar, the buoyant stock market - the main explanations for yesterday's fall were weak demand and bearish sentiment. One way of looking at it, according to one economist, was that the 145 had been too expensive in the first quarter of this year and had now returned to last year's levels. The 145 underperformed the June futures contract, which closed in Tokyo at 107.85 after trading between 107.49 and 107.89. In London, however, there was an early sell-off, taking the contract down to 107.38 before it recovered somewhat. US TREASURY prices remained stuck in a narrow trading range despite a broadly successful afternoon auction of Dollars 16bn in three-year notes. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 103 29/32 , yielding 6.813 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 3/16 , to yield 3.791 per cent. With so much new supply coming to the market - on top of yesterday's three-year sale, an additional Dollars 34bn in 10-year notes, 30-year bonds and cash management bills will be offered later this week - investors and dealers were reluctant to trade in in advance of the afternoon auction. In the event, the sale went well. The offering was sold at an average 4.27 per cent yield, at the high end of expectations, and the issue was almost three times oversubscribed. Yet the auction failed to lift prices, probably because dealers and investors remained wary of buying large amounts ahead of the 10-year and 30-year sales.</p>

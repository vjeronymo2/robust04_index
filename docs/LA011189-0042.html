			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER, BABY REPORTED RECOVERING  </P> <P> A woman who was struck by a hit-and-run driver while crossing Interstate 5 near  the Mexican border was in fair condition Tuesday at Scripps Memorial Hospital  in Chula Vista, and her 10-month-old daughter, abandoned near the border, was  picked up by her father, authorities said.  </P> <P> Onecima Lopez, 30, was alert after having her left thigh bone, lower right leg  and right ankle repaired in surgery, a hospital spokeswoman said. Lopez is in  traction and may need further surgery.  </P> <P> Her baby, hospitalized after spending two nights in a sewer pipe near the  border, was picked up Tuesday afternoon by Theodore Lopez, a Los Angeles  resident who had never seen his daughter before, authorities said.  </P> <P> Sandra Lopez, sporting freshly combed hair and a new pink dress, was holding a  white, stuffed panda about the same size as she when her father came to pick  her up, said Mark Morelli, spokesman for Children's Hospital, where Sandra was  later transferred.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'She Looked Like a Doll'  </P> <P> "She looked like a doll, she really did," Morelli said, "Her dad, he was all  smiles. He hugged her and kissed her." The two are believed to be in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, U. S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said there  was a "good chance" that mother and daughter would not be deported.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Our correspondent, Khamene,  reports from Islamabad on the activities of the speaker of the  Islamic consultative Majlis on the fourth day of his visit to  Pakistan:    [Khamene] Continuing his visit to Pakistan, Mr. 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri, Majlis speaker, arrived in Lahore and attended a  ceremony in which more than 250 Pakistani scholars and spiritual  leaders from various Islamic sects, ministers, deputies, and  personalities from Punjab were present. In the ceremony, Mr.  Nateq-Nuri referred to the hostile attitude of America towards  Islam and Muslims and stressed: The Islamic community should set  aside factionalism and safeguard its vigilance and preparedness  in order to foil American ploys and conspiracies.    The Majlis speaker mentioned that the increasing trend of  support for Islam and pro-Islamic activity in various parts of  the world has petrified the enemies of Islam and particularly  America. He added: The world arrogance and the devourer America  design a conspiracy against the world of Islam and Muslims each  day. Under such circumstances, any person who causes discord  among Muslims, under any pretext, has betrayed God and is an  American lackey.    The Majlis speaker condemned oppressive measures and  aggressive acts which take place against Muslims in Bosnia,  Kashmir, and Palestine and said: America and arrogance do not  care who is a Shiite or a Sunni. It is enough for a person to  believe in prayers and the Qiblah to be killed or subjected to  assault.    He honored the memory of the Muslim Pakistani martyrs who  protested against the apostate Salman Rushdie and said: We must  expand unity among Muslims, shun sectarianism, and hold hands to  protect Islam and Muslims.    During the ceremonies, Mowlana Aslam Salimi, Pir Asef Ali  Shah Gaylani, Mowlana Abdolqader Azad and Mowlana Abdol Rashid,  who are among the prominent Sunni scholars of the Pakistani  Punjab, applauded the high status of Imam Khomeyni and praised  decisive stances adopted by the late Imam and the Islamic  Republic of Iran to confront problems faced by Muslims and the  world of Islam.</p>

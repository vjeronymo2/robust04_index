			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ALEMANY CHOOSES KELLER TO LEAD BOYS' BASKETBALL TEAM  </P> <P> Kurt Keller has been named to replace Rocky Moore as boys' varsity basketball  coach at Alemany High, said Alemany Athletic Director Dudley Rooney.  </P> <P> Keller, a former standout basketball player at Paso Robles High and Portland  State, recently completed a four-year playing career in an Australian  professional basketball league.  </P> <P> "We're real confident with his knowledge of the game and we think he'll adapt  well," Rooney said. "We need somebody who is a strong motivator and is  disciplined."  </P> <P> After posting a 12-35 record during two seasons at Alemany, Moore announced his  resignation in May. He will coach at Muir next season.  </P> <P> Rooney said Keller will need time to turn the Alemany program around.  </P> <P> "He's seen our players play and he has confidence that he's going to improve  our team," Rooney said. "We're not looking for miracles the first year. We're  looking for someone who's going to make a long-term commitment to improve our  program."  </P> <P> The position was initially offered to former Pius X Coach Mike Murphy.  </P> <P> "I really wanted to take it and they were super to me," said Murphy, who said  he would take the job but then reconsidered. "I decided I wanted to spend some  time with my two sons." SAM FARMER  </P></p>

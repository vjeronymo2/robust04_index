			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> STRIPPER-POLITICIAN IN TAIWAN SENTENCED FOR PORNO MOVIE  </P> <P> Hsu Shao-tan, Taiwan's stripper-turned-politician, was sentenced Friday to  three months in prison for making a pornographic movie, court officials said.  </P> <P> Under Taiwan law, sentences of less than six months can be settled by paying a  fine -- amounting in Hsu's case to only $310 -- instead of serving the time.  Hsu did not appear in court for the sentencing.  </P> <P> She admitted appearing in the movie but said the nude scenes were not of her  body.  </P> <P> Hsu narrowly lost a race for a seat in Parliament in December elections. She is  still awaiting judgment in another case brought after she took off her clothes  in front of the legislature.  </P></p>

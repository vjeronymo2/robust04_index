			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / International Company News: Maxus shares firm on settlement of insider suit SHARES in Maxus Energy, a Texas oil company, rose in New York yesterday on the news that Kidder, Peabody, the Wall Street investment bank, had agreed over the weekend to pay Maxus Dollars 165m to settle an insider-trading lawsuit that was due to go to trial later this week. The lawsuit was originally filed in 1987. It alleged that insider trading by Mr Martin Siegel, a former senior executive at Kidder, and Mr Ivan Boesky, the disgraced arbitrageur who was imprisoned for insider trading in 1988, forced Maxus' predecessor company, Diamond Shamrock, to pay too much in its 1983 takeover of Natomas, a San Francisco based energy company. According to Maxus, Mr Boesky used confidential information supplied by Mr Siegel, who at the time was acting as Kidder's adviser to Diamond Shamrock, to force up the price of Natomas just before Diamond Shamrock paid Dollars 1.27bn for the company. Under the agreement, which was concluded just three days before jury selection for the trial began, Kidder will pay Maxus Dollars 125m in cash, plus Dollars 40m in exchange for five-year warrants to buy 8m Maxus shares at Dollars 13 each. Both sides said they settled the lawsuit to avoid the cost and time of litigation. News of the settlement pleased Maxus investors, who bid up the stock Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 7 1/4 . The share price of General Electric, Kidder's parent, rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 75 3/8 . Kidder said the payment to Maxus would have no material impact on its business because the firm had already set aside reserves relating to the matter.</p>

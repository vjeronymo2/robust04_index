			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Death duty and Peps When I die, what will happen with regard to tax on my various personal equity plans? Will my beneficiaries - most likely my wife - have to pay the tax on: 1. All future capital gains and dividends from the date of my death; 2. All capital gains and dividends from the start of the tax year in which I die; 3. All capital gains and dividends retrospectively to the dates when each Pep was purchased? Upon your death, the personal equity plan, which is a scheme of investments, ceases to qualify for beneficial tax treatment, writes Barry Stillerman. As regards capital gains, your beneficiaries will take over the assets at probate value and will be subject to CGT on any increase in value from your death. The Pep holding will not attract CGT by reason of your death. The income from the assets in the plan will attract income tax from the date of your death. For example, if you were to die on September 30, you would be subject to income tax on any income up to that period. The executors pay tax on income during the administration period and, once the assets in your estate (including the Pep assets) have been distributed to the beneficiaries, they pay income tax on any future income received. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

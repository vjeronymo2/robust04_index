			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- China will implement  over 20 forceful measures in the near future to curb the state's  unemployment growth, which now stands at 2.6 percent.    One of the major counter-measures is to set up an  unemployment warning line, according to Zhang Xiaojian, head of  the Employment Department of the state's Labor Ministry.    The official said that the warning line will be determined  in  light of the jobless rate, mass layoffs and the economic targets  of various localities.    A special organ headed by the labor departments will be set  up in order to take charge of organizing counter-measures to cut  the unemployment rate.    Zhang revealed that the government will promulgate a series  of relevant laws and regulations for the purpose of supervising  or penalizing enterprises when they conduct illegal layoffs.    The enterprises should set up a declaration system for  releasing redundant personnel and have to pay placement fees  when conducting mass layoffs.    According to the official, the government will still issue  administrative orders to prevent enterprises from firing aged  working staff.    As for the enterprises whose assets cannot offset debts, yet  which are still hopeful of being rescued, the concerned  departments will help to pull them through difficulties, so as  to avoid bankruptcy and large-scale layoffs.    To help curb the growth of unemployment, the enterprises  have  to confine rural recruitment within strict limits and give  priority to those people who have lost their jobs.    Moreover, according to the official, the state will set up  unemployment insurance funds at central and provincial levels.  He said that when the unemployment rate in certain localities  surpasses the unemployment warning line, they may take advantage  of the central and provincial funds to make up for local fund  shortages.    As for the bankrupt enterprises, the concerned government  departments will ask the enterprises to appropriate special  funds out of their remaining assets as relief aid to the  unemployed staff.    Zhang, the leading official charged with resolving the  state's unemployment problem, attributed the serious  unemployment state to the radical transformation of economic  structures and the sharp contradiction of labor supply exceeding  demand.    Zhang expects the number of the unemployed to reach 5  million  by the end of this year. He stressed that it will be still  possible to contain the jobless rate within 3 percent.</p>

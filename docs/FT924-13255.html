			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound down on economy fears Sterling fell nearly four pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday as investors became increasingly concerned about Britain's deteriorating economic situation, writes James Blitz. The pound, like other currencies, weakened against the D-Mark after the Bundesbank decided not to alter its official rates at yesterday's fortnightly council meeting. But sterling's fall was mostly the result of bad economic news, including yesterday's rise in unemployment by 32,200 in September and the impact of the recent decision to close most of Britain's coal mining industry. The UK appears to be entering a new economic downturn and this has weakened the currency by 8 pfennigs in the last four days. The pound was at a high of DM2.54 on Monday, at a low of DM2.4579 in European trading yesterday, and closed in London at DM2.4620. At the height of the sterling crisis, investors were concerned that the pound was not supported by higher short-term interest rates. Mr David Cocker, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, believes that the markets are now placing a greater premium on a need to cut interest rates and boost economic growth. 'Sterling would dip 4 or 5 pfennigs on the back of a rate cut,' he says. 'But that would be it. The fall would be followed by good buying.' Mr Ifty Islam, a currency economist at BZW in London, disagrees. In his view, the government would take a big risk cutting rates in the current, highly nervous, climate. 'If the government had eased policy after yesterday's unemployment figure, the market would have seen this as part of a trend, pushing sterling towards DM2.30.' A UK government's decision over whether to cut rates has political as well as economic ramifications. A percentage point cut in UK base rate would take it below Germany's discount rate of 8.25 per cent, establishing a very firm break with German - and continental - policy at a time when the government is trying to ratify the Maastricht treaty on European Union. As Mr Cocker puts it: 'Norman Lamont would have to give up walking a tightrope between two policies.' The German central bank's decision depressed the dollar, pushing it about 1 1/2 pfennigs down on the day to a close in London of DM1.4470. September consumer prices were also bearish for the US currency, showing a modest 0.2 per cent rise overall, and implying that inflationary factors would not deter the Federal Reserve from easing interest rates. However, the jobless claims for the week to October 3 fell to 383.000 from 399,000 the week before, slightly better than forecast. This underlined perceptions that the Fed can afford to wait until after the US Presidential election before easing policy.</p>

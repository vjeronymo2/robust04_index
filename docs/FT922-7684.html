			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: Alive on Broadway / Review of the 'Tony' nominated New York musicals THERE MAY be hope after all for the American musical theatre. Rumors have circulated for years that it is slowly dying, overwhelmed by the British mega-musical, but a lively Broadway season indicates that perhaps it was merely hibernating. The big box-office hits this year, Guys and Dolls and Crazy for You, are American to the core, and this spring's most exciting new productions, Jelly's Last Jam and Falsettos, show the presence of talent that just might revivify the industry. This Broadway year (from May 1, 1991) started dismally, with only 10 new productions opening in the first 26 weeks (as opposed to 14 last year), but perked up considerably in its second half, with the opening of nine musicals and 20 plays. Theatre attendance this spring is at 82 per cent of capacity (last year it was at 70 per cent), and the League of American Theatres and Producers reports that this will be the most profitable season in Broadway history - box office grosses may top Dollars 285 million, up Dollars 18 million from last year. As the cost of producing on Broadway mounts, so does the importance of the Antoinette Perry ('Tony') Awards. Winning Tonys gives productions credibility to punters, and that means increased sales. This year's Tony award nominations were made on May 4; the Annual Tony Awards (the 46th) will be bestowed by the American Theatre Wing and the League of American Theatres and Producers on May 31 at the Gershwin Theatre. Jelly's Last Jam earned the most nominations - 11 - and was nominated in every possible category. Jelly's Last Jam is bookwriter/director George C. Wolfe (The Coloured Museum, Spunk)'s examination of the life and work of jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton (1891-1941). Unlike Five Guys Named Moe, which strings together Louis Jordan's music around the flimsiest of plots, Wolfe's musical is at once a celebration of Morton's music and a complex, adventurous investigation of the artist's life. On the eve of Morton's death, in a 'lowdown club somewhere's 'tween Heaven 'n' Hell', the mysterious Chimney Man (powerfully played by Keith David) takes Morton on a guided tour through his life, forcing Morton to face the hypocrisies - a light-skinned Creole, Morton called himself white and hated 'niggers' - and hubris - he claimed to have invented jazz single-handedly - which, Wolfe argues, hindered Morton's artistic and personal development. Jelly's Last Jam secures Wolfe's status as one of American theatre's most innovative auteurs. From the musical's first moments his energy and imagination blast through the theatre, with the Chimney Man's gripping invocation to the company's ecstatic 'Jelly's Jam' to his sly tweak of the cliched Big Entrance - Gregory Hines as Morton ascends slowly on a platform, back to the audience, and pauses just long enough to tantalise before he turns. Hines earned his fame as a tap dancer, and as the production's star, tap he must and does through Morton's life, which, unfortunately draws attention to Jelly's Last Jam's only major flaw - an uneven and sometimes inadequate book. The musical never reveals just what Morton's unique contribution to jazz was; the audience learns more about Hines's exceptional tapping skills than Morton's musicianship. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, particularly the women: Tonya Pinkins, as Anita, Morton's lover and business partner whose voice and presence make 'Play the Music for Me' a steamy highlight; Mary Bond Davis as Miss Mamie, in whose club Young Jelly (Savion Glover) first encounters Jazz; Ann Duguesnay as Morton' s Creole Grandmother; and Mamie Duncan-Gibbs, Stephanie Pope, and Allison M. Williams as the Hunnies, who function variously as Morton's backup group, bodyguards and musical tour guides. Though musical theatre aficionados have known about his work for years, mainstream recognition has evaded composer/lyricist William Finn. Broadway has not been ready for sung-through musicals peopled with 'homosexuals, women with children, short insomniacs, and a teeny-tiny band' and 'Four Jews in a Room Bitching'. Finn's finally made it to Broadway with a dream production of Falsettos - two of his 'Marvin Musicals' - March of the Falsettos and Falsettoland - presented as one evening. With Stephen Sondheim, Finn is pioneering the genre of music theatre, which uncovers plot thorough melody and lyrics, using little spoken dialogue. For his subject matter Finn looks no further than the world immediately around him; he displays the complexities, inanities and tragedies of contemporary life in a voice both screamingly funny and achingly honest. In the first act of Falsettos, Marvin (Michael Rupert) has left his wife for another man, but coming out is not a cure-all. He is still neurotic. Everyone in Falsettos is in therapy or a therapist. Mendel, Marvin's psychiatrist, ends up marrying Marvin's ex-wife, Trina. The second act moves from the late 1970s to 1981, and 'something bad is happening' - young men, including Marvin's lover Whizzer, are dying. From a lighthearted, even silly tale of an individual domestic situation, Falsettos becomes the tragically familiar story of a makeshift family gathered at the bedside of a formerly 'healthy young bachelor'. Aids is never mentioned by name, but it becomes Falsettos' unifying structure and the focal point of its characters' lives. Rupert, though a touch WASP-ish to be a perfect Marvin, sings the role beautifully, earning a best-actor Tony nomination. Stephen Bogardus, perfectly cast as the chiseled Whizzer, and Chip Zien, a loveably obnoxious Mendel, were overlooked in the best supporting actor category. Barbara Walsh, nominated as best supporting actress, gives a performance of remarkable depth and wit as Trina. Both Jelly's Last Jam and Falsettos are strong contenders for the Best Musical Tony. They still might lose out, though, to Crazy For You, a glitzy, hollow mish-mash of Gershwin hits which feels like a tired revival, and is actually a rewrite of the Gershwin's Girl Crazy, but has been placed in the Best Musical category because of a new book by Ken Ludwig. The remaining nominee in the Best Musical category - Five Guys Named Moe - is mismatched against its American competition. What seemed a delightful entertainment in the seedy charm of London's Theatre Royal Stratford East comes across as shallow and silly in the New York production, despite Cameron Mackintosh's laboured efforts to simulate the Theatre Royal's riotous atmosphere on Broadway. The pre-interval conga conspicuously ends up in 'Moe's' - the cafe-bar Mackintosh built onto the Virginia Theatre for just this purpose. The audience at Five Guys resented being force-fed fun. Guys and Dolls, this year's mega-hit, is a shoo-in for the 'Best Revival' Tony, as predicted or, more accurately, predicated by the New York Times. No amount of press hype, however, can disguise the emptiness of Jerry Zaks' production. Its various elements are good enough: the material, of course, is among the best of the genre, Tony Walton's sets and William Ivey Long's costumes are eye-catching, and the performers, particularly Faith Prince as a chirpy Miss Adelaide, Nathan Lane as Nathan Detroit, and Walter Bobbie as Harry the Horse, do nicely-nicely, thank you, but there's no driving inspiration behind this production and no chemistry between the characters. The entire effect is disunified, dispirited, and depressing.</p>

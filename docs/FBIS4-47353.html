			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Geotectonics Department Head, Geological </F> Sciences Institute, AN [Academy of Sciences] of Ukraine,  Academician Ivan Illich Chebanenko, Head, Geology and genesis of  Oil and Gas Deposits Department, Geological Sciences Institute,  AN of Ukraine, Doctor of Geological Mineralogical Sciences  Vladilen Oleksiyovych Krayushkin and Head, Laboratory of  Fracture Tectonics and Oil and Gas Capacity of Pre-Cambrian  Geological Structures, Geological Sciences Institute, AN of  Ukraine, Viktor Petrovych Klochko]    [Abstract] Ukraine's demand for oil and natural gas is  substantially higher than oil and gas production in the  Dnieper-Donets, sub-Carpathian and Crimea sub-Black Sea regions.  The situation can hardly change to the better if geological  surveying keeps concentrating along usual directions. The most  promising way is the use of nontraditional natural sources of  oil, gas and condensate first of all in deep Earth's crust zones  and zones of gas hydrate formation (GHF) under the Black Sea. In  the authors' opinion Ukraine has no other geological  opportunities. In 1985-1987 12 commercial oil and gas deposits  had been discovered on the northern board of the Dnieper-Donets  Depression (DDD). The authors assessed the size of oil and gas  reserves in those deposits using two different methods. Also oil  and gas were discovered on the DDD southern board. There are  also prospects for finding oil and gas deposits in Western  Ukraine. Another non-traditional and promising direction is  oil and gas prospecting in the astrobleme zone. There are six  known astrobleme zones in Ukraine. The third direction is  prospecting for and commercial use of subhydrate hydrocarbon gas  and hydrocarbon gas hydrates in the Black Sea. The three  proposed approaches should be viewed as additional to currently  used traditional geological prospecting methods. Tables 1,  references 9: 7 Russian, 2 Western.</p>

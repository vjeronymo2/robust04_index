			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Bulky prices for compact discs BRITISH and other European buyers of compact discs get a raw deal by comparison with music lovers on the other side of the Atlantic. Prices in Europe are about 40 per cent higher than in North America. While the precise size of the discrepancy depends on the exchange rates used for comparison, even the record industry admits that European consumers pay more. The issue has come to a head in the UK, where a parliamentary select committee last week finished public hearings on the subject. So far, the industry has failed to give a convincing explanation of why CD prices are so high. It is therefore welcome that Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, is considering referring the matter to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The source of the price discrepancy is still something of a mystery. The industry's argument that the costs of supplying CDs in the UK are higher than in the US does not ring true. On the other hand, no evidence has emerged of a cartel among either record companies or retailers. The most convincing explanation is that the industry, which is increasingly dominated by multinational companies, has segmented the global market into national ones. In doing so, it has decided that it can get away with charging more for the same music in Europe than it does in America. A price-fixing cartel is not necessary to achieve this because one company's music cannot normally be substituted for another's. Each title is therefore a mini-monopoly, at least where protected by copyright. Copyright law Copyright law also buttresses market segmentation by allowing record companies to ban retailers from buying CDs at cheaper wholesale prices in other countries. This ban on parallel imports enables the industry to maintain wide differentials in wholesale prices between the US and the UK, which are then reflected in retail prices. Market segmentation and price discrimination are not in themselves always against the public interest. Since record companies have a high proportion of fixed costs, it is impractical for them to price CDs at the marginal cost of producing them. Doing so would lead to bankruptcy and the industry is right to stress that profit is not a dirty word. Recoup costs To recoup the fixed costs - such as signing on and promoting artists - the industry has to charge a mark-up on top of marginal costs. Rather than charging the same mark-up for each customer, it may be more efficient to charge a higher mark-up for those who receive more value from the product. This argument provides some justification for the higher prices of CDs compared with cassettes despite their similar production costs: CDs are considered to be premium products because they last longer and sound quality is superior. But a similar argument cannot justify price discrimination between Europe and America, unless one argues that Britons and Italians derive more value from listening to music than Americans and Canadians and so should pay more to subsidise their transatlantic brethren. Market segmentation in this case works against consumer interests and the competition authorities should act to remove it. The best way of achieving this would probably be to follow the lead set by the Australian competition authorities which have concluded that the ban on parallel imports is against the public interest and should be outlawed from next year. Similar action in Britain would give record companies an incentive to cut their wholesale prices or face a flood of cheaper imports. If record companies wished to be imaginative, they might lower their prices even without such an incentive, as high prices may be stifling the growth of the market. Given that the average American buys 30 per cent more CDs each year than the average Briton, the industry might find that lower prices were compensated through increased sales.</p>

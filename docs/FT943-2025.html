			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: All-round increase lifts Bodycote 10.5% Increases in all divisions enabled Bodycote, the metal technology, packaging and textiles company, to announce a 10.5 per cent advance in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1994. The rise from Pounds 6.52m to Pounds 7.21m was struck on turnover ahead almost 10 per cent at Pounds 41.4m (Pounds 37.7m). The advance was underpinned by continued progress from the metal technology side and a turnround from the second half of 1993 in the protective clothing business. The metal technology division lifted profits by 8 per cent to Pounds 5.56m (Pounds 5.15m) on turnover of Pounds 22.8m (Pounds 21.2m). Mrs Claire Avery, company secretary, said the rise had been on the back of greater demand from the automotive and aerospace industries for Bodycote's 'hot isostatic processing' - hipping - a process which removes the porosity from metal. Mrs Avery said demand was growing in the UK and the US and that the group was developing the process to cope with larger components. EHCO-KLM, the protective clothing and uniforms maker, made profits of Pounds 880,000 (Pounds 629,000) on turnover of Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 12.7m). This represented a sharp improvement on losses of Pounds 118,000 in the second half of 1993, which included closure and redundancy costs. Stockpack, the contract packaging group, was now reaping the rewards of the group's recent investment. High-tech machinery was leading to smaller labour costs, Mrs Avery said. The industrial and general division, of which Stockpack is the main subsidiary, raised profits 9 per cent to Pounds 1.26m (Pounds 1.15m) on turnover up at Pounds 4.96m (Pounds 3.77m). Capital expenditure for 1994 is expected to match 1993's Pounds 15m, with most going to the metal technology side and Stockpack. Gearing is 'negligible'. The interim dividend is lifted 7.5 per cent to 2.15p (2p), payable from earnings per share of 8.28p (7.68p). The share price closed 6p up at 322p.</p>

			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Lonrho slips 8p amid loss of contract worries LONRHO'S share price fell by 8p to 115 1/2 p yesterday after the Financial Times reported that the international trading group is to lose control of UK import and distribution of Volkswagens and Audis from the end of 1993. The business accounts for more than a fifth of the group's worldwide turnover. Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's joint deputy chairman, said in a telephone interview that the FT report was 'inaccurate'. He said: 'We have not been advised by the factory that we are to lose control.' He told news agencies 'we would seek to renegotiate to extend the contract as we have done in the past'. Lonrho did not issue any official statement yesterday. Mr Spicer said on Tuesday that Lonrho did not reveal the financial performance of its individual subsidiaries. 'We must provide the information for our shareholders all at the same time on February 26, when we publish our annual report,' he said. Financial analysts were surprised to discover yesterday, however, that ahead of publishing its annual report Lonrho had already filed a return for VAG (United Kingdom), the subsidiary that runs the VW/Audi operations in the UK. It shows that VAG (UK) achieved a turnover (including related companies) of Pounds 1.02bn in the 12 months to September 30, 1991, an 11 per cent fall from 1989-1990. The subsidiary's pre-tax profit fell 11.1 per cent to Pounds 20.0m from Pounds 22.6m a year earlier, accounting for 9.7 per cent of Lonrho's total pre-tax profits of Pounds 207m. After-tax profit totalled Pounds 12.3m, but VAG (UK) paid a dividend of Pounds 14.8m to its shareholders.</p>

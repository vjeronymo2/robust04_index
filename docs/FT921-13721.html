			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / US Money and Credit: Treasuries fall victim to Wall St IS THE US Treasury bond market a victim of the current conviction on Wall Street that a strong US recovery is coming sooner rather than later? That would appear to be the case, given that bond prices fell for most of last week (Friday was the exception) as optimistic equity investors continued to push up the Dow Jones index. The US stock market has been on a roll ever since the Federal Reserve's one-point cut in the discount rate on December 20, but it is difficult to find evidence of recovery to explain easily the 12 per cent rise in the Dow Jones average that has come with the rally. It cannot be said that the raft of recent macro-economic indicators has provided a clear compass. Indeed, the only logical, albeit partial, explanation for the rally is that lower yields in money market funds and other instruments have persuaded investors to shift money into equities. The stock market has convinced itself, however, that a big US recovery is around the corner. And the bond market, which thrives on bad economic news, has been hit by a sell-off. The benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond declined last week, finally staging a comeback on Friday on the back of a reported fall in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for December and a decline in US industrial production for December. By Friday evening the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond stood at 7.60 per cent, up from 7.43 per cent a week earlier. The sell-off in Treasuries reached its peak last Thursday, when the declining price of the 30-year benchmark pushed the yield up to 7.67 per cent. The number that provides perspective on current trading is the 7.35 per cent yield that came just after the Fed's interest rate cut last December. Mr Philp Braverman of DKB Securities called many of the credit market's beliefs about an economic recovery 'an erroneous interpretation of misleading evidence'. The US economy, as Mr Braverman put it, 'is not in recovery - not in the fourth quarter, and certainly not in the first quarter'. Like others, the DKB economist feels the strength of the equity market (and the corollary weakness of the bond market) primarily reflects a portfolio shift of investment funds from debt because money funds and CDs pay much less than depositors and investors are accustomed to receiving. The declining money supply figures released last week also appear to reflect the shift out of money market funds by investors seeking higher yields on the back of the equity market's rally. One glimmer of hope for the bond market is the likelihood of a further easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, a move many think will come by mid-February. Fed policy is presently on hold, but several market watchers think Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, will support a modest further cut in the discount rate and the Fed funds target as more data shows the weakness of the US economy for the month of January 1992. On the other side of the equation, the bond market may be unnerved again by the election year package of tax cut plans President Bush will unveil in his State of the Union message. Few serious economists believe the tax cuts are likely to be approved in the short-term or that they will have a real impact on consumer spending for many months, but worries over the future impact of such cuts on the already bloated US budget deficit will almost certainly affect bond market sentiment. It looks, therefore, as though the Treasury market may be incapable of taking a firm view in coming months. The analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette reckon an eventual recovery in the second half of 1992 will push the yield on the 30-year bond up to 8.50 per cent, while the economy's weakness in the short-term outlook remains reasonably constructive. Economic data expected this week will include initial weekly jobless claims, which are likely to be up slightly. On Thursday, the release of figures on housing starts could offer a slight improvement on the previous month's 2.9 per cent fall in housing permits. Neither of these statistics will be compelling proof of much, and therein lies the problem. If the equity market keeps rallying - regardless of whether such a rally is warranted or not - investors in Treasury bonds could be in for a rocky ride.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)                             Last   1 week   4 wks   12-month   12-month                            Friday    ago     ago      High       Low  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fed Funds (weekly average)  2.00    3.63    4.00     11.00       2.00 Three-month Treasury bills  3.86    3.90    3.76      8.29       3.76 Six-month Treasury bills    4.01    4.00    3.95      7.70       3.95 Three-month prime CDs       4.12    4.07    4.30      7.17       4.01 30-day Commercial Paper     3.98    4.00    4.50      7.12       3.98 90-day Commercial Paper     3.94    3.97    4.20      7.02       3.94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Last        Change            1 week   4 wk.

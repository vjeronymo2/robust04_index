			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 12 Feb (AFP) -- Saturday night, Peruvian  President Alberto Fujimori said the country should close ranks  in defense of sovereignty in the face of a U.S. Government  protest note regarding a law that relinquishes to the military  justice system a case involving the abduction and murder of nine  students and a professor from La Cantuta University.    "The important thing is the sovereignty of states. Instead,  we should close ranks because Peru is a sovereign country; it  has been totally autonomous and independent since 28 July 1821,  and this independence must be maintained," the president said.    Friday, U.S. Ambassador to Lima Alvin P. Adams read a note  from his government to journalists. In his note, the ambassador  urged Peru to respect the autonomy of the judicial branch and  stated his interest that the people responsible for the "brutal  La Cantuta assassination" receive justice.    Fujimori said that in "Peru, the branches of the state are  independent." He said this during a brief television statement  while aboard the airplane that took him to Lima from the city of  Puno, in the extreme Andean south, where he dedicated some  community works.    Fujimori stated: "There are laws in other countries that  other countries do not find appropriate, as has happened in our  country."    The chief of state defended his position that the Army  personnel involved in the abduction and death of the nine  students and a professor from Lima's La Cantuta University in  July 1992 be tried by a military court, thereby avoiding "the  political handling some want to give this case." Fujimori  indicated that military justice will punish the guilty.    Legislation regarding the La Cantuta case was approved last  Tuesday by the government controlled Congress; on Thursday,  Fujimori announced it, and on Friday, the Supreme Court of  Justice penal bench confirmed it by a majority vote.    The law has been challenged by the victims' relatives, the  Peruvian opposition, most of the press, the Lima Bar  Association, and the National Human Rights Coordinating Board  because "it is contrary to the new Constitution as well as the  country's current laws."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf on 2 February  admitted that "we have not solved all the subjects inherited  from the authoritarian Argentina," as he commented on the  critical human rights report prepared by the Clinton  administration for the U.S. Congress.    Ruckauf said that "the report's contents are not worse than  other countries and above average for Latin America" since the  document "describes the progress attained from pre-existing  situations."    Ruckauf's cautious tone contrasted that of Foreign Minister  Guido Di Tella, who told CLARIN that the report "is totally  unjustified." The different tones used by Ruckauf and Di Tella  on the same subject are due to their different cabinet functions.    While Di Tella is concerned over the possible influence the  report might have in our relations with the United States,  Ruckauf is the official who has had to look after the cases  described in the document, like the attacks against journalists  Marcelo Bonelli and Hernan Lopez Echague. Besides, he deals  directly with the police in Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Cordoba  Provinces, which are directly questioned by the Clinton  administration.    Thus Ruckauf maintained that there is a tendency "since the  years of the dictatorships for the security organizations to  overlook the legal norms," but he added: "This has diminished  since the return of democracy and there increasingly is more  freedom and democracy year by year." [passage omitted]    Although the U.S. report emphasizes the government's respect  for human rights, Minister Ruckauf preferred to speak about  Argentine society. He said: "In any society there are problems  with the institutions' functioning, especially in a society like  ours that has 10 years of democratic life and where there still  are many authoritarian components."    Ruckauf said: "I am 49 and I cannot remember living in times  of freedom like the present. I do not think there is any kind of  action that has worsened any of the situations linked to  security in the country."    Meanwhile, in Tunis, an hour after meeting with PLO leader  Yasir 'Arafat, Di Tella said via telephone that "this does not  affect in the least" relations between Argentina and the United  States, nor Argentina's image with the First World, which seems  to be an obsession for the Argentine Government.    What is your opinion of the U.S. document, CLARIN asked Di  Tella.    "It is totally unjustified. For example, freedom of the  press  is totally respected; it is incredibly respected, I would say.  Just read the newspapers every day and see the criticisms we  must bear."    Don't you think the report mentions some known subjects like  the government's alleged influence in the Judicial Branch,  CLARIN asked.    "I think the institutions are working more than well. Of  course nothing is perfect and everything can be improved," Di  Tella said.    Di Tella added that these kinds of reports are "routine  declarations by the U.S. Executive Branch every year. This is  not the general U.S. opinion, according to the high-level  meetings I have held. For example, last week I met with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher and he did not tell me  anything about this."    For Di Tella, "those who prepare this kind of report are  second-rank officials who base themselves on extreme situations  and adopt absolute positions."</p>

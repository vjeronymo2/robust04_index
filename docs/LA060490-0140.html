			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SABATINI, CHESNOKOV JOIN THE RANKS OF TOP SEEDS STUMBLING IN FRANCE  </P> <P> The French Open, already bereft of half a dozen top tennis players through  early round upsets, lost another glamour player today when fourth-seeded  Gabriela Sabatini was upset by 11th-seeded Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia 6-4,  7-5.  </P> <P> It was the second year in a row that the 20-year-old Argentine was eliminated  in the fourth round at the French and the second year in a row that Novotna has  reached the quarters here.  </P> <P> Also out was men's eighth seed Andrei Chesnokov, beaten in an emotional  roller-coaster match on center court by Frenchman Henri Leconte. The 1988  runner-up, who needed a wild card to get into the tournament, held on for a  6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3 victory.  </P> <P> He goes in the quarters against another unseeded player, Jonas Svensson, who  upset 15th-seeded Guillermo Perez-Roldan 2-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2.  </P> <P> The defeats of Chesnokov and Perez-Roldan left Americans Michael Chang and  Andre Agassi as the only seeded players in their half of the draw. They meet in  the quarters.  </P> <P> Monica Seles was on her game today, playing near-perfect tennis over the final  11 games to breeze past Laura Gildemeister and into the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Down 1-4 in the first set and having trouble controlling her two-fisted shots,  the 16-year-old second seed suddenly seemed invincible as she put Gildemeister  away 6-4, 6-0.  </P> <P> Sabatini is one of the biggest names in tennis but has reached just one Grand  Slam final and never has won one. Her frustration continued on the Paris clay.  </P> <P> Novotna eased through the first set and was up 2-0 in the second when she  twisted her left ankle. After courtside treatment, the Czech broke for 3-0 and  went up 4-0 on serve.  </P> <P> Sabatini saved two match points in the seventh game and started a  mini-comeback, breaking for 5-3 and 5-5. But Novotna broke back for 6-5 and,  after saving a break point with a forehand winner, won the match when a  Sabatini backhand hit the letcord.  </P> <P> "I played my best match of the year. I played very smartly," Novotna said.  "Today I felt stronger on the important points."  </P> <P> The Czech also said Sabatini let up a bit when she thought her opponent was  hurt. Sabatini, who has been questioned in the past for her mental toughness,  said she never tried to ease the pressure.  </P> <P> "When I am in that position, I try to move the player and find the right  angles," she said. "I think it was a bad day for me. I don't think I should  lose to her. It is a very big upset because I thought I was going to do much  better in this tournament."  </P> <P> Leconte pulled off perhaps the biggest upset since the first-round eliminations  of top seeds Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker. Chesnokov was a legitimate  contender for the title and Leconte was lucky to be here at all, his ranking  slipping to 161st in the world earlier this spring.  </P></p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Architecture: Stonehenge, danger major road ahead - Colin Amery backs the suggestion by Jocelyn Stevens that a tunnel should run under the famous monument Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage, is much too good to go. He is rumbling and threatening to resign if the Department of Transport goes ahead with plans for a new major road close to the site of Stonehenge. He is right to be angry with the short sightedness and folly of the DoT. Stevens has incredible enthusiasm for his job and he has galvanised much of English Heritage into greater efficiency. When it comes to Stonehenge, he and the National Trust (which owns much of the site) have taken their time to realise how terrible the present situation is for visitors and for the reputation of archaeology in England. If you attempt to visit the stones today you will see the ugliness of the car park, the closeness of the roads and the sheer unpleasantness of the tunnel approach to the site. The stones themselves are isolated as if in a concentration camp and surrounded by a high wire fence. The public accounts committee of the House of Commons condemned the presentation of Stonehenge as, 'a national disgrace' and ever since the stones were placed in the care of English Heritage in 1984 ways have been sought to improve things. Stonehenge is one of the world's most important prehistoric sites and has been recognised by Unesco as a World Heritage Site. There are more than 450 archaeological monuments within the boundaries of the site and in the years 3000 BC to 1200 BC the area was filled with settlements, tombs, and sites where the flint industry thrived. The ritual elements of the landscape are now the most visible and fascinating things about the area. They deserve to be treated with immense respect and dignity. Jocelyn Stevens is an ebullient showman and he has become something of a convert to the excitement of archaeology. He now realises Stonehenge could become a 2000 acre prehistoric park that could easily become an international tourist attraction of even greater significance than it is now. It is the real thing, not a Jurassic Park or Disney recreation. All this would be ruined by a major new road. As an alternative English Heritage proposes a radical solution. The Stevens plan is for a 2.8 mile twin bore tunnel beneath Stonehenge. This would allow the removal of all roads that damage the site. It would also create the opportunity for a large visitors' centre near Amesbury and a small railway, which would carry visitors to the 'sunken observation and interpretation centre', from where they would be able to wander freely among the stones in a landscape disturbed only by sheep. Money is the uncertain factor in the debate. The tunnel could cost up to Pounds 200m so the DoT has proposed an alternative northerly route that takes the A303 through Ministry of Defence land at Larkhill. That is expected to cost Pounds 30m. Because this road passes close to an ammunition dump and the officers mess of the Larkhill Garrison it has been partly re-routed so it now impinges on two other crucial archaeological sites. Stevens thinks that this route is not the answer - only a proper tunnelled road can ensure that Stonehenge is seen in a timeless setting, free of the detritus of the 20th century. How successful the campaign for the tunnel will be depends upon the outcome of a conference that is being held in London this week (Stonehenge - The Great Debate - July 8, Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre) where international experts will explore the monument's future. Stevens is determined to put the DoT on the spot. The minister, Steven Norris, will face several learned professors in road economics and engineering, including world experts in engineering tunnels. Proponents of the tunnel believe the debate will show that the costs of a short tunnel will be much less than government estimates. Stevens is optimistic that the visitors' centre, near Amesbury, will generate considerable income from shops and hotels. It is doubtful that it will pay for the tunnel, but private enterprise has to be involved and the possibility of a toll tunnel cannot be ruled out. Can Stevens succeed in selling to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Transport his vision for Stonehenge? It is a potent vision - a gloriously peaceful park dedicated to the mysterious rituals of the great stones. If the road lobby wins, I suspect that the nation will feel that Stevens is right when he says that if the government sanctions a low-cost, destructive road we will know that 'nothing is sacrosanct'. Not even Stonehenge.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hanson shows accelerating growth - Underlying profits increase gathers pace to 19% in second half Hanson saw an accelerating improvement in operating profits in the year to September 30, with an underlying increase of 8 per cent in the first half, rising to 19 per cent in the second. UK profit growth of 14 per cent slightly outpaced Hanson Industries in the US, which showed a 12 per cent improvement excluding Quantum. Profits at the Peabody coal business in the US more than doubled to Pounds 144m (Pounds 70m) following the settlement of its costly strike, which cost Pounds 76m (Pounds 125m). Last month, Peabody paid Exxon Pounds 230m for two low-sulphur coal mines in Wyoming, which will help boost production by 50 per cent this year. Three-quarters of its production is now low-sulphur coal, where prices are expected to firm over the next few years. Because of new clean air legislation Hanson expects the price of high-sulphur coal to decline gently, falling by between Dollars 1 and Dollars 2 a tonne this year. There was strong growth from the Beazer US aggregates business, where profits jumped 59 per cent to Pounds 48m, and a third record year at Cavenham forest products, with profits up 9 per cent to Pounds 116m. However, average timber prices tailed off in the second half, partly due to slower housing starts, and Cavenham is expecting slightly lower profits this year. The main downturn in the US was at SCM Chemicals, the world's largest producer of titanium dioxide pigment. Although sales were up 5 per cent to Pounds 615m, profits fell 18 per cent to Pounds 71m as prices slid 2 per cent. This reflects new capacity at Du Pont and SCM itself, together with the lingering effect of recession. But prices appear to have bottomed with Du Pont, the market leader, posting an increase from January. With the industry still operating at under 90 per cent capacity, a sharp recovery is not expected, but SCM is predicting steady improvement for the rest of the 1990s. Most of the smaller US businesses performed well. Ertl, the toy maker whose planned flotation has been shelved, increased its contribution by 39 per cent to Pounds 20m, but profits at Grove Crane nearly halved to Pounds 12m. In the UK, profits growth was driven largely by ARC aggregates, which was up by nearly two-thirds to Pounds 69m thanks to a sharp increase in margins; and Hanson Brick where profits rose more than 40 per cent to Pounds 23.5m. With shortages appearing in certain areas, the company is taking some brick kilns out of mothballs. After a flat first half, Imperial Tobacco turned in profits up 7 per cent to Pounds 328m despite an estimated 3.8 per cent decline in the market. Imperial increased its market share by 1.3 points to 36.8 per cent and pushed through a price increase in April. It believes that price and duty rises are now having less impact on volumes because the market has 'hit the hard core smokers'. Hanson raised more than Pounds 945m from disposals in the year helping to reduce debt from Pounds 3.4bn to Pounds 2.3bn. Gearing was cut from 86 per cent to 51 per cent, but has since risen to 58 per cent following the purchase of the US mines and Scholes in the UK.  ------------------------------------- MAIN CONTRIBUTORS TO OPERATING PROFITS  -------------------------------------                        93-94     92-93                     Pounds m  Pounds m  ------------------------------------- Coal Mining              144        70 Chemicals                220       115 Tobacco products         328       307 Aggregates               117        73 Forest products          116       106 Group total            1,232       978  -------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / FIS boycotts Algeria's crisis talks - but not the talking: The outlawed fundamentalists' continued contacts Talks aimed at finding a solution to Algeria's political crisis will open in Algiers today but one of the country's key political forces, the Islamic Salvation Front, will not be there. The FIS, which was outlawed two and a half years ago after the suspension of elections it looked certain to win, decided to boycott the talks in spite of the decision last week by Gen Liamine Zeroual, head of state, to transfer the party's two paramount leaders, Mr Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj, from prison to house arrest. Nonetheless, contacts and discussions between the fundamentalist leaders and senior generals have never been so numerous. Most take place behind closed doors, indeed behind prison gates, in and outside of Algeria. FIS leaders are insisting on a number of conditions before their party joins the talks, which will be attended by five smaller political parties. However, Mr Rabah Kebir, the spokesman for the exiled leadership, based in Germany, has suggested Mr Madani might be prepared to call a ceasefire before all conditions are met. FIS leaders first want a meeting of the party's ruling council, the Majlis Es Shura, and to consult leaders of the Islamic Liberation Army (AIL) which owes allegiance to the party. 'We do not wish to create difficulties for President Zeroual,' Mr Kebir said at the weekend, 'but each party to the negotiation must be able to hold meetings in order to represent their side.' It is 'not easy' to conduct consultations, he added, when the telephone used by Mr Madani and Mr Benhadj is 'controlled'. The fundamentalists say a key precondition to such a meeting is the lifting of the ban on the FIS. The state of emergency would have to be lifted and a general amnesty proclaimed. The army would have to return to barracks. To ensure such conditions are met, a 'neutral' government should be formed to oversee a transition period necessary before new elections are held. This is a tall order for the army's senior commanders and is unlikely to be met in full. The past two weeks have, however, already profoundly modified Algeria's political landscape. The two heavyweight players in the drama which, since January 1992, has claimed at least 11,000 lives, have publicly recognised the status of the other as a valid interlocutor. Dialogue, if and when it accelerates, is unlikely to spell the end of violence. The FIS will not have been surprised by the total opposition to talks expressed by the hardline Islamic Armed Group (GIA), many of whose leaders were trained in US-run camps in Peshawar, Pakistan, and went on to fight Russian troops in Afghanistan. Mr Cherif Gousmi, the GIA leader, is opposed to any 'truce or dialogue with a renegade government, to the very idea of democracy and all those who argue in its favour'. Opposition to talks has also come from Mr Redha Malek, the former prime minister, who said the release of the FIS leaders was a 'huge unilateral concession which put the republic in danger of death'. Mr Malek, who brokered an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, was sacked soon after Gen Zeroual took office last winter. Mr Malek's views are shared by groups within the country which have defended women's rights and, what is more important, by a number of senior officers. Some are bitterly opposed to the ideology of the FIS, others fear the loss of the many privileges a state-controlled economy has afforded them since independence in 1962. Many have been forced to participate in human rights abuses that they are deeply ashamed of, and feel betrayed by their elders. All parties to the conflict have resorted to methods which in Algeria remind many of the violent fight for independence from France between 1954 and 1962.</p>

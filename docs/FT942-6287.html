			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Canada slightly easier in search for direction Toronto stocks finished a lethargic session slightly lower after the market had searched in vain for direction. The TSE 300 composite index slipped 8.2 to 4,320.7 and declining issues outscored advances by 353 to 283. Volume dropped to a mere 26.1m shares from Friday's 60.9m and trading value was down to CDollars 209.8m from CDollars 636.7m, reflecting the holiday closures of the US and UK markets yesterday. Inco, off CDollars 1 1/8 at CDollars 35 5/8 , said the company and the union representing its hourly-paid Ontario employees have reached a tentative agreement for a new three-year contract. Aber Resources jumped CDollars 2, or 37 per cent, to CDollars 7 3/8 as it reported good initial results from a diamond discovery in the arctic.</p>

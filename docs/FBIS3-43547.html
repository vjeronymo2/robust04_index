			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, cabinet  ministers, and parliamentarians have awarded themselves salary  increases ranging from 30 to 64 percent, backdated to last July.    A report from Harare said this was the first increase in  salaries of the president and his ministers since 1992, when all  increments were suspended due to a severe drought that left half  the country's population of 10 million dependent on imported  food. Mr. Mugabe got the largest increase of 64 percent,  pushing his annual salary to 17,560 U.S. dollars, plus housing  and other allowances of 6,829 dollars a year. An average  Zimbabwean worker is paid about 900 dollars a year. Mr. Mugabe  also does not pay income tax. Mr. Mugabe's two vice-presidents  received 60 percent increases and sharply increased housing and  general allowances.    Ministers received a 30-percent increase in salaries, plus  allowances which rose by nearly 90 percent, while the salaries  of Members of Parliament were raised by nearly 50 percent.</p>

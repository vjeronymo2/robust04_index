			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Attention moves on to Little Rock Wall Street US SHARE prices remained in easier vein in light trading yesterday as investors awaited new data on the economy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the finish the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 11.88 at 3,292.20, its low for the session and the first time the index has closed below 3,300 in 10 days. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was off 0.89 at 432.84, while the American SE composite eased 0.82 to 392.56 and the Nasdaq composite gave up 1.06 at 654.73. Turnover on the New York SE amounted to 187m shares and declines outnumbered rises by 982 to 817. Trading was relatively subdued at the start, with dealing at some firms affected by the continued clean-up following the severe storm that struck New York on Friday and over the weekend. On the economic front there was nothing new for investors to chew on with all the upcoming data - on auto sales, business inventories, industrial production and jobless claims - due out later in the week. This meant that attention switched to Little Rock, Arkansas, where President-elect Clinton was holding his two-day economic summit for business leaders. Although the summit was being closely watched by investors for any hints at the likely direction of future economic policy, analysts did not expect much that was new to come out of the meetings. General Motors slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 as union leaders prepared to unveil an early-retirment plan that will allow the financially strapped motor manufacturer to lay off thousands of workers. The two other big car companies were in mixed form, with Chrysler Dollars  3/8 higher at Dollars 32 3/8 but Ford Dollars  3/8 easier at Dollars 42 1/4 . Harley-Davidson fell more than Dollars 1 early on, but picked up to end Dollars  1/2 down at Dollars 35 3/4 after the motorcycle manufacturer said it would record a reserve of Dollars 5.5m in the fourth quarter to cover costs from two product recalls. PSI Resources firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 19 1/8 in turnover of more than 1m shares on news of a pact to merge PSI with Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric into a new corporation though a conversion of stock. Cincinnati G &amp; E dipped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 23 3/4 . Glacier Water, which warned late on Friday that its earnings for the full 1992 year will be 11 per cent below the 62 cents a share it originally projected, dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 10 1/4 on the American Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq market, leading stocks were mixed. Biogen, which rose sharply last week on hopes of higher earnings, climbed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 48 1/4 . Canada THE Toronto market stayed put for most of the session before ending slightly lower. The TSE 300 index was off 5.5 at 3,262.0 and declining issues led advances by 330 to 281 after volume of 37m shares. Banking shares were mainly firmer, bolstered by a round of prime lending rate cuts by several major Canadian banks to 8 1/2 per cent from 8 3/4 per cent. A group of investors led by Mr Leland Verner, a Toronto businessman whose family formerly owned Jordan Wines, is proposing to make a CDollars 20 a share bid for TG Bright. Jordan Wines is now part of Bright, whose 'A' shares gained CDollars 2 1/2 at CDollars 17 5/8.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: NORMAN KEEPS ON STORMIN'  </P> <P> For golf, it was the worst news since the word came Hogan couldn't putt any  more, Palmer was turning gray and Nicklaus was building courses instead of  dismantling them with a one-iron.  </P> <P> Golf is a game that doesn't need square grooves, courses with railroad ties all  over them or even trick games made for television. Golf needs stars. Without  them, the game is headed for the deep rough.  </P> <P> That's why the game was ready for smelling salts at the published report that  Greg Norman -- Greg Norman! -- was going to have to quit tournament golf. For  the game, it had all the dismaying effect of a ball in the water on the 72nd  hole of the Open. Golf's gonzos from Deane Beman to the heads of networks and  cable operators gazed at the report with all the horror of a guy who just found  a rattlesnake in his hip pocket.  </P> <P> Golf can ill afford to lose a player of Norman's magnetism. He has what  Hollywood used to call "star quality." No one ever looked out at a golf course  and said, "Which one's that?" when Greg Norman went by. You may not be able to  tell David Peoples from Peter Persons, may get mixed up between Ken Green and  Billy Ray Brown or not know whether it's Dan Pohl or Don Pooley, but no one  ever mixed up the Great White Shark with the minnows.  </P> <P> Charisma comes in many forms. Ben Hogan had it in the sheer relentless drive --  a grim, dogged pursuit of perfection, stalking the game of golf as if it were a  dangerous animal he had to bring to bay. You got goose pimples when Hogan came  down a fairway a shot behind and the ball sitting prettily where it usually  sat, in the exact center of a par-five fairway.  </P> <P> The young Arnold Palmer was as exciting as Cagney with a machine gun in a gang  war. Arnold brawled with the golf course. Arnold made a two or a 12 with the  same reckless, go-for-it fervor of a guy jumping through a skylight. Jack  Nicklaus treated a golf course with the disdain normally reserved for your  inferiors. He taught it its place.  </P> <P> Norman is as exciting on a golf course as Dempsey with his man on the ropes or  Joe Montana with a man open in the end zone. There's no defense to his game.  Like Palmer in his prime, he goes for a two. He's never tried to par a hole in  his life. He never hits the safe shot. A case in point was this year's British  Open. Norman, trailing the eventual winner, Nick Faldo, by two shots came up to  the 12th hole in the third round. Faldo slapped his drive over in the deep  gorse. He looked like a double-bogey, at least. Norman's play, then, was to hit  a nice conservative bunt out into the fairway, make his sure par and, perhaps,  tie up the British Open.  </P> <P> Not our Greg. The Shark reared back, took his full 360-degree slide into the  ball -- and knocked it way out into the ozone and into a fairway trap. The last  place he wanted to be. He dissipated his advantage -- and his opportunity to  win the Open. A longtime Norman-watcher in the press room sighed. "God couldn't  have reached down and gotten Greg to swing easy," he admitted. "Not even if He  grabbed the club."  </P> <P> This sort of derring-do is good for a game in which the goal seems to be to  amass money, not victories. But Norman plays for twos, not seconds.  </P> <P> So, when the British news service this week reported that Norman was thinking  of calling it a career because of a wrist injury, golf needed smelling salts.  </P> <P> Norman has a wrist injury, all right. The facts are, he's had it since he was a  teen-age rugby player in Australia. He's played with it all his life.  </P> <P> "I aggravated it when I hit a rock at the 10th hole on the second round at the  Open in Brookline in '88," Norman recalled as he stood on a practice tee at  Sherwood Country Club the other afternoon, getting ready for his annual Ronald  McDonald Children's Charities tournament, an event that pits the 20 of the most  celebrated players in the game against each other in team competition.  </P> <P> "Almost every golf shot I've ever hit, I feel pain," he admitted. "I had a bone  scan and a CAT scan. The cartilage and ligaments were torn, and I'm always  going to have it. There's some arthritic growth and scar tissue, but there's  nothing operable that will help.  </P> <P> "But I have no intention of quitting golf."  </P> <P> It's something you learn to live with. You and I live with a slice or a  spasmodic putting stroke. Norman lives with a wrist throb at impact.  </P> <P> Norman has won nine tournaments on the American tour and 58 others around the  world, including the 1986 British Open and every tournament of note on the  Pacific Rim.  </P> <P> But Norman is almost as famous for the tournaments he didn't win. He lost the  1986 PGA when Bob Tway chipped in -- out of a sand trap -- over his head on the  final hole at Inverness. He lost the 1987 Masters when Larry Mize chipped in  over his head on the second playoff hole. He lost the 1984 U.S. Open in a  playoff to Fuzzy Zoeller. He lost the 1989 British Open in a playoff to Mark  Calcavecchia. He's good. Just don't call him Lucky.  </P> <P> Only a Greg Norman of today's tour players could bring off a Ronald McDonald  tournament where 80 selected sponsor-players pay $20,000 to the charity for the  privilege of playing two rounds with the world's greatest 20 golfers. No other  player today rates that kind of identification.  </P> <P> His tournament is a mixed bag of team play with the legendary likes of Jack  Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Raymond Floyd, Hale Irwin and Chi Chi Rodriguez  trading scrambles and best balls against the more contemporary opponents such  as Curtis Strange, Mark O'Meara, Mark Calcavecchia, Wayne Levi, Ian  Baker-Finch, Ben Crenshaw and Lanny Wadkins.  </P> <P> You can see why the game hopes the Shark continues to play with pain for years  to come. Besides, it evens the odds a bit for the rest of the field.  </P></p>

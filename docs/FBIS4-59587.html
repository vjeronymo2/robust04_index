			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 14 May (INA)--The Political Bureau of the  Kurdistan Revolutionary Party has condemned the mass  annihilation scheme whose dirty chapters are being implemented  by agents Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani against our Kurdish  people.    In a statement, the party called on the honorable Kurds--the  descendants of Salah-al-Din--to close their ranks, escalate  their daily struggle, and to trigger the spark of a major,  comprehensive popular uprising in Kurdistan against the  murderous agents of foreigners and to liberate Kurdistan from  their filth.    The party called for putting an end to those reckless,  criminal murderers' encroachments against the Kurds' rights,  property, and souls and to evict them from the cities to the  mountains and valleys, where they can fight each other like  hungry wolves and settle scores any way they want. The lives of  innocent children, women, and elderly people, whose only fault  is that they live under the control of those gangs, should be  maintained. The party appealed for evicting those beasts to the  mountains and valleys.</p>

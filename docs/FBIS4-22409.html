			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Georgian Republic Foreign Affairs Minister </F> Aleksandre Chikvaidze: "`It Was No Easy Task...'":]    [Text] On 3 February, a Georgian delegation headed by  Foreign Affairs Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze returned from UN  Headquarters in the United States. Even though the minister  immediately joined in the events of Boris Yeltsin's official  visit, the extreme importance of the issue made this interview  essential.    [Question] Batono [polite form of address for males]  Minister, what was the specific purpose of the Georgian  delegation's visit to the United States, and what difficulties  did you have to overcome to accomplish it?    [Chikvaidze] You will recall that on 1 February the mandate  of the UN observer mission in Abkhazia was running out, and so  the basic task was to extend it, which would necessitate further  participation by UN and international institutions, without  which any implementation of peace-keeping operations would be  ruled out.    [Original text missing or illegible except for phrase  fragments] ...the Abkhazian side... an attempt to settle  outsiders, which will make it easier for them to excuse their  crime by a future referendum. Dismissing the [?agreements]  reached earlier concerning the repatriation of the refugees, the  separatists again imposed several preconditions. As a result,  any practical results from the latest Moscow meeting became  doubtful. It was essential, therefore, once more to gain the  international community's recognition of the principle of  Georgia's territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders  and, along with raising the question of the safe and  unconditional repatriaion of the refugees,... ...the results of  a referendum.    [Many of the following lines are illegible except for phrase  fragments] Immediately on arriving in America we met UN General  Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the UN's Political Department  leaders, members of the Security Council, and member country  representatives. Our comments were taken into account in jointly  formulating a draft resolution.    Despite international support for Georgia (a "Friends of  Georgia" group has been formed, consisting of the United States,  France, Great Britain, Germany, and Russia), all this was no  easy task. According to the UN's own procedures, it takes at  least 24 hours to make amendments to resolutions, and within  that time every representative of the Security Council has to  contact his country's capital, define its position and receive  the necessary instructions, after which consultations are held  and only then can the resolution be adopted. But time was too  precious... We got the information about the Moscow meeting from  Tbilisi on the evening of 30 January, but the session of the  Security Council was scheduled for 31 January, and it was  necessary to prepare a practically new draft of the resolution  that had already been agreed on. Victory was won by our  permanent mission to the UN, and all its members, under the  leadership of Petre Chkheidze. We worked 24 hours, using  everything we could--old and new paths and personal contacts.  Fortunately, we achieved what we wanted and needed.    [Question] Batono Aleksandre, what about the resolution  specifically?    [Chikvaidze] I would single out several important items in  the resolution, in particular the UN observers' mission and  peace-keeping forces, Georgia's territorial integrity and  inviolability of its borders, and the refugees.    The resolution expands the mandate of the UN observers'  mission and extends it until 7 March 1994. In addition, the  number of observers is increased to 88. And, after the third  round of talks planned for 22 February, the General Secretary,  on instructions of the Security Council, is to immediately  present information on the circumstances which necessitate the  deployment of peace-keeping forces in the conflict zone, along  with an appropriate, concrete plan.    But the picture will be incomplete unless one very important  reality is taken into account. You know that the Georgian  delegation, headed by Batoni Jaba Ioseliani, has already had  successful talks with the Abkhazian side in Geneva on two  occasions. The fact is that the groundwork has been laid for new  and qualitatively different principles. Nevertheless, new and,  for us, undesirable tendencies emerged from the Abkhazian side,  which, from the standpoint of political logic, could have a  negative impact on further developments. From this standpoint,  the UN's resolution is very timely.    During our head of state's visit to Paris, Batoni Eduard  Shevardnadze met with the UN General Secretary, and their  two-hour talk became the political litmus test which clearly  brought out the further political tendency of the specific  situation and, in principle, brought about the passage of the  UN's resolution at the time we most needed it. This meeting  played a decisive role in turning events to our advantage.    The rest, as they say, was strictly a technicality. It was  necessary to get the Security Council members effectively to see  our side of the problem. Fortunately, the expected result was  not slow in coming.    Mr Butrus Butrus-Ghali already has two plans, which have  been  examined together with the Friends of Georgia group, with the  participation of Mr Eduard Bruner [name transliterated], the  General Secretary's personal representative.    The first plan calls for the UN's traditional peace-keeping  operation--2,500 Blue Helmets under its command will be sent  first to Gali, in the vicinity of the Enguri and the Psou rivers  and later to other areas, with a specific mission: to keep the  two sides separate, to disarm illegal military formations, and,  mainly, to work out firm guarantees of safety for the  unconditional repatriation of refugees. The second plan has the  same tasks in mind, with the difference that peace-keeping  functions will be carried out by armed forces of the countries  concerned, while monitoring and control will be provided by the  UN observers mission, now increased to 200 men. Of course, it is  impossible to make these two plans a reality at one stroke.  Activating the peace-keeping forces is a very complex process.  Preparations for it will take at least six months, a time in  which a concrete plan will have to be worked out as to which  country will take part in implementing the peace-keeping  operations, and in what numbers. Technical questions will have  to be decided, and there is the finance problem, and the various  countries' willingness and readiness to activate their troops  under UN auspices.    During our UN meetings, opinions and advice were voiced to  the effect that the correct thing at first would be to introduce  Russian troops into the conflict zone on the basis of a  bilateral agreement. Later on, those troops would be joined by  troops from other countries.    The UN is looking very closely at Russia's participation in  the peace-keeping forces. Russian representative Mr Vorontsov  stated directly at a Security Council meeting that it would be  unacceptable to change borders by means of armed confrontation,  but as for a possible referendum and its results, there can be  talk of that only after the refugees are repatriated and the  original character of the population has been restored.    [Question] Batono Minister, that kind of attention on the  part of the UN is not a new thing to Georgians. There is  probably no precedent for passing so many resolutions concerning  one country. Can you say something about the possible practical  results of this?    [Chikvaidze] Looking at things realistically, today's  political reality, the solution to any question requires a  political basis, and this resolution does lay that foundation.    After the passage of the resolution, preparations for  bringing in the peace-keeping forces should begin.    Emphasis is again placed on Georgia's territorial  integrity--at a time when the Gudauta gang is planning to hold a  referendum.    It was emphasized that it will be possible to determine  Abkhazia's political status only if the sovereignty and  territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia is respected.    For the first time, the resolution has noted and, more  important, singled out, our most painful problem--the refugees.  Article 11 and Article 12 recognize every refugee's right to a  safe return home without any preconditions whatever. The two  sides must comply with the pledges they have made and a schedule  of repatriation must be drawn up immediately. The resolution  denounces the attempts to change the demographic picture,  including the illegal settling of foreigners since the conflict.  From the political standpoint, these two articles are a great  balm to our pain and problems. In short, the mission was  accomplished.    [Question] What was the chronology of events?    [Chikvaidze] The Security Council meeting started at 4:30 pm  on 31 January. Georgia's representative to the UN, Petre  Chkheidze, spoke. He stated repeatedly that the refugees'  immediate and unconditional repatriation to their homeland must  be the cornerstone of any political solution to the conflict,  while any delay could bring about new tragedies and explosions.  He was followed by Mr Yuliy Vorontsov, who affirmed guarantees  of the principle of Georgia's territorial integrity and the  inviolability of its borders.    Great Britain's representative Sir David Henney [name  transliterated] made an extraordinary statement in which the  swift and unconditional repatriation of the refugees, and  cooperation on this matter, was deemed to be a task of top  priority to resolve the conflict, a touchstone of the  Abkhazians' good will, and an essential precondition of  prospects for achieving broad agreement on political problems.    The U.S. representative, Ms Madeleine Albright, said: "My  government will not support and is categorically against any  half-way measures, for that would mean avoiding our obligations  toward the refugees." The U.S. representative's statement, which  is not empty words but represents the American government's  official position, once more affirms that the international  community will categorically reject any precedent of border  revision. The same mood dominated most of the speeches. This  itself makes it clear that the separatists' aims are doomed from  the start.    Abkhazia's attempt to change the demographic situation was  denounced by the French and Spanish representatives, Mr  Jean-Bernard Merimee and Juan Antonio Yanez-Barnuevo.    The chairman of the meeting, Czech representative Karel  Kovanda, denounced the ethnic cleansing launched against the  Georgians by the Abkhazians, cast doubt on any referendum  initiated by that side (which constitutes a minority in the  region), and once again emphasized the supremacy of the  principle of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.    The resolution was passed unanimously.    And so, the world's attitude toward the Abkhazian conflict  has been affirmed once more, and it ought to make the Gudauta  gang think. Moreover, the Russian Federation's position is also  very important; the fact is that the palette of specific  political realities linked to the Abkhazian problem is being  filled with new, positive colors, in particular from the  standpoint of the Russian Federation's attitudes. Incidentally,  light was shed on many things by Boris Yeltsin's official visit  to the Republic of Georgia. Most important, it brought out a  tendency that is very favorable to us: I refer to the unity of  the two countries' views, both with respect to global issues and  specifically the Abkhazian conflict. It is obvious to the naked  eye, nevertheless, that a political settlement and ultimate  peace will not be an easy process. A great deal depends on  further events and the talks that have begun in Geneva. The main  thing is, however, that we are on the right path. The Russian  Federation's interest in a unified, undivided Georgia is  becoming increasingly apparent. And so, everything depends on  our taking the correct political steps.</p>

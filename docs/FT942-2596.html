			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Challenging the traditions - Benfield's new Pounds 50m reinsurance venture The launch this week of Benfield Re, a new Pounds 50m London-based reinsurance company, might at first sight appear unexceptional. After all the company is only one of a number of new ventures in the international catastrophe reinsurance market over the last 18 months, with more than Pounds 3bn pumped into the market by international investors over the last 18 months. Yet two factors make the new venture worthy of attention. Firstly, the backer of the project, Benfield Group, is one of London's most successful reinsurance brokers in recent years, with its 1993 full year pre-tax profits of some Pounds 30m amounting to nearly 75 per cent of its turnover. Mr Matthew Harding, the group's ambitious 40 year old chairman, has already generated a personal fortune recently estimated at Pounds 135m, and last year started to diversify his interests by acquiring a significant minority stake in Chelsea Football Club. Together with three of his co-directors, Mr Harding figures among the 500 most wealthy people in the UK, according to one recent survey. Secondly, Royal Bank of Scotland, whose other investments in the insurance industry include Direct Line, the UK's most successful insurance company of recent years, is backing the project. Its venture capital arm, Royal Bank Development Capital, is one of three institutions providing Pounds 12.5m in new equity to Benfield for the new venture. Benfield's achievements to date are in part due to the way it has challenged many traditional business practices in the London insurance market. Mr Harding is fiercely critical of traditional ways of broking, for example. Many brokers physically carry contracts around the market, frequently queueing at underwriting 'boxes' - the open plan offices where Lloyd's underwriters work - to obtain support for deals. 'Benfield brokers do not go out with their binders and tramp through the streets on a wet Wednesday afternoon,' insists Mr Harding. The group conducts the vast majority of its broking business either by telephone or in pre-arranged meetings and is usually the only broker involved in a reinsurance deal. 'In the bad old days in the mid to late 1980s, syndicates would often reinsure through a dozen or so reinsurance brokers. We would often structure the whole programme ourselves,' explains Mr Harding. In addition Mr Harding believes brokers must take a long-term approach to reinsurance business, developing stable connections with underwriters who are prepared to handle relatively large deals. Benfield's position in the market has been strengthened by the collapse of the 'spiral', the chain of reinsurance and retroinsurance (reinsurance of reinsurance) through which dozens of underwriters and brokers traditionally handled catastrophe risks. Benfield's customers were generally less involved in 'spiral' and most continued to trade through the market's difficulties. And following the contraction of the capital base supporting the London reinsurance market, Benfield was able to find alternative capacity elsewhere. This was at least partially through its links with overseas companies, such as Fortress Re, a North Carolina-based agency which underwrites on behalf of three Japanese companies, and Frankona, a reinsurance subsidiary of Gerling, a leading German insurance company. The group quickly became a leading force in the catastrophe market, increasing income from Pounds 9.4m in 1989 to Pounds 39.9m in 1992 and Pounds 41.3m in 1993. Mr Harding introduced innovative elements into reinsurance deals, mainly designed to prevent the re-emergence of a kind of reinsurance 'arbitrage', in which some underwriters were able to underwrite business but retain very little or no risk on their own accounts, and which was sometimes an important feature of 'spiral' business. At the same time Mr Harding and his team transformed Benfield's organisation, by introducing 'state of the art' technology and systems. Because it had brokered relatively few contracts, Benfield avoided the heavy burden of processing thousands of small claims. The company's brokers do their own secretarial work, using personal computers and dedicated software. Benfield's new reinsurance venture gives it the possibility to diversify its sources of income. For the moment its ambitions in this field remain relatively modest. With rates now beginning to soften as competition re-emerges, Benfield Re does not expect to use its capacity to underwrite up to Pounds 125m in annual premiums in its first year. Initially at least the company will not 'lead' the negotiation of reinsurance deals, instead working alongside a group of about a dozen senior underwriters. But the group is ambitious. Mr John Coldman, managing director, said this week that it was looking for growth and would be able to increase its capital base very quickly if necessary.</p>

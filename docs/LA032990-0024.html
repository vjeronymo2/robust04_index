			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: ROLLS WERE IN DEMAND SEVERAL DECADES AGO  </P> <P> Question: The following half dollars in good condition -- not uncirculated, not  excellent, but "good" -- include a 1941-S, 1942-D, 1943-S, 1944 and 1944-S,  1945-S and 1947-D. Also there's a roll of 1964 quarters and a roll of 1964  halves, all in good and fair condition. Then there's a silver-certificate  1935-G dollar with the signature of Henry Morgenthau Jr. and a blue seal; and a  1935-A paper dollar with Hawaii printed twice on the front with a gold seal and  gold serial numbers. -- R.E.S.  </P> <P> Answer: There are several interesting aspects of your letter. When you  described your half dollars as being in "good" condition, you were unwittingly  using a specific numismatic term to describe low-grade circulated coins, which  I suspect accurately describes your 50-cent pieces. If so, they are worth about  $1.50 each, primarily because of their silver content.  </P> <P> You also mention a roll of quarters and a roll of halves. Both of your rolls  are worth about $35 each. The reason is there are 20 coins in a roll of halves  and 40 in a roll of quarters. Again, the value is primarily in the silver.  </P> <P> Back in the '50s and '60s, it was popular to collect coins by the roll. It took  20 coins to make up a roll of dollars, 50 for a roll of dimes, 40 for a roll of  nickels and 50 for a roll of cents. You don't see too many original rolls  nowadays. Many have been broken up and the coins sold individually. But some  collectors still prefer rolls, either original from the bank or put together  from circulation.  </P> <P> As for your $1 bills, the 1935 silver certificate is just worth face value. The  $1 Hawaii overprint is worth about $5.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> The Western Wall, considered by Jews their holiest shrine, is commemorated in  an Israeli medal that depicts the hand-hewn stones of the wall on the obverse  with the inscription in English and Hebrew: "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem . .  . ." (Psalms 135:5). The medal (pictured) also features the Hasmonean  subterranean aqueduct on the reverse. Medals are available in bronze, silver  and 18-karat gold.

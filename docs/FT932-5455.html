			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (5): A daunting task ahead - Foreign direct investment 'The Koreans want only three things from us. They want our cash, they want our technology and they want us out.' The remark, from a senior western businessman in Seoul, contains a nugget of truth even if it is not wholly serious. It also illustrates a genuine and pressing problem for the Korean economy. Historically, Korean industry's competitive edge was largely based on cheap labour. In the past few years, that advantage has disappeared. Korea now urgently needs technology to allow it to compete with the developed world. Generating that technology will take time. In the meantime, Korea needs to import it. But when it comes to foreign direct investment, the Korean tradition is scarcely welcoming. 'They're not very internationally minded', says Mr Alan Timblick, head of Barclays Bank in Korea. 'A foreigner making profits is still seen as exploiting Korean workers. And they don't want to see the re-conquest of the peninsula by the Japanese by financial means.' The point is developed by Mr Sakong Il, formerly Korea's finance minister. 'Korea was exceptional among most developing nations in that it relied principally on foreign-borrowed capital rather than equity. One reason was the experience of Japanese colonialism. There was a reluctance at the level of both government and firms to allow direct investment. Another reason is that Koreans are independent by nature. If two Korean companies agree to share technology, that's big news here. 'A third factor is economic. Korean companies had negative real interest rates, because of fiscal subsidies and high inflation. From the viewpoint of a Korean entrepreneur, if you allow foreigners to get equity you have to share those benefits. The government wasn't very accommodating for the same reason.' Of late, however, the foreigners have started to get the message. Mr Jack Leber of Samsung Hewlett-Packard, co-chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce's investment committee in Korea, says: 'Foreign investment has been down for the past four years and last year Korea was ninth out of nine countries for investment in Asia. You've now got Dollars 50m a day going into China and the Koreans can see that.' Mr Timblick says: 'The Koreans are waking up to the foreign exodus. For the first time last year, more companies left than arrived. That affects their pride. It's one thing to be suspicious of foreigners raking in profits. It's another to be shunned. It's exactly what they don't need at a time when they should be upgrading their technology.' Most foreign involvement in Korean industry is in the form of joint ventures, which can be notoriously tricky in any country. Since the late 1980s, it has been possible for a foreign company to hold a majority stake in a joint venture, or even to own a Korean business outright. But, says Mr Alan Twist, head of ICI in Korea, 'foreigners are forbidden to hold land, unless in high-tech industries. If you're a pharmaceutical company, you can build a plant. If not, you can own the business 100 per cent, but you can't build the factory. So in commodity chemicals, for instance, you'd still want a local partner - partly for market access, but mainly to get hold of a land bank.' Another advantage of having a local partner, says Mr Timblick, is that it brings access to the relevant trade association. 'That's vitally important to market access', he says. A local partner will also be able to get hold of finance. 'It's very difficult for a foreign company to persuade a Korean bank to lend. Even a big company has to go through the local branch manager, who never heard of you. That's changing a little bit, but the domestic banking system is still very unsophisticated.' But, says Mr Timblick, the history of joint ventures in Korea is not happy. 'There have been far more divorces than silver weddings. A foreign manager will want to run his company according to criteria and accounting principles determined at head office level. The Korean partner is likely to argue that in Korea you don't go for return on capital but for market share, at least until you've eliminated your competitor. It gets worse when you find the manufacturing plant has outgrown the domestic market and the Koreans want to move into overseas markets'. Last year, a joint venture in vehicles between General Motors and Daewoo broke up for just that reason, with Daewoo buying out GM's 50 per cent holding. Another commonly cited problem is the lack of protection for intellectual property. Mr Twist says: 'The law on the statute books is now as good as anyone else's, but the policing is patchy. In the Confucian culture, the tradition is that the scholar talks to the people and that thought is free. The concept of ideas as property is not well understood by the people, and the government has a lot of trouble explaining that copying Gucci tracksuits or American software is a crime.' There is general agreement that the new government is making genuine efforts to encourage investment - 'to liberalise 50 years of xenophobic constraints', as one executive puts it. But it is not plain sailing. Mr Leber tells of how Cargill, the giant US food company, submitted an application to set up a soyabean processing plant in December 1988. 'The local competition here made a 30-minute video to show how they'd be hurt by it', he says. 'They finally got approval in January 1993. A similar application in Japan took only two years. Now they're considering whether China might be a better bet.' In any case, say the foreigners, the government is still only at the stage of removing barriers, rather than providing active encouragement. 'The Koreans have to realise', Mr Twist says, 'that their traditional approach of nibbling at a mountain of constraints is not good enough. China, Taiwan and Malaysia are offering incentives. Korea's just offering fewer disincentives.' Mr Leber agrees. 'In the four years I've been here, the Koreans have moved, but others are moving faster. In China, things are moving fast and they're making it easy.' There is also disagreement about how fundamentally attractive Korea is in the first place. Mr Timblick says: 'Korea used to be an area of great interest in this region as a way into China: it had cheap labour, a well-educated workforce and so on. But now that the Chinese are less regulated and growing so fast, Korea risks getting bypassed.' Mr Twist disagrees. 'I believe people can't have a strategy for the Asian-Pacific region which excludes Korea. It's the second most advanced industrial nation after Japan. In pharmaceuticals, Korea has 50 per cent of the whole Asian market excluding Japan. Korea has very strong traditional cultural links with north-east China, and Beijing is just an hour away. 'And Korea has a resource of very skilled operators. They know how to make things like cars and computers. China doesn't have a skilled workforce. You can't control the joint venture. It doesn't have the financial system, or the legislation. It's still frontier land.' Either way, Korea has little choice but to make itself more attractive. It may even have to woo its traditional enemies. Mr Timblick says: 'The government needs to change its mind on the Japanese. That's very difficult, and it's unclear how it can be brought about. But they need to be allies with the Japanese, which would be their salvation. They desperately need Japanese technology.' If the task sounds daunting, not every foreign observer is pessimistic about the new government's ability to tackle it. Mr Leber says: 'They need to change, and that'll be a challenge. But I think they'll do it. They have in the past. And what's happened in the past few months is really remarkable.'</p>

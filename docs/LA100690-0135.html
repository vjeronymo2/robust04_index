			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALTRANS TO ADD MORE TRAINS, STOPS TO DAILY RAIL SERVICE  </P> <P> Caltrans announced Friday it is extending rail service to the San Fernando  Valley, Ventura County and Santa Barbara Oct. 28, adding a second daily train  that will carry passengers to and from San Diego and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Under an agreement signed with Amtrak, there will now be both morning and  evening trains between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, in addition to the  traditional Coast Starlight, the long-distance service that carries Los  Angeles-Seattle passengers along the same route.  </P> <P> Caltrans, the state Department of Transportation, said the new northbound Santa  Barbara morning train will leave San Diego at 5:02 a.m. and Los Angeles at 8:20  a.m., arriving in Santa Barbara at 10:55 a.m.  </P> <P> The northbound evening service that began in 1988 will continue leaving San  Diego at 4:50 p.m. and Los Angeles at 8 p.m., arriving in Santa Barbara at  10:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Southbound morning service will depart Santa Barbara at 7:50 a.m., arriving in  Los Angeles at 10:30 a.m. and San Diego at 1:37 p.m. Afternoon service will  depart Santa Barbara at 3:25 p.m., arrive in Los Angeles at 6 p.m. and Santa  Diego at 9:07 p.m.  </P> <P> Stops by the six- to 14-car trains will be made at Oxnard, Simi Valley,  Chatsworth, Van Nuys, the Burbank Airport, Glendale, Los Angeles, Fullerton,  Anaheim, Santa Ana, San Juan Capistrano, Oceanside and Del Mar, with stops in  the city of Ventura scheduled to begin next spring when station construction is  completed there.  </P> <P> These trains are part of what Amtrak calls its San Diegans, eight trains a day  each way between Los Angeles and San Diego carrying 1.5 million passengers a  year. It is the second most-traveled intercity rail corridor in the United  States.  </P> <P> The number of trains between Los Angeles and San Diego will not be increased in  the new schedule. One more train a day each way will simply be extended to  Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Cindy McKim, head of the rail division at Caltrans, said ridership has been so  heavy on the Santa Barbara train inaugurated two years ago that service costs  have been more than fully recovered through passenger fares. That's a  comparative rarity in Amtrak service, although San Diegan service as a whole  also pays its own way.  </P> <P> In the 1989-90 fiscal year, McKim said, 52,470 passengers rode the southbound  train segment between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, while 47,253 passengers  rode the northbound train.  </P> <P> Caltrans also announced a promotional fare for the service. The special fare  will begin Oct. 28 and run through April 30, with some blackout periods around  the holidays.  </P> <P> The one-way Los Angeles-Santa Barbara fare is normally $18. During the  promotion, a same-day round trip will be sold for only $1 more, $19. For trips  not completed the same day, the round trip will be $25.  </P> <P> The one-way San Diego-Santa Barbara fare is $29.50. During the promotion, a  round trip completed the same day will be $30.50, and a round trip completed in  more than one day will be $36.50.  </P> <P> Announcement of the expansion of service comes at a time when the passage of $3  billion in rail bonds by the California electorate and new spending priorities  by the California Transportation Commission has raised the prospect of vastly  increased commuter and inter-city rail service in Southern California in the  next few years.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, for example, transportation officials have announced plans to  introduce commuter rail service by 1993 between Los Angeles and such points as  Orange County, San Bernardino, Santa Clarita and Oxnard. Commuter service also  is envisioned in the next few years between San Diego and Oceanside and between  Riverside and Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Although these projects are part of the state's seven-year transportation plan,  officials have cautioned that in many cases local funds are required to provide  operating subsidies and some capital investments, which raises doubts about  whether the plans will be realized, or realized on time. Federal funds also may  be required to help develop certain lines.  </P> <P> Another impediment could be a shortage of rail cars. The supply has been tight  nationwide.  </P></p>

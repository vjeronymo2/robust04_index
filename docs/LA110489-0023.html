			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RECRUITING INQUIRY CLEARS MONTCLAIR PREP  </P> <P> Montclair Prep was given a clean bill of health Friday after Southern Section  officials had paid a surprise visit to the private school in Van Nuys to  investigate the possibility of recruiting violations involving the school's  football program and its undefeated team.  </P> <P> Acting on a tip, Southern Section administrators Bill Clark and Dean Crowley  arrived at the campus Friday to investigate the living arrangements of Derek  and Leland Sparks, cousins who had transferred to Montclair Prep this fall.  Derek, from Banning High in Wilmington, is the Valley area's leading rusher.  Leland, from El Campo, Tex., is the team's quarterback.  </P> <P> The two players live in an apartment on campus with their uncle, Eric Sparks,  and Donovan Roy and John Goldbaum, fellow juniors on the football team.  </P> <P> Had the players lived off campus in an apartment owned by the school that  wasn't available to all students, the Southern Section could have invoked the  anti-recruiting statute of the California Interscholastic Federation rules.  That rule forbids schools from securing or retaining students through use of  "undue influence." Providing special living arrangements for athletes would  constitute undue influence.  </P> <P> But because Montclair Prep is a licensed boarding school, the living  arrangement of the four athletes satisfies Southern Section regulations.  </P> <P> V. E. Simpson, the school's principal and founder, provided financial records  that show the athletes pay rent for the apartment.  </P> <P> Eric Sparks has been hired by the school as the boarding school supervisor,  campus caretaker and an assistant coach with the football team, according to  Crowley. The four football players are the school's only boarders.  </P> <P> "It's a legit deal," Crowley said. "They (Montclair Prep) didn't have anything  to hide."  </P> <P> Rumors of recruiting violations at the school had abounded since the start of  football season.  </P> <P> The Southern Section investigation of Montclair Prep is the second in the past  four years. Crowley investigated the eligibility of eight athletes Oct. 7,  1985, but no violations were found.  </P></p>

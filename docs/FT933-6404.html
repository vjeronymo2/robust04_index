			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Alfred McAlpine deficit widens to Pounds 2.5m ALFRED McAlpine, the UK construction and building materials group, suffered an increased pre-tax deficit of Pounds 2.5m for the six months to April 30 1993. The outcome compared with losses of Pounds 71,000 for the corresponding period. Mr Oliver Whitehead, who was appointed chief executive in May, warned that large areas of the UK construction market remained deeply depressed. Reports of a recovery had been greatly overstated, he said. Even if increased spending on infrastructure was approved now by government and private sector utilities, it would take several years for projects to come to fruition. Mr Whitehead said that ministers had recently announced ambitious plans for widening motorways and improving railways but had so far not indicated where the money was coming from. Group turnover in the first half had fallen from Pounds 250m to Pounds 241.3m. After all deductions the group incurred losses per share of 3.3p, compared with earnings of 0.2p at the corresponding stage last year. The company, however, opted to pay a maintained interim dividend of 3p. There were some bright spots, directors said. The UK housing market had begun to recover, while construction activity was increasing in North and South Carolina, where McAlpine's US interests are mainly based. Pre-tax profit in the US during the first half fell from Pounds 528,000 to Pounds 85,000 due to a wet winter and losses on two contracts. Profits, but for these two contracts, would have been about the same level as the previous year, said Mr Whitehead. He expected US profits to be higher for the full year. UK housing profits were also expected to rise after a sharply-reduced first half loss, down from Pounds 1.33m to Pounds 254,000. The number of house sales rose from 469 to 593 while operating margins rose from 3.3 per cent to 4.7 per cent. On the UK construction side, which in last year's first half made a Pounds 2.02m profit, losses of Pounds 486,000 reflected the difficult trading conditions and a Pounds 750,000 exceptional loss on disposals. UK aggregates incurred a loss of Pounds 161,000 compared to a Pounds 490,000 profit. COMMENT McAlpine's share price has outperformed the FT-A All-Share Index by more than 70 per cent since January 1. A 2p fall to 213p, after yesterday's announcement, still left the shares just short of their high for the year of 218p. The efforts of Mr Whiteheads's predecessor Mr Graeme Odgers, now chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, in reducing costs has left the company well placed to take advantage of a recovery. The businesses and the balance sheet, with gearing of only 22 per cent, are soundly placed. Pre-tax profits this year could reach Pounds 6m, producing earnings just sufficient to cover a maintained total dividend for the year of 6.5p. It is difficult, however, to envisage the share price continuing to outperform while the UK housing recovery shows little sign of spreading to other areas of construction.</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Moslem offensive 'reversed' Bosnian Serb commanders yesterday claimed to have recaptured all the land seized in a Moslem offensive in northwestern Bosnia after giving their leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, sweeping powers to declare a state of war. In the aftermath of a two-week Moslem offensive, partly supported by Bosnian Croat forces, the Bosnian Serb military appears to have regained the initiative over their outgunned foes. Serb forces yesterday said their 'fierce counter-offensive had completely destroyed' Bosnian government units round the Bihac pocket, the Moslem enclave which is a United Nations-designated safe area, reported Bosnian Serb sources. After his assembly ended its three-day marathon session in Pale, the abandoned ski resort above Sarajevo, Mr Karadzic said his forces would 'neutralise the Moslems' in the Bihac enclave. Serb forces from Krajina, the self-styled Serb state in Croatia just over the frontier, have joined the Bosnian Serbs. Yesterday they claimed to have sandwiched the mainly Moslem army in Bihac, reported the Bosnian Serb news agency. The Krajina Serbs are believed to take orders from Belgrade. Their stepped-up military involvement may indicate that Serbia proper is relaxing its embargo against the Bosnian Serbs. President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia imposed a political and economic blockade, including military material and fuel, in August after Bosnian Serb leaders rejected a peace plan. In a letter to the Serbian president, Mr Yasushi Akashi, the top UN civilian official in former Yugoslavia, yesterday called on Belgrade to stop the Krajina Serbs from intervening in Bihac. Local analysts say an air raid launched by Krajina Serbs against Bihac on Wednesday probably had support from Belgrade. Fourteen people were wounded when a Serb fighter jet hit a munitions factory in Bihac. Nato says the flight did not appear to have entered Bosnian airspace, which would mean the violation of a UN no-fly zone over Bosnia. If it fired the missile from the Croatian border, it would indicate a high degree of expertise. Serb forces yesterday reportedly crossed the River Una, advancing towards Cazin and Velika Kladusa, once the stronghold of ousted rebel Moslem leader Fikret Abdic. UN officials said that forces loyal to Mr Abdic were reported to be massing just over the border in Serb-held parts of Croatia, their self-styled state of Krajina. Other reports said Krajina Serbs were masquerading as Mr Abdic's 'army'. Bosnian radio yesterday reported fierce fighting in the region, saying Serb had launched infantry attacks on all fronts.</p>

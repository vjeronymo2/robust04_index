			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Pro-democracy and pro-Beijing candidates do well in Hong Kong poll Strong support for pro-democracy candidates and a good showing for Hong Kong's main pro-Beijing political party were the highlights of the colony's first fully democratic elections. Hong Kong went to the polls on Sunday to elect 346 local government officials in what was the first of three colony-wide polls to be held over the coming year. After failing to agree terms with Britain, during talks last year, Beijing has said it will annul the result of these elections when it resumes sovereignty in 1997. By the close of counting yesterday afternoon candidates representing pro-democracy groups had taken nearly a third of the seats. The Beijing-funded Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB) won just over 10 per cent of the seats. The loser on the day was the pro-business Liberal party, which managed to win only 19 of the 99 seats it contested. More than 150 of the successful candidates ran as independents, underlying the essentially local nature of the elections. Hong Kong's Chinese language press welcomed the poll. Almost all of the colony's leading newspapers commented favourably on the elections, with many saying they boded well for municipal council elections next spring and Legislative Council polls next autumn. In all, 693,223 people voted - 64 per cent up on the vote in 1991, when 424,032 people voted. Sunday's turnout, however, represented only 33.1 per cent of Hong Kong's registered voters and was not much ahead of the 1991 poll, when 32.5 per cent of voters cast a ballot. The high voter turnout was attributed by some to the growing civic consciousness among voters. Many commented on the maturity and responsibility of voters and said they hoped China would take note of the result when it came to establishing a fresh political order after 1997. The pro-Beijing Ta Kung Pao said the large turnout did not imply public support for Mr Patten's reforms. Instead it concentrated on the turnout rate. Wen Wei Po, its stablemate, had encouraged its readers to participate in Sunday's poll by voting for candidates who 'loved Hong Kong and the motherland'.</p>

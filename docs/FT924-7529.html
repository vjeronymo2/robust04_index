			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / UK Company News: GPA asks bankers to waive debt repayments GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, has confirmed that it has asked its biggest bankers to waive debt repayments on outstanding loans of between Dollars 800m-Dollars 900m up to September 1996. The waiver of the debt repayments is part of the rescheduling proposals which will be put to the group's 73 banks at a London meeting on November 23. GPA has had to increase its bank indebtedness to pay for aircraft it has contracted to buy from manufacturers. The group's indebtedness since March may have increased by Dollars 2bn, giving total borrowings of around Dollars 5bn. A Dollars 325m facility is due to be repaid in spring 1994. A 'balloon payment' of 61 per cent of the Dollars 2.17bn corporate credit facility is due to be repaid in September 1996. Some 61 per cent of the principal on the Dollars 1.19bn associated companies long-term credit facility falls a year later. A waiver of the covenant clauses would require the agreement of two thirds of the banks. While GPA may have difficulty in paying back principal on the debt from cash flow it appears able to pay its interest on its debt for the foreseeable future. The group's banks have already made it clear that the negotiations on waivers of debt repayments are interdependent on GPA's talks with the aircraft manufacturers. GPA is pressing the aircraft manufacturers to introduce greater flexibility into their contracts. The group is committed to spend Dollars 4.7bn by the end of 1993 on the purchase of 146 aircraft. It has paid Dollars 954.1m in predelivery payments, with Boeing holding 37 per cent of the payments, Airbus 29 per cent and McDonnell Douglas 26 per cent. Mr Jim King, GPA's vice chairman, said: 'We are very encouraged by the positive support from the suppliers and our discussions continue'.</p>

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Adams poses queries about sovereignty Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, indicated on Saturday the issues covered by the organisation's demand for clarification of the Downing Street declaration on the future of Northern Ireland. He declined at a meeting in Dublin to give precise details of questions submitted by Sinn Fein to the government of the Irish republic and passed on to the UK authorities. But he outlined issues on which his party expected progress: What are the means and within what timescale does the British government expect to see agreement reached between all the Irish people? What are the constitutional options which Britain sees as a realistic alternative to the present constitutional structures? What are the long-term political objectives of the British government in relation to Ireland? On what basis does the unionist veto exist, and how far does it extend over constitutional change and political policy? If the Government of Ireland Act claims sovereignty over Northern Ireland, why was it not mentioned in the declaration? What are the subsequent steps which the British government envisages in the peace process? What are the structures and processes which the government expects to be developed from the declaration? Is acceptance of the declaration a precondition for involvement in talks on the development of new political arrangements? What is the process which will lead to 'de-militarisation'? Mr John Taylor, Ulster unionist MP for Strangford, yesterday accused the UK government of 'playing the tune' of the IRA. He said the people of Northern Ireland had lost all confidence in Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary. 'He has been sent written questions from the IRA via Sinn Fein, via the Dublin government, and then posted into London, and he is going to answer those written questions and publish the answers,' Mr Taylor told BBC Radio.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: Volksbank hit by bad loan provisions SWISS VOLKSBANK, the object of an agreed SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1bn) takeover bid from the parent company of rival Credit Suisse, has reported a loss of SFr68m in 1992 compared with a SFr68m net profit in 1991 because of nearly doubled provisions for bad loans. The actual loss was much higher, but was softened by the release of the remaining SFr292m in hidden reserves. The directors have recommended that the dividend be passed. Volksbank said CS Holding had completed its examination of the bank and confirmed its takeover offer, on the basis of three registered shares of CS for 10 Volksbank registered shares. Volksbank will seek the approval of its shareholders on March 11 to transform itself from a co-operative into a joint stock company, converting each of its co-operative shares into 10 registered shares. Mr Werner Sigg, a director of Volksbank, said the rationalisation plan agreed between the two banks called for the elimination of between 100 and 150 of their combined 400 branches in Switzerland and the loss of 2,000 jobs. While the two would maintain separate identities in Switzerland, the Volksbank international network would be folded into that of CS. Mr Sigg said the resulting savings would be of the order of SFr250m a year by 1995, roughly 8.5 per cent of the operating costs of the two banks in 1991. Mr Erwin Sigrist, executive vice-president of Volksbank, said the large growth in loan loss provisions last year from SFr394m to SFr720m was due mainly to the negative impact of the recession in Switzerland on small and medium-sized businesses. At December 31, 1992, the bank had total assets of SFr46.1bn compared with SFr46.5bn a year earlier. Capital was unchanged at SFr2.2bn.</p>

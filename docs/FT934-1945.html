			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Don't be so down on jam today What is the best way that the British economy can take advantage of the opportunities opened up by the Gatt accord and rise to the challenges of more competition, which are an essential part of the exercise? There is one answer, which is tempting to the economic elite, among whom there is a consensus that the British people consume too much and are undertaxed. One sees this in City circulars, hears it from Treasury officials and finds it in the conclusions of learned articles. It unites much economic opinion across sectarian lines. The view is upheld by monetarists and Keynesians, Labour and Conservative economists, and many independent analysts who have studied national incomes estimates of different countries. The case is superficially attractive for those who think that there is something wrong with a country that is different from the international average, or has changed its own behaviour. The top graph shows UK consumption, both private and government, as a ratio of GDP. There was a temporary bulge in the consumption ratio around the 1974 election at the time of the miners' strike, the three-day week and the oil price explosion. One likely reason is that the wage explosion, following the breakdown of the Heath pay policies, temporarily boosted real pay. After reaching a low point in the late 1970s, following the Labour government's pay policies and the restrictive fiscal and monetary policies associated with the IMF credit, the consumption ratio gradually recovered during the Thatcher years, and then really shot up during the recession years which followed her departure. (It is important to be clear that we are talking about ratios. Private consumption actually fell between 1990 and 1992. But it rose as a proportion of a shrinking or stagnant GDP because fixed investment and stock-building shrank even more.) If we take a cross section instead of a historical look, a similar picture emerges. The total consumption ratio has always been higher in the UK than that of either the Group of Seven or the European Union average; and the gap has widened - the overall consumption ratio is at about 87 1/2 per cent in the UK, compared with about 80 per cent in these other groups. What is supposed to be so wrong with a relatively high consumption ratio? The argument is that, if it could be lowered, there would be more resources set free for investment and exports. The result, according to this mainstream view, would be improved competitiveness, faster growth and a better balance of payments. The motto of this school is the Queen's in Alice Through the Looking Glass: 'Jam tomorrow and jam yesterday - but never jam today.' The objections to the anti-consumption thesis are on several different levels. Too many macro-economists, who ac-knowledge that they cannot guess the fortunes of specific industries, enjoy instead playing with big building blocks like consumption and investment which enhances their own job satisfaction. But they still mistake the role both of government and of economic analyst. The government's role is to provide those goods and services that are judged to be better provided collectively than through the market and to execute transfers between citizens. On the macro-economic side, it is to support an adequate non-inflationary growth of demand and to keep its own budget in order - which will not always mean an exact balance. The distribution of the national income, between consumption, investment, exports, stock-building and so on, is the business of people and companies. It is not one that the government should make for them or that it has shown any aptitude for doing in practice. I do not want to deny that the UK consumption ratio is too high, but to declare an aggressive agnosticism. When the gap between actual and potential output has been eliminated, growth is back to trend rates and the normal level of overseas capital inflows has been established, we will learn by observation what the sustainable consumption ratio is, without the government doing anything directly to bring it about, except to put its own house in order. Nor is there any reason to suppose that governments are very good at improving performance by forced savings and investment. In the former communist world, investment and savings ratios were far higher even than the Japanese ones, but this did not prevent their economies from becoming basket cases. Even a crude look at the charts suggests that the supposed relation between economic progress and a low consumption ratio is highly fallible. The US, for instance, has a higher private consumption ration than the UK. But its growth rate has been consistently as high as, or higher than, Europe's since 1975, or during any reasonable sub-period in the intervening years. (UK experience has been too dominated by the last recession to be much of an indicator on its own.) These observations are supported by a thorough econometric study entitled Is Fixed Investment the Key to Economic Growth? by Blomstrom, Lipsey and Zejan (Centre for Economic Policy Research). The authors accept some modest correlation between growth rates and the share of fixed capital formation in GDP. But they then go on to examine successive five-year periods between 1965 and 1985 in 100 countries, and they find far more evidence that increases in growth precede rises in rates of capital formation, rather than the other way round. In other words, high investment ratios reflect high growth rates rather than cause them. This study, of course, is not the only reason for being sceptical of the anti-consumption school, but it is useful to have support from a sledgehammer regression analysis with no economic axe to grind. Let us suppose, however, that we accept the anti-consumption analysis. What can the government - that blessed abstraction - do about it? Not all that much. It can raise the tax burden and devote the proceeds to cutting the budget deficit. It has indeed carried out at least part of the prescription. Taxation and social security contributions as a proportion of GDP (excluding the North Sea sector) are expected to rise from a recession low of 34 1/4 per cent in 1993-94 to 38 1/2 per cent by 1998-99. By the late 1990s the projected ratio will be nearly 4 percentage points higher than the level at which it was running during the last year of the last Labour government. Moreover, much of the increase will come in the next two financial years. The talking classes who proudly proclaim at dinner parties that they are not being taxed enough will soon not know what has hit them. But the strategy could backfire. An attempt by the government to increase the national savings ratio by raising taxes may not lead to more private investment at all. If the result is a slower recovery of demand and output, there may easily be less investment as a result. There is a danger that the over-contractionary pair of British budgets introduced in 1993 will have this effect. One can only hope the Gatt accord will offset this contraction by boosting 'animal spirits' - which means that there will be a higher rate of investment for a given level of final demand. An increase in intended savings may thus not boost investment. On the other hand, an increase in investment does not always require an increase in domestic savings, if it is mirrored by overseas capital inflows. In a rational world, savings are determined by people's preferences between present and future consumption; and investment upsurges are financed by tapping world savings and not merely the domestic variety. Adam Smith said: 'Consumption is the sole end of all production . . . The maxim is so perfectly self-evident that it would be absurd to attempt to prove it.' Yet some late 20th century economists have tried to forget it.</p>

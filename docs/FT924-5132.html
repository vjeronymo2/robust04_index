			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Irish PM's future in balance after poll losses: Reynolds' Fianna Fail loses Dail seats in surge to Labour Party Abortion referendum proposal defeated THE political future of Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's Taioseach (prime minister), hangs in the balance following his Fianna Fail party's disastrous general election result this week and the equally humiliating defeat of a controversial abortion referendum. Speaking on Irish TV, however, he said: 'I am not throwing in the towel.' As the final results trickled in yesterday evening, it appears that the make-up of the next dail (parliament) will be Fianna Fail 68-69 seats, Fine Gael 45 seats, Labour 33-34 seats, Progressive Democrats 10 seats, others 10 seats. A total of 83 seats are required to form a majority government. When the election was called last month, following the break-up of the Fianna Fail-PD coalition, Mr Reynolds said his target was to win an absolute majority. Instead his party's share of the vote, 39 per cent, has slumped to its lowest level since the 1920s, while Labour has surged forward, doubling its vote and its number of seats. It therefore looks likely that the price Fianna Fail will have to pay to stay in power will be the ditching of Mr Reynolds. He has been leader only since last February, when he led a backbench rebellion against his predecessor Mr Charles Haughey. All the other party leaders have serious reservations about Mr Reynolds. He has made public his distaste of coalition governments, but even more important, the continuing judicial inquiry into the beef industry places a question mark over his credibility. The coalition collapsed last month in an acrimonious war of words between the two party leaders over who was telling the truth to the inquiry. It was sustained parliamentary questioning by the Labour leader, Mr Dick Spring, that led to the establishment of the inquiry last year. Mr Spring is due to be called to the witness stand next week to substantiate allegations of fraud and political favouritism he made in the dail, and Mr Reynolds will probably continue to be cast as the accused. The alternative coalition of Fine Gael-Labour-PD faces ideological obstacles as well as Mr Spring's insistence that he be given the prime minister's post, instead of Mr John Bruton, the Fine Gael leader. Mr Michael McDowell, the chairman of the PD party said yesterday: 'I would be very conscious of ideological incompatibility.' Mr Spring is likely to insist on the leadership as his price for supporting such a coalition, however. His fallback option, preferred by many of his party strategists, is to continue building the party in opposition with a view to making it the second force in Irish politics and forcing the right-of-centre parties into coalition. Labour party activists believe it may take until the new year before a new government can be formed, although the new dail reconvenes on December 14. Until then, Mr Reynolds must struggle on with his discredited, minority government, which will make even more difficult the task of defending the Irish currency on the financial markets. In the abortion referendum, with a third of the votes counted, the right of women to travel abroad for an abortion and to receive information on how to go about it has been overwhelmingly supported. However, a government proposal put forward by Mr Reynolds, which would allow abortion when the life of the mother is threatened, has been overwhelmingly defeated.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian board sells wheat to India THE AUSTRALIAN Wheat Board yesterday said it had sold 500,000 tonnes of wheat to India in a ADollars 100m (Pounds 35m) deal which marks the resumption of Australian sales to New Delhi after a gap of more than 10 years. Mr John Lawrenson, managing director, said the board expected to sell more wheat to India for shipment early next year to help cover a forecast shortfall of 1.5m tonnes in the Indian harvest. 'That will depend in large part on the progress of the monsoon, but I understand that so far it has not lived up to expectations and that the area sown to wheat in India may fall below what is required to maintain self-sufficiency,' Mr Lawrenson said. India is normally self-sufficient in wheat, and has been a modest exporter in previous years. The deal means returns of about ADollars 200 a tonne for Australian growers, compared with average returns of between ADollars 160 and ADollars 170 a tonne. The average return last season was ADollars 180 a tonne. The wheat board said the wheat contract had spin-off possibilities for Australian grain legume growers. 'India is a significant market for Australian field peas and chick peas, and given that we will be shipping large volumes of wheat we may be able to generate some freight advantages that will assist the sale of these crops,' Mr Lawrenson said.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / ICI to close ephedrine plant in Australia ICI AUSTRALIA, the subsidiary of Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK, is closing a ADollars 38m (Pounds 16m) plant at Newcastle in New South Wales only five months after it was fully commissioned. The plant which produces ephedrine, an ingredient for cough and cold remedies, made a pre-tax loss of ADollars 7m in the first half to 31 March, according to the subsidiary. The factory, the only of its kind in Australia, was built in the late 1980s to export to the Far East. However, competition from Japan and China has led to persistent losses. Mr Philip Weickhardt, general manager of the subsidiary's speciality chemicals operations, said the plant would be mothballed. 'It is unlikely we will be re-opening it for ephedrine production, as we do not see it as commercially viable,' he said. He added the company had a number of options for the fine chemicals plant including selling it. About 50 employees will be affected by the factory's closure. Restructuring of the European fibres industry continued as Akzo, Dutch chemicals group, announced reorganisation of its carpet fibres operations. The company is meeting unions with the intent to cut as many as 250 jobs beyond the 60 already agreed. The company said its carpet fibres business had been troubled for some time because falling demand had led to excess capacity and falling prices. Akzo said it is looking for a long-term partner to secure the future of the business.</p>

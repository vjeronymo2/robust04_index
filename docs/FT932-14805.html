			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: KIO launches writs in UK in effort to recover Dollars 500m THE KUWAIT Investment Office, the external investment arm of the Kuwaiti government, yesterday launched writs in the UK seeking recovery of more than Dollars 500m. The KIO alleges this sum was misappropriated from Grupo Torras, its Spanish business which is in receivership, and a London offshoot, Torras Hostench London. It named 22 defendants in the proceedings, including some of the former managers of Grupo Torras and Torras Hostench London. The actions are civil claims, based upon conspiracy to defraud, breach of directors' duties and breaches of trust. The writs come after the failure of the new management of the KIO to convince courts in Spain that their complaints warranted investigation and criminal proceedings. Both efforts were dismissed earlier this year in Madrid for lack of evidence of criminal acts. The writs issued in London yesterday draw in many more defendants than the Spanish proceedings. The new KIO management has claimed that all Dollars 5bn invested by Kuwait in its Spanish industrial empire since 1986 has been lost due to gross mismanagement by former KIO executives and Spanish managers. The writs name Sheikh Fahad al-Sabah, the former KIO chairman and a cousin of the emir of Kuwait, Mr Richard Robinson, a former head of the KIO's direct investments department, who left KIO in 1989, Mr Fouad Jaffar, the former KIO managing director, Mr Walid Makezou, a director of Torras Hostench London, and Mr Plinio Coll Gutierrez, Grupo Torras' former internal auditor. In addition, they name Mr Javier de la Rosa, the financier who managed the KIO's Spanish investments until May last year, and a number of his associates, Mr Miguel Soler Sala, former finance director of Grupo Torras, Mr Jorge Nunez, former managing director of Grupo Torras, Mr Narciso de Mir, a director of Quail Espana, Mr De la Rosa's investment company, which had a management contract with Torras, and Mr Juan Jose Folchi and Mr Joan Pique, two lawyers close to Mr De la Rosa. The writs also name Mr Michael Russell, a Jersey lawyer, and his firm Russell Limebeer, in addition to eight offshore companies apparently established in Jersey by the KIO and used in the financing of its Spanish investments. The companies named are Croesus International, Wardbase, Oakthorn, Westow, Anslow, Wantley Development, Coggia and Riquel. If the writs are successful and lead to a trial in the UK, vast amounts of information on the once highly-secret management of Kuwait's oil fortunes is likely to be made public.</p>

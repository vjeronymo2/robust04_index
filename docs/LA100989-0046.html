			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBES OF BRADLEY TAKING TOLL ON IMAGE AT CITY HALL  </P> <P> Affable and relaxed, Mayor Tom Bradley faced the news media one morning last  week to announce a new program aimed at cutting traffic and air pollution.  </P> <P> The event followed the customary format: a speech by the mayor, explanations  from aides and then the reporters' turn.  </P> <P> "Now, smart alecks, ask some questions," Bradley said, turning to the cameras.  </P> <P> Intended as an icebreaker, the remark got a laugh, but it underscored the  frustration of the five-term mayor as he tries to divert the attention of the  press and public from his financial affairs and project an image of  business-as-usual at City Hall.  </P> <P> Six months of persistent stories about local and, more recently, federal  investigations have taken their toll and signs have emerged that business is  anything but usual at City Hall. Not only has Bradley encountered what he  considers a hostile press corps for the first time in his career, but he also  faces increasing and unaccustomed friction with the 15-member City Council.  </P> <P> "Tom was very popular and it was not fashionable to take your cuts at him,"  Councilwoman Joy Picus said last week. "Now people don't mind saying what they  think and they can be very mean. This man who was, in fact, a paragon of virtue  has been blemished." A liberal who has worked with Bradley on issues such as  child care, Picus has nevertheless criticized him over the years as  inaccessible to council members.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boldness in the Council  </P> <P> Emboldened by what they view as a weakened and distracted mayor, some members  of the City Council have begun seizing power, pushing harder for their own  agendas, and testing the water for runs at Bradley's job, possibly before his  term ends in 3 1/2 years.  </P> <P> "There are many council members who are considering whether they should make a  run for the mayor's office," said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who has been  cautious in her criticism of the mayor. "And it's never too early to start."  </P> <P> In recent months, there has been a noticeable change in the relationship  between the mayor's office and the City Council, Flores said. "Members who in  the past have been kind of laid back and accepting of recommendations are  becoming more vocal," she said, and easy passage of the mayor's priority  programs "is no longer a given."  </P> <P> Councilman Michael Woo, whose Ad Hoc Ethics Committee began hearings last week  on the city attorney's investigation of the mayor, said he sees signs of  "chaos" in leadership at City Hall.  </P> <P> Bradley may no longer be able to provide "a strong vision of the future for the  city," said Woo, who was elected four years ago when he unseated a Bradley  ally. "I don't know where that vision is going to come from if it's not coming  from the mayor."  </P> <P> "Trying to move the City Council now is like trying to lead a herd of cats,"  Woo said last week. "You've got to have some glue to hold things together.  There is no glue here."  </P> <P> Bradley aides deny that the mayor's office has been hobbled by the continuing  scandal and say that initiatives announced in Bradley's inaugural address three  months ago are going forward. They say that new initiatives are being announced  every week but that the news media, especially The Times, have intentionally  ignored them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Complaints About Coverage  </P> <P> "If the Los Angeles Times were effective in crippling Tom Bradley, all you  would do is cripple the city of Los Angeles," Michael Gage, Bradley's chief of  staff, said in an interview Friday. City Council members, he said, take their  cue from The Times.  </P> <P> "There's been a blatant attempt by the Los Angeles Times to blank Tom Bradley  out of the paper with anything positive," Gage said.  </P> <P> For example, he said, The Times last week played on the obituary page a story  on the mayor's press conference to denounce U.S. Senate passage of a bill that  would exclude illegal aliens from the 1990 Census. The same day, Gage said, The  Times reported on the front of the Metro section that Bradley had turned over  his income tax returns to the U.S. attorney's office as part of a federal probe  of the mayor.  </P> <P> Deputy Managing Editor Noel Greenwood said that The Times has assessed news  from the mayor's office according to standards of relevance and fairness, and  will continue to do so.  </P> <P> Bradley has been at the center of an ethical controversy since last March, when  the first reports of his dealings with Far East National Bank surfaced  publicly. Bradley was paid $18,000 as a consultant to the bank, which received  $2 million in city deposits.  </P> <P> Last month, City Atty. James K. Hahn filed a civil suit against Bradley for  failing to disclose major personal stock holdings, but said he did not find  sufficient evidence to bring criminal charges. A federal grand jury  investigation of the mayor's finances has not been completed.  </P> <P> As the investigations have mounted, Bradley has made fewer public appearances  and vanished from public view for several days at a stretch on two occasions --  the latest last week when The Times disclosed details of the federal grand jury  investigation. He has dramatically cut back on contact with the press and  refused to be interviewed for this article.  </P> <P> One indication of the council's invigoration during the last six months is a  broad reorganization of its committee structure to focus more attention on  issues such as housing and the environment.  </P> <P> In one move that appeared specifically aimed at the mayor, the council created  a committee to assume authority over the multibillion-dollar Community  Redevelopment Agency, a domain that had been strictly the mayor's. Last week,  the committee refused to endorse a CRA plan to pay the Union Rescue Mission  $6.5 million to vacate its downtown building.  </P> <P> The plan goes before the City Council this week, but its prospects for approval  are unclear.  </P> <P> The strongest opposition came from Councilwoman Gloria Molina, chairwoman of  the recently created Community Redevelopment and Housing Committee, who  complained last week that the CRA was attempting to rush the plan through and  had not provided the council with enough information about the deal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ferraro's Assessment  </P> <P> The council's attack on the CRA has "been coming on for some time," said City  Council President John Ferraro, the architect of the new committee system. "The  CRA's been running around without any controls over it.  </P> <P> "There's concern that the mayor's been wounded, and maybe he has been," added  Ferraro, who ran against Bradley in 1985. "But I don't think it affects the  city operation."  </P> <P> Gage, the mayor's aide, said Bradley does not consider the new oversight of CRA  a slap, but instead points to the fact that the council voted down a proposal  to take over the CRA entirely. That, he said, was a recent victory for the  mayor.  </P> <P> "I think some council members have allowed themselves to be sidetracked," Gage  said. "At least half of them want to be mayor. Given that the mayor has been  battered pretty badly, why shouldn't they feel their oats?  </P> <P> "But it takes one person to provide leadership and each time one of them pokes  his head up, the others will push him down."  </P> <P> Another indication of the mayor's loss of influence was a rare council override  last week of a Bradley veto. It came in the matter of a temporary moratorium on  building in two pockets of the 10th District, represented by Councilman Nate  Holden, a Bradley foe.  </P> <P> Holden had backed the moratorium and won council approval, but Bradley vetoed  it. The council override, which came in a vote last Wednesday, prompted further  speculation about Bradley's leadership role.  </P> <P> "I'm worried that the vote sets a precedent for the future and points to  chaos," said Woo. "Even at best we suffer from a dispersal of authority. We run  the risk of heading into uncharted waters."  </P></p>

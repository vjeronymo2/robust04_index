			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu by </F> Cristina Trepcea in Strasbourg on 11 May: "Romania at the  Council of Europe"]    [Text] The ceremony to sign Protocol 11 of the European  Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms took place  in Strasbourg on 11 May during the session of the Committee of  Ministers of the Council of Europe. This is a key document of  the Convention, which, among other things, stipulates the rights  of citizens to turn directly to the Court for Human Rights --  obviously, only after all rights to appeal in the national legal  courts have been exhausted. The court in Strasbourg has the  right to cancel their decisions. On behalf of Romania the  document was signed by Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu.  Immediately after signing the document, the minister gave the  following interview to the daily ADEVARUL:    [Trepcea] Minister Melescanu, what does the signing of this  protocol mean for Romania?    [Melescanu] The signing of Protocol 11 for us fortunately  coincides with the ratification by the Romanian Parliament of  the European Convention on Human Rights. The signing of the  protocol completes an effort that started on the day when  Romania was admitted to the Council of Europe, an effort aimed  at connecting Romania to a system not only of international  standards on the issue of human rights, but also of verification  of the way in which these standards are being observed. For us,  there will be certain advantages in starting to apply the  convention -- after a very short period of adaptation -- to the  new system with a single and permanent European Court and with a  much simpler mechanism to solve all cases that refer to Romania.  It will also be a very interesting challenge because, as the  rule demands it, first of all, one should exhaust all means of  internal appeal and thus, we, as citizens, will have to resist  the temptation to bring every difficulty or problem to  Strasbourg. I hope that once this system comes into effect, we  will receive the necessary assistance in order to make known all  the advantages for us and beneficial conditions of this system.  For us, this is an extremely important step on the road of  connecting Romania to the European democratic standards.    [Trepcea] Protocol 11 is considered to be the most important  protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights and it is a  complex instrument that controls the respect of individuals'  rights. How will this instrument function in Romania and when do  you believe that it will be ratified?    [Melescanu] As a first stage, I would like us still to be  able to use the old system in two stages. If the government  accepts it, in the near future we will try to adapt to the  requirements of the convention, from the viewpoint of the  internal legislation as quickly as possible. Then, I believe  that it will be two years before Protocol 11 comes into effect.  My recommendation would be that, in this first period, we  should make preparations so that we can be among the first  countries that will ratify the protocol. There is no point in  making a gratuitous gesture, such as ratifying it before it  comes into effect. Let us concentrate on the fastest possible  integration of the current system and of the Romanian  legislation in the provisions of the convention, as it is today.    [Trepcea] Here one gets the impression that the officials in  Strasbourg would like the period that separates us from the  coming into effect of the protocol to be as short as possible,  because of the presence of the Russian Federation at the gates  of the Council of Europe.    [Melescanu] Yes, this is true that there is this political  desire. There are also practical reasons, because the current  difficult mechanism lessens the credibility of the system for  protecting human rights.</p>

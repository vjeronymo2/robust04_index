			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFF-ROAD GRAN PRIX CIRCUIT OPENS AT ANAHEIM STADIUM  </P> <P> Another competitive race for the manufacturers' cup in the mini- pickup class  begins at 7:30 tonight at Anaheim Stadium in the Mickey Thompson Off-Road  Championship Gran Prix.  </P> <P> Toyota has won the cup 6 straight times since its inception in 1983, but a new  drivers' lineup and some strong competition could end its domination.  </P> <P> Defending mini-pickup class champion Steve Millen has shifted from dirt racing  to the International Motor Sports Assn. GTO sports car racing. He has been  replaced on Team Toyota by 20-year-old Robby Gordon of Orange.  </P> <P> Gordon was voted the sport's rookie of the year in 1988 and was the youngest  recipient of the All-American auto racing award.  </P> <P> Veteran teammate Ivan Stewart was second in the series last year, and showed he  hasn't slowed any by recording the fastest lap (38.04 m.p.h.) in a practice  session Wednesday on the man-made, one-third-mile course that includes 700  truckloads of dirt.  </P> <P> Walker Evans, factory driver for Jeep, and Roger Mears, factory driver for  Nissan, are expected to be strong contenders after struggling in recent years.  </P> <P> Evans won at Denver and was leading at Las Vegas before he crashed in the final  events of the 1988 season. Mears has won only 2 stadium races since 1985, but  he has taken over operating controls of the team and recently completed a new  5-acre test center in Bakersfield.  </P> <P> Mazda, a close runner-up to Toyota last year, has disbanded its team because of  disputes with promoters over restrictions on its engines, but veteran driver  Glenn Harris will continue to drive a Mazda for a tire manufacturer.  </P> <P> Danny Thompson of Sunset Beach blew two engines testing his Chevrolet last week  and will be limited with last year's equipment that has 15 less horsepower than  his 1989 model truck.  </P> <P> The series also features classes in 1600cc dune buggy, 4-wheel All-Terrain  Vehicle, odyssey, ultrastock and motorcycle racing.  </P></p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / How Xinhua is pulling HK to China: The news agency is midwife of the colony's return to the motherland EARLY next month Mr Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua news agency in Hong Kong, will take a group of about 50 personalities from the colony to Beijing to receive their letters of appointment as 'advisers' to China on Hong Kong affairs. A year ago Mr Zhou presented the leadership with a glittering array of Hong Kong's leading plutocrats, including Mr Li Ka-shing, Mr Henry Fok, Sir Run Sun Shaw - three of the colony's richest men - and a smattering of former civil servants, judges and serving politicians. This April will be no different, except in one respect. Mr Zhou's latest trophy will be Sir David Akers-Jones, a former chief secretary of the colony, and a British civil servant of the old school. He resigned earlier this week from chairmanship of Hong Kong's Housing Authority - a position from which he has been an opponent of Governor Chris Patten's plans for more democracy in Hong Kong. What Sir David's and the other 50-or-so appointments to Beijing's court will underline is the gravitational pull of China and the corresponding waning of British power in Hong Kong. From Beijing's angle, Xinhua deserves much credit for hastening that process. In Hong Kong Xinhua is the face of the Chinese central government - a regime that rarely does anything unintentionally - in belligerent mode. In the run-up to 1997 it is the midwife to Hong Kong's return to the motherland. Its headquarters, faced in red granite, opposite the Happy Valley race course on Hong Kong Island, houses some 650 mainland officials. Journalists working for the news agency occupy the first six floors of its former HQ in Wanchai. Xinhua's role has changed with the demands of the time. During the Cultural Revolution it agitated against British rule in Hong Kong until Zhou Enlai, China's then prime minister, called a halt. During the 1970s, when China was still a diplomatic outcast, Xinhua's 'foreign affairs' department met diplomatic representatives of countries with which China had no formal ties. More recently, diplomats say, it has been the conduit for unofficial talks with South Africa and was China's channel for setting up diplomatic ties with Israel last year. The agency's work in Hong Kong is, however, the standard by which it is judged in Beijing. Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister, ought to be pleased with Mr Zhou's performance since he took over Xinhua in early 1990 from Mr Xu Jiatun - the highest ranking Chinese communist official to defect to the west. Mr Xu lacked revolutionary fervour in his later years and was an ideological casualty of Beijing's Tiananmen massacre in June 1989. Not so Mr Zhou. He is a man whose loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party is such that in spite of being a vigorous Cultural Revolutionary, for which he won few friends, he has gone from strength to strength in the era of Deng Xiaoping and 'opening to the outside world'. If 'hardline', 'moderate' and 'liberal' have any meaning in Chinese politics, then Mr Zhou is assuredly a hardliner. He has, according to western analysts and Xinhua employees, toughened up the organisation and overseen its 'united front' activities in the colony to great effect. The agency draws its senior officials from the upper echelons of the party. Mr Zhou, who holds ministerial rank in the Chinese government, is a career diplomat who has served in Pakistan and Tanzania, and at the United Nations. He was a member of the Chinese team which negotiated the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 and, last October, was appointed to the central committee of the Communist party. Fluent in English and fond of quoting Shakespeare, Mr Zhou is passionately anti-British. Some analysts attribute this to his early diplomatic experience of former British colonies; others to his first job. During the Korean War he interpreted for Chinese interrogators of Allied prisoners of war. 'POWs are often scared and they collaborate; their interrogators feel contempt for them,' said one observer. But Mr Zhou's claim to fame may be the accolade he received from Mr Deng after the Joint Declaration was agreed in 1984. UK officials saw him as one who tried to wreck those talks, but Mr Deng is reported to have said he did a good job, a commendation that has shielded Mr Zhou ever since, but one which may only be good for the term of Mr Deng's life. Other senior officials of the agency have held senior provincial government positions. Mr Qin Wenjun, the agency's No 2 deputy director, was the vice-major of Shenzhen, the 'special economic zone' to the north of Hong Kong. His responsibilities include 'co-ordination', or building a broad coalition of 'capitalist and bourgeois forces' in opposition to the British. He reports directly to the party's United Front department in Beijing. Xinhua has opted for the more neutral term 'co-ordination' so as not to offend the locals, one employee said. Mr Zhang Guoxiong, the agency's first deputy director, was formerly head of the Guangdong communist party's personnel department. He covers personnel issues and 'social work', Xinhua's liaison with trade unions. He is one of the few senior Xinhua officials who speak Cantonese, the dialect of Hong Kong and neighbouring Guangdong. The agency puts little trust in its locally recruited staff, a mirror of the Communist party's broader distrust of Hong Kong. Many of its local employees, who believed in the Joint Declaration's promise of 'Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong' with a 'high degree of autonomy', are dejected about the current turn of events. 'In theory, what China wants is a smooth transition,' says one. 'But in essence they want to control HK from behind the scenes. They are only interested in those who will follow what they say.'</p>

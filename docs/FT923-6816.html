			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Expamet rises 22% to Pounds 2.45m SHARES IN Expamet International rose 48 per cent yesterday from a nadir of 29p to 43p on news of a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.01m to Pounds 2.45m in the first half of 1992 and a halving of the interim dividend to 2.09p. As recently as June 12 the shares had stood at 152p. They had tumbled as inflated profits - overstated by Pounds 1m disguising a fall into losses - were discovered in early April in Brema-Air, the Dutch ducting subsidiary described by Mr John Roberts, group chairman since July 22, as 'a contracting company with no chiefs'. 'With a weak balance sheet, we couldn't manage it out,' he said, and so, in June, Brema-Air was sold. The company took an Pounds 9.2m extraordinary charge (Pounds 445,000) of which Pounds 8.6m was for the Dutch sale. A Pounds 4.8m write-off for goodwill in the profit and loss account resulted in a Pounds 3.8m, or 20 per cent, fall in shareholders' funds to Pounds 15.2m. With borrowings at Pounds 23m, gearing therefore rose from 45 to 150 per cent. Mr Roberts said the dividend cut was 'to conserve cash'. His target is to reduce borrowings to Pounds 12m by the year-end and gearing to below 40 per cent as soon as possible. Turnover of the security components, hydraulic engineering and metal building products group, was down at Pounds 70.9m (Pounds 76.2m). Operating profits dipped to Pounds 4.16m (Pounds 4.77m). However a 36 per cent reduction in interest charges to Pounds 1.44m (Pounds 2.25m) and lower exceptional charges for redundancies of Pounds 270,000 (Pounds 510,000) produced the pre-tax surplus. Earnings, now covering the halved dividend, grew to 2.8p (2.75p). COMMENT The share price rise suggests the pessimists behind its recent freefall have been silenced by these better-than-expected results. However, reducing borrowings from Pounds 23m to Pounds 12m will be difficult. Some Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m could come from retained profits and lower working capital but the balance will have to come from non-core disposals in a buyers' market. Getting gearing down below 40 per cent in 1993 depends more on general economic factors - a small rise in trading volumes can quickly boost profits in a group with high operational gearing. Expamet looks healthier with its new chairman and the Dutch problems swiftly resolved. New products in its sound businesses are likely to have a positive impact soon. Forecast full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 5.5m give earnings of 6.3p per share and an undemanding prospective p/e of 6.8. The shares look good value now. They will prove better value if the borrowings hurdle can be cleared.</p>

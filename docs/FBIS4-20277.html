			<p>BFN     [Text] The indirect talks on the implementation of the  package of confidence-building measures have ended without any  agreement. Speaking after the talks he held with President Rauf  Denktas today, Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative, said that an agreement has not been reached and  no progress has been made on the problem. President Denktas  said later that the talks ended at an impasse and broke off as a  result of the Greek Cypriot side's irreconcilable approach and  the holes that have been drilled in the confidence-building  measures package.    [Begin Denktas recording] The only reason for the conclusion  of the exercise in this way is the move they [UN officials] made  to include a road in the package, which the two sides agreed to  at the beginning on the condition that a change would not be  made in it. They asked that our troops be withdrawn from that  road. They abandoned their request for the withdrawal of our  troops today. Instead, they said that the troops must not be  visible from that road. How will they not be visible? We said  that that is not the only problem. We have another pending  problem, which is related to their map. We said: The process  will collapse if you insist on that map because we do not accept  it. You have given two maps to us. The first map was given to  us in New York on 1 May 1993. It was a realistic map, which  depicted the fenced area. We began the process of the talks on  the basis of that map. However, you submitted a new map one and  a half months ago. It took a piece of land from our military  area, a piece of land that has no connection with the fenced  area. Therefore, we cannot accept that map.    He [Joe Clark] said that the map was placed on the  negotiation table and that the talks would collapse if we did  not accept it. Well, why have you forced us to hold talks on the  question of access to Maras [Varosha] since the talks will  collapse because of that map? We cannot agree to that map.    Furthermore, we said that you have mentioned the question of  the use of the Nicosia Airport by Greek Cypriot passenger  aircraft. That matter was not included in the package.  Obviously, that is an addition to the package. Glavkos  Kliridhis put forward the condition that the airline companies  based in Cyprus would not use the airport. He also said that  that applied to the Cyprus Airways company. That is how we  agreed to the package. However, we were informed later that the  Cyprus Airways company would use the airport. Kliridhis further  said that the Turkish Cypriot Airlines company could use the  airport on the condition that its aircraft had no inscription or  logos on them. That meant that the Turkish Cypriot passenger  aircraft would take off and land like pirate aircraft.    Well, the concept of equality is a basic principle. We have  asked whether or not the same conditions would apply to the  Greek Cypriot passenger aircraft if we agreed to allow them to  use the Nicosia Airport. Will the inscriptions and logos on the  Greek Cypriot aircraft be erased? Will the Greek Cypriot  aircraft be under the UN administrator's control, as is the case  with the Turkish Cypriot aircraft? Will the Greek Cypriot  aircraft be registered in Athens? If not, then will the Greek  Cypriot side agree to the registration of our passenger aircraft  in Nicosia? Does the Greek Cypriot side agree to all that?    He said that the Greek Cypriots will not agree to all that.  The Greek Cypriot passenger aircraft will use Nicosia Airport  under their company name but will comply with the UN  administrator's conditions. Considering our demand for  equality, we asked whether the Turkish Cypriot aircraft would be  allowed only one flight if the Greek Cypriots ask for the right  to fly once a day? All that has not been clarified.    We have been informed that a fair and just system will be  established. However, the additions that have been made are  such that they will cause the package to collapse. The  recognition of that right for the Cyprus Airways Company will be  tantamount to recognizing the most fundamental political right  for the Greek Cypriot side at our expense. However, they do not  wish to realize that state of affairs. As far as they are  concerned, that right is very natural and the Cyprus Airways  Company can benefit from it.    As far as we are concerned, we cannot move any further in  light of such an approach. Meanwhile, a tangible form has not  yet been given to the rights they have promised to give to us.    We have been talking on the package. However, he informed us  today that we should take up the issues one by one, starting  with the question of access [to Varosa]. Why should we discuss  the question of access? It is related to your map, which I do  not accept. First, you should correct that map. We can hold  talks on it later. Considering the rights you have given to the  Greek Cypriots, let us use the northern part of Dhimokratias  Avenue. However, they have not even bothered to discuss the  matter.    In view of all that, I believe that they will probably  consider the matter once again. A new UN report may be drawn  up, in which we may be reprimanded. Nevertheless, considering  the promise we have made to our Republican Assembly, we have  acted with goodwill and moderation and maintained the talks  until now by agreeing to many points. Otherwise, the talks  would have ended a long time ago.    Mr. Clark is well aware of the fact that the UN officials  placed two maps on the negotiation table and that we have agreed  to the concept of holding talks on the fenced part of Maras.  Nevertheless, he disregarded that and said that is the map which  has been placed on the negotiation table, you have to accept it,  and it cannot be changed. That approach has undermined  everything.

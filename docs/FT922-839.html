			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Observer: New lady vanishes What a pity that sweet stories aren't always true - the one about the Old Lady being run by a woman, for example. It seems that Sarah Hogg will not, in fact, take over from Robin Leigh-Pemberton as Governor of the Bank of England on his retirement 12 months hence. For one thing, as head of the prime minister's policy unit, she is too valuable to John Major for him to countenance her leaving 10 Downing Street. For another, although extremely able, she lacks the tribal City background so far deemed essential in the governor's job. What is more, Major is well aware of the criticism he'd invite by putting one of his closest advisers in charge of the Bank at a time of growing pressure for it to be given greater independence. Indeed, if European economic and monetary union stays on track, the next governor will almost certainly have to stand free of Whitehall, Treasury opposition notwithstanding. But the main reason why 46-year-old Hogg won't be taking up the governorship is simply that she doesn't want the job. Hence the front-runners remain deputy governor Eddie George and Warburgs' Sir David Scholey. Even so, since no announcement of the successor is likely till around Christmas, there is still time for some more adventurous suggestions. Let's hope so, anyway.</p>

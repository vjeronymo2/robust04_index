			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: POP STARS ***** GREAT BALLS OF FIRE **** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR  *** GOOD VIBRATIONS ** MAYBE BABY * AIN'T THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> CYNDI LAUPER "A Night to Remember." Epic ** 1/2  </P> <P> The girl doesn't just want to have fun. She wants to sell records. For Lauper,  who slipped commercially after her smash 1983 debut, that means playing it  straight with her third album. Lauper's old goofiness is gone, replaced now by  sober professionalism. "A Night to Remember" is a polished work that is catchy  and well-crafted, consistently well-sung and disappointingly conventional.  </P> <P> Lauper covers all stylistic bases in a something-for-everyone fashion that  belies  </P> <P> an eye toward mega-sales. The assortment includes fervent ballads, snappy  dance-rock tunes, a solidly straightforward rocker after the style of "Money  Changes Everything," and incongruous opening and closing snippets of old-timey  Appalachian folk.  </P> <P> But most of the songs are one-dimensional affairs. Lauper and her cadre of  established hitmaking songsmiths go for a bland simplicity that has little room  for the well-turned phrase or the specific imagery and hint of emotional  ambiguity that can give pure pop some staying power. The best songs cast Lauper  in the role of a woman emerging from bad relationships: "Like a Cat," with its  taunting put-down of a domineering lover, and the more aching "Heading West"  and "I Don't Want To Be Your Friend," which resembles a Joan Armatrading song  in its dusky emotionalism.  </P> <P> Lauper, an inventive, versatile singer, proves here that she doesn't need her  old dizzy image to get by. But it would be nice to hear her push her talent  with songs that don't just skim the surface. MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

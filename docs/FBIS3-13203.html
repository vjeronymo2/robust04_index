			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yasir Abu-Hilalah] </F>   [Text] An arrest in al-Qasr in al-Karak Governorate has  raised many questions about what is wanted from Jordan, in  general, and from the Islamic institutions, in particular. The  following is the story of the arrest, as told by of detainee  'Abd-al-Majid al-Majali to security men in the presence of  witnesses:    Last Sunday, a person from al-Zarqa' visited 'Abd-al-Majid  in  al-Qasr. The two knew each other. The visitor had a small  carton with military hardware in it and asked 'Abd-al-Majid to  guard it until he returned in a few days to carry out a commando  operation against Jews from southern Jordan.    'Abd-al-Majid asked the person if the weapons were licensed.  The visitor said they were not, so 'Abd-al-Majid refused to  keep them inside his house but agreed to hide the carton  elsewhere, It ended up in the storage room of a house facing a  mosque belonging to a school for the Islamic Center Society.  Working hours were over on that day and the school's guard did  not know about it. The imam of the mosque refused to hide the  carton inside the mosque, so 'Abd-al-Majid hid the carton inside  a storage room that is separate from the house.    After that day's fast breaking meal, a group from the  security forces came from Amman. They headed directly for the  place where the military hardware was hidden. They searched the  place and seized the carton of ammunition. Afterwards, they  arrested the defendant who hid the carton. Full security  procedures on the incident were taken. 'Abd-al-Majid confessed  the entire story without any pressure and in the presence of  many witnesses.    When the security forces made inquiries, the school's  administration denied any knowledge of the incident and stressed  that the mosque is a public place frequented by many people.    The incident did not answer the following questions: How did  the first defendant from al-Zarqa' manage to tell the security  forces where the carton of military hardware was hidden on that  same day? Doesn't this indicate that he wanted to trap Islamic  institutions by taking advantage of some simple people? Why  weren't the weapons hidden outdoors or in one of the defendants'  houses instead of being hidden in a public place? Why does this  incident come now, closely following a wave of arrests on  security issues?    AL-SABIL met with 'Abd-al-Jalil al-'Awawidah, administrative  director of the Islamic Center Society, who commented on the  incident. He said: The Islamic Center Society is a national  institution that has been offering social, educational, and  health services for more than 30 years. It plays a commendable  role in shouldering the country's social burdens. It provides  social care for thousands of orphans and needy people. It also  offers educational services to thousands of the homeland's sons  in the various stages of education as well as health services.  He added: Throughout these years, not a single legal violation  was or will be recorded against the society.    On the recent arrest, al-'Awawidah said: As for reports  about a small carton containing military hardware that was found  inside a kindergarten for the society in al-Karak governorate,  the society is sure that the person who hid this small carton  and confessed to the security forces has nothing whatsoever to  do with the society. He is not a member of the society and he  does not work there either. Besides, he did not consult any of  the society's officials and acted on his own responsibility.    I do not rule out that he has evil intentions toward the  society--which is known for its good reputation--or that some  quarters pushed him to undermine the society--a society that is  known for its commendable services on the level of the Kingdom.  This is especially so since the room in which the carton was  seized is outside the kindergarten and school and has a separate  door that opens to the main road.    Just as the society's administration is concerned about  providing its educational, health, and social services to all  people in the kingdom, it spares no effort to keep its branches  and committees as beacons of the generosity and good that are  acquired from the Koran and the Sunna of God's prophet, may  God's peace and blessings be upon him.    The defendant's choice of one of the society's  kindergartens,  which also includes a mosque, is not surprising. Any public  place that offers its services to all people--such as the  mosques of the Ministry of Awqaf, the schools of the Ministry of  Education, and all the public institutions, whether governmental  or private--could have been chosen.    The final say is for the courts, in terms of who carried out  this act and whether it was done out of ignorance or ill  intentions. This confirms that Islamic institutions are targeted  by quarters hostile to the stability of Jordan, of which the  Islamists are a pillar.    AL-SABIL also met with 'Abdallah al-Majali, the detainee's  brother, who commented on the incident. He said: I have no  relation to the al-Faruq Islamic Schools, although I  contributed, to a large extent, in building these schools, which  have a special committee linked to the Islamic Center Society.  He added: The society's facilities play a pioneering role in  community service.    On the recent incident for which his brother was arrested,  he  said: His actions were individual and he is responsible for his  behavior. We do not approve of any act that harms the security  of the country. He added: The security and stability of the  country is the responsibility of everyone.</p>

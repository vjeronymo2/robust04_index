			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAVY METAL GROUPS STRIKE A SOUR CHORD  </P> <P> The article by Bob Sipchen on Hollywood's heavy metal nightclub scene really  hit home ("Rock City," June 8).  </P> <P> I used to head out to Sunset Boulevard every weekend to catch the latest bands,  but that was several years ago.  </P> <P> I stopped because I got tired of seeing either of the following: dimwitted  "death metal" basket cases who play fast merely for the sake of playing fast  with no regard for emotion save blind rage, or oversexed playboys who spend  more time moussing their hair and searching for groupies than putting any  thought behind their music. It all added up to self-serving, meaningless  garbage.  </P> <P> Sipchen's article has proven to me that nothing has changed. Los Angeles metal  is suffering musically because the musicians and club-goers who pack Hollywood  on any given night aren't there to change the direction of rock and roll, but  to fulfill their pipe dreams of either being famous or knowing someone who is.  That's why great bands like Soundgarden and Faith No More are coming from  elsewhere.  </P> <P> No wonder no one takes heavy metal music seriously.  </P> <P> DARRYL DAWSON  </P> <P> Harbor City  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The president of Ukraine has signed an edict on  introducing into circulation state commodity bonds of Ukraine's  material resources. The Ukrainian credit fund has been  designated as the issuing body. The funds received from the  sale of the bonds on a competitive basis are to be invested in  programs to develop and modernize enterprises. Foreign currency  revenue from the sale of the bonds, received by enterprises to  carry out the development programs, is counted as credit funds  and is not subject to compulsory sale or taxation.    The bonds are issued in series. The president of Ukraine  takes the decision to issue each series. The edict envisages  the issue of the first series of bonds, numbering 400 units with  a nominal value of $25 million each -- a total value of $10  billion, on terms of payment of 7.75 percent annual interest.</p>

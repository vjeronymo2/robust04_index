			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gennadiy Kulagin] </F>   [Text] Almaty May 27 TASS -- Kazakh Parliament has given a  vote of no confidence to the government's socio-economic and  legal policies.    The lawmakers resumed discussing the statement "on  governmental policies," which was earlier submitted by a group  of 42 deputies, at the morning plenary session. The statement  has been discussed by the lawmakers to no avail for a week,  because many of them opposed the extremely sharp criticisms of  the cabinet contained in the statement.    Today, however, majority of lawmakers (96 out of 177) came  out in favour of the statement, the wording of which has been  finalized by the parliamentary committees.    First, leaders of the parliamentary committees, leaders of  the four political factions which were legalized yesterday, and  several legislators, who had signed the statement, took the  floor.    Next, a coordinating editing commission was formed to  finalize the wording of the statement. It brought together  representatives of all committees, factions and the initiators'  group. Deputy parliament speaker Marat Ospanov chaired the  commission.    At the evening plenary session, the legislators gave a vote  of no confidence to the socio-economic and legal policies of the  government.</p>

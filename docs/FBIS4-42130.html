			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that  linking the U.S. military aid extended to Turkey to human  rights, the antiterror struggle, and the Cyprus issue is  extremely irrelevant. Ciller announced that following the U.S.  Congressional decision on the subject, Turkey will reassess the  aid issue and if necessary will reject it.    Ciller, who is currently in Boston in the United States,  conducted a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill  Clinton. Ciller reported that the conversation focused on  various issues concerning the two countries. Ciller said that  she told Clinton that the Turkish people will find it difficult  to understand the Congressional decision to suspend 25 percent  of the foreign aid earmarked for Turkey for 1995.    The prime minister explained that during the telephone  conversation she stressed that linking U.S. aid to human rights,  the antiterror struggle, and the Cyprus problem is extremely  irrelevant to the issue. Ciller said: I informed Mr. Clinton  that I will reassess the aid issue and if necessary reject it.  The President, in turn, related that he will undertake all the  necessary initiatives and expressed the hope that he will obtain  results on the matter.    According to Ciller, Clinton said: You can tell the Turkish  people that the U.S. Administration regards this issue with  equal sensitivity. Ciller also expressed the hope that Clinton  will undertake initiatives on the subject of aid.</p>

			<p>920605 FT  05 JUN 92 / Rivers watchdog sees improvement THE National Rivers Authority said yesterday that there was an 'underlying trend of real and sustained improvement' in the quality of bathing waters. That is in spite of a fall in the number of beaches reaching European Community standards last year. The NRA's second annual report on bathing water found that 312 out of 414 beaches, or 75.4 per cent, complied with EC standards. That was down from 78.1 per cent in 1990 .</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Communities face uphill task in spite of Pounds 1bn aid A PACKAGE of aid worth Pounds 1bn for coalfield areas affected by pit closures was outlined yesterday by the government. But experience of earlier closures suggests that the measures are unlikely to prevent a big rise in local joblessness. The money will cover redundancy payments of up to Pounds 37,000, depending on length of service and weekly earnings, as well as measures aimed at regenerating local economies. The 30,000 redundancies announced yesterday bring to about 170,000 the number of miners who have lost their jobs since the end of the miners' strike in March 1985. The link between pit closures and local unemployment is not straightforward in areas that are depressed, but unemployment levels in 'travel to work' areas affected by pit closures are on average about 3 percentage points higher than the national figure of 9.9 per cent. The picture is worse in the mining communities, with parts of Barnsley, for example, suffering unemployment of 20 per cent. Recent government projections indicated that unemployment in travel to work areas might rise by an average of almost 2 percentage points as a result of the 29 pit closures then envisaged. Since 1987, the main body charged with finding jobs for miners has been British Coal Enterprise. BCE says it has resettled 80 per cent of the 20,000 former miners' who have approached it - about a third of those made redundant since it started work. Many miners return immediately to the industry, employed by private contractors on short-term contracts. Many others move into driving, security and warehousing jobs, where BCE concedes they earn less than they did at the pit. A 1988 study of Yorkshire miners found that 10 per cent of former miners who had found work were earning between Pounds 70 and Pounds 100 a week less than they had with British Coal. Mr Steve Clemerson, BCE's outplacement manager, said: 'We would like everyone to come to us, but there are those who find work for themselves, take early retirement or simply want nothing more to do with British Coal or its subsidiaries.' The Coalfields Communities Campaign, an alliance of local authorities, argues that BCE-aided workers often displace other local labour, so that the overall level of unemployment in an area is unaffected. The campaign says coalfield areas need a package like the one Corby's steelworkers got when they lost their jobs in 1980. For the next three years coalfield areas will benefit from Pounds 135m under the Rechar programme, an EC initiative intended to regenerate the areas.</p>

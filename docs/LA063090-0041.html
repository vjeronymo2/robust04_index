			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> WELFARE INCREASE DELAY IS SIGNED  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian quickly signed a bill Friday to delay for one month the  required cost-of-living increases for welfare mothers and children. The  Legislature passed the bill by Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno) Thursday to  give leaders more flexibility in ongoing budget negotiations.  </P> <P> State law would otherwise require the 4.6% cost-of-living increases to begin  Sunday for recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The bill  suspends those increases for a month, along with increases for in-home  supportive services and county health services. Lawmakers and the governor have  been unable to reach agreement on a budget for the 1990-91 fiscal year that  begins Sunday. Deukmejian has proposed freezing welfare benefits as part of a  final budget compromise. If the increases had been allowed to take effect, it  would have been legally difficult to change benefits later this month.  </P></p>

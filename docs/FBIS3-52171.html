In an interview with the Arabic-language daily AL-HAYAH,  published in London, Beirut and other Arab capitals, Yoel  Zinger, said: "We must expect a delay of a few weeks or months,  but this situation must not drag out further since the agreement  risks meeting the same fate as that of Camp David."    Zinger is the Israeli foreign ministry's legal advisor who  helped formulate the declaration of principles for progressive  Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories signed  September 13 in Washington.    Subsidiary clauses of the 1978 Camp David accords between  Israel and Egypt calling for proposed autonomy in the occupied  territories have remained a dead letter.    Zinger added: "A further delay in implementation (of the  autonomy accord) could lead to the collapse of the PLO."    He said Israel had wanted to negotiate a peace deal with the  Palestine Liberation Organization because the organization was  in danger of disappearing.    "We figured it was in nobody's interest for it to disappear  and for Israel to remain alone facing several organizations,  none of which is able to speak in the name of all the  Palestinian people and to impose itself on them," he added.    Israel and the PLO have still not reached agreement on  control of international crossing points on the Gaza Strip and  in the West Bank town of Jericho, the first regions earmarked  for autonomy, a senior PLO official said Friday.    The disagreement has delayed the withdrawal of Israeli  troops  from Gaza and Jericho, which had been scheduled for December 13  under the terms of the autonomy accord.    Palestinian negotiators have proposed to their Israeli  counterparts the resumption Monday in Egypt of talks on  implementation of the accord, the PLO's representative in Egypt  said Friday.    Sayid Kamal told AFP the PLO was waiting for Israel's reply  on resuming the negotiations, which began October 13 in the  Egyptian Red Sea resort of Tabah.</p>

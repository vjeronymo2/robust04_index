			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> POLAND'S MAZOWIECKI TO VISIT U.S. FOR TALKS  </P> <P> Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki is going to the United States to seek support  for the Solidarity-led government's demand that a treaty guaranteeing Poland's  western border be signed before Germany unifies.  </P> <P> The former Solidarity editor and political prisoner leaves Warsaw today for a  six-day visit to the United States, with a one-day stop in Canada. It will be  Mazowiecki's longest abroad since he was elected in August.  </P> <P> Treaties commit the two Germanys to respect the Oder and Neisse rivers as  Poland's western border, but a unified Germany is not bound by those terms.  </P></p>

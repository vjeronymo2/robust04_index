			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Fomin] </F>   [Text] Chita April 4 TASS -- A special regime of  electricity supply was introduced in the Chita region this week.  Several days ago the management of the territorial branch of  the Sibenergo energy generating amalgamation threatened to  disconnect the eastern part of the Baykal region from the single  power grid of Russia for delays in the payment of debts.  Partially the threat was put into effect: Electricity supply to  the Chita region from neighbouring regions was reduced almost by  three times. As a result of it, a schedule of switching off  cities and districts one after another began to be implemented  today. Industrial enterprises are being supplied with  electricity under an emergency regime. Freight and passenger  traffic at the trans-Siberian railway line may come to a  standstill.    Commenting on the situation, Valeriy Lomako, first deputy  head of the regional administration, told ITAR-TASS that the  local government authorities are trying to prevent a complete  energy blockade of the area by holding talks with Sibenergo. A  compromise has not yet been reached, because the region has no  money to pay the debt, and there are no other sources of  financing in sight. In the opinion of Lomako, the conflict  between the region and Sibenergo can hardly be settled without  the interference of the Russian Government.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director finds that these proposed revisions, unless specifically discussed below, are no less effective than the Federal regulations and is approving them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Provisions Not Discussed That Are Substantively the Same as the Counterpart Federal Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes revisions to rules that contain language that is the same or similar to the counterpart Federal regulations, replace Federal references and terms with appropriate State references and terms, or add specificity without adversely affecting other aspects of the program regulation. The Director, therefore, finds that these proposed revisions to Iowa's regulations are no less effective in meeting SMCRA's requirements than the Federal regulations. These revisions are as follows (Federal regulation counterparts are indicated in brackets): IAC 27&hyph;40.4(207) and 40.4(6), concerning the permanent regulatory program and the exemption for coal extraction incidental to the extraction of other minerals [30 CFR Part 702]; IAC 27&hyph;40.4(7)(f)(2), concerning the impact of a request for administrative review by persons adversely affected on an exemption determination [30 CFR 702.11(f)(2)]; IAC 27&hyph;40.4(8)(3), concerning the impact of a petition for administrative review on a decision to revoke an exemption [30 CFR 702.17(c)(3)]; IAC 27&hyph;40.31(15), concerning a permittee's right to appeal for administrative review [30 CFR 773.21(c)]; IAC 27&hyph;40.33(1) and (2), concerning general content requirements for permit applications [30 CFR 777.11(a)(3) and 777.14(a)]; IAC 27&hyph;40.35(1) and (3), Vegetation information and land use [30 CFR 779.19(a) and (b)]; IAC 27&hyph;40.35(9), Climatological information [30 CFR 779.18]; IAC 27&hyph;40.35(13), Identification of public roads [30 CFR 779.24(h)]; IAC 27&hyph;40.51(5), concerning soil productivity levels required for release of performance bonds on prime farmlands [30 CFR 800.40(c)(2)]; IAC 27&hyph;40.73(2)g, concerning notification of owners and controllers of a permit upon issuance of a cessation order [30 CFR 843.11(g)]; IAC 27&hyph;40.74(6), concerning procedures to prepare a request for a hearing on a violation [30 CFR 845.19]; IAC 27&hyph;40.74(7), concerning procedures for determining final assessment of a violation [30 CFR 845.20]; and IAC 27&hyph;40.75(3), concerning final order and opportunity for review of a penalty assessment [30 CFR 846.17(b)(1)]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Iowa Code Chapter 207 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the letter dated July 8, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IA&hyph;383), submitting revised language for the proposed amendment in response to OSM concerns, Iowa notified OSM that the Iowa Code has been reorganized in an attempt to achieve more logical groupings by agency and function in the Code. Therefore, Iowa Code chapter 83 is now Iowa Code chapter 207. Iowa indicated that no substantive changes were made to the statute. All references to Iowa Code chapter 83 in the Iowa Administrative Code have been revised to read Iowa Code chapter 207. OSM approves the recodification based upon its understanding that no substantive changes were made to the statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Provisions Adopting Suspended Federal Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Iowa proposes to adopt by reference several Federal regulations or portions thereof that are suspended. In its cover letter dated July 8, 1993, Iowa indicated it's intention to adopt the suspension rule announcements located at the end of the sub-Parts to the Federal regulations as published in the Code of Federal Regulations. Accordingly, the Director considers any proposed Iowa rule adopting a suspended Federal regulation noted in the 30 CFR as of July 1, 1992, to also be suspended in the State program. Therefore, the Director finds that with this clarification, these proposed State rules are no less effective than the Federal counterpart regulations and is approving them. The following is a list of the proposed Iowa rules adopting suspended Federal regulations as noted in the July 1, 1992, 30 CFR and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices that explain the Federal suspensions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENROLLMENT INCREASE MARKS TURNAROUND IN GARDEN GROVE  </P> <P> This year's growth in enrollment at the Garden Grove Unified School District,  the county's second-largest, has reversed a 20-year downward trend.  </P> <P> And higher birth rates in the areas served by the district indicate that the  increase in student enrollment will continue, district officials say.  </P> <P> Figures from the district's office of business services show an increase of 561  students this year over last school year, bringing enrollment to 36,725, a 1.6%  increase.  </P> <P> The district's enrollment peaked in the 1968-69 school year with 53,114, when  it was then the county's largest district.  </P> <P> A recently released state report examining birth rates projected large  increases in California's school enrollment. District information officer Alan  Trudell said that birth rates in the cities the district serves -- Garden  Grove, and portions of Santa Ana, Westminster, Fountain Valley, Stanton,  Cypress and Anaheim -- indicate that growth in the district is expected to keep  going up.  </P> <P> The latest data available shows that in 1987 Garden Grove's birth rate was 19.5  per 1,000, while for Santa Ana, which provides 25% of the district's children,  the birth rate was 33.9 per 1,000, nearly twice the county average, Trudell  said.  </P></p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Mubarak under fire over quake: Riot police deployed after protests by homeless RIOT police were deployed in force near key government buildings and embassies in Cairo yesterday following a night of disturbances in the city's inner suburbs. The protests, fuelled by frustration among thousands of homeless people over a perceived slow official reaction to last week's earthquake, carried ominous overtones for the government which has been under increasing pressure from Islamic extremists. Police sealed a main thoroughfare through the slum suburb of Boulaq and fired tear-gas at stone-throwing youths in a night of tension. A bridge across the Nile was partially closed to prevent protesters crossing into the Zamalek area where many senior officials live. Most worrying for the authorities were the angry chants directed against President Hosni Mubarak plus the conspicuous role of various Islamic groups. Near the Shura Council, or upper house of the parliament, hundreds demonstrated on Saturday, giving vent to the frustrations of Cairo's crowded streets and alleyways. 'Mubarak, you have to collect your shame and get your children off the streets,' people shouted. 'Where have you been Mubarak - you went asking for aid and came back to us with a few bars of soap.' Mr Mubarak, who cut short a visit to China to oversee the relief effort, defended his government's efforts at a press conference on Saturday. 'I think the government since this problem started has done its maximum . . .,' he declared. However he conceded that there had been shortcomings in providing emergency assistance. 'The lesson for the Egyptians and the government and all the authorities in this country is just to try to educate the people how to react when ever there is any emergency,' he said. More than 500 people were killed and some 6,000 injured in the earthquake, which measured 5.5 on the Richter scale. Government estimates put total losses at about Dollars 300m (Pounds 174.4m) with 8,000 structures either destroyed or rendered unsafe. The ruling National Democratic party has been unnerved, by the speed with which Islamic groups mobilised to help people in distress. Within hours of last Monday's disaster, Islamic charitable organisations had established relief centres in poor neighbourhoods hardest hit by the earthquake. They wasted no time in providing funds for the destitute and help for families made homeless. Their activities stood in marked contrast to official efforts. The Islamic mainstream Moslem Brotherhood and more overtly militant religious groups have been mounting a spirited challenge to the government for the hearts and minds of Egypt's 57m people, many of whom live in grinding poverty. Hard-pressed government officials pledged to house the thousands of homeless within days, and have begun handing out money to quake victims, but Egypt's bureaucracy has appeared slow to meet the challenge. The earthquake-inspired disturbances come amid a marked increased of civil unrest in recent weeks, prompted by widespread economic hardship plus growing anger at harsh police measures and perceived government corruption.</p>

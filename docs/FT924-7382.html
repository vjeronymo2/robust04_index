			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Business and the Law: Greek state aid law condemned by Court  -European Court In the third case to raise the compatibility of Greece's general state aid law with the second European Community company law directive, the European Court has again condemned the Greek law. Law 1386/1983 gives the Greek government power to grant aid to Greek industry. In permitting a capital increase of a company by decision of the minister for the economy, without holding a general meeting, it does not satisfy the second directive's requirements for safeguards for minority share-holders. The law was also the subject of European Commission Decision 88/167/EEC. Brussels declared that it had no objections to the implementation of the law provided certain conditions were satisfied. One condition was that Greece should comply with the second company law directive by December 31 1987 at the latest. In response to a third question referred in the present case, the ECJ ruled that the condition imposed did not authorise Greece by way of derogation to maintain in force provisions infringing the second company law directive until the end of 1987. The Court confirmed that the treaty rules on state aid do not permit the Commission to authorise member states to derogate from treaty rules other than those on state aid. Case C-134 and C-135/91, Kerafina and others v Greece, ECJ 6CH, November 12 1992. Motor insurance liability clarified The ECJ has clarified the rules in the European Community motor insurance directives determining the country in which a vehicle is normally kept. The Court held that the rule concerning the territory of the member state of which a vehicle bears a registration plate referred to a registration plate properly issued by a member state. The Court said that was the only interpretation consistent with the objectives of the motor insurance directives to remove border checks on motor cars by limiting such checks to the registration plate. If a registration plate appears to be properly issued there should be no further checks. Proof of registration may only be required when the plate is visibly false. Case C-73/89, Fournier v van Werven, ECJ 6CH, November 12 1992. No judgment enforcement without proper service or initiating proceedings On a reference from the German Bundesgerichtshof, the ECJ has interpreted the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments as meaning that an English High Court default judgment may not be recognised for enforcement purposes in Germany, when the writ initiating the proceedings had not been properly served on the defendant in accordance with German law on civil procedure. This interpretation applied regardless of whether or not the defendant had knowledge of the judgment and had not used the procedures available to him in his home state. Case C-123/91, Minalmet GmbH v Brandeis Limited, ECJ 4CH, November 12 1992. Convention on origin designations between France and Spain upheld The ECJ interpreted the Rome Treaty's rules on free movement of goods as permitting geographic descriptions of confectionery and designations of origin to be protected by a 1973 bilateral convention between France and Spain, provided the protected descriptions and designations did not have a generic character in the country of origin at the time the convention came into force, or since. Case C-3/91, Exportatur SA v LOR SA and Confisserie du Tech, ECJ FC, November 10 1992. Other cases In the context of a dispute over German meat health inspection charges, the ECJ held that a Council Decision had direct effect and could be relied on in national proceedings against national authorities responsible for its implementation, once the deadline for implementation had expired. Case C-156/91, Hans Fleich v Landrat des Kreises Schleswig-Flensburg, ECJ 2CH, November 10 1992. BRICK COURT CHAMBERS, BRUSSELS Judge Edward Judge David Edward, the British judge at the European Court, has asked us to make clear that certain statements about cases currently before the Court made in last week's column were comment and not made by him in a speech to the UK Association for European Law in London.</p>

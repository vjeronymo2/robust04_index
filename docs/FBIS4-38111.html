			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muslim Brotherhood leader Hamid Abu-al-Nasr </F> by Sha'ban 'Abd-al-Rahman; place and date not given]    [Text] ['Abd-al-Rahman] How do you assess all the recent  intense talk about the Muslim Brotherhood [MB] and are there  certain reasons or background to that talk?    [Abu-al-Nasr] What has been or being said about the  Brotherhood is assessed according to the parties involved. Such  parties include the security authorities, government-run  newspapers, the official media, and a number of people with  leftist and secular inclinations, although their popular effect  is less than limited. But perhaps the opportunity for publicity  given to them through various media made them look different  from their real weight and size and made them look more  vociferous. Their status is known because their stance on Islam  is known.    Speaking about security authorities, everyone recalls the  interior minister's statement a few days ago that the Muslim  Brothers are preachers and have nothing to do with terrorism.  But shortly afterward he said that the Muslim Brothers support  terrorism. This statement came after the president's interview  with the German newspaper DER SPIEGEL, in which he said that the  Muslim Brothers were behind terrorism, which was followed with a  propaganda campaign by the government-run newspapers depicting  the Muslim Brothers as a terrorist group that supports terrorism  and forms clandestine organizations. The campaign also  indicated that a funds secretary of one of the trade unions had  provided terrorism with a quarter of a million pounds. This was  stated by a person whom the security authorities presented on a  television program.    This series of events and developments suggests a great  deal,  especially if we remember that senior official circles stated  some time ago that the Muslim brothers followed a democratic  course in the country's political activity.    There have been varying explanations for the situation. Some  suggested that this was a campaign to stem the Islamic upsurge  by restricting the preachers and barring them from preaching for  the cause of Almighty God by giving advice, barring them from  seeking unity based on love and brotherhood and from reviving  the spirit in a religious context and raising it on pride,  dignity, and sacrifice. Other explanations suggested that the  official stand escalated after the crisis that emerged between  the Lawyers Association [LA] and the state authorities following  the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani and that this  situation has spread to cover all the trade unions. Others have  another explanation. They say that with the preparation for the  [national] dialogue and the exclusion of the Muslim Brothers,  the situation required a justification for this exclusion and  for preparing the way to rally the participants in the dialogue  against the Islamic trend.    Other explanations cite fears and expectations by officials  based on the vision of some circles, saying that the Muslim  Brothers are seeking to take power and that they are close to  this goal and hence a measure of confrontation is necessary.  Other explanations refer to the Gaza-Jericho Accord and the  Muslim Brothers' stand on it. Meanwhile, some opposition  newspapers reported that there had been U.S. memoranda warning  against the Islamic upsurge and saying that the Muslim Brothers  were close to taking power.    Still others said that the People's Assembly elections are  approaching and it is necessary to prevent the continuation of  the alliance among the Muslim Brothers and to prevent this  alliance from taking part in these elections.    Despite all this, the Muslim Brothers stress two points.  First, they are preachers and not seekers of power and all they  aim for is God's retribution. Second, their stands on various  issues are based on principles derived from God's Book and His  Prophet's traditions, and that there is no vagary, whim, or  private interest behind defining a view or stance.    ['Abd-al-Rahman] Relations between the government and the  Brotherhood in the past were calm. So what made them erupt in  this way? Could the Lawyers Association [LA] incidents be the  sole cause?    [Abu-al-Nasr] We have said that there are several  explanations propounded by a number of parties. Though the LA  incidents could have caused the eruption, as has been observed,  we do not believe that they were the sole cause. We have  referred to a number of explanations for the tense situation as  given by some people.    ['Abd-al-Rahman] Talking about the LA, what is the  relationship between the Brotherhood, as a group, and the  professional associations and the Brotherhood members in their  councils?    [Abu-al-Nasr] The Brotherhood has no ties with the  associations. The latter have their own elected councils and  they include thousands of the cream of this country's sons who  have the brains, intellect, knowledge, awareness, and expertise  to manage the country's affairs independently. They realize and  are aware of the gravity of their professional and national  duties. That is how the associations are and everybody knows  about their affairs and conditions. Members of these  associations' councils who belong to the Islamic tendency have  undertaken their responsibilities or been tasked with them  through elections which they fought as citizens who have the  right to do so. They are doing their job and fulfilling their  duties through the associations' councils and within the  associations' framework and not through the Brotherhood.    ['Abd-al-Rahman] What is your response to the terms of  seizure, control, and occupation of the associations which the  media are using against the Brotherhood?    [Abu-al-Nasr] Control, onslaught, occupation, and illegal  seizure of the associations are not concepts but expressions of  impotence, bankruptcy, and evasiveness which this or that party  are using. Members of the associations are depicted as being so  naive as to allow opportunities for their associations to be  seized or their affairs to be pounced upon while remaining  oblivious to all this.    The Brotherhood has not entered the associations through the  window or infiltrated them during the night. It has not changed  the ballot boxes or cards or massed the security forces or the  militias to suppress the associations' members and impose its  own councils on them. Muslim Brothers entered as candidates in  free and honest elections that were under the full supervision  of the judiciary. The members voted freely and safely without  rigging or pressure. They sided with those who derive their  principles from God's Book and His Prophet's teachings.    I believe that it is the believers' right to ask: Why  shouldn't free and fair elections be the arena for the honest  confrontation? Why are the Muslim Brothers accused of illegal  seizure when they have won through clean ballots and under the  supervision of the unbiased judiciary? Why are the others loath  to admit what is right and factual and then resort to  propagating false claims? Is it not ridiculous, for example, to  say that the Brotherhood has seized control of the LA even  though extremely honest elections were held under judiciary  supervision led by a Coptic brother counselor?    These are claims of bankruptcy or avoidance of reality but  they do not deceive the noble Egyptian people and do not affect  the awareness or determination of the associations' members.    ['Abd-al-Rahman] So what has happened to change the  situation  and make President Mubarak and the government media describe you  all of a sudden as being behind terrorism and say that you are  managing the associations from the Brotherhood's guidance office?    [Abu-al-Nasr] Following the LA's incidents, one of the  government's papers said that the Brotherhood is managing the LA  from its guidance office. It presented conflicting and tenuous  justifications for this claim. It wrote that the Brotherhood  exploited the death of Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani to instigate  the LA incidents and create troubles that would embarrass the  authorities. It also said that al-Madani belonged to terrorist  organizations and therefore the Brotherhood exploited his case  and this proved there was a link between the Brotherhood and  terrorism. The same paper then said that the Brotherhood  instigated the LA incidents in order to gain popularity that  would ensure the success of its candidates in the coming  elections. All these are flimsy excuses whose main objective is  to accuse the Brotherhood of terrorism. But these claims are  contradictory and farcical and this shows just how false they  are. Yet the responsible and media quarters used them to launch  a campaign against the Brotherhood and to level accusations  against the Muslim Brothers.    ['Abd-al-Rahman] Exactly what effect is this campaign  against you having on your proselytizing, the way you  proselytize, your participation in Egypt's political life,  social activities, and your dealings with the government and the  authorities in general?    [Abu-al-Nasr] We are preaching for God Almighty with the  right words and good example. Proselytizing is the duty of  every Muslim and is not an easy road or one strewn with roses.  It is a call for love, brotherhood, cordiality, sympathy, work,  sacrifice, pride, might, and independence. Those preaching  God's word are continuing along their road and course and are  seeking only God's blessing and mercy. If someone follows this  course and has this as his objective, then what can impede him  from doing his duty and job?    We are participating and will participate in the political  life through all legitimate ways and means. We will do so  tomorrow as we did in the past. We will deal with people the  way God's preachers deal with everybody. We are seeking only  what is good for Egypt and its people, both rulers and ruled.  We pray to God to guide everybody toward working according to  His Book and His Prophet's teachings and to strengthen the ties  of love among Egypt's sons.    The Muslim Brothers condemn terrorism, fight terrorism, and  are subjected to it when their freedoms are confiscated and  their proselytizers are pursued, imprisoned, detained, or hanged.    ['Abd-al-Rahman] What effects is this campaign against you  having on your stand on terrorism and the mutual killings  between the authorities and some Islamic trends groups?    [Abu-al-Nasr] Our stand on all forms and sources of  extremism  and terrorism does not change because it is a principled one.  We have condemned terrorism and will continue to do so.  Several years ago, we published the book "Proselytizers and Not  Judges" by the late Hasan al-Hudaybi, the former Brotherhood  leader, so as to correct the concepts and fight terrorism.  Freedom, security, and safety are every citizen's right. It is  an inherent right that God has granted to man. People's rights  are inviolable. God made them and Islam has stressed them, that  is their lives, properties, and honor. For God, these are more  sacrosanct than the al-Qa'bah.    ['Abd-al-Rahman] Is there an indirect link between this  campaign against you and the Brotherhood's strong opposition to  peace with the Zionist enemy? Could this campaign affect your  stand?    [Abu-al-Nasr] Our stand on the Gaza-Jericho agreement is a  principled one. Our stand on the usurping Jewish entity is also  a principled one. Palestine is an Arab, Islamic country and its  cause is an Islamic one. Those who have the right to it cannot  relinquish a single inch of it or concede any part of it because  this would be against the shari'ah of God Almighty who has  ordered jihad to liberate the land, avenge honor, and expel the  hostile intruder. The nation should be taught this through the  media, culture, education, and all possible ways and means.    ['Abd-al-Rahman] How do you reply to the constant attempts  and propaganda to accuse the Brotherhood of terrorism or of  encouraging it by referring to the events of the forties and to  the Muslim Brotherhood's secret organization?    [Abu-al-Nasr] As we said, the Muslim Brothers have rejected  and condemned terrorism. We believe that the false allegations  claiming that they support or back it cannot negate or cover up  the truth or deceive the people or grip their minds. Even  though the campaigns against the Brotherhood are falling thick  and thin and even though the Muslim Brothers are deprived of the  right to reply because they have no access to any media channel,  right is clear and God Almighty defends those who believe. The  noble Egyptian people are so aware as to be able to expose the  lies and aspersions.    Regarding the allegations of secret organizations, the  Muslim  Brothers have no secret organizations and do not resort to  secrecy. The Brotherhood had its own system in the forties due  to special circumstances, namely the circumstances of  colonialism which was in control of the country at the time in  addition to the royal palace's treachery. Therefore, there was  this special system in order to confront colonialism and to  liberate the land. The Muslim Brotherhood's actions and battles  in Palestine and the Suez Canal were great and are recorded by  history. This special system ended when the English evacuated  Egypt and the Muslim Brothers entered prisons and detention  camps in the mid-fifties.    ['Abd-al-Rahman] What do you say to President Mubarak?    [Abu-al-Nasr] I tell President Mubarak and all the Arab  leaders this: The nation needs the unity of your ranks. Act to  unite its ranks. Applying God's shari'ah is a trust in your  hands and a duty and everyone will be accounted for it before  God Almighty. Mobilize the resources and capabilities to apply  it. Freedom and security are inherent rights for all the  people. Provide them for everyone.</p>

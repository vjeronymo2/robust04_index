			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council, today met with the brother  leaders of the political parties and organizations in the  national arena.    They discussed many issues about the Yemeni homeland and  safeguarding its unity. They also considered developments in  the national arena in light of the war ignited in the homeland  by both the secessionist gang and the rebellion and in view of  the declaration of secession made by the traitor and agent  al-Bid, and also in light of issuing UN Security Council  Resolution 924 on the situation in Yemen, and in view of the  final statement issued by the meetings of the foreign ministers  of the Gulf Cooperation Council on the situation in our country,  in addition to the speech delivered by Saudi Foreign Minister  Sa'ud al-Faysal on Yemen.    The brother chairman indicated the importance of this  meeting  which groups the political parties and organizations in the  national arena, so they can responsibly rise to national duty in  terms of confronting the schemes hostile to unity. He said: We  are meeting under the extremely important and crucial  circumstances through which the Yemeni homeland is passing.  This homeland is now experiencing severe regrettable events  fabricated by the rebellious secessionists in order to involve  the homeland's sons in fighting and implement their secessionist  scheme.    The brother chairman reviewed the scenario and aspects of  the  destructive secessionist plan that have brought the homeland to  the point it is at. He also pointed to the fact that this gang  stockpiled weapons, vehicles, and military hardware, fabricated  crises in the homeland, and ultimately exploded the situation  militarily and caused fighting between the homeland's sons and  their Armed Forces in Abyan and later in Harf Sufyan, Shabwah,  'Imran, Dhamar, and Aden in addition to this gang's suspect  moves abroad in order to evoke others' hostility to both Yemen  and its unity.    The brother chairman asserted that this criminal  secessionist  gang in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] leadership plotted  against the YSP itself and against unity. He explained the  concessions and sacrifices offered to prevent this gang from  implementing its conspiracy against the homeland and unity.  This gang either sought to unilaterally rule Yemen or fragment  the homeland and reinstate the partition to achieve its own  narrow interests, he added.    The brother chairman said: We sought dialogue and its  continuation in order to keep the homeland away from war. This  gang, however, continued to implement its criminal scheme by  igniting war and imposing it on the homeland in order to shatter  unity. We were thus forced into defending the homeland and  confronting the scheme designed to fragment it.    The brother president explained that the Yemeni unity was  realized through peaceful and democratic means, and was not  imposed by force. He said this unity is an expression of the  free will of the Yemeni people, demonstrated in the referendum  on the Republic of Yemen's Constitution and the elections of 27  April 1993, and the setting up of constitutional establishments.  The Yemeni people have always been one people who stick to  their unity, and they will not relinquish it because they are  aware of the consequences of separation, and they have paid a  high price during past divisive conflicts.    He added that the secessionist and rebellious gang dreamt of  restoring its dictatorial and totalitarian rule. It does not  accept democracy or participation with others, and it does  tolerate different opinions. Therefore, it sought to circumvent  democracy and the results of the legitimate and constitutional  elections.    The brother Presidential Council chairman emphasized that  the  Republic of Yemen's policy is that of democracy and political  pluralism, freedom of the press, respect of human rights, and  building of modern civilian establishments, free economy, and  social justice.    He said this policy will not be relinquished, and will  continue to be the choice to which we will adhere to embody the  aspirations for building a new Yemen, the pillars of which we  laid down on 22 May 1990, and there will never be a return to  the totalitarian separatist system.    The brother Presidential Council chairman urged leaders of  parties and political organizations to close national ranks, and  form a broad national front in which efforts are mobilized to  confront the challenges imposed on the homeland, its unity, and  sovereignty.    He said building and protecting the homeland is everyones  responsibility, and that we should unite and rise above all  differences and sensitivities of the past in order to keep the  dangers away from the homeland and safeguard its unity, and  support all nationalist constants.    The brother president expressed appreciation for the  nationalist and responsible position of the political parties  and organizations, unions, popular organizations, and all  political and social figures in the national arena for  confronting the secessionist plan and their rejection of  al-Bid's separatist proclamation, and their support in face of  the elements and perpetrators of this plan.    He said the challenge the Yemeni homeland faces at present  is  the real test of all the homeland's sons, led by political  parties and organizations, in order to prove the credibility of  positions and commitment to national responsibility.    The brother president hailed the heroic performance of our  valiant Armed Forces, the forces of unity and legitimacy, which  respond to the people's will with high nationalist determination  to defend unity and democracy, and safeguard the constitutional  legitimacy, security, and stability in the homeland.</p>

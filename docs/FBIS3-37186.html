			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, February 15 (TASS) -- It is a year today  since Algirdas Brazauskas was elected president of Lithuania.  In the country's first universal democratic elections 60.03  percent of voters cast their ballots in his favour.    Responding to a question from the country's most popular  daily LIETUVOS RITAS about what successes the president feels  proud of, Brazauskas said that when he won the elections, news  was circulated all over the world that Lithuania was again ruled  by communists.    "Since that time Europe, and not Europe alone, has come to  realize that all power institutions in the republic were elected  democratically, that reforms continue and that Lithuania is  pursuing a predictable foreign policy. No one in Europe can say  that some uncertain types were in power. It was an important  task for as to change the image of Lithuania in the eyes of the  world community", Brazauskas said.    "The adoption of Lithuania in the Council of Europe confirms  the fact that our country has won international recognition. We  see good relations which have been formed lately with the  European Union, NATO and other international organizations as  our great achievement," the Lithuanian president said.    "In the field of foreign policy we managed to avoid major  conflicts through planning, and the Russian Army was withdrawn  on time," Brazauskas said.    He also said that his successes as president also included  better relations among people. "Suspiciousness is vanishing and  there is no more search for internal enemies," Brazauskas  stressed.</p>

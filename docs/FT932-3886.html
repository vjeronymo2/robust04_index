			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Salomon to pay Dollars 54.5m to settle lawsuits SALOMON Brothers, the Wall Street securities house, announced yesterday that it had agreed to pay Dollars 54.5m to settle class action lawsuits filed by the firm's shareholders and debtholders in the wake of the 1991 bond auction scandal. The scandal, which nearly destroyed one of Wall Street's most powerful firms, erupted when Salomon's bond trading desk was discovered to have faked customer bids for Treasury securities in a number of bond auctions during 1990 and 1991. The false bids were part of an attempt by Salomon's chief bond trader to avoid government rules limiting how many bonds securities firms were allowed to acquire in each auction. Yesterday's settlement, however, will not involve Salomon paying any new money, as the Dollars 54.5m will come out of the Dollars 100m fund the firm set up in May 1992 to compensate victims of its violations. The fund was established as part of the settlement reached with the government last year. At the time, Salomon also paid Dollars 190m in fines and forfeitures for its actions. Additionally, Salomon said yesterday that it had agreed to pay all legal fees incurred in the shareholder and debtholders' action, up to a maximum of Dollars 12.5m. That money will not come out of the Dollars 100m compensation fund, but will be paid directly by the firm. Although this latest settlement is an important step for Salomon, it does not represent the final chapter in the bond auction scandal. The firm still has to fight litigation brought by investors who purchased government securities in 1990 and 1991 and who claim they suffered losses. The firm is expected to fight these actions more vigorously than it did the lawsuits settled yesterday. Senior Salomon executives knew of the illegal activities for months before they were publicly revealed, so the firm had little choice but to reach a settlement. Also, Mr Paul Mozer, the former head bond trader at Salomon who allegedly faked the customer bids in Treasury auctions, still faces trial for his actions.</p>

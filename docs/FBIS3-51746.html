Carlos Lage, a member of  the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC), today said  the current sugar harvest, as well as the upcoming sugar  harvest, will be decisive in attaining that goal.    During a meeting with leaders of the sugar industry in  central Ciego De Avila Province, Lage said the 1994-95 harvest  must be greater than the current one. He stressed that the  recovery of the country's main industry is a precondition to  overcoming the current period of economic crisis.    Cuba is experiencing a period of severe economic difficulty,  following the disbanding of the European socialist bloc, with  which it conducted 85 percent of its foreign trade, and the  increased U.S. trade, financial, and commercial embargo against  the island.    Lage, who is credited with being the strategist of Cuban  economic policy, underscored the importance of the current sugar  harvest, saying that it will provide the resources needed for  next year's harvest, which could mark the beginning of the  country's economic recovery.    According to a report by the National Information Agency,  the  vice president of the Council of Ministers said no one must stop  work now to process a single ton of sugar or sow a single  caballeria (11.42 hectares) of cane sprouts.    Lage pointed out that life has demonstrated that the country  can complete a harvest with less resources than before, during  this special period, as the Cubans call the strategy they have  developed to overcome the economic difficulties.    Nelson Torres, the minister of the sugar industry; Alfredo  Hondal, a member of the Politburo and first secretary of the PCC  in Ciego de Avila; and the directors of the agroindustrial  complexes were present at the meeting, during which they  discussed production strategies for the current sugar harvest.    The participants agreed that maximum use of all available  resources, railroads, and sugar cane for processing are  essential to an efficient campaign.</p>

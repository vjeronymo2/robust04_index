			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT SO FAST: ROCKETS SLOW THE LAKERS;  </P> <P> GAME 3: HOUSTON KEEPS CONTROL IN FOURTH QUARTER FOR 114-108 VICTORY. L.A. LOSES  FOR FIRST TIME IN A BEST-OF-FIVE PLAYOFF GAME.  </P> <P> Fourth quarters usually belong to the Lakers. That is when their level of play  soars, when they can arise from even the most daunting of deficits and take  control. It has become nearly instinctive, especially at playoff time.  </P> <P> That changed here Tuesday night. The Houston Rockets, tired of falling just  short in this first-round series, staved off elimination with a 114-108 victory  over the Lakers before 16,611 fans in the Summit.  </P> <P> It was the Lakers' first loss in a first-round series since the NBA switched to  a best-of-five format in 1984. They had won 20 consecutive first-round games,  taking the first two from Houston by dominating the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> The opportunity was there again Tuesday. The Lakers began the fourth quarter  trailing only 92-90, in good shape considering that they were on the road  against an inspired team whose coach, Don Chaney, had "guaranteed" two  consecutive victories.  </P> <P> Instead of becoming forceful in the fourth, the Lakers folded. It was neither  pretty nor predictable.  </P> <P> In the last quarter, the Lakers made only five of 18 shots and allowed the  Rockets to shoot 59%. Magic Johnson, double-teamed all night, attempted only  three shots in the quarter, all were failed three-point tries. James Worthy,  who had 26 points, made only one of four shots in that span. Those two subdued,  no other Laker stepped forward.  </P> <P> As a result, the Rockets put together a 15-5 run in the first 6:29 of the  quarter and led, 107-95. The Lakers' fourth-quarter sluggishness was evident  right away, Houston scoring six consecutive points in the first 1:28.  </P> <P> The Lakers did muster their strength and cut the Rockets' lead to 111-108 with  46 seconds left after Byron Scott's three-point basket, but they could get no  closer.  </P> <P> Typifying the Lakers' play was a rare five-second violation on Michael Cooper  on an inbound play with 23 seconds left and the Lakers trailing by five points.  Cooper tried to pass it to Johnson, who was covered, then Scott, also covered.  Eventually, he passed to referee Joe Forte, who gave the ball to the Rockets.  </P> <P> Long before that, though, Houston had taken control.  </P> <P> "It was a great game for three periods," Laker Coach Pat Riley said.  </P> <P> But, about that fourth . . .  </P> <P> "At the top of the period, that 6-0 run gave them life," Riley said. "We had a  hard time getting back in it. We got a little out of sync. We took some long  shots, the same shots we hit the last two games to get back in it in the fourth  quarter."  </P> <P> The Rockets, wary after losing a seven-point lead with 7:46 left in Game 2  Sunday, seemed determined to prevent a sequel.  </P> <P> That was evident by the 6-0 run. Akeem Olajuwon, hampered by foul trouble  earlier in the second half, began the surge by tipping in Otis Thorpe's missed  jumper. After a turnover by Orlando Woolridge, Sleepy Floyd drove the lane for  a basket. Then, after Scott and Worthy failed to connect on a pass, Thorpe  completed a fast-break dunk to make it 98-90. Timeout, Lakers.  </P> <P> The Lakers did not score in the fourth quarter until A.C. Green, who had 16  points, sank an 18-foot jump shot.  </P> <P> "We made the run in the fourth quarter like the Lakers made on us," said Floyd,  who had 23 points and a Rocket playoff-record 18 assists. "We turned up the  defense a notch, and we responded excellently to the challenge. We showed a lot  of character."  </P> <P> Despite trailing by two points, Laker players said they felt in position to win  heading into the fourth quarter. They were at a loss to explain what happened  and vowed it would not happen again.  </P> <P> Johnson's statement: "We just have to play better in the fourth quarter."  </P> <P> Worthy elaborated.  </P> <P> "We just a had a little mental lapse, and they had three of four quick  baskets," he said. "From that point, we were behind and had to play catch up.  Any time you get down at that point in the game, it's tough.  </P> <P> "We had a couple lapses earlier. When we'd get (the deficit) down to one or two  points, we didn't execute. That's not like us."  </P> <P> Game 3 was very unlike the Lakers at several junctures.  </P> <P> They fell behind by 12 points midway through the first quarter -- no surprise  there -- but then rallied to trail by one entering the second quarter. From  there, the Lakers cut Houston's lead to one point three times but failed to  overtake the Rockets.  </P> <P> The Lakers' big break, however, came 26 seconds into the third quarter when  Olajuwon received his fourth foul contesting Green on a rebound. Initially, the  Lakers seized the chance. Green made both free throws, then sank a jumper 32  seconds later to tie it, 60-60.  </P> <P> The Lakers took their first lead, 62-60, with 10:40 to play on Johnson's  fast-break layup after Worthy stole the ball from Vernon Maxwell. Johnson was  fouled on the drive but, as a harbinger of squandered opportunities to come, he  missed the free throw.  </P> <P> Still, Olajuwon's absence was a time the Lakers could exploit the Rockets.  Instead, they did their best just to stay close.  </P> <P> Thorpe took over Olajuwon's low post obligations and hurt the Lakers more than  Olajuwon, who finished with 22 points and seven rebounds.  </P> <P> Thorpe quickly erased the last Laker lead of the game -- 64-63 with 9:46 left  in the third -- with consecutive three-point plays in a one-minute span. Both  were drives inside. He was fouled first by Green, then by Mychal Thompson.  Neither could adequately defend Thorpe, 6 feet 10 but quicker than either  defender. Thorpe had 10 of his career playoff-high 27 points in the quarter.  </P> <P> "It was very scary being without Akeem," Chaney said. "Usually, when he's out,  we decline. We were able to buy some time."  </P> <P> The Lakers considered it an opportunity lost. That wasn't all that was missing.  </P> <P> Johnson had 17 points and 18 assists, but he made only five of 14 shots. "They  doubled me; it was nothing new," he said. "But everybody else has got to hit  the shots, or we're in trouble. There's nothing different I can do. Just make  the pass. I can't force it. Other people just got to step on up. We know what  they're trying to do to me. We have to get back to rotating quicker. They got  some big second shots (12 offensive rebounds)."  </P> <P> All five Rocket starters reached double figures, all but Buck Johnson scoring  at least 20 points. Floyd and Maxwell combined for 49 points.  </P> <P> "We'll have to look at (Houston's backcourt) and make adjustments," Riley said.  "We may try something different."  </P> <P> Riley, asked if the Lakers are capable of winning at the Summit, said, 'Yes, we  can win here.' "  </P> <P> A Houston writer asked, "Can you guarantee it?"  </P> <P> "I'll see you guys tomorrow," said Riley, walking away.  </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> A CBS producer said his interview with Akeem Olajuwon, during which the Houston  Rocket center said he might ask for a trade, occurred a day before the start of  the first-round playoff series, not two months before as Olajuwon later told  Houston sportswriters.  </P></p>

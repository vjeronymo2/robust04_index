			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / How to Spend It: Old idea: new greeting - Keeping up with the designer age is a challenge. Helen Lowry finds how the card industry is coping Even in the age of fax, telephones and communicating computers, there is still no better - or more popular - way of communication than the greeting card. According to the Greeting Card and Calendar Association, 2.427m cards are sold each year in the UK alone. Greeting cards are keeping pace with our increasingly design-oriented times. Individual artists, craftsmen, photographers, illustrators and architects are turning their hand to the art. Cards now display a range of design techniques and there is a wealth of choice. According to Christopher Cordingly, of Art Angels Publishers: 'It is a heavily populated industry in which you have to carve your own niche.' He looks for a distinctive style and images which have a universal appeal. Lucy Clibbon is one of four recent art school graduates he has commissioned. Initially inspired by a postcard made to illustrate her degree show, she now has a range of 50 cards which are sold worldwide. She uses two techniques, monoprinting and gesso (primal paint). Her gently humorous designs are full of detail. 'Hand in Marriage' features a couple in traditional wedding dress within the outline of a hand. Surrounding them, and in the fingers, are hearts, champagne glasses, a wedding cake, and various other objects associated with marriage. Each Art Angels card is given a title and all are 'blank message' cards. Improvement in reproduction quality has opened the market to numerous other professionals. Emma Tennant specialises in rag-rug making, a traditional craft in the south of Scotland from where she comes. She describes the craft as 'the flip side of patchwork'. Using left-over bits of wool, in particular scrap tweed, she pulls them with a hook through hessian. First transformed into wrapping paper, the bouncy texture and vibrant colours are captured equally well in card form. Living on a farm, Tennant's designs are inspired by looking out of the window. It is partly the simplicity of her designs - a cat, sheep, pig or flowers - which gives the cards their charm. Michael Ashpool, of IMAI Design, also uses a traditional craft, the Japanese paper-folding art of origami. He regularly makes trips to Japan to buy 'washi', vast sheets of hand-made, silk-screen paper. He believes that 'an image must be simple and stand out'. His first, and most popular design, is a miniature representation of the kimono, one of the most recognisable and colourful of oriental images. His range also includes a swan and butterfly, and can be bought at The Conran Shop (address below); The British Museum, Bloomsbury, London WC1; and The Japan Centre, Piccadilly, W1. Individual ventures and contemporary designers are only one aspect of the card market. Galleries and museums, as well as reproducing items from their collections, are increasingly bringing out ranges to cover special exhibitions. The Victoria and Albert Museum, Cromwell Road, London SW7 2RL, has a large and varied card selection, ranging from reproductions of William Morris prints to hand-made cards by young contemporary artists. They have produced a series of cards following the popular Fornasetti exhibition. Black and white designs feature the classic Fornasetti woman. Her smooth and expressionless face forms the head of a light bulb, a sun, or just her eyes and nose are encompassed in a winding ribbon. Fornasetti's colour drawings, although blank inside, have 'occasion' themes. 'Paloni', which depicts a sky scattered with hot air balloons, is an ideal card for someone about to set off on a trip; 'Brindisi', the striking image of a man and woman's arm crossing in the air, their glasses raised in a celebratory gesture, could mark an anniversary or engagement. The Design Museum, Shad Thames, London SE1 2YD, has a small but excellent selection. Fold-out cards, created by Japanese architect Masahiro Chatani, depict simple shapes, scenes or buildings. 'Dining Niche', a table and chairs, captures the intimacy of a dinner. There are three-dimensional representations of the Taj Mahal, a multi-tiered wedding cake, and an abstract design entitled 'Blocks'. In contrast to this understated collection, is a series of cards celebrating product-design throughout history. Each card is a bold cut-out. There is, among others, a pop-inspired Valentine Typewriter, bright red and toy-like; a Predicta Television, one of the most famous images of post-war industrial design; and a classic 1930s BMW motor-cycle. Art Angels cards are available at Liberty of Regent Street, London W1; The Conran Shop, 81 Fulham Road, London SW3; The General Trading Company, 144 Sloane Street, London SW1; The Medici Gallery, 7 Grafton Street, London W1; and The Royal College of Art, Kensington Gore, London SW7. Emma Tennant cards, published by Frederica Freer Greeting Cards, are available at: The General Trading Company; Graham &amp; Greene, 4 Elgin Crescent, London W11; The Royal Horticultural Society, Vincent Square, London SW1; The Chelsea Gardener, 125 Sydney Street, London SW3; Dartington Cider Press (Devon); The Village Bakery (Cumbria) and the National Trust.</p>

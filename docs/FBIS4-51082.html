			<p>BFN     [Text] From 22 to 23 May, after leading responsible  comrades of the departments directly under the provincial  authorities to attend the forum on economic work of three  provinces convened by Comrade Zhu Rongji in Henan Province, Zhao  Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and  governor of Shandong Province, travelled to Heze and Jining to  conduct investigation and inspect work.    When talking about the current economic work, Zhao Zhihao  stressed: All levels of departments in the province should pay  close attention to summer planting, harvesting, and field  management in a timely manner to ensure bumper harvest and  should be meticulous in organizing economic operation with focus  on improving economic efficiency in order to resolve conspicuous  problems and promote the sustained and sound development of the  provincial economy.    Zhao Zhihao said: From January to April, the general  economic situation of the province was very good; various  reforms, particularly the reforms of finance, tax, investment  enterprises, and foreign exchange management, proceeded  smoothly; old systems were giving way to the new steadily; and  positive and remarkable results were achieved in economic  development. However, some conspicuous contradictions and  problems also existed in economic operation. In particular,  deficits of enterprises increased, more enterprises faced  difficulties, and the margin of price hikes was high. All  levels of departments must pay high attention to these problems.    Zhao Zhihao stressed: This year, wheat is doing well  throughout the province, and the wheatfields promise a good  harvest. All levels of departments should be prepared in  ideology and work and seize the current good opportunity to  quickly harvest and thresh wheat in order to reap a bumper  harvest. At the same time, good preparations should be made for  the sowing of summer cotton in order to sow as much cotton as  possible. All levels of grain management departments should  voluntarily and conscientiously make preparations for procuring  summer grain.    Zhao Zhihao stressed: We should successfully organize the  operation of industrial economy by firmly persisting in the  central task of improving economic efficiency. We should go all  out to promote sales and increase the marketing rate of  products. We should resolutely correct the erroneous tendency  of blindly competing for high-speed development. We should  exert great efforts in improving enterprise management and  strictly controlling the quality of products, the cost of  production, and the operation of funds with a view to improving  economic efficiency, by focusing on straightening out and  strengthening leading bodies of enterprises and on strengthening  the basic work. We should go all out to help the enterprises  facing difficulties find out the roots of their problems and  study how to develop themselves in the future. Great efforts  should also be made to help such enterprises resolve their  problems concerning livelihood of workers.    Zhao Zhihao stressed emphatically: All levels of governments  and responsible departments should organize forces to go deep  into enterprises to help them resolve their practical problems.  They should seize the current opportunity and resolutely depend  on reforms to resolve problems for the small and medium-sized  enterprises that have long been operated at a lose.</p>

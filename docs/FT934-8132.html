			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (7): The road block is a Green - Profile: Joschka Fischer MR JOSCHKA FISCHER is a cheerful, rotund and expansive figure, with tousled hair, and a T-shirt worn under an open collar: articulate, self-confident, and laid-back. He is the archetypal child of the 1960s in middle age. He is also the man who is holding Germany's powerful nuclear energy industry to ransom. His hostage is the DM1bn nuclear fuel-element plant being built at Hanau in the state of Hesse by Siemens, the country's foremost nuclear power station contractor. Mr Fischer is a former world revolutionary and Frankfurt taxi driver who is now the environment minister of Hesse. He is deputy premier of the state in a coalition between the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and his own Green Party. The German nuclear power generators, led by the Big Three electricity utilities, Bayernwerk, RWE and Veba's PreussenElektra, are required by German law to re-use their nuclear waste to the maximum possible extent, via re-processing. And Hanau is the critical element - and the weak link - in that recycling process. As environment minister, Mr Fischer has simply prevented the plant receiving the necessary planning permission to come into operation. The nuclear waste produced by Germany's 20 atomic power stations is being turned into plutonium in France and Britain, and then has nowhere to go. It is rapidly becoming a severe embarrassment. 'What we are doing has nothing to do with abandoning nuclear energy,' Mr Fischer says with a disarming smile. 'It must be a factory which is safe, and corresponds to the law. Just like a car, it needs to be licensed.' Mr Fischer is undoubtedly being disingenuous. He is completely committed to the goal of getting Germany to abandon nuclear power generation, as soon as may reasonably be achieved. He also knows that nuclear waste disposal is the weak link in the nuclear chain. 'Everyone must understand that things have changed here in Germany,' he says. 'Since the 1970s and 1980s, things have been moving. Abandoning nuclear power is now inevitable. It is no longer a question of if, but merely of when and how we get out.' Mr Fischer led the Green Party delegation in the ill-fated attempt over the past year to negotiate a cross-party 'energy consensus' over the future of both the nuclear industry, and the German coal mines. And he led his party out of the talks in the summer, when it became apparent that the government and the power generators were determined to keep the nuclear option open. 'The result we almost had .. (promoted by Mr Gerhard Schroder, the prime minister of Lower Saxony) was very bad,' he says. 'It would have been a capitulation.' It would have meant allowing the present generation of atomic power stations to have an operating life of around 40 years, far longer than the Greens are prepared to accept. It would also have meant allowing a new generation reactor to be built. 'It is a mystery to me why this was a compromise,' he says. 'After 2010 or 2015, this new generation would then have been brought in. There would have been no abandonment of nuclear power.' Instead, the collapse of the talks at the end of October has left Germany with a de facto moratorium on the future of nuclear energy. And the next decisive event will be the October 1994 elections for the new Bundestag, with Mr Fischer's party firmly aiming for a share in a SPED-led coalition. 'There would be no government participation (by the Greens) with a continuation of nuclear energy,' Mr Fischer says bluntly. 'What is negotiable is only how and when we get out.' His ambitions are certainly not out of the question. The Greens are doing better from the current mood of disenchantment in Germany with all established politicians and parties than anyone else - including the much-feared splinter groups of the far right. They won almost 14 per cent of the vote in the most recent Hamburg city elections. If they can do that across the country, they must have a very good chance of forming a red-green coalition with the SPD. As far as the German nuclear power industry is concerned, Mr Fischer's skirmish over the Hanau fuel plant is merely a foretaste of the full-scale war to come if he emerges as a king-maker in the next Bonn coalition.</p>

			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Cuba seeks UN debate on embargo CUBA wants the UN General Assembly to debate, for the second year running, the US economic embargo against the island which Havana says is illegal, Cuban state media said yesterday, Reuter reports from Havana. A written request for the issue to be included in the agenda of the next assembly session, starting next month, was sent recently to UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros Ghali by Cuba's ambassador to the UN. The subject was debated at the UN last year but Cuba's government backed away from demanding a formal vote on a resolution condemning the embargo, apparently because it could not muster enough support for its passage, diplomats said. Cuba is condemning what it calls recent moves by the US government to tighten the trade restrictions, imposed by Washington 30 years ago soon after it broke off diplomatic ties with Havana.</p>

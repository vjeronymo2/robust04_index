			<p>BFN     [Text] Monrovia, 21 Apr (AFP) -- Dissensions emerged today  within the National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], the main  armed faction, a day after the announcement of an agreement  between the different factions on the formation of the future  transitional government.    Last night, four of the six NPFL representatives within the  transitional government were given "hearings" by the  Transitional Legislative Assembly, before being officially  commissioned by David Kpomakpor, the chairman of the Council of  State (transitional collegiate presidency). The NPFL's mission  "has been successfully accomplished," new Justice Minister  Laveli Supuwood said, while his colleague, Labor Minister Tom  Woewiyu, said that he was "ready to break down factional  barriers and seek the interest and happiness of all Liberians."  Interior Minister Samuel Dhokie, who is a top NPFL official,  promised "to ensure national reconciliation and destroy the  artificial division of the country."    A fourth NPFL representative, Wehyee Dekyee, minister of  lands, mines, and energy, attended the ceremony, which was  boycotted by the two other NPFL members in the government,  Information Minister Joe Mulbah and Agriculture Minister Roland  Massaquoi. In addition, none of the 13 NPFL representatives in  the Transitional Legislative Assembly attended the hearings of  their "brothers-in-arms," an AFP correspondent observed. For  NPFL leader Charles Taylor, quoted this morning by the Front's  radio monitored in Monrovia, the NPFL officials who have taken  office in the government "without a consensus on the issue  within the movement have not shown solidarity." It is a  "defection," as far as Taylor is concerned. Since last November,  the NPFL representatives in the government have refused to take  office until an agreement is reached on all the ministerial  posts, particularly on the four remaining key portfolios:  defense, finance, foreign affairs, and justice.    Yesterday morning, the Council of State chairman announced  that an agreement had been reached between the NPFL, the former  interim government, and the United Liberation Movement for  Democracy in Liberia on three ministries, and that the fourth  post -- that of foreign affairs -- will be appointed "soon" by  the Council of State. A few hours later NPFL Information  Minister Joe Mulbah had already begun expressing some  reservations, pointing out before journalists that the Front's  leadership had not been officially informed about these  nominations and that, consequently, his boss Charles Taylor had  not endorsed them.    In a statement issued late this morning in Monrovia, the  NPFL  announced the holding of a congress this weekend in Gbarnga --  160 km northeast of Monrovia. At the end of this congress, the  NPFL "will be able to present serious and adequate proposals  that will finally enable all the signatories to the Cotonou  Accord to participate fully in the government," the communique  said.</p>

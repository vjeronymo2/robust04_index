			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Sergey Volkov: "A Real Headquarters May Soon </F> Appear in Almaty. So Far Only Central Asian, Though"]    [Text] While Eurasian ideas so far remain on paper,  the Unified Economic Space project (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,  Kyrgyzstan) is beginning to acquire an increasingly real  shape.    One gets this impression from a frenetic pace of preparation  of numerous documents for the July meeting of heads of these  three countries that is currently being carried out in the  bowels of Kazakh ministries and agencies. Despite personnel and  structural reshuffling in republic state organs, more than 10  agreements and accords are going through final polishing, which  gives one hope for at least an outward success of the upcoming  Shymkent summit of Presidents Nazarbayev, Karimov, and Akayev.    The unquestionable "bomb" among these documents (at least  for  other CIS partners) will be the substantiation of proposals  being prepared by our side for making Almaty the site of the  proposed headquarters of a permanent executive body of the  "Central Asian trio's" intergovernment commission on  intensification of economic integration. Kazakhstan is preparing  not only the draft on this organization's status, but also its  estimated budget, and will provide the technical infrastructure  for its functioning. Such serious preparation for organizing the  structures of the Unified Economic Space (EEP) seem to be  pointing in the direction that this interstate structure is  being set up seriously and long-term. There is, of course, a  danger that even after setting up the organization's  headquarters, as time goes by and circumstances change, its  parents will lose interest in the idea of Unified Economic  Space, and this will result in another unproductive squandering  of the republic budget money.    Notable among other documents is a memorandum and program  for  creating conditions to reduce the population's migration. It is  not yet clear, though, which migration Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,  and Kyrgyzstan intend to reduce--interrepublic or general? At  the root of this question is that it is quite difficult to  separate the regional migration issues from general migration  problems existing today on the territory of the entire  post-Soviet space.    Naturally, in attempting to create something unified and  economic, the sides concentrated their attention first and  foremost on economic issues. Among them, agreements on the  following should be noted:    --setting up an arbitration court (Supreme Economic Court);    --setting up a joint commercial bank;    --setting up joint enterprises;    --manufacturing cars on the operating capacities of the  three  countries;    --manufacturing cotton yarn and fabrics made of it;    --manufacturing textile machinery;    --joint construction of an Aktau-Beyneu-Kandagach oil  pipeline and reconstruction of oil refineries.    Most likely, dealing with these items (if agreements on them  are signed) will become the prerogative of the aforementioned  Unified Economic Space's permanent executive body and the  planned Business Cooperation Council (SDS), in which our side  apparently will be represented by specialists from the Ministry  of Economics, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and the  Congress of Kazakhstan Entrepreneurs. The presence of the latter  organization in the lists of candidates for participation in  international structures says that the young businessmen who  constitute its skeleton are already tired of simply asking the  government for this and that and decided to engage themselves in  writing economic history (even though only a Central Asian one).  There is a concern, though, that the new generation of  entrepreneurs will find themselves too much involved in such  close cooperation with Cabinet of Ministers structures, which  will eventually leave them firmly linked with the current  government course, which is not particularly popular among the  people. But this is, as they say, their own problem.    In short, we do not have to wait long to find out whether it  is right to say that Unified Economic Space ideas are eternal  because they are correct.</p>

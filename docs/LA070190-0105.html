			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COVER STORY: SUMMER SOAP PLOTS HEAT UP FOR THE YOUNG AUDIENCE  </P> <P> Summertime, and the living is easy -- unless you happen to reside in Pine  Valley, Port Charles or the other settings of the daytime soap operas. The  weather isn't the only thing that heats up from mid-June to mid-September. So  do the soaps' story lines, with sizzling romances and provocative issues.  </P> <P> The soaps' summertime pace accelerates to counteract the season's real-life  languor, when more viewers are apt to be on vacation or spending time outdoors.  And the important influence on many of the shows' hot weather happenings is the  influx of younger viewers -- teen-agers and college students -- for whom school  vacation can mean more time in front of the TV.  </P> <P> Consider, for instance, some 1989 figures provided for CBS' top-rated "The  Young and the Restless." From Jan. 2 through May 28, viewers age 12 to 17  numbered 260,000, but from May 29 through Sept. 3 the figure rose to 840,000 --  a whopping 223% increase. Women 18 and older -- the soaps' primary demographic  target -- registered only a 2% increase.  </P> <P> "It is to all of our best interests, in terms of ratings consistency, to appeal  to young people during the summer, though never at the expense of the  traditional audience," said Lucy Johnson, vice president of daytime programs  for CBS Entertainment.  </P> <P> "Soaps are such a flexible form, with lots of plots and characters at any given  time, that you can bring to the forefront a plot that spotlights young  characters and direct a story line to your added audience. And soaps as a form  have a greater chance of hooking someone than do other daytime shows -- if you  get someone intrigued, they will keep watching."  </P> <P> Though it seems an obvious summer strategy, the practice of featuring younger  characters alongside the older ones may have been stumbled upon inadvertently,  according to Douglas Marland, head writer of CBS' "As the World Turns." He was  responsible for the phenomenally popular early-1980s pairing of "General  Hospital's" Luke and Laura when he was head writer for that ABC show.  </P> <P> "It was not a conscious decision (to bring in Luke during the summer); it  happened because of the way the story was structured," he said. "But we had the  young audience, and the ratings soared. Then everyone else said, 'That has to  be the way to do it: do young stories in the summer.' "  </P> <P> With romance as the soaps' bedrock, so to speak, it is no wonder that younger  characters find new or existing relationships intensifying during the summer.  "What you hope to inspire," Marland explained, "is a rooting section for the  (couples) you want to see together, and people hissing and booing those who  complicate that."  </P> <P> On NBC's "Days of Our Lives," for example, Patch and Kayla will remarry this  summer, and Roman and Isabella, who now face obstacles, will find the course of  their true love running smoothly by summer's end.  </P> <P> Summer is often the time when new characters are introduced, whether to provide  romantic complications or figure in other steamy plots. On NBC's "Santa  Barbara," senior executive producer John Conboy has introduced what he  described as "three hot, attractive young characters," all around age 19. One  mystery woman is even named "Flame."  </P> <P> Or popular characters of the past may return, such as "Santa Barbara's"  Lockridge family and Robert Barr -- in a dual role this summer as his twin  brother Quinn -- and the two-years-absent heartthrob Holden Snyder on "As the  World Turns."  </P> <P> Some soap producers deliberately take advantage of their larger youthful  audience to dramatize issues directly relating to that age group. "We are  unquestionably aware of our young audience, and we want to do something that  will have a positive impact on their lives," said William J. Bell Sr.,  co-creator with his wife, Lee Phillip Bell, and executive producer and head  writer of "The Young and the Restless." He and his wife are also creators and  executive producers of "The Bold and the Beautiful."  </P> <P> Last summer "Y and R" tackled the issue of date rape, which is still drawing  viewer mail; other plots have dealt with teen-age drunken driving, runaways and  baby selling. This summer's plan to spotlight sexual harassment on the job was  jettisoned after Bell discovered that charges are usually difficult to prove,  thereby creating a story line that would frustrate viewers. The show, instead,  will deal with the environment, drugs and young people living together.  </P> <P> On NBC's "Days of Our Lives," supervising executive producer Al Rabin recalls  that three years ago he delayed a Jack-and-Jennifer story line on teen-age  sexual responsibility until the summer, after learning from the Center for  Population Options of the dire need to educate teens about birth control.  </P> <P> "We had Jennifer's grandmother tell her, 'If you're going to do it, be  protected,' and we did actual shots of her getting a diaphragm," he notes. As  it turned out, the couple abstained from sex until late last month.  </P> <P> Of course, not all the soaps cater to their younger summertime audiences.  Despite its title, ABC's "All My Children" shies away from the practice,  according to Jozie Emmerich, senior vice president of daytime programs at the  network.  </P> <P> "We've been criticized by our viewers, gotten letters saying, 'We just don't  want all these kids,' " she said. "We have a wide panorama of viewers, so we  have something for everyone. We try to do something youth-oriented year-round."  </P> <P> Still, as Douglas Marland of "As the World Turns" says, "We do have a strong  young audience watching all year long, but I think they look to the summer  months as 'their' months. They look to the soaps to feature more stories  exclusively for them."  </P></p>

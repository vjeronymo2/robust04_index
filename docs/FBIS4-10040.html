			<p>BFN     [Text] For Cuba as well as for those Cuban emigres who  maintain an open and respectful attitude toward the Revolution,  it is no longer acceptable to continue the abnormal ties of the  past few decades. This was a statement by Foreign Vice Minister  Jorge Alberto Bolanos during a news conference on 6 April with  Cuban and foreign journalists to discuss preparations for the  forthcoming conference, The Nation and the Emigre Community, to  be held 22-24 April.    Bolanos added that the meeting will be for friends only and  will include a broad cross-section of the emigre community,  including representatives of the right. Bolanos pointed out that  the only ones excluded are those who maintain a hostile attitude  toward their fatherland and who advocate a dirty war and the  U.S. blockade.    Bolanos also stressed that the participants will be people  capable of making positive contributions to the Cuban emigre  community and to their ties with Cuba. He added that the April  meeting is not an isolated event, but a continuation of the  dialogue begun in 1978, which seeks to find answers to issues  left unresolved then, as well as to new issues. Bolanos  announced that over 200 invitations have been sent and that  positive responses have been received. Over 170 emigres are  expected to attend the conference.    The conference's four main subjects will be addressed by  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; Ricardo Alarcon, president of  the National Assembly of the People's Government; Abel Prieto;  and Carlos Lage.</p>

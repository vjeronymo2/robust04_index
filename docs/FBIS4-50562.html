			<p>BFN     [Text] Skoplje, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Macedonian Economic  Minister Petrus Stefanov has expressed the hope that his country  will see an early end to the war in ex-yugoslavia so that the  former Yugoslav Republic could be saved more economic losses.    The minister told XINHUA recently that Macedonia has  suffered  heavy economic loss from the war and the related sanctions  against Serbia.    Macedonia had been the poorest republic among the six  republics of the former Yugoslavia. About 80 percent of its  national economy was related to other republics and 45 percent  of its external trade depended on Serbia, Stefanov said.    After the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, and especially  since the Bosnian conflict, Macedonia's overseas market has  shrunk sharply.    The main railroads and highways to the outside were almost  paralyzed after the UN sanction resolution against Serbia, which  was compounded by Greece's imposition in February of an embargo  on Macedonia.    Macedonia's monthly average economic loss now stands at 150  million U.S. dollars this year, and total losses reached 1.8  billion dollars in 1993, Stefanov added.</p>

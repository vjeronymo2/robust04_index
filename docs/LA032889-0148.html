			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> EXPOS TRADE HEATON TO PIRATES  </P> <P> Left-hander Neal Heaton, who was unimpressive in his spring training bid for a  spot in the Montreal Expos' starting rotation, was traded to the Pittsburgh  Pirates today for a player to be named later.  </P> <P> With Randy Johnson and Brian Holman securing the fourth and fifth spots on the  pitching staff, Heaton became expendable. He did not help his cause with  several mediocre outings during the exhibition season and had an 8.57 earned  run average.  </P> <P> "They know what they're doing when they don't put spring training statistics on  the backs of bubble gum cards," Heaton said jokingly.  </P> <P> Heaton was obtained by Montreal on Feb. 3, 1987, as part of the deal in which  the Minnesota Twins acquired relief ace Jeff Reardon. Heaton had a 16-16 record  in two seasons with Montreal.  </P></p>

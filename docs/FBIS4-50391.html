			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Sixty-five British  companies with offices in Beijing today set up a chamber of  commerce to "help promote trade relations with China," Chamber  Chairman Brian Outlaw announced here today.    Outlaw, general manager of the British BP Petroleum  Development Ltd., said the Chinese Government's decision to  approve the official inauguration of the British Chamber of  Commerce in China (BCCC) "is a mark of the increased importance  of Sino-British trade relations."    It is learnt that British exports to China in 1993 were 72  percent higher than the previous year. Several large contracts  have been signed so far this year, including one for digital  technology equipment and another for a submarine cable laying  vessel, he said.    Senior officials from the China Council for the Promotion of  International Trade, the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation were guests at the  inauguration reception.</p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAT wanted Buying ahead of first-quarter results pushed tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries higher yesterday. The shares, which have languished on fears of a US tobacco price war, moved ahead 17 to 873p with 3.2m traded. The market is looking for profits of around Pounds 350m, against Pounds 262m for the same period last year. Nevertheless, yesterday's rise represents a relatively small bounce. Although the move by US group Philip Morris to cut the price of its Marlboro brand is not expected to impact on BAT's figures to the end of March, BAT shares have fallen from Pounds 10 since the start of April. The quarterly results will include a currency gain of about Pounds 30m and reflect stronger performance by BAT's insurance subsidiaries.</p>

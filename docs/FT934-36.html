			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / International Company News: Smaller loans that broke Banesto's back - The excessive growth that caused the crisis With hindsight, the institutions that invested Dollars 775m in Banco Espanol de Credito last summer should perhaps have suspected what was to come. The story of excessive loan growth which finally undid Spain's fourth largest bank was already familiar to those who followed Banesto closely. Mr Luis Angel Rojo, Spain's central bank governor, told a parliamentary committee yesterday that Banesto's problems stemmed from an over-aggressive expansion of loans between 1988 and 1991 as Mr Mario Conde, the chairman who was ousted this week, tried to gain market share. Pointing out that Banesto had expanded its loans by 109 per cent over the three years while loans by other big Spanish banks had only risen by 55 per cent, Mr Rojo dismissed many of the smaller loans which Banesto took on at that time as being 'of doubtful value' because of poor credit control. Mr Rojo participated in the decision to dismiss the Banesto board this week after identifying a potential Pta500bn (Dollars 3.5bn) overvaluation of its Dollars 61bn assets. He blamed mismanagement, overspending and an excessive concentration of risk - including loans to companies it partly owns. Yet with the exception of the charge of mismanagement, most of what Mr Rojo had to disclose was partly foreseen in last year's offer document for a placing of shares managed by JP Morgan. While recommending the purchase of shares, Morgan disclosed several worrying details about Banesto. JP Morgan has been placed in an awkward position by its role as corporate adviser to Banesto, and as an investor through its Dollars 1.1bn Corsair fund. Yet the US bank can at least argue that it gave a frighteningly accurate picture of the potential for difficulties at Banesto last year. For example, while arguing that Mr Conde had by last year brought Banesto under control, the offer document talks of the bank's credit controls up to 1991 suffering from 'inadequate analysis, outmoded technology, inefficient collections and a general fragmentation of functions'. Under JP Morgan's influence, Banesto had by then curbed the loan growth which followed Mr Conde's appointment as chairman. While the group's loan portfolio rose by 15.3 per cent in 1990 and 15.6 per cent in 1991, this was brought down sharply to 2.7 per cent growth in 1992. This raised Banesto's total loan portfolio to Pta2,412bn by the end of last year from Pta2,036bn at the end of 1990. At the same time, Morgan's advice to be more prudent in setting aside sums to cushion the impact of Spain's recession was leading to a sharp rise in loan loss provisions. Banesto started putting aside large sums to cover potential problems. Provisions of only Pta1.8bn in 1990 were increased heavily to Pta35bn in 1991 and Pta44.3bn last year. But the deterioration in loan quality was already starting to become too pronounced even for these provisions. The share of doubtful and non-performing loans to total loans rose from 2.82 per cent to 6.94 per cent at the end of last year. Despite the provisions top-up, the ratio of loan loss allowances to bad and doubtful loans fell over the same period from 104 per cent to 57.3 per cent. This meant that Banesto was in effect slipping backwards while running faster. The biggest consolation for potential investors was ironically the recent actions of the Bank of Spain itself, which told Banesto to reclassify Pta51.8bn of loans as non-performing at the end of last year. Mr Rojo said yesterday the Bank had examined every loan of more than Pta750m in its 1992 inspection (although Banesto and JP Morgan put the threshold at Pta500m). Mr Conde argued strongly that this meant Banesto had in effect been given a clean bill of health for the future. Yet this ignored an important aspect of Banesto's loan portfolio. It was heavily weighted towards smaller loans which slipped under the Bank of Spain's threshold. Only 28 per cent of the loans of the Spanish bank, excluding Portuguese and other subsidiaries, were above Pta200m. As a result, the Bank of Spain inadvertently sent a false signal to investors. By allowing so much weight to be placed on its initial loan inspection, it helped give the impression that the small business and personal loans in which Banesto specialised had been given its seal of approval. As it turns out, this was disastrously inaccurate. Mr Pedro Solbes, the finance minister, told the finance committee yesterday that as the Bank of Spain's inspectors this year examined the smaller loans which had been the backbone of the 1988 to 1991 growth, they became extremely worried. 'The inspectors realised that the deterioration in Banesto's balance sheet was far worse than had been expected and that it needed an urgent rescue plan,' he said. Mr Rojo said that 47 per cent of the bank's loan book could have been classed as bad or doubtful at the end of last June. The remaining uncertainty is how the Pta500bn shortfall is going to be solved. Before the Bank of Spain's announcement, Banesto was predicting it would only break even in 1993, implying a Pta500bn retained loss if the whole revaluation was passed through the profit and loss account. Such a move would more than wipe out the group's Dollars 2.8bn in equity capital, including the Dollars 775m which was raised last year. Yet both the governor and the finance minister emphasised yesterday they expected the bank's share capital to take only part of the strain in a restructuring. There would be an attempt to work out the loan portfolio, which could gain value if Spain emerges from recession. The bank could also sell assets from La Corporacion, the industrial holding company 85 per cent owned by Banesto, which have an estimated liquidation value of Pta211bn. 'The bank has clear possibilities of coming out ahead,' said Mr Rojo with what appeared an unlikely degree of optimism yesterday. Contemplating their holdings of shares suspended at the Pta1,900 offer price, Banesto's investors may wish that they had read the runes more carefully.</p>

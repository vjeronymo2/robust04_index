			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Japan Telecom sets auction price Japan Telecom, one of the country's three long-distance telephone operators, yesterday announced a minimum bid price of Y2.41m per share for its 17,000 shares to be auctioned on August 25. A further 17,000 shares will be sold in a fixed-price offering immediately after the auction. This will include 5,000 shares to be offered to international investors, the first equity issue in Japan to include a separate international tranche. The issue constitutes 9.9 per cent of the company's outstanding shares. Japan Railways will remain the majority shareholder after the offer, with about 50 per cent of the company's stock. The minimum price represents a cash-call of at least Y819bn (Dollars 7.9bn) and indicates a price/earnings ratio of 97, based on the company's projected earnings per share for the year ending 31 March 1995. The shares will debut in Tokyo on September 6.</p>

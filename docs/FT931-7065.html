			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Straw demands review of grants AN INDEPENDENT review of the local government grant system was urged yesterday by Mr Jack Straw, the shadow minister for local government. He condemned the present method of distributing council grants as 'bent and flawed'. The government has already conceded that standard spending assessments, its estimates of what councils need to spend, should be thoroughly reviewed and the process has started. Ministers admit privately that as the system of limiting local spending becomes increasingly dependent on SSAs, the present system might not be 'robust' enough to be a fair basis. Next month officials of the Department of the Environment will start talking to local authority associations about the review. The exercise will be completed by the autumn in order to take effect in the spring next year. But Mr Straw argued that there should be a wide review of SSAs, which should be independent of ministers and carried out by a team chosen after consultation with local authority associations and the Audit Commission, the council spending watchdog. The average council tax bill in England will be Pounds 447 per household, according to a survey for Public Finance and Accountancy magazine and Channel Four News based on council tax figures recommended or approved by 313 of 529 councils. Labour-led Harlow District Council in Essex voted last night to shed 176 jobs from its total of 1,400 and to reduce its budget from Pounds 24m in 1992-93 to Pounds 18.2m in 1993-94.</p>

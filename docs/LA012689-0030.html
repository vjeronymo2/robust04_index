			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> EX-POLICE OFFICER SENTENCED  </P> <P> A former Hawthorne policeman, who pleaded no contest last month to a charge of  assault for hitting a 17-year-old suspect with a flashlight, has been fined  $1,000, placed on probation and ordered to perform 500 hours of community  service.  </P> <P> Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Raymond Mireles imposed the sentence Monday on  John Garza, 25, a patrolman who was fired by the Hawthorne Police Department  about a month after the assault on June 12.  </P> <P> Garza entered his plea Dec. 14 to the felony charge in exchange for the  district attorney's office dropping a second assault charge stemming from the  same incident, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden.  </P> <P> Garza faced up to one year in County Jail, but Mireles chose the other  penalties and suspended a 90-day jail sentence.  </P> <P> The incident that led to the assault began early in the morning, when police  arrested two teen-agers for allegedly firing a pistol in the Holly Park section  of Hawthorne. The 17-year-old had already been captured by other officers and  was lying handcuffed on the ground when Garza arrived and hit the youth on the  head for no reason, Darden said.  </P> <P> Garza's lawyer could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

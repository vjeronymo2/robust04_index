			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen , who is also a vice-premier, returned here  by air this morning from a three-pronged mission. It included  visits to six African countries and to France and a meeting with  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    In an interview at the airport here this morning on arrival  from Paris, Qian told reporters that his three missions had gone  well.    Diplomats here believe that Qian's effectiveness is  impressive, since he has finished such important and intensive  diplomatic missions with significant achievements within only  half a month.    The first leg of Qian's foreign trip at the beginning of  this  year was his visit to Ethiopia, Eritrea, The Sudan, Kenya,  Madagascar and Mauritius. This was also his fourth visit to  Africa since he became foreign minister in 1988.    Since his first Africa visit in 1990, Qian has shuttled back  and forth in the African continent and has by now visited 21  African countries, about two fifths of all of them.    Qian's frequent visits to Africa are seen as visible proof  that China pays great attention to the African countries' role  in the international arena. To further strengthen and develop  friendly relations and cooperation with the developing countries  has always been vital for China's diplomatic policies.    While Qian was visiting East Africa, China and Lesotho  resumed diplomatic relations, bringing to 159 the number of  countries which have forged diplomatic ties with China.    While Qian was still in Africa, General Liu Huaqing,  vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission, paid an  official goodwill visit to Thailand and Indonesia.    There were also important foreign visitors to Beijing. The  Zimbabwean Parliament Speaker Nolan Chipo Makombe, Cambodian  First Prime Minister Samdech Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime  Minister Hun Sen, Japanese deputy prime minister and Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata, speaker of the National Assembly of the  Republic of Korea Lee Man Sup -- all visited China, one after  another, during the first month of 1994.    This series of "comings and goings" shows the strong  momentum  of China's diplomatic activities. The visits also reflect that  promotion and deepening of cooperative relations of mutual  benefit with its neighbor nations and the developing countries  is the key point of China's diplomacy.    Qian's France visit was an important high-level contact  between China and France after the two sides issued a joint  communique in mid-January, marking the normalization of  bilateral relations.    Qian was "satisfied" with his meetings and talks with French  President Francois Mitterrand, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur,  and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, saying that the two sides  achieved understanding on many issues, which "is of great  importance to the relations between China and France and the  other European countries as well."    Qian pointed out that many Western countries are intrigued  by  China's huge market, and that they are willing to take part in  China's economic development. To strengthen ties with China has  become a trend in the world, he added.    France has announced that Prime Minister Balladur is to  visit  China, and Foreign Minister Juppe also indicated that he would  go to China in the near future. Their visits, if happening,  will be major events in Sino-French relations and make the  relations resume at a high level.    The 30th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-French  diplomatic relations falls on January 27, 1994. Over the past  30 years, bilateral relations have experienced both progress and  difficulties.    The issuing of a Sino-French joint communique and Qian's  France visit unfolded a new page in the annals of bilateral  relations.    Around Qian's visit to France, Qiao Shi, chairman of the  Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, has  been in Europe on an official visit to Germany, Austria and  Switzerland.    There is no doubt that both Qian's and Qiao's visit to West  Europe will have extensive and positive impact on the  development of the relations between China and West European  countries.    The Paris meeting between Qian and U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher and a visit to China by Lloyd Bentsen, U.S.  secretary of treasury, are two important events between China  and the United States.    During the three-hour-long talks, the Chinese foreign  minister and the U.S. secretary of state exchanged views and  achieved consensus on some bilateral and international issues.    Qian told XINHUA in the interview today that he and  Christopher both held that through constant contacts, China and  the United States should further increase their understanding of  each other, narrow or even eliminate differences on some  matters, including the most favored nation trade status issue,  so that they would not hinder the development of bilateral ties.    Qian said the Sino-U.S. foreign ministerial meeting will be  followed by more contacts between high-ranking officials from  the two sides, and that bilateral exchanges will maintain their  active momentum, which started last November when the Sino-U.S.  summit meeting was held in Seattle.</p>

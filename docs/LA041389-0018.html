			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> A miniature Koran by an unknown 10th-Century scribe has been auctioned for a  record $297,000. Christie's auction house in London says the price paid for the  little book of 332 vellum pages, less than 3 inches tall and written in Eastern  Kufic script, was the highest ever paid for a Koran or part of one. The buyer  was only identified as representing a European collection. Christie's had put a  top estimate on the Koran of $169,000. A single decorated leaf from a large  Koran made the previous record of $268,000 in London in October. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

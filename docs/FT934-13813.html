			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Government wins defence votes THE government secured comfortable majorities in the Commons last night over its defence policy but was again warned that excessive spending cuts imposed by the Treasury would spark a revolt by Tory backbenchers. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence select committee, and Mr Patrick Cormack, MP for Staffordshire South, were among prominent Tory backbenchers who gave notice that they would oppose any attempt to slash the defence budget by Pounds 1bn. Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said he had taken note of the significant number of Tory backbenchers who had expressed 'very grave reservations'. He suggested that there was scope for 'substantial' savings through the continuing drive to secure improved efficiency and value for money without reducing the operational efficiency of the front-line services. Mr Aitken stressed that these were not the kind of cuts 'on which tears or votes should be shed'. Sir Nicholas insisted that the Treasury should not be allowed to take control in deciding Britain's defence commitments. He could not believe that it would remain properly defended if any more 'substantial cuts' were imposed. Mr Cormack said now was not the time to seek to 'balance the books' by cutting the defence budget by Pounds 1bn. If that happened, he would seek to persuade as many Tory MPs as possible to join him in voting against it. Mr Cormack said he had been assured by a backbencher that they would not take much persuading. The government won a majority of 55 (322-267) to defeat a Labour attempt to condemn its failure to address long-term security needs. Labour leftwingers - ignoring the official party line to abstain - were defeated by a government majority of 298 (332-34) when they voted against the defence estimates.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Honorable Minister of Information and  Broadcasting, Mr. Mpho Malie, has appealed to the Basotho nation  to work hard to strive for peace, stability, reconciliation, and  social development.    In a statement released today the minister said it was of  paramount importance at this critical time that the entire  Basotho nation should join hands and strive to combat all acts  of sabotage which were aimed at frustrating Lesotho's democracy.  He said the acts of lawlessness and crime perpetrated by  criminal offenders were not aimed at destabilizing the ruling  Basotholand Congress Party, BCP, but were instead aimed at  causing national instability and the frustration of the  democratic process.    Mr. Malie said it was necessary to project tolerance and  respect for one another among the people of Lesotho and that  further bloodshed in Lesotho should not be allowed to take  place. The minister said it was unfortunate that political  gatherings by the main opposition Basotho National Party, BNP,  and reports by its official newspaper (Mothlanka) left much to  be desired. This, together with utterances by some of the  leadership of the BNP, could have disastrous effects.    Mr. Malie condemned the acts of abduction of people and  misuse of government property, such as vehicles, by the striking  police and said such acts were detrimental to the economic,  social, and political stability of the country. The acts  condemned by the minister included the brutal killing of the BCP  youth leader, (Selabalo Mathie), the abduction of the principal  secretary of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and  some police officers, and the erection of road blocks.    The minister extended his appreciation to members of the  Lesotho army who had responded promptly in dealing with the  rampant lawlessness and the instability in some parts of the  country.</p>

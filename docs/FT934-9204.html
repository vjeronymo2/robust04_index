			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Walt Disney hit by Dollars 350m charge for French park WALT Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of Dollars 77.8m after taking a Dollars 350m charge associated with Euro Disney, the troubled French theme park in which it holds a 49 per cent stake. The company reported a 10 per cent drop in operating income, from Dollars 395.8m to Dollars 356.7m, on revenues which rose 5 per cent to Dollars 2.2bn, while the net loss worked through at 15 cents a share. In the fourth quarter of last year Disney made Dollars 224m, or 42 cents a share. Wall Street analysts were generally sanguine about the lower-than-expected operating results, pointing to special factors, but some trimmed their 1994 earnings forecasts because of the large losses at Euro Disney. Salomon Brothers, for example, cut its projection from Dollars 2.05 a share to Dollars 1.85. Walt Disney's investment in Euro Disney produced a loss of Dollars 414.5m for the quarter - including the Dollars 350m charge - and a loss of Dollars 514m for the full year. Walt Disney said the need for a financial restructuring at Euro Disney had created uncertainty about the American company's ability to collect its current receivables from Euro Disney and about its provision of temporary funding to the associate. Its Dollars 350m charge would fully reserve it against both, with roughly 50 per cent of the sum accounted for by the funding. Walt Disney's theme parks and resorts saw operating income fall 11 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 190.4m on revenues down 6 per cent at Dollars 933.7m. Filmed entertainment saw operating income down 22 per cent at Dollars 94.9m on revenues up 12 per cent to Dollars 879.8m. The company attributed the drop to an unusually strong 1992 fourth quarter. For the full year, Disney reported net income of Dollars 299m, or 55 cents a share, down from Dollars 816m, or Dollars 1.52 a share, after accounting changes and Euro Disney charges. Its operating income rose 20 per cent to Dollars 1.72bn on revenues 14 per cent higher at Dollars 8.5bn.</p>

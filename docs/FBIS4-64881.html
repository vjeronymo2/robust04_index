			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Trade: U.S. Obstacles Are Costly </F> for Europe -- Increased Recourse to Unilateral and Bilateral  Measures"]    [Text] The United States is continuing to orientate its  trade policies on the basis of the competitiveness of its  companies, a report by the European Commission (EC) accuses.    European Union (EU) companies lost "several billion dollars"  in 1993 due to U.S. trade barriers, but the signature of the  GATT agreement allows the hope of an improvement in  transatlantic trade in 1994. This is the EC view in its 10th  annual report on U.S. barriers to trade and investment.    As it presented the document yesterday, the European  Executive deplored the fact that "worries about the  competitiveness of U.S. companies continue to orientate the  trade policies" of Washington. The Europeans are concerned in  particular about the resurrection in March of the so-called  Super 301 procedure, which allows the United States to decide  unilaterally to take sanctions against a trading partner  suspected of unfair trading practices. "That indicates that they  are allowing themselves to once again be tempted by increased  recourse to unilateral or bilateral trade measures," the EC said.    Taken together, the tariff and regulatory barriers listed in  the EC's report constitute lost earnings of "several billion  dollars" for European companies which would like to export  across the Atlantic.    The EU member states had a trading deficit of ECU6.5 billion  in 1993, considered as "reasonable and moderate" by Brussels.  Transatlantic trade flows were ECU165 billion and EU exports  reached a new high, increasing from ECU73.9 billion in 1992 to  ECU80 billion in 1993.    The EC's annual report denounces the U.S. barriers, most of  which are well known. In addition to unilateral measures, which  Washington wants to keep even though they contradict the spirit  of the Uruguay Round agreement, the document lists fiscal  barriers (which affect cars in particular), the large number of  standards, the rules protecting industrial property and the  unequal treatment of non-U.S. subsidiaries.    The EC also regrets the "frequent recourse to the notion of  national security," and the interpretation of certain political  and environmental rules to the detriment of European companies.    According to the EC, European companies have also suffered  considerably from the high customs duties which can exceed 40  percent for some products like textiles, clothing, and table and  glassware.    However, reductions in these "tariff peaks" are provided for  under the GATT agreement and Europe will monitor their  application.    Let us add that from the other side of the ocean, the report  by the U.S. Administration on "trade barriers," published on 31  March, pointed its finger at Japan above all. But the EU was  cited in particular for its system of protection for audiovisual  products.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / The hole in our pocket: The chancellor's dilemma, an inside view The Treasury expects to borrow Pounds 50bn this year. Yet only three years ago, in his March 1990 Budget, then-Chancellor Major expected a balanced budget for 1993-94 after giving away Pounds 3bn in tax cuts. What has caused this rapid deterioration in the public finances and can it be reversed? Some blame excessive public spending ahead of the election. On this view, the deficit will not be cured until what was given away then is clawed back by further spending cuts. Others claim the main problem is the recession, which pushes up social security payments irresistibly while reducing tax receipts. On this view, much of the deficit will melt away as the recovery gathers strength. A third factor, less widely recognised, is an unexpected erosion of tax revenues because of policy changes, such as the introduction of independent taxation, new tax breaks for savings, and generous carry-back of losses for corporation tax. There is a lively debate among forecasters - including the Seven Wise Men and the OECD - about the respective importance of these factors, on which their policy recommendations depend. If the deficit is mainly due to the recession, it will disappear in the upturn. If not, action must be taken to correct it. Unfortunately, you can only quantify the effect of the recession by comparing the actual outturn with a hypothetical no-recession scenario. That gets you straight into the world of economic models, the debate about the underlying growth rate of the economy, and the extent to which output is currently below trend. Economists differ sharply on these issues and about the effect of output on tax and spending. To avoid these problems, we can adopt a much simpler approach, which is to compare the latest official revenue and spending projections for 1993-94 with those made in March 1990. That date was the last occasion on which the government's fiscal plans showed the economy still on course for a balanced budget in the medium term. The comparison shows how much of the extra borrowing is due to extra spending and how much reflects lost tax revenue. We can roughly quantify the effect of the recession on tax revenues, even though we do not know the size of the output gap, because we do know that we have lost nearly 5 per cent of output compared with earlier plans. Since tax revenue depends, other things being equal, on the level of output, that implies a 5 per cent loss of revenue, worth some Pounds 11bn. The remaining Pounds 13bn of lost revenue must be attributed to tax changes that were not forecast in 1990. On the spending side, we know that the social security budget bears the brunt of the recession. If we assume that all the extra social security spending (compared with previous plans) is due to the recession, we get a rough idea of how much of the extra spending is recession-induced. We find that planned social security spending for 1993-94 has been revised upwards by Pounds 11bn since 1990. (Although the published 1990 spending plans do not include a breakdown by spending department beyond 1992-93, we can use the rate of growth of social security spending published in the 1991 plans to fill in the missing number.) Since total public spending has been revised upwards by no less than Pounds 30bn, it is tempting to conclude that discretionary spending must have risen by Pounds 19bn. However, this ignores a very important item of unavoidable spending: the interest charges on past borrowing. When public borrowing goes up, whether because of recession or because of extra discretionary spending, debt interest charges also rise. The deterioration in the public finances has brought about a sharp rise in the government's outstanding debt, and hence in the interest accruing on it. Strictly speaking, some of that in-crease should be scored as discretionary, since it is past spending decisions as much as the recession that have pushed up today's debt interest bill. On the other hand, the government has no discretion about paying the bill today. When debt interest charges go up, it is an irresistible claim on the public purse, just as it is when rising unemployment pushes up social security claims. Which brings us to the central issue. The whole point of trying to calculate how much of the rise in borrowing has been due to the recession is to estimate how much will be automatically reversed by economic recovery. ln this context, it is immaterial why the extra debt interest charges have arisen. The point is they are an extra charge on the public purse which is both irresistible and, unlike social security spending, irreversible. Compared with its March 1990 plans, the government will have Pounds 110bn of extra debt by the end of this year. At today's interest rates, that is some Pounds 8bn of extra public spending on debt interest charges. These calculations, summarised below, are intended to cast light on two issues: how we got into this mess; and how we might get out of it. The figures suggest that our problems are two-fifths due to the recession, one-fifth due to extra discretionary spending and one-fifth due to missing tax revenue. The missing-fifth is the combined effect of all these factors on the debt interest bill. Getting the public finances back to the healthy state shown in the 1990 plans requires some Pounds 11bn of spending cuts and Pounds 13bn of tax increases. But even that would not eliminate the residue of debt interest charges resulting from a permanently higher national debt. Nor is it by any means certain that all the recession-induced social security spending will simply disappear in the upturn. The social security budget has tended to ratchet upwards in the past, leaping ahead in recessions but not falling back in the subsequent re-covery. In the first Budget of 1993, Mr Norman Lamont proposed tax increases which will raise an extra Pounds 10bn of revenue by 1995-96. Mr Clarke has hinted that he may do more in the November Budget. So the problem of revenue shortfall is being addressed. However, it cannot be right to tackle a deficit which is partly caused by excessive spending simply by raising taxes. Action is also needed on the spending side. Yet none has so far been proposed. Why not? I shall try to explain next week. The author is former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies and was special adviser to the former chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont.  -------------------------------------------------- How and why borrowing has changed  -------------------------------------------------- Changes in Plans for 1993-4 between 1990 and 1993 (Pounds bn)  -------------------------------------------------- Due to       Recession    Other factors    Total  -------------------------------------------------- Revenue         -11           -13           -24 Spending         11            19            30  --------------------------------------------------</p>

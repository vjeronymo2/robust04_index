			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / BNP shares set at FFr240 in attempt to draw investors THE FRENCH government yesterday set a lower than expected price of FFr240 on shares in Banque Nationale de Paris, the country's third largest bank, in an attempt to draw investors to the first issue in its ambitious privatisation programme. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said that the issue, which will be offered to investors from today, 'is aimed primarily at French households'. Market analysts in Paris said that the price of the issue, which values the bank at about FFr43bn (Dollars 7.5bn), was at least FFr10 per share lower than they had forecast. They said it demonstrated the desire of the centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur to guarantee a successful start to its plan to privatise 21 state-owned groups. 'They want to begin with a bang' explained Mr David Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris. Mr Alphandery also gave details of a group of stable investors which will hold about 30 per cent of BNP's shares after privatisation. Most of these shareholders will be French financial and industrial groups, but they will also include General Electric of the US, BAT Industries of the UK, Roche Holding of Switzerland, Dresdner Bank of Germany and the Kuwait Investment Authority. According to Mr Alphandery, the price was slightly above the minimum level of FFr235.5 set by the privatisation commission, an independent body formed to establish the terms and conditions of the privatisation issues. He said it was 'a medium-term' price which had been calculated on the basis of analysis of BNP's earnings performance and business strategy. Under the terms of the BNP issue, which will close on the evening of October 12, 72m shares will be offered for sale. Of these, 37.5m will be reserved for individual investors and 34.6m for institutional investors. The tranche allocated to individual investors can be increased to 47m shares if demand is strong. Of the core investors, Union des Assurances de Paris, the state-owned insurance group, which is also on the privatisation list, will raise its holding in BNP from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. A group of 15 other industrial and financial groups will hold a further 15 per cent of BNP's shares. Chief among these 15 investors are Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, which will be privatised by the middle of next year, and Saint-Gobain, the glass and building materials group - which will each hold about 2 per cent. Like the rest of the 15 investors they will pay a premium of 4 per cent. Other core investors include Dresdner Bank, a strategic partner of BNP, which will hold about 1 per cent of the shares. The two banks eventually plan to take a 10 per cent stake in each other. The privatisation of BNP will raise about FFr28bn for the government. The target for the year as a whole is FFr40bn. The balance will be raised through the sale of the next companies on the list, Rhone Poulenc, the chemicals group, and Banque Hervet, a small retail bank.</p>

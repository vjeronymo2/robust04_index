The high turnout for the mile-long march was fueled by concern after  a week of intense guerrilla warfare in El Salvador culminated in the murders of  the priests in the capital city, said organizers who have frequently held  rallies that have drawn fewer people. "I haven't come out for a long time to  protest," said painter Antonio Bernal. "But things have gotten so bad that we  have to do as much as we can to stop the killings."  </P></p>

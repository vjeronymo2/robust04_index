			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Letter: A self-help solution on housing Sir, Professor Gavin McCrone (Personal View, August 17) brought some realism to the housing market debate. If the ERM is to have any real impact on curbing inflationary pressures within the British economy, the old housing market solutions - increased mortgage tax relief and short-term interest rate reductions - will have to be assigned to history. Prof McCrone clearly understands this. But do Conservative backbenchers, now that the housing market is undergoing structural change similar to that faced by manufacturing industry in the early 1980s? If the government really wants to help those who own homes and who are affected by the asset value to debt ratio of their property or unstable employment prospects, it needs to formulate innovative solutions. Encouraging a partnership solution through self-help is one possible measure. The government could allow 100 per cent tax relief on rental income from property normally owner occupied coupled to the retention of tax relief at the standard rate, provided the accommodation is registered with the local authority as meeting certain quality standards. These measures would facilitate financial adjustment at the micro level without causing macro-level housing inflation. By making them retroactive, the government might avoid financial pressures resulting from speculation in the housing market as ERM-led adjustment took place. The advantage to the government is that revenue foregone never existed; the individual house owner is given an opportunity for self help; a private rented sector might grow from the recessionary ashes; and, through housing registration, tenants might be assured quality accommodation.

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Leading Article: A dearth of options ONE CONSTANT and unremitting theme of the post-war financial world has been the decline of the personal investor. Year in year out, almost without fail, the UK personal sector has appeared in the official statistics as a net disinvestor in company securities. Anonymous investment institutions have filled the gap, taking their stake in British equities up to two-thirds or more of the total value of the stock market. Not even the rhetoric of the Thatcher period, with its emphasis on popular capitalism and privatisation, was able to change the trend. Then, last year, came a dramatic, though untrumpeted, volte face. The private individuals who had sold Pounds 19.8bn, Pounds 7.8bn and Pounds 2.6bn in 1989, 1990 and 1991 respectively, suddenly bought a net Pounds 3.6bn of equities. In the first quarter of this year they added a further Pounds 835m to their holdings. It looks suspiciously as though the collapse in the housing market has finally achieved what years of exhortation by Tory politicians and stock exchange chairmen so signally failed to bring about. While richer individuals have been flocking back to the stock market, smaller retail investors have been pouring money into unit trusts. July alone saw a net Pounds 948m flood into the unit trust managers' coffers, taking the total for the first seven months of the year to over Pounds 5bn. That is more than the total cash flow of Britain's pension funds for the whole of last year - a remarkable reversal of another lengthy trend. This shift in the balance of power between retail investors and the big investment institutions is partly a reflection of the traditional hunt for income at a time when interest rates are plumbing historically low levels. People have been withdrawing their savings from low-yielding deposit accounts at banks and building societies and putting them into unit trusts or shares. Modest improvement That pattern is repeated all the way up the investment scale. Within an overheated equity market higher yielding shares have out-performed for much of this year as investors have sought protection in income. Elsewhere the institutions have re-acquired an appetite for commercial property investment that they lost in the disinflationary 1980s. The big question in all this is whether the quality of the income compensates for the risk of falling prices. By historic standards, the current dividend yield on British equities of 3.7 per cent looks low. Moreover dividends shrank last year in real terms and look set for only modest improvement this year. This does not, then, look the time to buy equities for the long term; but note that, after the 1967 devaluation, equities were exceptionally buoyant despite negative dividend growth. Today the market looks set to bubble away in comparable fashion until interest rates are perceived to have run their downward course. The mere fact that equities bounced back to record levels after the Bundesbank threw a wet towel on the proceedings on Thursday by failing to cut key interest rates suggests that this bull will take some stopping. Heavily oversold In property the long-term position is very different from equities. Despite the sharp recovery since last year yields are still historically high, relative to gilts, in a market which had been heavily oversold by the institutions. The problem for investors is that the excess supply of property, much of it in the hands of banks, is not all income-producing. The attraction of a higher yield than in gilts depends on the existence of a good quality tenant and a long lease with upward-only rent reviews. Even here, there is a question mark in that underlying rental income continues to fall while capital values are rising. Many tenants are committed, under the terms of standard institutional leases, to paying way over the open market rent. Buyers have to base their judgment on the likely rent and the potential value of the property in, say, 10, 15 or 20 year time. If their assumptions about residual values are over-optimistic, the comparison with gilts is a nonsense. Nor are gilts immune from questions about the quality of income. For while gilt yields have been falling, budget deficits across the developed world have been rising, thereby raising questions about future inflationary pressures. As the London-based securities firm BZW points out, the debt overhang cannot be stabilised until real debt yields fall below the likely trend growth of GDP. Taking British index-linked gilts as a yardstick, real government bond yields have almost certainly fallen across the Group of Seven industrialised countries. But even at around 3.3 per cent, they are still above any plausible growth assumption for the short to medium term, which means that debt burdens will continue to grow. But if governments do confront their fiscal problems, economic growth will, paradoxically, be slower in the next year or two. Investors, it seems, are making precious little allowance for risk in equities, gilts and property alike. But that is because, in the hallowed phrase, they cannot find a better hole.</p>

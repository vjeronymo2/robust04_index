			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / US news service expands in Europe CABLE NEWS Network International, the 24-hour US television news service, yesterday expanded its service in the UK and the rest of Europe when it began broadcasting on the Astra satellite system. Until now the service, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has been available only to owners of large satellite dishes and subscribers to cable television networks. The decision to broadcast from Astra, as well as an Intelsat satellite, means that the international news service will be available to an additional 8m homes in Europe equipped with 60cm dishes. That includes more than 2.7m homes in the UK. The extension of its broadcasting is the latest move by CNNI in its strategy to make its service more international. This week the station began co-presenting its live programme, The International Hour, from London. Spanish-language translations of a number of programme segments will be introduced from September.</p>

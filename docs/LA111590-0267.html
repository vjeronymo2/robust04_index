			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: SCHUMACHER, OUT OF 'PHANTOM,' STARTS 'DYING YOUNG'  </P> <P> THIS WEEK director Joel Schumacher began filming "Dying Young," starring Julia  Roberts and Campbell Scott, in Mendocino, Calif.  </P> <P> But after much hoopla -- Schumacher has backed out of his commitment to direct  the movie of "The Phantom of the Opera." He and Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the  screenplay together and spent months here and abroad making plans. But, as one  observer says, "You know, in show biz, if people don't 'get married' right  away, sometimes it never happens."  </P> <P> Joel and Andrew say they are still friends, but someone other than Joel will  direct the great London and Broadway stage hit musical for the screen.  </P> <P> THE BRITISH are coming -- apart? London is agog over director Trevor Nunn. He  has left his wife, Sharon Leigh, and their two children to trek off after  actress Imogene Stubbs of the Royal Shakespeare Company. (She has just played  the leading role in the coming Herbert Ross movie, "True Colors.") Nunn had  directed Stubbs in "Othello."  </P> <P> Nunn already had a go-round with American actress Judy Kuhn while married to  Sharon Leigh. And, as a matter of fact, he was once wed to actress Janet  Suzmann and left her for -- Sharon Leigh.  </P> <P> Award-winning playwright Tom Stoppard (his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are  Dead" recently won the Venice Film Festival) and his wife, Dr. Miriam Stoppard,  are also suffering some apartness.  </P> <P> THE OTHER day I reported all wasn't so hotsy-totsy between those Columbia  biggies Jon Peters and Peter Guber. They take exception and say my report  "quite saddened" them. "Our relationship, both personally and professionally,  has withstood numerous outside assaults. . . . There is not a scintilla of  truth in your article." Then they invited me to come visit in their homes,  which would "enable you to understand our relationship in person."  </P> <P> Well, this is one of the most unusual denials I've ever received in this  business. It's nice not to be yelled at or threatened with broken legs, for a  change.  </P></p>

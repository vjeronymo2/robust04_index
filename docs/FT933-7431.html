			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Thomas Jourdan cuts loss to Pounds 0.5m THOMAS JOURDAN, the diversified manufacturing group, is seeing the benefit of restructuring undertaken over the last three years, and has almost halved its loss. For the six months ended June 30 the group incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 465,000, compared with Pounds 874,000, from turnover of Pounds 8.96m (Pounds 8.9m). There was a Pounds 67,000 (Pounds 290,000) exceptional charge, this time representing the cost of holding surplus properties. The group makes trouser and tie presses, decorative fire surrounds, handles for cabinet furniture, cosmetic and industrial brushes, and solid wood fitted furniture. Mr Keith Whitten, chairman, said a significantly larger part of profits came in the second half. The improvement in trading was mainly the result of rationalisation and innovation and from the launch of new products. His belief that the group would perform satisfactorily in the rest of the year was not based on any dramatic upturn in consumer demand, but 'rather on the fact that we have efficient well run businesses able to trade profitably at current levels of activity'. In the half year losses per share were cut to 2.59p (4.86p). The interim dividend is again 0.5p, payable January 6.</p>

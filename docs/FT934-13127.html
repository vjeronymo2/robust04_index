			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): US markets remain listless in the heat of summer IT WAS sweltering 90-degree weather in New York for most of the summer, and US stock markets seemed to wilt in the heat. While bond prices surged in the third quarter, because of low inflation and weak economic growth, the markets' leading equity securities stood virtually still. Between July and September the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 1.1 per cent to 3,555.12, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index advanced only 1.8 per cent to 458.93. Smaller company stocks, however, enjoyed a better run  - the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks rose 8.3 per cent to 762.28. The pattern of trading and the state of investor sentiment were little changed from the previous quarter. The fundamentals of the stock markets were neither especially good nor bad  - the economy, which grew only modestly in the period, continued to perform poorly by historic standards. Inflation remained unthreatening, and corporate earnings improved, but not particularly impressively. Equities, however, were again supported by low interest rates, which continued to force investors to shift money out of low-yielding short-term assets in a search for higher returns. Much of that money flowed into the equity markets via mutual funds. The period started with investors in an extremely skittish mood. Prices gyrated wildly amid uncertainty about the economic outlook, and growing unease about the immediate future for stocks and bonds. Speculation about a possible sharp downward correction in financial markets cast a cloud over trading for the first few weeks. By late July the second quarter reporting season was in full swing, but the picture of corporate profitability was not clear enough to provide stocks with a substantial lift. There was good news from the likes of Sears Roebuck, Citicorp and Merck, and bad news from IBM, Apple Computer and Procter &amp; Gamble. IBM's share price fell to the lowest point since 1975 as the ailing computer giant announced further redundancies and plant closures. By the time the reporting season ended, the Dow had managed to reach new highs. This was particularly impressive, considering the background noise created by turmoil in Europe's managed currency system, an overheated gold rally and the last-gasp victory in Congress for President Clinton's deficit-reducing budget. The fact that the tax increases in the President's budget did not unduly damage stock market sentiment was mostly due to the positive response the budget received from the bond market, where yields dropped to new lows. This decline in interest rates was enough to keep investors' minds off having to pay higher taxes to tackle the deficit problem. By late August, the Dow had pushed through 3,600 for the first time, aided by buoyant stock markets in Europe, where the currency crisis had given way to widespread reductions in interest rates. Investors, however, failed to build on the new highs. Cyclical and consumer goods stocks suffered as economic concerns resurfaced, while fears about what President Clinton's healthcare reform plan might do to the medical industry's profits undermined pharmaceutical and healthcare stocks. In September, leading share prices seemed stuck in a narrow trading range, while secondary issues, somewhat neglected earlier in the year, staged a comeback. As the quarter drew to a close, a rash of billion-dollar mergers (in the banking, entertainment and health industries) lifted spirits, but political unrest in Russia and slow economic growth at home kept prices rooted. In Canada, the market held its ground reasonably well despite disturbing news on the economy and the autumn general election campaign. The TSE 300 composite index broke through 4,000 for the first time in the quarter, but like the Dow, it fell back from its peak, ending at 3,990.6, up 0.6 per cent on the quarter. Mexican equities surged back from the disappointing second quarter, as the Price and Quotations Index climbed 10 per cent to end at 1,840.72. Low interest rates, low inflation, improved corporate earnings and the news that Mexico, the US and Canada had reached various side deals on the North American Free Trade Agreement all contributed to the market's advance.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Vice President Rong Yiren met with Dr. Arpad Bogsch,  director general of the World Intellectual Property Organization  [WIPO], and his wife at the Great Hall of the People here this  morning. Dr. Bogsch is an old friend of the Chinese people.  This is his 15th visit to China.    Rong Yiren said: As China's economy develops and as its  reform and opening deepen, it has become increasingly aware of  the importance of protecting intellectual property rights.  Since signing a series of intellectual property rights  conventions, China has become more keenly aware of protecting  intellectual property rights. We must strengthen education to  let all our people clearly and correctly understand this.    He pointed out: The symposium in Kunming on Asian copyright  protection cosponsored by China's State Copyright Administration  and the WIPO will provide a good educational opportunity.    He continued: The Chinese Government supports the protection  of intellectual property rights and will make constant efforts  to improve work in this field.    Dr. Bogsch said: The Chinese Government has adopted a  prudent policy on intellectual property rights. The WlPO has  cooperated with China for more than 20 years. The Chinese  Government has attached great importance to enacting laws as  well as rules and regulations governing intellectual property  rights. This will bring benefits to China's foreign relations,  to its economic development, and to its economic, trade, and  cultural exchanges with other countries.</p>

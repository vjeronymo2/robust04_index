			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An war plane with unidentified markings violated the  Armenian Republic's airspace over its southern border at 1130  today and flew at great height toward Kapanskiy Rayon. The  invading airplane dropped two cluster bombs near the defensive  positions around Yegvard in the rayon. Unfortunately, the foggy  weather prevented determining from which country the airplane  came.    The Armenian Defense Ministry press service reported that it  is assumed that it took off from the Iranian border.    Armenia's air-defense forces have taken relevant measures.  Data on the fate of the warplane are being determined.    The same source reported that two SU-25 war planes, this  time  certainly from Iranian territory, invaded Megrinskiy Rayon and  dropped two cluster bombs on the railway station at 1540.    They later flew toward Kapanskiy Rayon and dropped two more  cluster bombs on the borders. The two aircraft then flew toward  Iran.    Data on the consequences of the bombing are being  determined.    Taking into consideration that the war planes appeared from  the territory of a neutral country, Armenia's air-defense forces  did not take counter-measures.    The aforesaid violations were also registered by the Russian  border troops stationed in Armenia, and the Armenian Armed  Forces command was informed about it.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] What is ABRI's [Armed Forces of the Republic of  Indonesia] social-political role in the next five years? "ABRI's  social-political role cannot be separated from a discussion of  ABRI's dual function as a moral and political concept, given the  background of its identity and the way it came into being," said  Armed Forces Chief of Staff General (Army) Feisal Tanjung in a  speech to Kostrad [Army Strategic Reserves Command] officers at  Kostrad's 33d anniversary on Saturday (5 March).    The Armed Forces Chief of Staff said that as people's social  life has grown more critical and has developed further, ABRI has  to update its role as pioneer, stabilizer, and dynamizer in  national life. "We carry out this role actively by making  decisions about state and government problems, by developing  Pancasila [Five Principles of the Nation] democratic life, the  constitution, and the rule of law," said Feisal Tanjung.    To understand ABRI's social-political role in the widest  sense, the Armed Forces Chief of Staff explained that what is  needed is the ability to think within the general macrosystem  which is integrated into the paradigm of Pancasila and the 1945  Constitution. We must also think within the special microsystem  of our ideological, political, economic, sociocultural, and  defense-security life. "In order to anticipate problems, ABRI's  social-political role must in fact be increased," said Armed  Forces Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung.    That is why every ABRI soldier is always aware that he plays  both a defense and security role and a social-political role.  Members of ABRI must lend support to creating conducive  social-political conditions. The approach used must persuasively  put forth arguments acceptable to all sides. "Avoid giving the  impression that ABRI is showing off its power," the Armed Forces  Chief of Staff asserted.    Armed Forces Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung said that in the  next five years ABRI's social-political role will take the form  of a force of thought rather than a purely physical form. This  means that ABRI personnel will have less of a presence in the  executive and judicial fields. "Only strategic positions will  still be occupied by ABRI personnel. However, ABRI will still be  present in the legislative bodies, both at the federal level and  in the provinces," said the Armed Forces Chief of Staff.    Armed Forces Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung's speech  reemphasized that ABRI will continue to push for a structured  national and state life. "ABRI will continue to try to put the  implementation of Pancasila democracy on a firm basis in order  to create high quality, dynamic, creative, and responsible  political superstructures and infrastructures," said Armed  Forces Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung.</p>

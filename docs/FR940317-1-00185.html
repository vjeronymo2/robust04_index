			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While complex to develop and administer, the noise budget could achieve noise mitigation through directly addressing the issue of noise impact but would not address the impacts other than noise. Once the ``budget'' is established based on target noise levels in various areas of the park, air tour operators would have substantial flexibility to adjust their business operations without exceeding those levels. The noise budget could act as a practical limit on the amount of aviation activity, but would not impose limits on the number of operations. A noise budget would also represent an incentive for operators to acquire relatively quiet aircraft to avoid a penalty on the number of operations that could be conducted within each operator's target noise level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individual allocations under a noise budget could be established by designating maximum noise levels for each operator. This could be done by ``grandfathering'' the current noise contribution by each air tour operator, or by some other administrative means. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Incentives To Encourage Use of Quiet Aircraft <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air tour operators could be encouraged to use relatively quiet aircraft on park overflights. For example, a flight corridor with a good scenic view of the canyon could be limited to aircraft meeting certain noise emission standards. An air tour operator could find it advantageous to convert its entire fleet to such quiet aircraft to incorporate that corridor in its tours. While there is no Federal requirement for aircraft to be manufactured to produce less noise than Stage 3 standards, some aircraft appropriate for air tour operations are quieter than Stage 3. Increased use of such aircraft in air tours would achieve noise mitigation through reducing noise levels on the surface of the park, although this option does not address issues other than noise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Questions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPS and FAA also solicit comments on several questions related to air tour sightseeing operations in and adjacent to units of the national park system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Policy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

The primary focus of this advance notice is commercial air sightseeing tours, rather than military or general aviation operations. It is anticipated that any regulations eventually developed would be general in nature and applicable to the entire national park system. It is not the intent of the NPS or FAA to develop regulations specific to any one park at this time. However, examples of aviation activities observed in one park may be used to support an opinion on overall aviation management issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

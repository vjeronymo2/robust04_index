			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Wilson (Connolly) off 13% despite rise in house sales WILSON (Connolly) Holdings, the Northampton-based builder, sold more houses last year than in the booming late 1980s. But its pre-tax profit fell 13 per cent from Pounds 31.1m to Pounds 27.1m, half the 1989 figure. Group turnover inched ahead to Pounds 198m (Pounds 196m) in spite of falls in the construction and property divisions. Mr Ian Black, managing director, said a record 2,750 homes had been sold, 400 more than in 1990 and nearly 1,000 more than in 1989. But the average price had come down to Pounds 54,400, from Pounds 59,500 in 1990 and Pounds 64,500 the previous year. He warned that prices could fall further this year. Two thirds of the 16 per cent decline in average prices was caused by deflation, the rest from the greater emphasis on one and two-bedroomed homes. Small houses accounted for 65 per cent of sales last year, 'whereas the normal level would be 45 to 50 per cent'. This year the group had seen some welcome signs after a 'diabolical' fourth quarter. Customer interest had picked up in the first two months and the ratio of house prices to earnings was in better balance. Wilcon Homes had spent nearly Pounds 30m buying land last year after virtual inactivity in 1990. 'I would be disappointed if we did not spend Pounds 30m again this year because it would mean a lack of opportunity,' said Mr Black. In spite of this increased outgoing, net debt had only risen to Pounds 25m, giving year-end gearing of 13 per cent compared with 7 per cent. Off-balance-sheet debt was Pounds 4m. Construction profits fell to Pounds 3.03m (Pounds 4.43m) on reduced turnover of Pounds 36.2m (Pounds 48.1m). The squeeze on margins was expected to get tighter. Property made just Pounds 380,000 profit, down from Pounds 5.56m. It would continue to be a struggle to break even, he said, although Pounds 15m cash had been released. Earnings per share fell to 10.2p (11.3p). An increased final dividend of 2.66p makes a total of 3.93p (3.74p). COMMENT Housing analysts seem to be going into a decline ahead of the general election. One said the average income of a new house-buyer was Pounds 22,000, just the level at which Labour's national insurance extension would start to bite. This is fuelling fears that house prices could fall further, just when land bought at higher prices is feeding through. Hence the erosion of margins. Wilcon's 17 per cent last year, which included a couple of respectable quarters, looks vulnerable to a further squeeze. Pre-tax profit is forecast to fall below Pounds 25m this year, giving a prospective p/e of just over 19 times. It remains one of the safe players, with a strong balance sheet and long land bank, making a case for holding the shares. But the price is unlikely to make progress until the political dust has settled, and the multiple is high enough to carry risk of a further downrating along with the sector.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HUNGARY DISMANTLING IRON CURTAIN AT AUSTRIAN BORDER  </P> <P> Hungary today began dismantling a symbolic Iron Curtain that has divided Europe  for four decades as it started to remove a barbed-wire fence on its border with  Austria.  </P> <P> "With the dismantling of this barrier, an era with our relations with Western  Europe and particularly Austria is closed," Interior Ministry official Andras  Kovari told a news conference.  </P> <P> The 20-year-old barbed-wire barrier replaced a mine field laid after the  Communist takeover of Hungary in the late 1940s.  </P> <P> The phrase "Iron Curtain" was coined by the late Winston Churchill, former  British prime minister, in a 1946 speech discussing the dangers of Soviet  expansionism.  </P> <P> "From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic," Churchill told an  audience in Fulton, Mo., "an iron curtain has descended across the continent."  </P> <P> Reformist Minister of State Imre Pozsgay said in October that the fence had  become outdated historically, politically and technically.  </P> <P> Dismantling began in the no-man's-land near this small town on the main road  between Budapest and Vienna and at three other points, Koszeg, Sopron and  Szentgotthard.  </P> <P> Journalists watched as soldiers with sledgehammers disconnected the alarm  system, lifted six-foot posts and rolled up wires.  </P></p>

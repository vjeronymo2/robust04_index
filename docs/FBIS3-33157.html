Therefore, we  must support the actions carried out by the executive branch and  the Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation (Petroven) to prevent this  measure from being implemented.    The statement was made by Allan Viergutz, president of the  Venezuelan Oil Chamber, who believes the current situation  "contradicts those excellent trade relations."    Viergutz explained that one of Petroven's most important  marketing policies has been to guarantee the United States a  reliable and continuous supply of petroleum-related products.  This included purchasing and refurbishing a series of  refineries, oil pipelines, terminals, and distribution systems.    Consequently, Petroven is currently one of the United  States'  largest gasoline suppliers, and this is why limitations to the  marketing of Venezuelan gasoline in U.S. territory is undeniably  an unfriendly action toward our country, which has been one of  the United States' most reliable suppliers of oil and  petroleum-related products for more than half a century.    "This inexplicable lack of loyalty toward a reliable  supplier  of the U.S. economy should prompt us to adopt a harder line in  our international policy," it was stated by Viergutz. He added  that, aside from the technical decisions which Venezuela may  adopt in connection with the EPA decision concerning refined  gasoline, our country "must adopt aggressive measures through a  boycott -- not only of oil products imported from the United  States but also of industrial products. The Venezuelan market  represents an important element in the U.S. export formula."    The Venezuelan Oil Chamber also believes that, in case we  are  compelled to seek new clients for our refined gasoline because  of the EPA's standards, we must counter the measure by importing  oil products -- which are normally purchased in the U.S. market  -- from other markets that receive our gasoline. This would  mean we would use "economic solutions."    Meanwhile, the Venezuelan Oil Chamber will adopt the  necessary actions to sponsor the free marketing of products in  the United States, given this "change in relations."</p>

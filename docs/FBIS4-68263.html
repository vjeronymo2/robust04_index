			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Ubran, "Short-Lived Militia"; "The </F> Estonian Army is Seeking Allies, the `Kaytseliyt' Enemies"]    [Text] Military Review    The defense forces of the Estonian Republic include regular  armed forces (2.5 thousand men), and a militarized volunteer  organization, the "Kaytseliyt" (roughly 6.5 thousand members)  and the security services of the state. In turn the state  security services consist of the border troops (4 thousand men),  the rescue service, and the coastal defense.  <H5>  We Monitor Everyone, Even the Police </H5>   When creating its own army, the Estonian government put the  "Kaytseliyt" in first place. Only now have they acknowledged  their error.    The "Kaytseliyt" (Defense League) is an organization  which appeared in the capacity of people's militia back before  the war. It was restored in 1990. In the autumn of the same year  it conducted an exercise to restore the prewar border of  Estonia, digging in border barriers on foreign territory in the  Leningrad oblast. In 1991-1993, the militiamen launched several  armed attacks on Russian service members in the Estonian  Republic.    When the volunteers "implemented" slogans having to do with  fighting the occupiers, this was supported in every way by the  political elite. But when it became clear that the Russian Army  was leaving sooner or later, another solution was found for the  military patriotism of the "Defense League."    Last summer in Pullapae the volunteer jaeger  company, which consisted of soldiers of the Karu "Kaytseliyt"  force, barricaded itself in their barracks as a token of protest  against the fact that the government was unable to purge the  ranks of the army of the "former communists and officers of the  Soviet Army." Even though the mutiny itself ended bloodlessly,  shots were fired. In November, when the former commander of the  Pullapae mutineers Asso Kommer was arrested, there was an  exchange of fire between the police and the jaegers,  and two policemen were wounded.    The scandal has not died down as yet. Even though recently a  government commission investigating the jaeger  affair disclosed the results of its work, the problems have not  been fully eliminated. In the opinion of the commission, the  conflict occurred primarily because the status of the  jaeger company had not been defined, and for this  reason the company constitutes an "alternative military unit  attracting both those who are interested in bearing arms, and  those who are interested in combat training outside the control  of the main staff of the defense forces."    Other unsavory facts about the "Kaytseliyt" were also  discovered. For example, the commission got hold of a document  which indicated that the Parnu militia was conducting  "counterintelligence against the municipal prefecture police."  It turns out that local "Kaytselliyt" members had received the  mission from their Tallinn leaders of "constantly surveilling  the activities of the police."    Although the "Defense League" has many highly placed  patrons,  the authorities have begun to take action to eliminate the  "partisan subunits." And in a future law on state defense  evidently there is no mention of the "Kaytseliyt" as a military  formation. Its functions will be rolled back to preparation of  draftees and reservists.    Aleksander Einzeln, the commander of the defense forces and  a  former American colonel invited back to the motherland (where he  became a Major General), is insisting on this. "The problem is  that many of these boys are acting more like members of a street  gang than like members of the armed forces," he commented on the  situation in the NEW YORK TIMES, "and we need to get rid of the  swindlers, thieves and adventurers."  <H5>  What Commander Would Not Love a Fast Career </H5>   After the "strike" of the jaeger company, the  nationalists in parliament blocked a decision on punishing the  culprits. But paying no mind to the radicals, Einzeln  immediately discharged around 1500 "Kaytseliyt" soldiers. And  just as demonstratively, he left in service the former communist  and Soviet officer Colonel Ats Laaneots, the chief of the main  staff of the defense forces, against whom the volunteers had  been acting.    Laaneots has retired only now, in April, when his authority  officially expired. But he turned over the job to his  49-year-old deputy chief of operations, Colonel Avro Serel, who  is also one of the "formers." Why did Einzeln pay no heed then  to those who seem to see communists everywhere? It is simply  that the defense forces require professionals. You see, now most  of the Army officers are quick promotions, as they say here,  from the initial period of independence. Only six percent of  them have higher education, and most of the commanders have  completed only a six-month training course.    But life rapidly dispelled the illusions of the first years  of independence. And in this context, the interview with the  commander of the Kaleva battalion, Captain Alar Laneman,  published in the newspaper ESTONSKAYA ZHIZN is quite  characteristic. Five officers are envisioned for each company in  his battalion, but usually there is only one. And he generally  has no experience in service, and cannot cope with the great  loads. It is no surprise, Laneman admits, that some of them "got  off track and began to push too hard." For this reason, many of  the young officers were "simply shoved out" of the battalion.    Who is having as meteoric a career in Estonia as the  politicians?    The 27-year-old journalist Yuri Luyk, becoming Minister  of Defense after the Pullapae crisis, this January returned to  his former place of work, and was confirmed as Minister of  Foreign Affairs. (He began his political career in 1991, taking  over a department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs). And the  military department is headed by a classmate from Tartu  University, Indrek Kannik, who also worked earlier at the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Like Luyk, he is a deputy of the  state council from the rightwing coalition party "Isamaa."    But still, one must give the young ambitious politicians  their due. The task set two years ago of gradual integration  into NATO is being accomplished here most actively, if one  compares the efforts of all the Baltic states. And the chief  obstacle, the creation of an army on the same principles as in  the West, is now starting to be overcome in Estonia.    Despite the economic difficulties, Prime Minister Mart Laar  last spring with the help of the then Defense Minister Hayn  Rebas, concluded a contract with the Israeli state company  "Tass" for delivery of NATO-standard small arms and antitank  weapons (with spare parts). The parliament easily "swallowed"  the astronomical cost of the deal for the Estonian Republic," 50  million U.S. dollars, and in January of this year a ship with  the first lot of foreign weapons was unloaded at the port of  Tallinn.    Yuri Luyk also evidently will go down in history for  announcing preparations for production of NATO caliber  ammunition in the Republic. The present minister Indrek Kannik  and following ones will also have their share of worries.  Estonia has undertaken to pay off the sum required by the  contract with "Tass" by the start of the year 2000. It is then  when plans are to bring the numerical strength of the regular  forces to 12 thousand, which is precisely how many can be  supplied with the purchased weapons.  <H5>  The Peacekeeping Battalion Is Lucky -- There Is Someone to </H5> Attack    It is still hard to speak of combat readiness of the defense  forces. And joining NATO is not exactly an immediate prospect. A  military alliance is now possible only with the nearest  neighbors, Latvia and Lithuania. The decision has already been  made to form a combined peacekeeping battalion in order to then  offer its services to the U.N.    And the first test of the forces was on February 20-22, when  one company from each country gathered for an exercise at a  range not far from Viru.    Participating were: One hundred and fifty service  members from Latvia, representing a motorized rifle battalion  stationed in Aluksne, 129 Estonian soldiers (Company "C" of the  Kupriyanov battalion); 96 men from the Lithuanian brigade  "Gelezhinas Vilkas" (1st Company of the Panevezys  Battalion).    Against the background of numerous statements regarding  preparation for peacekeeping operations, the plan of action of  the future U.N. soldiers appears strange. Here is how the  Estonian press describes the exercise: "The first day the  combined battalion withdrew under the pressure of enemy forces .  . . They (the subunits) cleanly emerged from the encirclement,  and by evening the withdrawal had stopped. The next day a  counterattack began which ended in a brilliant victory."    One could of course cite other details. But this is the main  thing. It is thought that the goal of any peacekeeping operation  is to stop fire and separate the belligerent parties. Here  everything is different.    It is no accident that immediately after the Viru maneuvers,  the "Kaytseliyt" leadership began to demand an "all-Estonian  defensive exercise," again dragging out its slogans about the  struggle with the occupiers. It is a good thing that after the  results of the work of the "jaeger" commission were publicized,  the enthusiasts supporting the "Defense League" decreased both  in the state assembly and in the government.    The venture has collapsed. They say that after this, one of  the "Kaytseliyt" leaders began work on his memoirs--a good sign  that his time had passed.</p>

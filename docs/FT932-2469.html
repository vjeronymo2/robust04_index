			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Hanson backs down over proposed rule changes HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, has unexpectedly withdrawn a plan to give its chairman greater control over the annual general meeting, following strenuous opposition from shareholders. Lord Hanson, chairman, said yesterday: 'My previous letter to shareholders, asking for their permission to vary certain articles of association, apparently gave some the impression that we were seeking to take draconian powers over shareholders and to restrict their rights. This I regret as, needless to say, this was not my intention.' The changes would have eliminated the right of shareholders to nominate a director to the board unless backers represented at least 10 per cent of the vote. Also, shareholders would have lost the right to propose amendments to resolutions at the meeting unless they represented 5 per cent of the company's share capital. Two leading shareholder groups, the Pensions Investment Advisory Council and the National Association of Pension Funds, had organised the opposition. Yesterday, Mr John Rogers, secretary to the investment committee of the NAPF, said: 'This decision is a very positive and responsible one from a board which has listened to its shareholders.' The offending proposals, contained in a broader set of suggested changes to the articles of association, were due to have been approved at an extraordinary general meeting on June 25. All but one of the measures - the establishment of a new share option scheme  -have been withdrawn. However, Hanson will call a second EGM in July at which other measures, which were welcomed by shareholders, will be resubmitted. The move poses difficulties for the 20,000 Hanson shareholders who had elected to take advantage of a scrip dividend option for the dividend payable on July 1. Approval for Hanson to pay that dividend in shares rather than cash is among the proposals which will not be voted on at the June 25 EGM. Shareholders will be allowed to cancel their decision to receive their dividends in shares, and instead earn cash to be paid on July 1. Those wanting shares will be advised that receipt of certificates will be delayed until after the second EGM.</p>

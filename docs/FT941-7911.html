			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Italian government brokers Fiat peace deal with union The Italian government has brokered a costly deal between Fiat, the country's biggest private employer, and the unions to avoid big job losses and lay-offs in the motor industry. Fiat lost close to L1,800bn (Pounds 730m) last year. The deal, affecting 16,600 of Fiat's 95,000 Italian workforce, contains three main elements: an unprecedented use of early retirement for 6,600, and special funding for 2,200 losing their jobs; introduction of work sharing and a shorter working week influenced by events at Volkswagen; a commitment by the government and Fiat to invest L450bn (Pounds 182m) in developing non-polluting cars. An industry analyst described the agreement as 'the last of the old-style corporatist deals with the state bankrolling labour peace and giving Fiat a helping hand'. A leading member of the FIOM engineering union said: 'We fought hard to make the point that this is throwing money at funding job losses instead of finding money to finance an industrial strategy. This is a financial solution; it does not secure the industrial future of Fiat or future jobs in the motor industry.' Fiat announced in November it wanted to cut the labour force by 5 per cent and lay off 10 per cent more for two years. When it began implementing the programme last month without union agreement there were stoppages at Fiat plants, especially those most at risk of closure. With a general election in March, the government has been anxious to bring the two sides together to avoid serious labour unrest. Fiat has made an important concession in accepting the principle of 'solidarity contracts', a catch-all phrase covering work-sharing, a shorter working week and lower salaries to ensure that people keep their jobs. Until recently, it was insisting that this was not a productive use of labour and proposed lay-offs for two years pending a sales recovery. In return for acceptance the government has shouldered more of the social and political cost of streamlining Fiat's automotive operations. Some 2,200 jobs have been saved. However, the unions have not obtained the kind of guarantees they would like about Fiat's future.</p>

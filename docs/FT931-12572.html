			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Slovaks fail to pick president THE Slovak parliament yesterday failed to elect a president, in its second attempt in two days to choose a head of state, and it will have to vote again next month, writes Patrick Blum in Prague. Mr Roman Kovac, the candidate of the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), received 78 votes, improving on the 69 votes he won in the first round, but this was still short of the 90 votes needed in the 150 seats in parliament to win the presidency. His only other opponent, Mr Milan Ftacnik of the Democratic Left Party, which groups the former communists, received 31 votes. There were a number of abstentions, and eight invalid votes. The results are a blow to Mr Vladimir Meciar, the prime minister and HZDS leader, who had strongly backed Mr Kovac. The next round of voting will take place on February 15-16 with new candidates. Meanwhile, the HZDS will hold discussions with other parties to find a consensus candidate. This is expected to be Mr Michal Kovac, the former chairman of the Federal Parliament of Czechoslovakia, who had been tipped as a strong candidate for the presidency, or for a senior job in the government or as governor of the Slovak central bank.</p>

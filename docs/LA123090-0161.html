			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOWL GAMES SURVIVE KING CONTROVERSY, BUT ARIZONA SUFFERS  </P> <P> When last we left it, the Grand Canyon State was in a state of turmoil. The  voters had rejected two propositions that would have established a paid state  holiday to honor Martin Luther King Jr., the slain civil rights leader.  </P> <P> Forty-seven states have such a holiday, and Arizona became a national symbol,  albeit a reluctant one, when on Nov. 6 it became the first state to vote on and  reject the paid holiday.  </P> <P> The gestation period for controversy, among the shortest for all calamities,  broke records with this issue. Overnight, racism was again the subject of  national debate, and Arizona was its focal point. According to a large segment  of national opinion, the state was a social backwater and its residents were  racists.  </P> <P> As reaction grew more serious -- in the form of millions of dollars in lost  convention business and the threat of losing the 1993 Super Bowl -- Arizonans  dug in. "Leave us alone; why pick on us; don't mix sports and politics," they  said.  </P> <P> While the controversy might linger elsewhere, it seems to stop at the border.  On the eve of Monday's Copper Bowl in Tucson and the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe on  New Year's Day, two major sporting events thought to be heavily hit by King Day  fallout, the mood is upbeat and relentlessly cheerful.  </P> <P> And while no one denies that the two bowls will experience financial  shortfalls, that could as easily be attributed to the nation's troubled economy  as to the King Day mess. The poor ticket sales have likewise been assigned  causes other than the controversy.  </P> <P> There is a stubborn and rather uniform refusal to acknowledge that the holiday  issue has in any way harmed the state. This view dovetails nicely with the  state's I-told-you-so stance. There has been no hint of protest at either bowl  site. The teams -- California (6-4-1) and Wyoming (9-3) in the Copper Bowl and  Louisville (9-1-1) and Alabama (7-4) in the Fiesta Bowl -- have not been  bothered.  </P> <P> Wilbert Nelson, president of the Phoenix chapter of the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, said his group has no plans to boycott, picket  or protest the Fiesta Bowl and its events and is unaware of any groups planning  to disrupt the Copper Bowl.  </P> <P> It has been so quiet that when something does percolate through the ooze of  public disinterest, it is received with a mighty bang.  </P> <P> Take the case of the Letter to the NFL, which was front-page news in Phoenix  last week. The president of the American Indian Bible College in Phoenix sent a  letter to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue asking the league to force the  Washington Redskins to change their name.  </P> <P> "If you are sincere about your anti-racist concerns, why do you not recommend  to the owner that the name be changed?" Moore wrote to Tagliabue.  </P> <P> This story was gleefully repeated around Arizona as a kind of  taste-of-their-own-medicine shot at the NFL and its threat to pull the Super  Bowl.  </P> <P> Not that the issue of a paid holiday for King is taken lightly or even  dismissed altogether. Gov. Rose Mofford is still attempting to have Arizona's  legislature deal with the issue again. However, her efforts to rally support  for a special session on the paid holiday issue failed when, two weeks ago, no  lawmakers would agree to meet Mofford for lunch to discuss it.  </P> <P> The matter apparently will be dealt with when the Arizona Legislature convenes  in its regular session next month. However, even then there is no assurance the  King Day issue will be settled. The state must still organize and stage a  run-off for governor, another matter that was not settled Nov. 6.  </P> <P> Mofford, who is not in the runoff, has made the King Day issue her personal  crusade. She led a delegation of state officials that met with Tagliabue  earlier this month.  </P> <P> Their intention was to persuade the commissioner to reconsider his decision to  urge NFL owners to move the 1993 Super Bowl to another state. The meeting,  while described as cordial, failed to sway Tagliabue.  </P> <P> State officials say the loss of the Super Bowl can be converted to a loss of  $200 million in income to the state.  </P> <P> The Arizona landscape is littered with the economic fallout from the election.  Tourism, the state's No. 2 industry, has been hit with an estimated $30-million  loss from conventions that have moved to other cities. Dozens of companies have  changed plans to relocate to Arizona, citing the King Day controversy as one  reason.  </P> <P> And the Fiesta Bowl, which last New Year's Day brought in an estimated $30  million to the state, is not likely to set any profit records. The bowl is  $691,000 in debt, and ticket sales have been sluggish.  </P> <P> The teams have bought about 5,000 tickets each and may not sell all of them,  according to John Junker, the Fiesta Bowl's executive director. The game will  not be a sellout, and Junker said he is considering a local television  blackout.  </P> <P> Junker said he can trace the slow sales to at least one event, the Nov. 6  election.  </P> <P> "November is our No. 1-selling ticket month, and that's when all this King  controversy came down," he said. "Take this controversy to any other bowl and  see how many tickets they sell."  </P> <P> Copper Bowl sales have been worse. Merle Miller, executive director of the  Tucson event, said the generally slow economic climate is a factor. The Copper  Bowl expects about 35,000 in 56,000-seat Arizona Stadium.  </P> <P> Miller said each team was allotted 10,000 tickets; Cal has sold nearly 8,000,  but Wyoming has sold only 3,000.  </P> <P> According to Wyoming ticket manager Louie Krutsch, the university has an  agreement with the Western Athletic Conference to pay jointly for the 7,000  unused tickets. Priced at $27 each, that amounts to $189,000.  </P> <P> Melva Miller, Cal ticket manager, said the university expected to donate  unbought tickets to needy persons in the Tucson area.  </P> <P> Some problems proved too sticky for even the perky, yellow-coated Fiesta Bowl  officials to smooth over. Take, for example, the problem of finding two teams  willing to play in Arizona.  </P> <P> While Fiesta Bowl officials are not willing to state categorically that the  King Day controversy was responsible for teams such as Notre Dame, Virginia and  Mississippi going elsewhere, it's difficult to imagine what other factor would  cause a university to turn down the Fiesta Bowl's $2.5-million payout.  </P> <P> After Alabama accepted the Fiesta Bowl's invitation, university officials had  to scramble to quash criticism from within. Various ad hoc committees met and  argued, and the upshot was that the school will set aside $100,000 from its  bowl receipts to improve academic programs relating to minority issues. Alabama  also agreed to reactivate an advisory committee for minority affairs "to  promote full representation by African-Americans in the life of the  university."  </P> <P> The Copper Bowl, with its $600,000-a-team payout, had an even smaller spectrum  of teams from which to select. On the politically aware Berkeley campus, the  idea of going to Arizona for a football game was disgusting to some. The Golden  Bear players met, however, and voted to accept the bid.  </P> <P> There was little or no controversy reported in Wyoming, whose players have been  delighted to be anywhere.  </P> <P> While sensitive to the appearence of caving in to national opinion, there is no  doubt that bowl officials have made efforts to temper the criticism.  </P> <P> Predictably, however, something had to go wrong. The first problem came when  the Fiesta Bowl announced it would set aside $100,000 for each participating  school to establish minority scholarships.  </P> <P> Executive director Junker said, in announcing the offer, that the Fiesta Bowl  wanted to "make a positive statement about what a football game and a community  can be."  </P> <P> No sooner had the offer been made than Michael Williams, assistant secretary of  education, ruled that such exclusionary scholarships violated the 1964 Civil  Rights Act. Fiesta Bowl officials were not alone in their anger at this.  </P> <P> Williams was called on the carpet by his boss, President Bush. The Department  of Education quickly issued a clarification that only served to further confuse  everyone. The bottom line for the Fiesta Bowl is that Louisville and Alabama  will get the money for minority scholarships.  </P> <P> The two bowls also have included more than a nod to the issue of civil rights  and King's life. Indeed, both will have halftime programs that appear to be  more like civics lessons than the usual baton-twirling, band-marching,  flag-waving extravaganza.  </P> <P> The Fiesta Bowl's halftime show will be a tribute to King. NBC-TV has agreed to  air up to 5 1/2 minutes of it. The Alabama band and football team will wear  shoulder patches in King's honor, and the school will present a portrait of  King to the bowl.  </P> <P> The Fiesta Bowl's pregame show will be dedicated to the 200th anniversary of  the Bill of Rights.  </P> <P> The Copper Bowl is locked into a Salute to the Armed Forces theme for its  halftime but will include certain King elements. Near the end of the halftime  show, an excerpt from King's famous "I have a dream" speech will be played over  the public address system. The players from both teams will come onto the field  and stand in opposite end zones. A drill team will form the letters MLK on the  field. At the end of the excerpt, the band will play "God Bless America."  </P> <P> The players have been struggling to walk the politically correct line in the  midst of the controversy. On the one hand, there is the symbolism of coming to  Arizona after it voted down a paid King holiday. None of the schools, and  certainly none of the players, wanted to appear to condone the vote.  </P> <P> On the other hand, there is the compelling athletic consideration of being  invited to a bowl game, with the attendant hoopla and exposure that it brings.  None of the schools, and certainly none of the players, wanted to miss that.  </P> <P> "I think a lot of people blew it out of proportion," said Stacy Harrison, a  safety on Alabama's football team. "They tried to bring the football team into  a political aspect. We won the right to play in this bowl game."  </P> <P> Harrison, along with other Alabama players, has had the initials MLK shaved  into the back of his closely cropped hair. He said that not coming to the  Fiesta Bowl "would take away from what we've earned. I'm not saying a boycott  couldn't be right, but we've earned the right to come here. It's a big-time  bowl."  </P> <P> That's about the extent to which the players are addressing the King  controversy, by now a tired subject for them.  </P> <P> And while no significant demonstrations or disturbances are expected, there is  always the possibility of an isolated incident.  </P> <P> The Copper Bowl's Miller said his sponsor, Domino's Pizza, has experienced an  unorganized, spotty boycott. But he expects a quiet New Year's Eve, except for  the group that has announced it will picket outside the stadium, protesting the  building of a hazardous-waste dump site in the area.  </P> <P> "I guess we are just the staging area for the protest," Miller said. "Oh well,  it could be worse, I guess."  </P></p>

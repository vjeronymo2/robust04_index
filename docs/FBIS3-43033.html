Because strains that destroy such  compounds have been only partially described, the researchers  here sought to present a complete picture of the genetic control  and regulation of the process associated with the decomposition  of sulfoaromatic compounds. In studying the genetic control of  the decomposition of arylsulfonates in Pseudomonas  sp. BS1304, they demonstrated that the process of destruction is  controlled by the plasmid pBS1004, which has a molecular weight  of 120 kbp and belongs to the IncP-9 incompatibility group. The  plasmid can be isolated in P. putida, P. aeruginosa,  and P. mendocina. Degradation of the substrates  begins with desulfonation and subsequent meta-cleavage of the  substituted catechols. Both stages are effected by enzymes with  high substrate specificity. The researchers found that the  instability of the trait under consideration was associated with  the formation of spontaneous deletions in the plasmid.  Ultimately, the researchers demonstrated that the formation of  such deletions is induced by Rms178 of the IncP-2  incompatibility group. Figures 3, references 13: 1 Russian, 12  Western.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] A row has broken out today in the top ranks of  Nigeria's Campaign for Democracy, the CD, the umbrella coalition  of human rights groups which has been fighting for an end to  military rule. CD Chairman Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti is reported to  have been accused by the secretary general, Chima Ubani, of  fraternizing with the military government. A number of radical  civilian activists have been persuaded to join the Abacha  administration since it took power last November. Prominent  among them is Dr. Olu Onagoruwa, who is now minister of justice  and attorney general. On the line to Lagos, Akwe Amosu asked  Dr. Ransome-Kuti if he was aware of Mr. Ubani's allegations:    [Begin recording] [Ransome-Kuti] Well, not really but he has  been.... [pauses] Maybe he has been behaving in a funny way for  some time. But we have organizational ways of resolving things  so I am quite comfortable.    [Amosu] But he says that you have been having secret  meetings  with the military and that you have compromised the  organization. I mean that's rather specific, isn't it?    [Ransome-Kuti] Well, I don't know where he gets his evidence  from or his advice, but we do talk to a lot of people and a lot  of people do confront us and there is no way he can say we have  compromised because we are still on the organizational stand.    [Amosu] I mean one of his pieces of evidence says that your  own lawyer who stood by you through thick and thin, Mr.  Onagoruwa, is now the justice minister and that your relations  are so close that he is the main channel of communication  between you and the government.    [Ransome-Kuti] Well, I don't know what he wants me to do  about that. Maybe he wants me to exile myself or exile Mr.  Onagoruwa. I don't know about that but Onagoruwa has many  friends and he talks to a lot of people and sometimes he wants  to know what CD thinks and he is told what CD thinks. I don't  see what else one can do. One is not on an island and he can't  isolate himself.    [Amosu] So, you would say that fraternizing with the  government is an accusation that just won't stick.    [Ransome-Kuti] Well, it does not make sense. I mean  everybody knows where we have stood for years and we still stand  there. I mean he has just started so who is he to say somebody  is compromising? What do we have to gain by compromising with a  military government? Maybe he is showing youthful exuberance.  Maybe he thinks things should go a different way than they are  going but he does not know how organizations work. But on the  other hand, we must say that CD has become quite a force in  Nigeria and I won't be surprised if the government is trying to  destabilize it internally because we are having a meeting now at  this moment. If he had any problem, he should have raised it up  at the meeting. We are having a convention in two weeks' time,  so what is his problem? What can his problem be?    [Amosu] You seem to be accusing Mr. Ubani himself of being  manipulated by the government.    [Ransome-Kuti] Not really. All I am saying is that if we  have an internal fight and he feels so strongly, I am saying  that we are having a meeting right now, which he knows about.  Why does he not come and resolve it there? I mean when you  have an internal fight in a organization, the secretary general  goes out and makes a press release.    [Amosu] What about the other allegations that Mr. Ubani has  made that collective leadership has broken down and that some  officials are being kept in the dark about the state of the CD's  finances?    [Ransome-Kuti] Well, he knows where to raise it. He knows  where to raise it. The same point was raised by him a week ago  and all the finances are audited and everything, so you know  that is why I said it seems that he is trying to destabilize the  organization because these are things which, if they were true,  everybody would sympathize with him.    [Amosu] Whether this is a deliberate attempt to destabilize  the CD or not, it is going to do you damage, isn't it?    [Ransome-Kuti] Well, I hope not because people know our  reputation and we have been at it for some time and it is not at  this stage that we are going to start collaborating with  government. For what purpose? [end recording]</p>

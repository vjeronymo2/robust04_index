			<p>BFN     [Text] Bosnian Serbs are carrying out unthinkable deeds in  Gorazde, a high-ranking official from the Russian Foreign  Ministry told Interfax today.    "Even brothels have their own rules. However, Bosnian Serbs  do not recognize them and are "raping" the poor Gorazde in the  eyes of the whole world," the diplomat said.    According to him, the preparedness of many Russian  parliamentarians to defend Bosnian Serbs only proves that they  are using the Bosnian crisis as a trump card in their domestic  political games. "Russian parliamentarians state they are ready  to wage a war in Bosnia until the death of the last Serb.  However, this does not make them differ from Serbs who are  ready to fight until the death of the last Russian," the  diplomat suggested.</p>

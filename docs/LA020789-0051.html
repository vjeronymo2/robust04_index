			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Weightlifter Guy Greavette of Canada denied any role in a scam to foil an  anti-doping test before the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.  </P> <P> Testifying before a federal inquiry, Greavette contradicted earlier testimony  by former teammate Jacques Demers that he was one of four athletes who  attempted to beat the test last September in Vancouver by having "clean" urine  injected into their bladders.  </P> <P> Greavette said Demers and two other weightlifters, David Bolduc of Montreal and  Paramjit Gill, like Greavette of British Columbia, were mistaken when they  testified last week that Greavette was at a meeting where the plan to inject  urine into the athletes' bladders was discussed.  </P> <P> Demers, Bolduc and Gill all failed the test despite the urine injection scheme.  </P></p>

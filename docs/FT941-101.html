			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Caradon rises 70% after big restructure: Group boosted by sterling's fall and CarnaudMetalbox stake sale Caradon, the building products and security printing group, came through a year of substantial restructuring with underlying profits up 5 per cent to Pounds 132.2m and earnings per share unscathed at 15.2p, Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive, said yesterday. In 1993 Caradon sold its 25.3 per cent stake in CarnaudMetalbox for Pounds 467.5m, and reinvested the proceeds, plus Pounds 334m raised through a rights issue, in the Pounds 808.7m purchase of the Pillar building products business from RTZ. Caradon shares fell sharply initially but recovered to show a net fall of 9p to 374p yesterday. Mr Jansen said Caradon had found no serious problems at Pillar and that operational management had been largely retained. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 213.4m, up 70 per cent from Pounds 125.7m, including exceptional gains of Pounds 81.2m net. These were a Pounds 100.3m profit on the CarnaudMetalbox sale, less a provision of Pounds 14.1m against properties being sold and a Pounds 5m provision on last week's sale of the UK security printing business. However, profits were helped by sterling's fall, which gave translation gains of Pounds 10.3m at the operating profit level. The sale of the CarnaudMetalbox stake cut profits by Pounds 32.5m, but this was offset by profits from acquisitions of Pounds 19.2m and interest receivable of Pounds 8.6m, a positive swing of Pounds 13.7m. Mr Jansen, who is adding the deputy chairmanship to his role, was optimistic about the UK building products market. Volumes rose 9 per cent, but prices fell 1 per cent with bathroom products under particular pressure. He said the group had been distracted by the strategic upheavals of 1993 and had not pushed for price increases last year. Now price increases were coming through. The US recovery was ahead of that in the UK but in continental Europe, which now accounts for about 10 per cent of the group's business, conditions worsened in the second half and the trend was continuing. In US security printing, prices were under pressure in 1993, falling 5 per cent, partly as the group offered its three largest bank customers a discount to refix contracts early. However, volumes rose 4 per cent. Group turnover from continuing operations rose 10.3 per cent to Pounds 720.9m, and the total increased 44.6 per cent to Pounds 960.7m. Operating profits from continuing activities were up 6.6 per cent to Pounds 99.6m. UK building products profits were flat at Pounds 35.4m, continental Europe was unchanged at Pounds 18.9m and security printing rose 15 per cent to Pounds 45.3m. Earnings per share excluding exceptionals were unchanged at 15.2p, while fully diluted FRS3 earnings were 29.2p. A final dividend of 6.08p is proposed to give a total of 8.91p, a rise of 3 per cent.

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sunshine breaks through the clouds over Salomon - Patrick Harverson on relief at the securities house following its settlement with Federal authorities The clouds that have hovered over Salomon Brothers for the past 10 months were not completely lifted by Wednesday's Dollars 290m settlement with Federal authorities. Some sunshine, however, was allowed to pierce the gloom for the first time since the giant Wall Street securities house was caught rigging Treasury bond auctions last year. Although criminal and civil investigations into individuals and other firms involved in the scandal continue, and Salomon still faces about 50 private lawsuits related to the case, top executives at the securities house breathed a large sigh of relief when the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and the US Attorney's office in New York announced the settlement of the civil case against Salomon and their decision not to pursue criminal charges against the firm. The separate sanctions unveiled the same day by the Federal Reserve - a 60-day ban on all dealings with the New York Fed and no lifting of the ban on bidding for customers at Treasury auctions until August 3 - also gave some cause for relief. While troubling in the short-term, the measures fell well short of the worst case scenario Salomon had envisaged - the permanent loss of its primary dealership status - and they are unlikely to have a significant impact on the firm's bottom line. Salomon's profitability, however, will be hit by the extra Dollars 185m pre-tax charge the firm intends to take in the second quarter this year. The money, along with the Dollars 200m set aside as reserves last year, will go towards paying the fines, compensation and costs related to the lawsuits still outstanding against Salomon. The total potential cost of nearly Dollars 400m would represent more than half of Salomon's profits in a good year. There is also the unquantifiable impact on earnings of the business lost because of the scandal and the long government-led investigation. Salomon says most clients who withdrew their custom because of the scandal last August have returned to the fold. Yet in the highly profitable business of securities underwriting, which enjoyed an unprecedented boom in 1991 and in the first quarter of this year, Salomon has lost out badly, either through being downgraded by issuers from lead managing to co-managing underwritings, or by being left off managing syndicates altogether. The underwriting boom was, in the words of Mr Deryck Maughan, Salomon's chief operating officer, 'a once-in-a-decade opportunity - and we were on the bench'. The almost year-long ban on bidding for customers in Treasury auctions must also have taken its toll, with institutional investors transferring their business to Salomon's rivals on Wall Street. Moreover, the shrinking of the capital base and the dramatic overhaul of internal business lines undertaken by Salomon's new management since the scandal meant the firm has been in no shape to take full advantage of the hugely favourable market conditions of the past year. The scandal has also left a deep scar on Salomon morale. Concern about the long-term outlook for a company facing federal investigations deeply unsettled Salomon employees, persuading some in the first few months to jump ship to rival Wall Street firms. Even more executives left in the wake of the internal shake up at the firm. Despite the protestations of the new management, staff in domestic equities and investment banking regarded the changes at Salomon as an implicit downgrading of their departments. The result was a number of damaging defections by key executives and a further decline in morale. The redesign of the firm's pay system - bonuses were cut and future compensation tied more closely to performance - also created unrest and ill-feeling. Yet for the first time in almost a year, Salomon can envisage a future without the threat of massive fines or criminal charges hanging over it. The greatest break for Salomon was the decision of the authorities not to press criminal charges against the firm. If criminal prosecution had been sought, Salomon could have been fatally wounded as scores of private and government clients shied away from a firm facing a drawn-out battle in the criminal courts. Much of the credit for avoiding criminal charges must go to Mr Warren Buffett, the chairman of Salomon. On taking over in August, he pledged the firm's full co-operation with all investigations - a promise he delivered on. Officials at the SEC and the US Attorney's office went out of their way this week to praise the help they received from Salomon's senior management. The contrast with the experience government investigators faced in the late 1980s when pursuing wrongdoing at Drexel Burnham Lambert, has escaped no one on Wall Street. Drexel's refusal to co-operate with the federal authorities until two years into the investigations eventually cost the firm dear - a Dollars 650m fine and bankruptcy. Yet a few critical voices have been raised arguing that Salomon has escaped lightly, and that the authorities stopped short of criminal prosecution because the firm was too important to the Treasury markets and the government's management of its debt. Having rescued Salomon from disaster - at one point last summer there were real doubts whether the firm would survive the scandal intact - Mr Buffett will now withdraw from the scene. He is likely to hand over the reins of running Salomon Brothers to Mr Maughan soon, and as promised, ensure the next chairman of the parent group, Salomon Inc, is an outsider with no previous ties to the firm. The whole affair, however, is not yet over. Salomon must fight the 50 or more lawsuits filed by individuals and companies who claim they suffered losses because of Salomon's actions. The firm now has almost Dollars 100m set aside to cover the cost of these cases and most observers believe the reserve should be sufficient. The authorities, meanwhile, are still pursuing their investigations into the individuals involved in the scandal, notably Mr Paul Mozer, the bond trader accused of faking customer bids in Treasury auctions and who is likely to face criminal charges unless he can strike a deal with the government. The senior managers at Salomon, including the former chairman Mr John Gutfreund, who waited four months before reporting their knowledge of Mr Mozer's activities are being investigated for possible civil violations, and will probably be fined heavily for failure to supervise the firm properly.</p>

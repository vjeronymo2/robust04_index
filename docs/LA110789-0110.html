			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR JUTE NATIONS OK TENTATIVE ACCORD  </P> <P> Major producers and consumers of jute have provisionally adopted a new  international agreement designed to improve export earnings of Third World  countries.  </P> <P> A previously drafted text was approved at the end of a one-week conference and  will be open for signing during all of 1990.  </P> <P> It would then enter into force for an initial five years when the current  international jute agreement expires in January, 1991.  </P> <P> Robert van Schaagen of the Netherlands, chairman of the conference, said the  Soviet Union "gave a very strong signal" that it would sign the new accord.  </P> <P> Although the Soviets are the world's biggest importer of jute with a share of  around 12%, they did not join the existing agreement.  </P> <P> The new accord, like the existing one, contained no provisions to control  prices by means of stocking and market intervention.  </P> <P> Instead, the five countries that account for 99.6% of annual world exports of  jute will receive assistance in quality improvement and marketing aimed at  stabilizing and increasing demand as well as prices.  </P> <P> Officials said prices are improving but consumption last year of 2.9 million  tons was the lowest since 1975 because of competition from synthetics, although  jute has the environmental advantage of being biodegradable.  </P></p>

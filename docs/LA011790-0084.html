			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Gillette Wins Round in Court: U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan denied a Justice  Department request to immediately freeze Gillette Co.'s planned acquisition of  part of Wilkinson Sword's international razor blade business. The judge refused  to issue a temporary restraining order, saying Gillette has stated that no  action would be taken without a 10-day advance notice to the government. The  acquisition is being challenged on anti-competitive grounds, alleging a  violation of the Clayton Act.  </P></p>

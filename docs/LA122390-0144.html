			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TERMS OF THE U.S. EMBARGO ARE STRICT  </P> <P> The U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam prohibits Americans from engaging in  virtually all forms of commercial relations with that nation. First imposed  against the North Vietnamese in 1964 and extended to the entire country in  1975, the sanctions include a freeze on all Vietnamese assets, a ban on  financial transactions, travel restrictions and trade prohibitions in all  fields except information.  </P> <P> The embargo applies to all Americans wherever they live and U.S. subsidiaries  incorporated abroad. Vietnamese-Americans wishing to take money to relatives  are restricted to $300 per quarter or $750 to relatives preparing to emigrate.  In addition, the law imposes a $200 per day spending restriction on any  American in Vietnam. Americans are also prohibited from entering or leaving  Vietnam on the state carrier, Air Vietnam.  </P> <P> However, the embargo does not prohibit Americans from visiting Vietnam, meeting  with Vietnamese officials, collecting information or even entering into  non-binding agreements.  </P> <P> The sanctions are based on the 1917 Trading With the Enemy Act, which allows  the President to impose a broad range of economic sanctions to further U.S.  foreign policy interests. Other examples include sanctions against Nicaragua  and South Africa in 1985, Libya in 1986, Panama in 1988 and the current embargo  against Iraq and Kuwait. But the measures against Vietnam constitute the  fullest scope of sanctions possible and are similarly imposed only against  Cuba, North Korea and Cambodia, according to a U.S. Treasury official.  </P> <P> In 1988, Congress passed one exception to the embargo that allows the exchange  of books, records, newspapers, dictionaries and other information. As a result,  Cable News Network was allowed to install a satellite dish in Vietnam. Another  American, a Maryland entrepreneur, was recently given approval to import books  and newspapers from Vietnam.  </P> <P> Violations of the law carry maximum criminal penalties of 12 years in prison  and fines of $250,000 for individuals and $1 million for corporations. Treasury  officials could not provide statistics on the number of violations. But the  most celebrated case involves Lindblad Travel, a Westport, Conn., firm that  went bankrupt under the weight of more than $500,000 in fines after pleading  guilty last year to arranging tours to Vietnam.  </P> <P> "The U.S. business community really tries to bend over backward to comply with  the law, and if there are any questions, your readers should give us a call," a  Treasury official said.

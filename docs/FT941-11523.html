			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Dominican Republic debt accord Holders of the Dominican Republic's international bank debt will begin signing a debt restructuring agreement on February 14 in Toronto which will cut the country's bank debt in half. The pact, the first with the Dominican Republic since 1986, will cover about Dollars 1.1bn of debt. The bank group, chaired by Bank of Nova Scotia, includes Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Chemical Bank and Royal Bank of Canada. The signature of all creditors is necessary before the agreement can be considered by the country's Congress. Thirty-five per cent of the debt will be submitted for cash - at 25 cents for every dollar face value - and the rest exchanged for 30-year bonds at a discount of 35 per cent to the debt's face value. The discount bonds, paying interest at  13/16 of a point over Libor, will carry collateral guaranteeing repayment of principal and 12 months of interest.</p>

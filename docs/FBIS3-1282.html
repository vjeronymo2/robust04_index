About 15 ambulances completely  blocked the entrance. Drivers and other ambulance personnel sat  on the curbs nearby.    A spokesman, Mr Frank Makalima, said the vehicles had been  there since 7.45am. He said the protesters had sent a delegation  to King William's Town to speak to the Transitional Executive  Council task force, which took over administration of the  territory earlier this week. Executive Council member Mr Zam  Titus said on Wednesday that council team intended to move into  the ministerial offices in the parliamentary complex on Thursday.    Near the ambulance drivers, a convoy of South African  Defence  Force troop carriers, ambulances and armoured vehicles with  cannons were parked at the side of the road.    The troops appeared to be observing a rally in progress at  the Bisho stadium about a kilometre away. There were police  roadblocks on the N2 outside King William's Town, and on the  road between Bisho and King William's Town.</p>

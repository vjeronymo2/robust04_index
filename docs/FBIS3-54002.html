A just and comprehensive peace, as well as security and  stability, cannot be established in the region without taking  into account Syria's interests and its ever-increasing important  regional standing.    Abu-Hilal noted that the Syrian-U.S. summit affirmed that  the  United States needs to enhance and deepen its contacts with  Syria and understand Syria's positions in the talks with Israel.  The summit showed Syria's weight and its principled stance of  adhering to the principle of a comprehensive and just solution  in the region on all fronts on the basis of international  legitimacy's resolutions, especially Security Council  Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, as well as to the principle of  land for peace as opposed to separate deals and bilateral  solutions.    Abu-Hilal stressed that Syria's adherence to this stance is  being welcomed and supported on the pan-Arab level, particularly  by the Palestinians.    As for the results expected in the wake of this summit,  Abu-Hilal expressed the belief that it will bring swift results.  One of the immediate results of the summit is the revival of  the peace process and the resumption of negotiations between  Israel and the Arab parties in Washington.    Abu-Hilal said that the Syrian president spelled out the  concept of a just and comprehensive peace and that the ball is  now in the Israeli court. Israel's behavior will either  increase or reduce the chances of achieving a comprehensive and  just peace in return for full withdrawal on all fronts.    Abu-Hilal ruled out the possibility of Syria striking out,  either now or later, against the Palestinian factions opposed to  the Oslo accord, especially following the Syrian leadership's  affirmation that this is a Palestinian concern and that it is  legitimate for those factions to express their political views  in a democratic way. Moreover, striking out against those  factions is not in Syria's national and pan-Arab interests.</p>

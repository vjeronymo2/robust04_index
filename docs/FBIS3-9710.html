			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of Social </F> Democracy of the Polish Republic, SdRP, by Barbara Czajkowska,  identified by caption, in Warsaw, on the "Special Line"  program--live]    [Excerpts] [Czajkowska] Good evening to you, ladies and  gentlemen, and to you, Mr. Sejm Deputy. Welcome.    [Kwasniewski] Good evening.    [Czajkowska] Recently in Davos [Switzerland], you publicly  expressed your conviction that you have been handling people's  frustrations and disappointments--which, according to you, are  the real danger to the reforms in Poland--the right way. Now,  what do you mean by saying you have been handling them the right  way? What do you really mean by saying the SLD [Democratic Left  Alliance] has been handling our frustrations the right way?  Results of public opinion polls that are available to society  do not confirm your optimism.    [Kwasniewski] First of all, one must realize that these  frustrations do indeed exist and that they are justified.  Millions of people in the country have problems: They are  unemployed, their retirement pensions and other types of  pensions and salaries are low...    [Czajkowska, interrupting] But we know all that. But my  question was: What do you mean by saying you have been handling  it the right way?    [Kwasniewski] To handle it the right way means to suggest a  program that will be changing the situation step by step by  guaranteeing economic development first of all. This is what I  talked about in Davos. I think Poland's great chance is the  fact that last year we saw growth of the GDP of more than 4.5  percent, and also that, after the first two months of this year,  we saw a 10-percent increase in production output...    [Czajkowska, interrupting] But that is to be attributed  neither to the SLD nor to the governing coalition.    [Kwasniewski] You know, it is to be attributed primarily to  people. I think that any politician who says this is to be  attributed only to him is dishonest. But the fact is that, if  these are the trends, they must be preserved and protected. And  that is our biggest chance. So, when you remember the difficult  budget we argued about, which the SLD took upon its shoulders,  as it were, because the budget had been proposed by the then  Finance Minister Borowski, and then we fought for the budget in  the Sejm, the goal of all that was, step by step and while  protecting the developmental trends in the economy, to create a  chance to meet halfway those people who are frustrated and who  have good reason to feel so.    [Czajkowska] So when you said in Davos that the SLD has been  handling things the right way, you simply meant all of the  governments that ruled the country after 1989?    [Kwasniewski] Even more than that. What I also meant was  all the good in the country that we managed to create since the  beginning of Poland's existence because it is my view that  Poland began neither in 1989 nor in 1945. The point is simply  to do in Poland whatever can bring us success and to avoid doing  those things that contribute to our problems. That is my  philosophy, as it were, the philosophy of a politician and the  philosophy of a man. My view is that one must look for positive  aspects and good solutions while avoiding bad ones, and that is  why I regret many things that take place in our country and that  I evaluate as bad things.    [Czajkowska] And I hope this is what we will talk about in  the program tonight and also that we get your replies as to how  you think these difficult problems should be solved. [passage  omitted]    [Czajkowska] Sir, one does not have to be particularly  observant to see that the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] is clearly  being favored over the SLD. When the president, for instance,  warned against greedy communists, he clearly meant the SLD.  There is talk among people that the presidential constitutional  initiative was rejected by Sejm deputies for the SLD, even  though everyone knows that Sejm deputies for the PSL also voted  against. Even Solidarity attacks the SLD while clearly taking  an easy-going attitude--forgive me for using that popular  term--toward the PSL. All that is not just a coincidence. What  is your assessment?    [Kwasniewski] You know, of course it is not just a  coincidence. It can be concluded from this, that we [SLD]  exist, while, in the year...    [Czajkowska, interrupting] But the PSL also exists.    [Kwasniewski] Yes, but the point is that, back in 1990, when  the PSL was being born out of the old United Peasant Party, it  was of marginal importance, as it were, and no one had any  particular grievance against them because of that, whereas the  SLD, or, actually, Social Democracy of the Polish Republic,  which was being born in the spring of 1990, was confronted by  the president's argument in which he said we will be finished  within three months. Not only have the three months been going  on and on for a long time now, but we also won the elections;  let me remind you that we won the September elections by quite a  big margin, to be quite honest, even though before, right-wing  activists had been ascribing us the role of what they call  postcommunist, or communist, remnants.    [Czajkowska] But the PSL is your coalition partner.    [Kwasniewski] Fine, but I will not say even one unfavorable  word about the PSL tonight. Please, do not force me to do that.    [Czajkowska] I am not forcing you to do that. I am just  asking whether there are clear....    [Kwasniewski, interrupting] They are our coalition partner  whom we treasure and with whom we want to cooperate.    [Czajkowska] That is fine with me.    [Kwasniewski] But, if you allow me to, I would like to  finish my thought on why there are so many attacks against the  left wing and the SLD, in particular coming from the president.    [Czajkowska] Actually, I meant the PSL being clearly  favored--that is the term our viewers used.    [Kwasniewski] Fine, let it be so. The reason is that the  SLD is disliked because we have shown that, through a peaceful  exchange of arguments, lack of aggressiveness, and rational  ideas, one can simply gain social confidence and win elections.  I think that very many people on the right wing--and also,  unfortunately, the president, I say with sorrow--still find it  very hard to come to terms with the fact that we who had been  condemned to be a marginal phenomenon--some even said we belong  on history's rubbish heap--right now are winners in the  elections, form a governing coalition, and, moreover, when you  read Western newspapers, you can see that we are actually  guarantors of the Polish democratic and free-market reforms.  And I think that is the right perception. After all we went  through, including some very personal experiences, we are very  deeply convinced that there is no going back for Poland. I mean  we cannot give up democracy, the free market, or our openness to  the world. When it comes to our coalition partner, well, all I  can say is that I envy the PSL a bit in that all groups have  favorable opinions of the party. Both the Democratic Union and  the Confederation for an Independent Poland have courted the  PSL, as the president is doing now. But apparently the left  wing is not suited to play the role of one who is courted.    [Czajkowska] And do you not think, Mr. Chairman, that  perhaps you yourselves are to blame for the PSL's being favored  this way? From the very beginning of this coalition, the SLD  has actually been teasing the PSL by trying to sermonize to it,  by warning it, and by placing yourselves at the top of the  reforms process--you said that yourself tonight, by the way--and  by seeing in the PSL's measures a danger to the reforms.  Recently, SLD spokesman Mr. Siemiatkowski made a comparison  between Chairman Kwasniewski and a messiah who is supposed to  lead the nation to a successful future without any problems. Is  that not too much?    [Kwasniewski] Of course, that was a lot, and perhaps it was  too much, but, as far as I can recall, that interview by Mr.  Siemiatkowski, he spoke there about the left wing. I think  that, in that sense, what the left wing has gone through....  [Kwasniewski pauses] Of course, I am the kind of man....    [Czajkowska, interrupting] Are you trying to suggest that,  when Mr. Siemiatkowski spoke about the left wing, he also meant  the PSL?    [Kwasniewski] No, I think he meant us, the political group  that is us, and also....    [Czajkowska, interrupting] But it is you who was described  as a Moses in that statement.    [Kwasniewski] So is it a Moses or a messiah?    [Czajkowska] I am sorry. I confused the two.    [Kwasniewski] Please, do not....    [Czajkowska, interrupting] I think I am not the one you  should address but rathe, Sejm Deputy Siemiatkowski, who  described you this way.    [Kwasniewski, hesitating] You know, that is of course a  metaphor, and let us approach it that way. But there is no  doubt that, when it comes to the left wing in the country, as I  said, we managed to overcome the condemnation of a political  nonexistence and become one of the ruling parties. Of course,  that is by no means to be attributed to only me personally, but,  on the other hand--let us not be too modest here--I think I  played some part in the process. Very many people played a  positive role, and attacks by some others were also helpful to  us. But that is a closed chapter, and it is not the most  important thing. The most important thing is what you asked me  about our coalition partner. Well, my view is that there is no  alternative, given the political configuration that was  established after September of last year. Of course, we could  get theoretical here in a number of ways, but the truth remains  that the PSL-SLD coalition is creating a chance in Poland for a  stable government based on a majority, for the first time in  many months or even years. And one must....    [Czajkowska, interrupting] Forgive me for interrupting, but  this is not what I meant.    [Kwasniewski] So what did you mean?    [Czajkowska] Let me refresh your memory: I am not willing  to question the principles of the coalition's existence or the  PSL's participation in it. All I am saying is that the favoring  of the PSL at the expense of the SLD, which we talked about  earlier, is perhaps caused--or at least there are such views--by  the SLD's own behavior inasmuch as the party sermonizes to the  PSL, teases it, tells it what to do, as if condemning the PSL to  play a secondary role, which means the SLD leads the reforms.  By the way, you yourself said that here tonight.    [Kwasniewski] No, all I said was that we are absolutely in  favor of the reforms that are taking place. As far as our  coalition partner is concerned, we treat the PSL with all  seriousness and in the most thorough manner possible, even  though cooperation is of course difficult. One must be honest  about that. There would be no problems or conflicts if the  cooperation were perfect. As regards the sermonizing, of course  I can be self-critical here and say that we are not without  guilt here and that many things have been said unnecessarily,  that is for sure. But, on the other hand, I also think that too  many measures by our coalition partner have not been completely  understood or accepted by us. [passage omitted]</p>

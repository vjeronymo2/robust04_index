			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- The Swiss committee  for supporting Korea's reunification published Korea-bulletin  "Korea Is One".    The bulletin carries a photograph of the great leader  President Kim Il-song receiving bereaved families of  anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs and introduces his  reminiscences "With the Century".    In an article titled "For Nuclear-Free Korea", the bulletin  notes that the purpose sought by the United States in its  clamour about "nuclear inspection" is to detract the world's  attention from its nuclear weapons in South Korea.    Saying that there is no ground for the DPRK to allow  inspection of even the military base which has no nuclear  facilities, it stresses that all the anti-imperialist  peace-loving forces must extend support to the Korean people who  are striving to realise the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula, get the U.S. forces withdrawn from South Korea and  achieve the independent and peaceful Reunification of the  country.</p>

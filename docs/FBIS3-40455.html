			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt]  <H5>  June -- Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) </H5>   The Industrial Science and Technological Development Section  of the Industrial Technology Council (chaired by Hiroyuki  Yoshigawa, president of the University of Tokyo) held its first  meeting on June 10, 1993, in the annex to the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI). The main details are  described below.  <H3>  The Structure of the Industrial Technology Council's  Industrial Science and Technology Development Section's Meeting </H3>   The establishment of a section for each project in the  meeting was agreed to. Since a comprehensive evaluation of the  advanced material processing program, and mid-term evaluations  of advanced chemical processing technology and manufacturing  methods for high performance chemicals (for marine life  activity) are to be performed, an evaluation committee was  established for this purpose.  <H5>  The Industrial Science and Technology Frontier Program (ISTF) </H5>   The purpose of the program was explained and the details of  the research and development were reviewed. It was decided to  extend the research and development period for basic research  and development in the propulsion program for supersonic  transport by two years.  <H5>  Note: </H5>   (1) The Industrial Technology Council was established as an  organization affiliated with MITI on July 25, 1973, with the  task of examining crucial issues related to science and  technology for the mining and manufacturing industry in response  to an inquiry from the Minister of MITI. The head of the Council  is Hiroshi Inose, director of the Japan Information Center for  Science and Technology (JICST).    (2) The Industrial Science and Technology Section, which is  organized as one divisional section, will review the ISTF  Program, which began in 1993.  <H5>  The ISTF Program </H5> <H5>  ISTF Office </H5> <H5>  1. Background </H5>   In order to contribute to the advance of fundamental and  original research and development that will contribute to the  future development of industry and society as well as provide  measures to address the quickening pace of society and the aging  society, the former National Research and Development Program  (Large-Scale Project), the Research and Development of Basic  Technologies for Future Industries Project, and the Medical and  Welfare Equipment Technology Development Project were  consolidated in 1993, and a new R&amp;D system, the ISTF Program,  begun.  <H5>  2. System Overview </H5>   The consolidation and revision of the former National  Research and Development Program, the Research and Development  of Basic Technologies for Future Industries Project, and the  Medical and Welfare Equipment Technology Development Project  mainly covered each of the following areas:     -  Fundamental and Original Research and Development       This is fundamental and original research and development to  contribute to new social and economic developments by  constructing and fostering new technological systems, or  implementing technical breakthroughs.     -  Research and Development in the Public Interest       This research and development is needed to address societal  tasks such as providing the foundation needed to improve the  lives of the citizens, to guarantee the stable supply of  resources, and to promote science and technology.    Exploratory research which provides preliminary basic  research and investigation in the preproject stage is carried  out in order to systematically and efficiently advance projects.  <H5>  3.

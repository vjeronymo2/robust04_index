			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i to the Hajj </F> congregation; date not given -- read by announcer]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. [passage omitted] The sacred time for hajj is upon us  with its eternal resources for the Islamic ummah. Thanks be to  God for this unending gift and this ever-vital spring, by the  grace of which Muslims of the world can benefit and reap rewards  according to their own efforts and wisdom.    The extent and variety of the interests and issues which the  divine hand, with its knowledge and wisdom, has fitted into the  duty of hajj is of a magnitude which cannot be found in any  other Islamic precept, ranging from spiritual presence and  thought and the self- discovery of the Islamic individual in  finding himself alone with God, and the cleansing of the heart  from the dirt of sin and negligence, to the sense felt by the  individual who finds himself among a crowd and the sense of  unity felt by each Muslim with the entire Islamic ummah, and the  sense of strength arising from the greatness of the gathering  together of Muslims and to the effort made by every individual  to attain a cure from spiritual wounds and diseases, that is,  from sins, to curiosity and the will to understand and heal the  profound scars and pains affecting the body of the ummah, to  fellow-feelings with all Muslim nations, that is, the members of  that body, are all contained in the hajj and its various rites  and rituals.    The Koran describes the actions carried out during the hajj  as rituals. This means that they are not merely individual  actions aimed at fulfilling an individual duty; they are,  rather, gestures intended to raise the level of insight and  wisdom of the human beings who perform them. Underlying all  these gestures is monotheism, that is, the rejection of all  powers that, in some way, take possession of the bodies and  souls of human beings and the establishment of the absolute rule  of God over one's entire existence. In other words, the rule of  an Islamic system and Islamic regulations over the individual  and social lives of Muslims.    Included in the Koranic verses referring to the hajj, the  Koran calls on everyone to disavow the idols worshipped by the  infidels: But shun the abomination of idols, and shun the word  that is false. [preceding Koranic verse read in Arabic] These  idols may in some instances refer to the idols which were placed  around the Ka'ba; but, undoubtedly, today and at all times, they  also refer to those powers that have unjustly taken charge of  the lives of humanity and, today, refer clearest of all to the  power of arrogance and the satanic power of the United States  and the power of Western culture and the corruption and  decadance which are inflicted on Islamic countries and nations.    Of course, the pseudo-theologians affiliated to and in the  pay of the governments-made-of-straw will insist that, no, those  idols refer merely to Manat, Ellat, and Hubal, those very same  idols that were crushed and annihilated under the foot of the  victorious soldiers of the Great Prophet, peace be upon him and  his scion, on the day when Mecca was captured. The intention of  these monarchical-clergy is to empty the hajj of all political  content to suit their own taste, ignorant of the fact that this  very millions- strong gathering of Muslims that has come  together from every corner of the world in one place at one time  itself contains the richest political content.    This is a display put on by the Islamic ummah in which all  differences of race, language, geography, and history are set  aside and in which everyone joins together to form a whole. In  order to prevent Muslims from understanding the significance of  this great unity and in order to prevent individuals from  gaining a sense of collectivity, these pseudo-clergymen and  their masters have used every kind of lie, deceit, and falsehood  and will continue to do so in order to make life as difficult as  possible for the people who call for unity and invite the  pilgrims to disavow the ring leaders of infidelity.    Islamic Iran wished to do nothing more than the minimum  required by the hajj and that was to issue a call to unity to  all Muslims, to invite all nations to learn the truth about one  another and to ask people to express their hatred and revulsion  of the ring leaders of infidelity and corruption. Anyone who  stands against these valuable and lofty aims is speaking  unjustly, regardless of what he says. As the Koran says: Shun  the word that is false.    The word that is false is the unjust statements made by  those  who speak ill of the Islamic Republic, because the Islamic  Republic rejects the rule of the Zionist government over  occupied Palestine and considers as valueless the compromises  made with the usurpers by a few corrupt and isolated  individuals. It condemns the master-like interventions of the  United States in Arabic countries. It exposes the ugliness of  the treachery of some Islamic leaders against their own Muslim  nations for the pleasure of the United States and the Zionists.  It calls on Muslims to recognize their own tremendous strength  which no superpower can withstand today. It deems Islamic  insight and the rules of Shari'ah as capable of ruling Islamic  countries. It considers the imposed culture of the West, the  manifestation of which lies in nakedness, drunkeness, and  faithlessness, to be harmful for Islamic countries, and, in a  word, insists on obedience to the Koran and Islam.    Today, any Islamic country that states these things openly  and adopts these same positions, that is, rejects usurper  Israel, rejects the bullying interventions of the United States,  rejects drunkeness, decadence, sexual corruption, and the  mingling together of men and women, rejects the treachery of  those who compromise with Israel, calls on Muslims to unite  against and resist the superpowers, implements the rulings of  Islam in government, the economy, politics, and so on, will be  on the receiving end of exactly the same kind of propaganda  which is spread throughout the world against Islamic Iran and  exactly the kind of insults and falsehoods which are directed  against the leaders of this country.    And the news agencies of the arrogant powers and Zionism and  the radios of the United States and Britain and their allies  will speak in exactly the same insulting way, with exactly the  same kind of nonsense, about them. This is what was meant by:  the word that is false, which was put alongside and on the same  level as infidelity by God. How amazing that preachers and  rulers in some corners of the world imitate these anti-Islamic  and religiously forbidden actions of the propagandists of the  United States and the Zionists.    Of course, the total submission to tyrannical rulers that,  unfortunately, is the destiny of clergymen in some Islamic  countries should not really be a source of amazement.    Today, the hajj, God's great blessing, is before you. Every  single Muslim and every member of the Islamic ummah must benefit  from it and as has been commanded [passage omitted], benefit  from it to the advantage of their world and their religion.  Today, the religion of Muslims is threatened by the enemy's  cultural onslaught and the spread of corruption, injustice,  faithlessness, and decadance among Islamic societies; something  that is happening on the initiative of anti-Islamic powers and  with the help of their propaganda and media, and the world of  Muslims is threatened by the ever-increasing hegemony of  arrogance over the affairs of Islamic countries and by the  ever-increasing pressure on and hostility against any government  or group that wishes to direct the minds of people toward the  true rule of Islam and toward the independence and strength of  Muslim nations.    And, of course, at the head of this all-embracing attack  against Islam is the Great Satan, that is, the Government of the  United States. Any clear-sighted eye can see the hand and will  of that anti-Islamic government behind all the misfortunes which  are inflicted on Islam and Muslims.    In occupied Palestine, the main reason behind the strong-  headedness and the boldness of the Zionists and the most  important factor behind the compromise made by most Arab  governments before the endless demands of Israel is the United  States. Without the backing of the United States, the  reactionary governments of the region, which are well known for  their submissiveness to the United States, would not have turned  into the defenders of the usurping government and into the  supposed defenders of those Palestinians who are against  compromise.    And those who, according to their Islamic duties, must stand  against Israel would not don the clothes of those who stand  against the opponents of Israel. And, without the unconditional  support of the United States, the usurping government would not  have been able to bring about a great tragedy such as the  massacre [in Hebron] at the noble shrine of Abraham, peace be  upon him, and to avoid suffering all the consequences of such an  action.    A similar situation applies to the Muslims of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The historical massacre of the people of  Gorazde and Sarajevo by the Serbs, which can truly be seen as  ranking among the most shameful deeds committed by humanity in  our times, is a huge crime, the responsibility for which must be  borne by the powers who dominate the world and, more than any  other power, by the United States.    If it were not for their interference and their policies,  the  Muslims of Bosnia would not have been deprived of receiving  assistance in the form of weapons in the face of well-equipped  and well-armed Serbs, and a defenceless and besieged nation  would not have been sacrificed to blood thirsty, shameless and  encouraged aggressors.    What is painful is that the United States and NATO, after  laying the groundwork in this heartless way for the massacre of  Bosnian Muslims, after using the United Nations and its  secretary general totally for their own ends, after displaying  signs of their own pleasure at the killing of Muslims at the  hands of the Serbs, and after several weeks passed since the  savage attack of the aggressors against Muslim women, children,  the old, and the young and the death of thousands of innocent  people and the inflicting of suffering on such a scale on the  people of the city of Gorazde, after all that to call a halt to  the torture and describe that as humanitarianism, love of peace  and neutrality.    Is it the case that, when an executioner stops torturing a  person after hours and days, he can claim to be humane and use  as evidence of his humanity the fact that he has stopped  torturing his victim?    This apparently neutral, but in practice aggressive, stand  against Muslims, is seen in the United states and its European  collaborators, such as Britain, in every incident in which  innocent Muslims constitute one side, and are subjected to their  enemies' oppressive behavior and pressure. Among the examples  are the sorrowful events of Kashmir and the intense suffering of  the Muslims in Nagorno-Karabakh and Tajikistan.    Wherever a government or a gathering chant slogans of  Islam, and strive for the establishment of the rule of Islam,  they become the inevitable targets of America's abuse, slander,  ruthlessness, and malicious hostility. Clear examples have been  shown toward the Sudanese Government, Algeria's Islamic  movement, Lebanon's Hizballah, Hamas, Palestine's Islamic Jihad,  Muslims of Egypt, and so on. In all these cases, the agents of  global arrogance and above all the United States have been  displaying fanatical behavior similar to that of tribal  communities. The case of the United States' malicious  hostilities, accompanied by wrath and injustice against Islamic  Iran -- although in most cases ineffective thanks to the divine  will and blessing -- is in itself a separate issue, of which  many in the world are aware.    Now, do the great Islamic ummah, its leaders and  politicians,  intellectuals and religious authorities have no responsibilities  with regard to this tragic plight of Muslims throughout the  world? Do these people, who on the basis of the words spoken by  the great prophet of Islam, may God's blessing be upon him and  his scion, who said: He who shows no interest in the affairs of  Muslims is no Muslim [preceding Koranic verse in Arabic] -- know  of an occasion more suitable than the hajj to the House of God  and of a time more suitable than the days of the revelations for  displaying this important obligation. It was indeed not without  reason that the exalted prophet, may God's blessing be upon him  and his scion, chose the hajj period for promulgating the  disavowal of infidels, which is a totally political activity  within the framework of the very first Islamic government's  general policy. He proclaimed a divine and Koranic command: And  an announcement from God and His apostle, to the people  assembled on the day of that great pilgrimage. That God and His  apostle, dissolve treaty obligations with the pagans. If then,  you repent, it would be best for you, but if you turn away, know  you that you cannot frustrate god. And proclaim a grievous  penalty to those who reject faith. [preceding Koranic verse in  Arabic]    Indeed, the hajj is a religious duty during which and by way  of which the most important political difficulties of the  Islamic ummah can be resolved. For that reason, the hajj is a  political-religious duty, the peculiarities of which have made  this very apparent. Those who deny this and propagandize against  it are in effect against the resolution of those difficulties.  In brief, the hajj is a religious duty which concerns the  ummah, the unity, the rule of Muslims, the improvement of the  individual and the community, and in a nutshell, this world and  the hereafter.    Those who do not want to accept the political connotations  of  hajj, in effect want to keep Islam away from politics and  separate religion from politics. The issue of separating  religion from politics is that very point which the enemies of  Islam have been raising for decades.    Today, because a government based on the sacred religion of  Islam has been set up in Iran, and the ever-increasing  enthusiasm for the formation of Islamic governments has engulfed  the entire Islamic world, the arrogants are raising that issue  of separating religion from politics with more vigor and haste.  Wherever they see the preparations for the realization of this  aim of forming Islamic governments, they enter the scene with  force and aggression to fight against it.    The rule of Islam requires resistance to the intervention of  the arrogants in Islamic countries. It also warrants the need  to keep away those who are dependent on these powers, and the  slaves of the satan of selfish desires and arrogance, from  ruling these countries. It is therefore natural that arrogance  and those who depend on it, and the satans and their followers  should be angry about the rule of Islam. By the same token,  those who believe in God and the Day of Judgement should welcome  it and strive toward it.    Now that a number of people from all over the world have had  the fortune of perceiving [as heard] the period of revelations  and the hajj to the House of God, I in all sincerity and modesty  beseech the almighty to accept their pilgrimage and to endow  them and the entire Muslim ummah with pilgrimage benefits.    I make the following recommendations to the brothers and  sisters:    One: Seize this opportunity for self-making, repentance, and  pleading to God and store spiritual assets to last you for the  rest of your life.    Two: Ask Almighty God to eliminate great obstacles along the  path of the Muslims; and keep repeating this request again and  again in every prayer and hymns.    Three: Seize every opportunity to become acquainted with  Muslims from other countries. Learn a lesson from the positive  and negative points of their daily life. Non-Iranian Muslims  should particularly hear the truth and circumstances of Islamic  Iran from the mouths of their Iranian brothers, so that they  discover for themselves whether the global propaganda against  Iran is right or wrong. Today and always, they should strive to  learn the instructions of the late imam, His Eminence Imam  Khomeyni, may God bless his soul, on Muslim issues. They should  become better and more closely familiar with that illustrious  and pious personality of Islam's history.    Four: All the accurate information and knowledge you have  acquired on the situation of the Islamic ummah or about your own  country, pass it on to the Muslims from other countries.    Five: During conversations with your Muslim brothers, from  every corner of the Islamic world, bear in mind the plight of  the Islamic ummah and view the solidarity of the Islamic world.  Take your thoughts and others' thoughts beyond the confinement  of geographical borders, racial, ideological, factional, and  other such divides. Think only of Islam and Muslims.    Six: Keep reminding your conversation partners to think of  the God-given might of more than one billion Muslims and dozens  of Islamic countries with so much material and spiritual wealth  and with a huge heritage of culture, civilization, faith, and  ethics.    Seven: Break the myth of the West's invincible might and  particularly that of the United States, which global arrogance  has always tried to magnify several times above reality and has  tried to instill into the Muslims' minds. Remind yourselves and  others that the Communist might, which on the surface seemed  insurmountable, collapsed in our region and in front of this  same generation's eyes. Nothing is left of that might now. The  existing over-inflated powers, including the might of the United  States, may be destroyed and annihilated just as easily.    Eight: Keep reminding the religious ulema and intellectuals  of the Muslim countries of their immense burden of  responsibility.    Nine: Remind the heads of Islamic states of their obligation  to the Islamic ummah, which is to create unity among Muslims, to  keep away from global powers, to incline and rely on their own  nations, and to create healthy relations between the people and  the rulers. Such a reminder by you is a duty in accordance with  the Koranic verse which says: The imams of the Muslims need  advising. [preceding verse in Arabic] Afterwards ask Almighty  God to rectify this matter.    Ten: Remember always that when we say the heads of state are  responsible, it does not mean the individual members of a nation  have no responsibility. Rather, they can play a decisive role  in the realization of all these great goals. It is hoped that  with divine help and kind considerations of the Imam of the Era,  may our souls be sacrificed for him and may God hasten his lofty  advent, the esteemed pilgrims' hajj rituals will be accepted by  God.    I beseech God to bestow his blessings and vast mercy on the  entire Islamic ummah and every individual among the Muslims.  May God's peace be on all pious slaves.

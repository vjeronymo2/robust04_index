			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Inchcape The market turned up its nose at Inchcape's planned acquisition of Hogg Group, knocking 2 per cent off its shares. But that seems a grudging response to a neatly-turned deal. Admittedly, the purchase marks a departure for Inchcape, which has been averse to buying public companies in the past. There are still worries about the depths of Hogg's trading problems and the acquisition is unlikely to contribute to Inchcape's earnings this year. At 40 times estimated earnings, Inchcape is paying a full price. Writing off goodwill will knock more than Pounds 150m off Inchcape's shareholders' funds, lifting gearing to 50 per cent. But Hogg is unlikely to prove a pig in a poke. The consideration is a relatively modest 1.35 times Hogg's brokerage income and there is scope to restore operating margins. Hogg forms a geographic fit with Inchcape's own Bain Clarkson. Benefits should also derive from sheer economies of scale. The merger may eventually give Bain Hogg Clarkson the strength to vault into the top tier of insurance brokers. Its partial flotation within the next two years will enable it to use paper to fund the next leap forward, which will be useful given the goodwill costs involved in buying asset-free businesses. From where Inchcape started, the deal makes strategic sense. Given Bain Clarkson's modest size, Inchcape either had to get bigger or get out of insurance broking. The merger and flotation may enable it to do both.</p>

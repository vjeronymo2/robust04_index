[Fujimori] It really started during the presidential  inauguration in Asuncion. At the time, President Wasmosy and I  became friends. This visit greatly strengthens our bilateral  ties. I believe some steps will be taken to strengthen them even  more.    [NOTICIAS] Do you believe [Latin American liberator Simon]  Bolivar's dream of achieving a politically and economically  united Latin America will ever be accomplished?    [Fujimori] I believe that each one of these markets,  Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the Andean Pact, will  have to consolidate themselves by establishing free markets that  will lead to integration. It is very likely that some countries  will become doorways between Mercosur and the Andean Group.  Peru, and I believe all Latin American countries, are very  willing to be part of a large bloc.    [NOTICIAS] What is your definition of Peruvian economic  policy, because any integration is based on the macroeconomic  factor?    [Fujimori] I believe that one of the issues that may delay  this economic integration is the establishment of common customs  tariffs. There is a wide variety of ideas on this issue.  Peru's case in the Andean Pact is an example of this, at least  temporarily. Peru has an open economic policy, with common  customs tariffs ranging between 15 and 25 percent on products,  while other countries have a differentiated customs tax. This  is the main problem impeding an agreement.    [NOTICIAS] What is Peru's domestic situation? Is terrorism  still a shadow?    [Fujimori] I hope you have the opportunity to witness for  yourselves here in Lima, and throughout Peru, that people can  walk freely and safely. Terrorism is not a problem for us  anymore. In less than two years, we have been able to defeat  two of the more violent groups in the world, not only in Latin  America. By adopting specific and practical measures at all  levels, and through an overall strategy, Peru is now able to  overcome underdevelopment, precisely because terrorism was one  of the factors that undermined this objective.    Right now we have launched a great battle: the fight against  poverty. This is done, of course, without overlooking other  areas such as the fight against drug trafficking. We are  concentrating on this to strengthen domestic security.    [NOTICIAS] Do the Chiapas and Santiago del Estero cases  worry you?    [Fujimori] Similar cases may occur in other places. We have  suffered a terrible nightmare for the past 13 years.  Fortunately, we are almost through with it and we have gained  great experience. We are aware that pacification is achieved  only through development. We are working on this, and this is  why we have declared war on poverty.    [NOTICIAS] Mr. President, do you believe that the Fujimori  approach in Peru as a Peruvian political experience can be  applied in other Latin American countries?    [Fujimori] I do not believe that models applied in one  country can be repeated elsewhere. But I do believe that people  are questioning themselves, not only in Latin America but in  other regions of the world as well, because the so-called  democracies are not working. Peru's particular case, and  probably that of some Latin American countries, is that the  objectives and aspirations outlined by the government and the  people are not fulfilled. This is the cause of frustrations  resulting from a system that is mistakenly called democracy.    At the world level, there will be a need for reform that the  peoples will bring about to improve the democratic system.    [NOTICIAS] Do you believe the Latin American political class  is declining?    [Fujimori] It is being questioned and this is taking place  in several places. If there is no rapid reaction, it is going  to be challenged.    [NOTICIAS] Are you thinking about seeking reelection? And  if that is the case, what will be your political support? Will  you be supported by any particular sector?    [Fujimori] I reassert that I have not made up my mind yet.  My entire government policy is based on the people, on the  people's needs.    My party, Change 90 or New Majority, is the one that groups  competent people. We do not have a party structure.    [NOTICIAS] How would you define democracy from your point of  view?    [Fujimori] I believe one must defend democracy, but not a  pseudo-democracy, which strives to hide improper situations.  Democracy must be increasingly more open. It is within this  framework that democracy and the people will win.    [NOTICIAS] Finally, what was [Shining Path leader] Abimael  Guzman to you?    [Fujimori] A criminal...a criminal.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: MPs and activists speak out against electoral pacts ELECTORAL PACTS between Labour and the Liberal Democrats were firmly ruled out at a fringe meeting on the prospects of a political re-alignment delivering electoral success for the centre-left. Labour's fourth successive election defeat raised the question of whether an anti-Conservative pact is the only way the party will ever emerge from opposition, but the idea has been rejected by the leaderships of both the parties. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Citizen's Charter minister, said: 'Electoral pacts are not on the agenda. It is not for us to make the decision for voters or for party activists.' But she said that where there was common ground with other parties it should be acknowledged. Sharing a platform at the meeting was Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat MP for Fife North East. Last month's Liberal Democrat conference also ruled out formal pacts, but left the door open for informal contacts. Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, warned that the party may have to accept that there is a 'glass ceiling' to its support, above which the electorate will not let it rise. He said: 'We do not know what the circumstances will be when the next election is called . . . It would be wise at this stage to keep our options open.' He urged joint membership of the proposed Commission for Social Justice, which Labour suggested should look for solutions to poverty. Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West, spoke against closer links with the Liberal Democrats, saying it would be a further obstacle to moving Labour back to the left. 'It is not just about getting an anti-Tory government. The mere fact that you can look at the Liberal (Democrat) manifesto and see so much common ground with Labour is a matter of distress,' he said. Speakers from the floor demonstrated deep suspicion of Liberal Democrat opponents. A delegate from Tower Hamlets, east London, attacked the election tactics of the Liberal Democrats, which have led to bitterness in the area. Dame Barbara Castle, the former Labour cabinet minister, said her first memory of the Liberals was as 'the Tories' natural allies'. She said: 'There have been and still are some great Liberal spirits with whom we naturally ally. But they won't ally with us unless we have got some great revolutionary spirits left in the Labour party. 'I believe the only alliance that can possibly exist between Labour and Liberals is with individual Liberals on the basis of a great strong reforming policy by the Labour party.'</p>

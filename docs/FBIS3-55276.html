He told reporters that the move "would help eliminate any  misunderstanding between the government and the deputies."    Shakhray added that the 24 deputies belonging to his party,  the Russia Unity and Accord Party that ran against the  government-backed Russia's Choice party during the recent  legislative elections, would give Chernomyrdin their vote of  confidence.    He said that he expected a government reshuffle planned by  President Boris Yeltsin to be a source of tension between the  Kremlin and parliament, which has little say in the matter.    Shakhray, who may be targeted by the reshuffle according to  local press reports, said he would not react "hysterically" if  that were the case.    He said he plans to seek the presidency of the Duma despite  the clear opposition of many of the political parties.</p>

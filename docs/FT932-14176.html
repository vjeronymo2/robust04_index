			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Opposition rises to higher Black stake in Fairfax MR JOHN Dawkins, Australia's federal treasurer (finance minister) is coming under increasing pressure to reject an application from Mr Conrad Black for permission to take a larger stake in Australia's John Fairfax newspaper group. Mr Dawkins has until the end of the week to decide whether to allow Mr Black's UK-based Telegraph group to increase its holding in Fairfax from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. The application has attracted criticism from a wide range of public figures, including Mr Martin Ferguson, president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), and Mr Malcolm Fraser, a former conservative prime minister. Mr Ferguson told Mr Dawkins in a letter that the government would fail its first big test since winning re-election last month if it allowed Mr Black to increase his stake. 'The policy of the ACTU is to ensure that foreign interests cannot control either directly or indirectly the management or programme content of any newspaper, magazine or periodical,' Mr Ferguson said. Mr Fraser, who campaigned against the acquisition of Fairfax in 1991 by the Tourang consortium led by Mr Black, said the high level of overseas investment in the Australian media was a serious problem. He said a takeover of Fairfax by Mr Kerry Packer, the media entrepreneur, would be preferable to an increase in the minority holding Mr Black acquired in 1991, because foreign control was a more important issue than concentration of ownership. 'Kerry's a good businessmen and he's very much an Australian. If we are going to have . . . control by individuals I would far sooner (have) Kerry Packer . . . than Conrad Black,' Mr Ferguson said. Mr Packer owns about 10 per cent of Fairfax through his privately-owned Consolidated Press Holdings group, but would have to give up control of the Channel Nine commercial television network before launching a full bid. Opposition to Mr Black's application among Labor MPs has been muted since the election because of the promotion to the government of several prominent critics. However, Mr Barry Jones, Labor's federal president, was one of five senior backbench MPs who signed a letter last week urging Mr Dawkins to block the Telegraph group's application. Mr Dawkins is believed not to have made a final decision on the application, which is likely to be discussed by the federal cabinet today. Tourang acquired Fairfax for ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1bn) after the group was put into receivership, following a bungled buy-out of family shareholders by Mr Warwick Fairfax. The group publishes the Sydney Morning Herald, the Australian Financial Review and The (Melbourne) Age. It is the principal competitor to News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's US-controlled media group, which is Australia's largest newspaper publisher.</p>

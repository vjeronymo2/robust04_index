			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: Perfect gifts for difficult people - Lucia van der Post conjures up an imaginary family to offer ideas for presents for real relatives Families, families . . . console yourself, everybody else's are difficult, too. But, as Tolstoy might have said, it is the difficult ones that are the most interesting. But no matter how difficult they may seem, somewhere there is a present to match. Here is an archetypally difficult family, and presents to please them. CHARLES: IN RECESSION In the 1980s Charles' salary looked like a telephone number. But these days life is tougher. The financial investment firm he worked for has gone under, his losses at Lloyd's still loom and Charles spends his days helping to put some financial order into his wife's catering business. He does not often have to wear a suit so anything from somewhere like Racing Green (0345-331177) would help restore his fading wardrobe or, better still, a pair of stone-coloured cords or moleskin trousers from Hackett or Johnnie Boden (081-964 2662). A Thomas Pink shirt would go down well, too, for those days when he has to face the bank manager. Now that Charles does not have to cut much of a figure in the office his waistline has become rather slack. He would love a chin-up bar at just Pounds 9.99 - tones up the biceps and the torso - from Lillywhites, Piccadilly Circus, London W1. Charles loves good things but can afford them less and less - he would be thrilled by a finely-made Caran d'Ache pen - all slim lines with a good strong pocket clip and a giant-sized refill for Pounds 99.50. He badly needs cheering up so a real boys' own adventure would be just the thing. Give him a day out learning to be a rally driver for Pounds 225. (01608- 678339) ZAC AND SKY: VERY, VERY GREEN Zac and Sky are concerned about the third world, conservation, over-population and waste. Zac is in computers and Sky is an occupational therapist but hates it. Sky sees herself as an earth mother but her concern about using up the earth's resources means she only has one child. She is worried about her Daisy sitting in front of screens all day, laying down cholesterol for her later years. Power Rangers In-Line skates ('the most happening way to work out') would be good for eight-year-old Daisy. With a high ankle support, soft inner linings, strong chassis and PVC wheels, they are just the thing and at Pounds 19.99 a pair (from Toys 'R' Us) Daisy will find them 'awesome'. Then Sky loves traditional games such as Triominos from Goliath Games. It is, she has heard, the perfect family game. It encourages 'interactive play' something Sky is very keen on. It won the Game of the Year in the Netherlands and for just Pounds 9.99 ought to give a lot of bonding. Daisy will certainly find an Urban Forestry Kit, Pounds 2.99 from Natural Fact, 193 King's Road, London SW3 (mail order 071- 352 4283) in her stocking. The kit consists of three seedlings to plant to help prevent global warming. Sky herself would love almost anything from Natural Fact, 192 King's Road, London SW3 - an ecru towelling robe at Pounds 49.99 or Acca Kappa natural straw massage slippers at Pounds 30. As for beauty products (not that Sky uses them much) Green Things, 70 Chalk Farm Road, London NW1 is the place. Sky believes in fair trade and loves anything with an 'ethnic' label. Kashi (294/5 High Holborn, London WC1), for instance, has hand-made papier-mache decorations, children's wooden jig-saw puzzles at Pounds 6, and silver-plated wine glasses from Pounds 4.50, all made by extremely poor women in India. JANET: STRESSED SINGLE MOTHER Janet is in her late 30s, a media person with an independent TV company and, as if that was not stressful enough, she is a single mother to seven-year-old Simon. She is busy, busy, busy. She never has time to shop so what she needs are presents to soften her home and things for herself. Give Simon a PGL Adventure holiday weekend (Pounds 79 plus insurance 0989-764211). Simon would have a ball and Janet (dearly as she loves Simon) would love a weekend to herself. She could indulge in all those new age therapies she is so keen on. She would love a voucher for aromatherapy (Aromatherapy Associates 071-731 8129, Pounds 38 a session) and she is always worried that she never has time to pretty up the house so fresh flowers arriving regularly would do wonders for her morale. For roughly Pounds 150 Parterre (071-323 1623) would send a bunch of seasonal flowers once a month for six months (delivery charges vary but in the London area would be about Pounds 3). Jewellery, if you get it right, is always a good present. A multi-stranded pearl choker from Coleman Douglas Pearls, 97b Drayton Gardens, London SW10 (starting prices Pounds 380) or one of their huge pearl cuffs (from Pounds 480) would be wonderful. She has also had her eye on Sandra Cronan's collection of faux jewellery at 18 Burlington Arcade, London W1 - in particular her aquamarine collet necklace at Pounds 850. Janet likes glam clothes - she is, after all in a visual business - so anything from Browns, South Molton Street, London W1 would be appreciated. She hankers for Mulberry's Chenille coat at Pounds 495 or a delicate devore scarf by Camilla Ridley (small ones are Pounds 99 but the luscious shawl-sized ones are Pounds 249 . . . find them at Harrods, Liberty's, Space NK). HENRY AND ROSE: NEED SPOILING Rose, dear Rose, has spent the last 20 years looking after the four children, tending the house, doing the flowers in the church on Sunday while Henry has been tending his patients as a country GP. They are both unaccustomed to spending on themselves - what with four lots of school fees and their youngest son's surprising academic success (what was his Ph. D all about? They never did quite get a handle on it) required years of parental support, and then the grandchildren coming along, the Old Manor House is looking a bit shabby . . . as are their wardrobes. So Henry and Rose are easy . . . spoiling is what they need. Rose would love a black cashmere tunic sweater which can be given a demure elegance by the addition of heavy ivory silk detachable collars and cuffs (Pounds 265 from Madeleine Hamilton, Chichester Rents, Chancery Lane, London WC2A 1EG and 94 Richmond Avenue, Islington, London N1 0LU. Mail order 071-833 3388). Or she would love a heavy matt silk shirt with double cuffs (Pounds 75 from TM Lewin, 103-106 Jermyn Street, London W1). These days Rose has difficulty keeping track of her spectacles - so her grandchildren might give her some pretty haematite beaded spectacle ropes to hang them around her neck. At Pounds 19.99 a time (including p+p ) from Crystal Eyes, 12 Bemish Road, London SW15 1DG (081-789 3528). If Henry is feeling rich he could give her one of the beautiful antique lorgnettes or opera glasses sold by Optika on the Lower Ground Floor at Harrods (not cheap  -anything from Pounds 250 upwards - but very special). As a girl Rose was a promising artist and now at last she has time to start doing water-colours again - she would love the drawing pad holder, beautifully encased in leather, by Papyrus (Pounds 97.50, 48 Fulham Road, London SW3 6HH, 071- 584 8022) and if somebody is feeling generous there is a paint brush tube with a waterproof lining that fits on to it with a strap for Pounds 97.50. Rose likes jewellery. Caroline Charles, 56/57 Beauchamp Place, London SW3 (071-225 3197) is her sort of shop and this winter it has marvellous antique-looking diamante chokers and earrings as well as some dashing leopard skin gloves which would wake up the sidesmen in the local church on a Sunday morning. Henry has seen too many of his patients slide into an unhealthy late middle age so he is making determined efforts to take his shape in hand. A precision-made marching compass with a luminous dial and a magnifying sight lens at Pounds 14.95 (from Presents for Men, 01295-750100) would lend his walks some interest. So, too, would a pedometer which clips to the waistband and measures the distance covered, approximate number of steps taken and calories consumed. By Sportsline at Lillywhites, Piccadilly Circus, London W1, Pounds 19.99. Henry loves single malt whisky or, at the end of one of Rose's splendid diners, some cognac (get him an XO Cognac at Pounds 90). A classic from Talking Books for when he is driving round the countryside would go down well (make sure it is unabridged for Henry knows his classics), as would some very fine tea. NIGEL: DASHING IN ADVERTISING Nigel is in his early 30s and really rather dashing (though not quite as dashing as he would like to be). Much to the bewilderment of his masters at school who remember him as rather lightweight Nigel is doing very well in advertising. Though Nigel has had a mobile for some time he is rather bored with the bulge it makes in his Paul Smith suits - he would love the little Sony ('smaller than a pack of playing cards,' he read somewhere) mobile. He knows it is expensive (anywhere between Pounds 200 and Pounds 400 depending on the discounts) but it would be just the thing. In the 1980s his bathroom was full of premium-priced lotions and potions but now he is wary of glitzy names selling what he refers to as 'coloured water' and goes for classic lines which he likes to think of as 'his': Chanel's 'Pour Monsieur', Givenchy's 'Gentlemen' or anything by Geo. F. Trumper are the classics he likes. In the 1980s he would spend hours watching American football but 1990s man supports his local soccer team. So he would love a video of his favourite club (Arsenal, Spurs, Chelsea . . . they are all doing them). He has intellectual pretensions so a video of a French classic movie would please him. Nigel eats out rather less than once he did and is into cooking - lots of pasta which satisfies his need to feel creative without taxing it too severely. A proper Parmesan grater would go down well (Pounds 12.75), as would a terracotta egg-tray for Pounds 6.75 and an espresso maker that goes on top of the cooker with a ceramic pot on top around Pounds 20 or sweet little aluminium knives at Pounds 3.95 to Pounds 4.95, just right for spreading tapenade on his crostini. All from The Conran Shop, Michelin House, Fulham Road, London SW3. He is, of course, highly computer literate and would not move without his laptop. But he is the first to admit that computers are not things of great beauty. Mulberry understands him perfectly and has produced a laptop computer case in brandy harness-leather with solid brass fittings which would be just the job for Pounds 395. SOPHIE: DADDY'S GIRL Sophie has just turned 19 and is not what you might call academic. Her A-levels, much to Daddy's displeasure were not up to much, so after her secretarial course she took a nice little job in an art gallery. The salary is poor but she likes the slight whiff of bohemian glamour attached to it (after all Lady Helen Windsor did all right, didn't she?) and they do not mind if your lunch-hours drift on a bit. She would really like anything from Nicole Farhi (Chanel is, dare we say it, just a little passe this Christmas) or APC (130 Draycott Avenue, London SW3) and what she would like in particular is a silver tunic or leather-wrap mini-skirt. Then she has her eye on an absolutely plain polo-neck wool body from Donna Karan's DKNY range at Pounds 79, any accessory by Patrick Cox (8 Symons Street, London SW3). She longs to own a Discman (about Pounds 200). Now that she has to be tolerably organised for work she would like a black patent Bill Amberg rucksack to hold her personal belongings (Pounds 70 from Harvey Nichols but there is an excellent cheaper version at Debenhams for Pounds 35). She has always longed for a silver jig-saw ring Pounds 144 from Georg Jensen, 15 New Bond Street, London W1 or silver pen from Tiffany which would fit into her Filofax (Pounds 34).</p>

			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Empty offices become shelter for homeless ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks and food group, has turned almost half of its former London headquarters over to temporary shelter for the homeless. Allied-Lyons has given up three of the eight floors at its former offices in Islington, north London. The move is part of a campaign to help the homeless by taking advantage of some the capital's empty office space. Up to 120 people sleep each night in the building, which has become London's largest cold-weather shelter. The project has been organised by English Churches Housing Group and the Construction Industry Relief and Assistance for Single Homeless (Crash). Crash said that it was the first time that owners of an empty office block had offered to make space available in the capital under the government's cold-weather shelter scheme launched in 1991. Under the scheme the government provides grants to voluntary agencies in London to finance temporary shelters during the coldest winter months, normally from late November to the end of March. Crash, established to take advantage of surplus construction industry capacity and skills to aid the homeless, has been supporting the scheme since November 1991 by providing conversion work either free-of-charge or at concessionary rates. This winter building groups such as John Laing and Trafalgar House have provided services, goods or money to provide more than 300 temporary cold-weather beds. The Barbour Index, which supplies construction research, has also helped fund the projects. English Churches and Crash appealed to owners of other empty office buildings to follow Allied-Lyons' lead. Ms Caroline White, chief executive of English Churches Housing Group, said: 'When the managing agency has experience of working with the homeless, as we do, there is no risk to the property.' The group said that the offices had been converted into double bedrooms in just five weeks with the help of Crash and Wates Construction.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (z) Is for patent or copyright infringement. (See AR 27&hyph;60). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (aa) Claims for damage to property of a State, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia caused by ARNG personnel engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 who are assigned to a unit maintained by that State, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia will not be paid without the express approval of the Commander, USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (bb) Is for damage to property or for any death or personal injury arising out of the activities of any Federal agency or employee of the Government in carrying out the provisions of the Federal Disaster Relief Act of 1954 (P.L. 93&hyph;288, Sec. 403, 88 Stat. 143). The Act requires the local beneficiary (State or local government) to hold the Government harmless and to assume the defense of all claims arising from the removal of debris and wreckage from public or private property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (cc) Arises from activities that present a nonjusticiable political question. The courts search for six factors, as follows, any one of which is grounds for dismissal: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A commitment of the issue to a coordinate branch of Government by the text of the Constitution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The impossibility of deciding without a policy determination calling for non-judicial discretion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The impossibility of undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of respect for coordinate branches of Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) An unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The potential for embarrassment from multiple pronouncements by various departments on one question. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.76 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims under other laws and regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any claim that may be settled under any exclusive or specific authorization discussed in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 8, will be settled under such authority in preference to settlement under this subpart. Guidance concerning application of this policy will be obtained from USARCS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.77 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) General. Unless inconsistent with the provisions of this subpart, the procedures for the investigation and processing of claims set forth in subpart B will be followed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Claims arising out of tortious conduct by ARNG personnel defined in subpart 536.71(b)(1)(iii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Notification and investigation. The procedures in &sect;&sect;536.97 and 536.98 will be followed in NG claims arising under the FTCA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Claims against the U.S. Government received by agencies of the State. These claims will be expeditiously forwarded through the State adjutant general to the appropriate U.S. Army area claims office in whose geographic area the incident occurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Statute of limitations. (1) To be settled under this subpart, a claim against the United States must be presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within 2 years of its accrual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For statute of limitations purposes, a claim will be deemed to have been presented when the appropriate Federal agency (as defined in the glosssary) receives from a claimant or his or her duly authorized agent or legal representative, an executed SF 95 or written notification of an incident, together with a claim for money damages, in a sum certain, for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or death. For Federal tort claims arising out of activities of the NG, receipt of a written claim by any full time officer or employee of the NG will be considered proper receipt. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A claim received by an official of the DOD will be transmitted without delay to the nearest Army claims processing office or area claims office. Inquiries concerning applicability of the statute of limitations to claims filed with the wrong Federal Agency will be referred to USARCS for resolution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Claims within settlement authority of USARCS of the Attorney General. (1) A copy of each of the type of claims described below will be forwarded immediately to the Commander, USARCS. (Subsequent documents should be forwarded or added in accordance with &sect;536.22(b)(2).) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Claims that appear to be of a type that must be brought to the attention of the Attorney General in accordance with his or her regulations (28 CFR 14.6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A claim in which the demand exceeds $25,000 or the total amount of all claims, actual or potential, from a single incident exceeds $25,000 $50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) USARCS is responsible for the monitoring and settlement of such claims and will be kept informed of the status of the investigation and processing thereof. Direct liaison and correspondence between USARCS and the field claims authority or investigator is authorized on all claims matters and assistance will be furnished as required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Non-Army claims. Claims based on acts or omissions of employees of the United States, other than military and civilian personnel of the DA, civilian personnel of the DOD, and employees of nonappropriated fund activities of the DA will be transmitted forthwith to the nearest official of the employing agency; the claimant will be advised of the referral. (See &sect;536.18(c) and (d) for further guidance when more than one Federal agency is involved.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Acknowledgment of claim. (1) The claimant and his or her attorney will be kept informed by personal contact, telephonic contact, or mail of the receipt of his or her claim and the status of the claim. Formal acknowledgment of the claim in writing is required only where the claim is likely to result in litigation or is presented in an amount exceeding $15,000. In this event, the letter of acknowledgment will state the date of receipt of the claim by the first agency of the Army receiving the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If it is reasonably clear to the office acknowledging receipt that a claim filed under the FTCA is not cognizable thereunder; for example, it is a maritime claim under chapter 8, or it falls under subparts C or F, the acknowledgment will contain a statement advising the claimant of the statute under which his or her claim will be processed. If it is not clear which subpart applies, a statement to that effect will be made and the claimant will be promptly advised when a decision is made. However all potential maritime claims will be handled in accordance with &sect;536.21(b)(5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When a claim has been amended as set forth in &sect;536.20(f)(4), the amendment will be acknowledged in all cases. Also, the claimant will be informed that the amendment constitutes a new claim insofar as concerns the 6 months in which the DA is granted the authority to make a final disposition under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a) and the claimant's option thereunder will not accrue until 6 months after the filing of the amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) When a claim is improperly presented, is incomplete, or otherwise does not meet the requirements set forth in section 536.20(d), the claimant or his or her representative will be promptly informed in writing of the deficiencies and advised that a proper claim must be filed within the 2 year statute of limitations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Investigation. Claims cognizable under this regulation will be investigated and processed on a priority basis in order that settlement if indicated may be accomplished within the 6 months prescribed by statute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Advice to claimant. (1) A full explanation of claims procedures and of the rights of the claimant will be made to the extent necessitated by the amount and nature of the claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In a case where litigation is likely, or where this course of action is preferred by the claimant, and it appears to be a proper case for administrative settlement, the claimant will be advised as to the advantages of administrative settlement. If the claim is within the jurisdiction of a higher settlement authority, the claim will be discussed with such authority prior to the furnishing of such advice. The claimant should be familiarized with all aspects of administrative settlement procedures including the administrative channels through which the claim must be processed for approval. He or she may be advised that administrative processing can result in more expeditious processing, whereas litigation may take considerable time, particularly in jurisdictions with crowded dockets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If appropriate, the claimant may be informed that a tentative settlement can be reached for any amount, but that awards in excess of $200,000 are subject to approval by the Attorney General. The claimant should be advised that administrative filing of the claim protects him or her under the statute of limitations for purpose of litigation and that a suit can be filed within 6 months after the date of mailing of notice of final denial by the DA, thus potentially allowing negotiations to continue indefinitely. An attorney representing a claimant should be advised of the limitations on fees for purposes of administrative settlement (20 percent) and litigation (25 percent) and that there is no jury trial under the FTCA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

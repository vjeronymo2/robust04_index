			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Regulation urged for digital TV Regulatory intervention is urgently needed if viewers are to get full benefit from the digital television revolution, consultants Arthur D. Little said yesterday. The firm says in a report for the BBC that without regulation the companies which owned 'conditional access systems' - the decoder boxes which unscramble subscription television signals - would be able to create effective monopolies. The danger was that viewers might need several decoder boxes to watch all the new services. The firm says that if monopoly owners of access systems were allowed to emerge 'the development of new digital services could be stifled'. The report comes before Monday's hearing of the European parliament's economic and monetary committee, due to be attended by many of Europe's broadcasters and operators of decoding systems. Arthur D. Little believes a mandatory 'common interface' standard is needed so that one decoder box would be able to handle the subscription cards of several operators. The BBC has called on the government and the European Commission to create a regulatory framework to ensure that there is no opportunity for monopoly abuse. This would include: Standards so customers could buy decoders compatible with all available systems. Licensing so decoder boxes could receive all channels using proprietary systems. Arrangements for owners of conditional access systems to carry rival channels if capacity was available. Fair pricing and transparent accounts when operators also run television channels. Binding arbitration.</p>

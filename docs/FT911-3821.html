			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Daimler falls 10% before tax DAIMLER-BENZ, the diversified German motor group, said its pre-tax profits fell by around 10 per cent last year, much of the decline caused by currency movements. Because of a lower tax payment, however, net profits were 6 per cent higher at DM1.8bn (Dollars 1.03bn) compared with the comparable figure of DM1.7bn. It actually announced a net profit of DM6.8bn for 1989, but DM5.1bn of this was due to a change in accounting methods. Daimler gave no pre-tax figure for last year. Turnover rose by 5 per cent to DM85.5bn. It said it would maintain its dividend at DM12 a share. Mr Edzard Reuter, the chief executive, said in February that Daimler had considered raising its dividend until it became clear last autumn that the dollar's weakness - which especially affects Mercedes-Benz car sales in the US - and worsening economic conditions would hold back profits. Last week, AEG, its electrical and electronics subsidiary, announced a DM205m loss for 1990; Daimler said a further loss was expected this year as a result of restructuring measures.</p>

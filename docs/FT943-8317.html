			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Opposition scents power in Sri Lanka Sri Lanka's political future hung in the balance last night after the general election failed to produce a conclusive victory for the ruling United National party or the People's Alliance, a centre-left opposition coalition. However, there were growing expectations that Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, the opposition's charismatic chief campaigner and prime minister designate, would secure enough support from minority parties to form the next government with a slim majority. Mr D B Wijetunga, the president and UNP party leader, was holding talks with chiefs of different parties on the formation of a new government. But with no party winning an outright majority, the country seemed set for a period of political instability. There were fears that some party workers, frustrated at the lack of a clear verdict at the ballot box, might take to take to the streets in violent protests. A curfew imposed on Tuesday night was set to stay in place until tomorrow. 'This is the worst possible outcome,' said one diplomat. 'There's a big danger of violence and of political uncertainty.' The People's Alliance emerged from the election as the largest parliamentary grouping, with 105 seats out of 225. With its ally, the Sri Lanka Moslem Congress, which won seven seats, and the vote of one independent member, the alliance could secure 113 seats - giving it a bare majority. But last night the UNP, which won 94 seats, had not given up hope of holding on to power. Officials had secured the support of the EPDP, a party representing ethnic Tamils in the north, which has nine seats, and they were trying to win over other minority groupings. Mr Wijetunga said he would form a new cabinet by this morning and pledged to appoint a government which would have the confidence of parliament and to act in accordance with the constitution. The promise was aimed at disarming fears that he might be tempted by party affiliation to favour the UNP. But officials of the People's Alliance were still suspicious of his motives. They said the constitution gave the president wide powers over ministerial appointments. The People's Alliance fought an energetic election campaign under Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the 78-year-old former prime minister, and, especially, Mrs Kumaratunga, her daughter. The alliance capitalised on popular demands for change after 17 years of UNP rule. It accused the government of corruption and of failing to end the civil war with Tamil Tiger separatist guerrillas. The UNP hit back by alleging that Mrs Bandaranaike, a lifelong left-winger, and her allies wish to bring back socialism. Independent groups monitoring the vote said the poll was peaceful and seemed to have been free and fair.</p>

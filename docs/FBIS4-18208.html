			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Summary" of an interview with Alain Juppe, French minister </F> of foreign affairs, by YOMIURI SHIMBUN's Shin Sato in Paris on  28 March]    [Text] Paris, 28 Mar -- The following is a summary of  remarks made by French Foreign Minister Juppe during an  interview with YOMIURI SHIMBUN:  <H5>  UN Security Council Reform </H5>   Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is scheduled to visit  France  in early May. We are also looking forward to a visit by His  Majesty, the Emperor.    I would like to touch on the reform of the UN Security  Council in particular, since this is also related to the  political dialogue between Japan and France. As the 20th  century draws to an end, the expansion of the UN Security  Council has become imperative. We would also welcome a greater  number of permanent members. I think granting both Germany and  Japan permanent memberships would be the natural thing to do.  We are not in favor of creating new permanent memberships under  a new framework. It would be fine to have permanent members  which possess all the rights and duties, and those which do not.  <H5>  North Korea's Suspected Development of Nuclear Arms </H5>   France is seriously concerned about the DPRK (North Korean)  attitude of not respecting the International Atomic Energy  Agency's (IAEA) official duties. This is a threat to regional  stability and international security. IAEA should be able to  inspect all nuclear facilities freely, regardless of whether  they have been formally declared [by the DPRK]. We have stated  this point many times. North Korea's attitude is unacceptable.  If Pyongyang continues to refuse inspections, the UN Security  Council has to place the issue of sanctions on its agenda.  <H5>  Trade Issues </H5>   The creation of the World Trade Organization must bring  about  a more impartial order in international trade. Japan has a  significant role to play in the achievement of this goal. The  important thing is to eliminate all basis for such customary  practices as using weapons such as the "Super 301 Provision" to  threaten a trading partner and draw unilateral concessions, or  for the principle of might is right. At the same time, it would  be desirable for Japan to clearly indicate its intention to open  its market to various nations through resolute promotion of  deregulation and market liberalization measures.  <H5>  The European Union (EU) and Japan </H5>   The monitoring quota for Japanese car exports to the EU is  completely within the framework of GATT. EU also hopes for more  procurement of auto parts from Japan. For this reason, we are  watching with great interest negotiations between Japan and the  United States in this sector. If Japan succumbs to threats and  grants unilateral preferential treatment to U.S. companies, this  will close Japan's door to European companies which are  similarly highly competitive. That will be unacceptable for  France.  <H5>  Cooperation Between Japan and France </H5>   Many issues need to be discussed in Tokyo. There are  regional issues for which our two countries need to coordinate  our actions, such as Indochina, Africa, and Algeria. There will  be an international conference on AIDS in Yokohama this summer,  and in Paris this fall. It might be good to consider joint  action by France and Japan.</p>

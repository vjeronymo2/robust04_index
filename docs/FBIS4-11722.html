			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Pursuing nuclear nonproliferation"] </F>   [Text] The United States has now, reportedly, sought to  expand the framework of the proposed five-nation conference on  nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia. The proposal envisages  India, Pakistan, China, Russia, and the United States together  working out a formula for a nuclear-free South Asia. India,  however, has been reluctant to participate in any such  conference on the grounds that it is not prepared to limit  consideration of nonproliferation strategies aimed only at South  Asia. It has recently reiterated this position during the  course of a visit by the US assistant secretary of state for  South Asia. India's contention is that in the presence of a  nuclear-armed China it is not possible for it to consider  capping its nuclear programme.    Now the US proposal to expand the framework to include  Britain, France, Japan and the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) could be seen as a way of bringing more pressure  to bear upon the two sides to work out some kind of an  acceptable arrangement. The current US emphasis does not appear  to be on absolute nuclear disarmament. The effort is now  directed at getting the two sides, at least in the initial  stage, to freeze their existing arsenals at current levels. The  objective of a roll-back would be pursued at a later stage. As  a part of this graduated approach, also, Pakistan has repeatedly  signalled its willingness to undertake the necessary  nonproliferation measures in tandem with a similar policy on the  part of India. The latter has, however, continued to invoke the  argument of a nuclear China as well as the need to discuss any  such measures not by reference just to South Asia but in a much  broader, global, context. In a sense, this proposal by  including among the participants all the permanent members of  the Security Council, as well as Japan and the IAEA does meet  India's demands for a broader context for discussing the issue  of nonproliferation. But how much help this will be in getting  India to make any meaningful change in its rigid position on the  issue remains to be seen. In any such context Pakistan could  also find itself being subjected to increasing pressure by  powerful global and regional actors. It is important,  therefore, for Pakistan's policy-makers to identify its policy  options carefully in this regard, beyond the understandable  linkage with India's nuclear programme that it has continued to  emphasise. There appears to be a heightened US interest in  Pakistan's nuclear programme as demonstrated by its recent offer  to allow the sale of 38 F-16s that Pakistan has already paid for  in exchange for a verifiable capping of its nuclear programme.  The upcoming visit by the US deputy secretary of state is also  in the same context. While there appears to be general  consensus in Pakistan on rejecting this offer it is interesting  that it has been opposed also by Senator Pressler as well as  Indian policy-makers, perhaps as a result of the apprehension  that it will leave Pakistan with the ability to assemble a  limited number of nuclear devices in short order while  augmenting the ability of its air force, not least in the  department of nuclear weapons delivery, in considerable measure.  In any case Pakistan, while remaining mindful of its own  security interest and the options available, should welcome the  proposals to discuss the various aspects of the nonproliferation  issue in a broader framework. Among other things, it should  help in subjecting India's case for a voiding any meaningful  response to Pakistan's various initiatives for a nuclear-free  South Asia to a thorough review by the international community.</p>

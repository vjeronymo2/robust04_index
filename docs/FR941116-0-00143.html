The actual yield for ELS cotton shall be computed by dividing the total production by the total acreage harvested for lint, rounded to the nearest pound. Such acreage is the planted acreage, unless a smaller acreage is reported as harvested. If the total of such planted acreage is not harvested by the producer, the actual yield for such acreage shall be zero.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) If the planted acreage of ELS cotton on the farm is significantly less than the normal planting on the farm and the county committee determines that the reduction in planted acreage caused the ELS cotton yield on the farm to be unreasonably high, then the county committee may reduce the yield for the crop.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1413.37  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Submitting ELS cotton production evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Production evidence for ELS cotton shall be submitted according to &sect;1413.19 by a final date:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Established by the State ASC Committee,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Which shall be no later than April 1 of the crop year following the current crop year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Production evidence for ELS cotton shall be certified on either form ASCS&hyph;658&hyph;1, Certification of Deliveries to Handlers, or form ASCS&hyph;503, Identification of Cotton Production, at the option of the county committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart G_Program Options for Program Crops <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1413.41  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> 0/85/92 provisions for wheat and feed grains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 0/85.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If an ARP is in effect for the 1994 and 1995 crops of wheat and feed grains and producers file form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CCC&hyph;477, Intention to Participate in the Price Support and Production Adjustment Programs, for such a crop with the county ASCS office and such producers devote a portion of the maximum payment acres for wheat and feed grains equal to more than 15 percent of such acreage to conservation uses; such producers shall be eligible to receive deficiency payments on such portion of the maximum payment acres in excess of 15 percent of such acreage devoted to conservation uses at a per bushel rate that will be established by the Secretary, except that the rate may not be established at less than the projected deficiency payment rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exceptions to 0/85.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) In the case of each of the 1994 and 1995 crops of wheat and feed grains, producers on a farm shall be eligible to receive deficiency payments for such crops not to exceed 92 percent of the maximum payment acreage, if an ARP is in effect for the crops, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Producers have been determined to be prevented from planting the crop, or have a reduced yield of a program crop on a farm because of a natural disaster, and such producers elect to designate such prevented planted or reduced yield acreage as CU for payment for such crop and devote more than 8 percent of the wheat or feed grains acreage to CU for payment; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Producers elect to devote a portion of the maximum payment acres for wheat and feed grains in excess of 8 percent of such maximum payment acres to minor oilseeds and IOC's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If producers elect to devote a portion of the maximum payment acres for wheat and feed grains in excess of 8 percent of the maximum payment acres to a combination of minor oilseeds, IOC's, and CU for payment, a weighted average amount of between 8 percent and 15 percent of the maximum payment acres shall be determined by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Multiplying 92 percent times the minor oilseed and IOC acreage divided by the total of the minor oilseed, IOC, and CU for payment acreage; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Sweden unveils banking crisis plan THE Swedish government yesterday promised unlimited financial assistance to its crisis-stricken banking sector as a long-expected package of support measures was finally unveiled. 'All obligations will be met, regardless of the final amount,' said Mr Bo Lundgren, tax minister, although he indicated that tough conditions would be attached to any assistance to minimise the cost to the state. The support, generally in the form of loans and guarantees, will be administered through a special authority. The government has made it clear that the last thing it wants is for the state to end up owning the banks or state-affiliated credit institutions which are covered by the scope of its proposals. The government will force the 'viable institutions' which request help to repay any aid once when they recover their financial strength. However, in cases involving reconstruction or winding-up, it accepts it may lose money. Credit losses in the Swedish financial sector amounted to SKr100bn (Pounds 11bn) in 1990-92, and many experts expect at least as much again to be lost in the next few years.</p>

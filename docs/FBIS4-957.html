			<p>BFN     [Text] The minister of defense, Alhaji Mahama Idrissu,  today assured Ghanaians of the safety of Ghanaian troops serving  with the UN force in Rwanda. He was speaking in an interview  with the GBC [Ghana Broadcasting Corporation] on the changing  situation in the Rwandan crisis:    [Begin recording] [Idrissu] [Words indistinct] generally  worried about the wounded soldier, but what I would like to tell  you is that, I mean, that was accidental. It was not a firing  at our troops which caused this injury. It was purely  accidental. He was hit by a stray bullet.    [Unidentified correspondent] Many people would think that  Ghana should be getting ready to withdraw our contingent from  Rwanda. This is because other foreign troops, especially  Belgium, is reported to have withdrawn completely. Why are we  still in Rwanda? Are there steps to get our troops withdrawn  and if not, why?    [Idrissu] Quite honestly, I don't know the circumstances  under which the Belgians withdrew, and we are there under UN  auspices, and I don't think we will be taking a unilateral  decision to pull out. We have faith in the Organization of the  UN, and we hope that the interest of our troops would be  paramount and they would be protected.    [Correspondent] What would you say is the exact situation of  our troops in the city, especially as it is reported to have  been encircled?    [Idrissu] Well, right now our troops are in Kigali. They  are around the airport area and most of the key places. But let  me assure you that all our troops, with the exception of this  one injured soldier, are healthy. They are all in good health.  They are not under any attack. So we don't have any fears  about their present situation.    [Correspondent] The situation in Kigali (?also looks) like  the peacekeeping role of the UN: It is not working. It is not  likely that our troops may end up fighting in self-defense, and  if that happens, are they well equipped to handle such a  situation?    [Idrissu] Well, that is a little bit difficult for me, but  we rely on the judgment of the force commander of the UN and the  secretary general's representative in the area to take good  decisions so that we are not engulfed in any such situation.

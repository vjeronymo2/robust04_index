			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (9): Euro-flights may be spokes from a hub  -The airport JUST BEFORE seven o'clock on the morning of April 8, a Jetstream 31, of Manx Airways, took off from Cardiff-Wales airport, at Rhoose, 15 miles west of the capital, with a full payload of 16 passengers. One hundred minutes later, it touched down in Brussels, and a dream nurtured for years within the Welsh business community had become reality. Capt Norman Brewitt, the airline's chief pilot, who was at the controls, had helped to introduce a service much needed in Cardiff - a direct link between the Welsh capital and the de facto, if not de jure, capital of the European Community. Four hours after the Brussels flight, another Manx aircraft, a JE 103, took off for Dusseldorf. The two flights represented a double first: the first time Cardiff had been linked directly to these European cities, and the first time Manx had run a continental service. Mr Terry Liddiard, managing director of Manx, says the company wants to create a hub of services from Cardiff: 'There is enormous potential in South Wales, and we see it as a major centre for our services. We hope to bring in a twice-daily Paris flight later this year, and introduce another service to Manchester in the autumn.' Manx already operates services from Cardiff to the Isle of Man (its home base), Glasgow, the Channel Islands, Dublin and Belfast. Cardiff is not without international flights. Air France introduced a Paris service last year; and KLM, through one of its subsidiaries, has for some years operated one to Amsterdam. The latter, like the Brussels flights, provides a connecting point for passengers who want to fly on to other destinations without having to use Heathrow or Gatwick. There have been a number of attempts to bring intercontinental carriers into the Welsh capital, but this has proved a difficult business to generate. Airlines providing flights to Toronto, Florida and the Caribbean have come and gone, to the dismay of the airport's director, Mr Graham Greaves. These carriers have either been absorbed by bigger partners, or fallen into financial difficulties. But Mr Greaves promises: 'We shall have Toronto, and Orlando in Florida, on the schedules this year - Toronto for the first time direct.' Nationair, the Canadian airline, will serve Toronto with a Boeing 757, and the UK carrier Monarch is also using a 757 on its North American operations. The core of Mr Greaves' strategy, though, is to develop Cardiff as a business centre for European destinations. 'We must try and generate more scheduled flights,' he says. 'This is where our destiny lies.' Businessmen in South Wales have for years bemoaned the lack of direct links with European centres. Since Cardiff is one of the UK's three main centres of government, they believe that Brussels, in particular, should be a big earner, especially as civil servants need to travel there for meetings. But the South Wales business community is not large, and it will need to use the airport to the full if Manx's enterprise is to be justified. The omens are not overwhelmingly favourable, however, despite the cries for such a link. Air France, for instance, has not had great success with its Paris service, launched last year, though this may have something to do with the less-than-convenient time-slot. Like most regional airports in Britain, Cardiff, until last year one of the fastest-growing, must therefore continue to rely heavily on its charter traffic for its immediate profitability. 'About 85 per cent of all our traffic is in the charter business,' says Mr Greaves. 'That, inevitably, peaks between June and September; and so, to utilise the airport's facilities more sensibly, we need to flatten that peak by attracting out-of-season business.' But Cardiff, again like other regional airports, has been hit by the recession and the Gulf war. It also faces competition from Bristol which, with a catchment area of some 4m people, compared with Cardiff's 2.5m, is in a healthier position to attract holidaymakers bound for Spain, Greece and the ski slopes. Mr Greaves takes encouragement from what he detects as a change in holiday patterns. 'Holidaymakers are looking to go further afield. They are looking to the Caribbean and Florida, and this is where Cardiff has a distinct edge. We have the second-best weather conditions of any British airport.' He also considers that Cardiff's runway, extended four years ago, provides advantages. 'Our 7,723ft runway can handle all the big giants - including Concorde.' Two years ago, a British Airways jumbo flew non-stop from Cardiff to Seattle on America's west coast, with a full payload. And this winter some 30 aircraft landed at Cardiff on diversions from Heathrow and Gatwick. In the summer, Concorde will take a party of Americans, holidaying in Europe, back home from Cardiff. When British Airways opens its giant maintenance plant alongside the airport, five jumbos a month will be flown into the airport, to be handled in the hangar - a welcome boost in landing fees. Those fees helped to increase profitability to a record Pounds 1.9m in 1989-90, the last year for which figures are available. The figures will tumble for the year just ended, given the difficult time experienced by airlines and airports around the world. But the Pounds 12m capital-spending programme is going ahead. Work begins this summer on a lounge for international passengers, and better Customs facilities will be provided. These should be ready by the end of next year.</p>

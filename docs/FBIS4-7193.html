			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- New Justice Minister  Shigeto Nagano of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is a former  chief of staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF). He  replaced Akira Mikazuki, a distinguished academic, as justice  minister.    Nagano, 71, graduated from the former elite Japanese  Military  Academy and assumed the post of first lieutenant in the Japanese  Imperial Army in 1945 when World War II ended.    He entered the police reserve force in 1951, which was  upgraded to the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) in 1954. Before  retiring from the GSDF in 1980, he was promoted to the top  uniform rank.    Nagano won his first seat in the House of Councillors in the  1986 election for which he had run as a candidate of the then  ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). He is now serving as an  upper house member for the second six-year term.    In June 1993, he joined other LDP defectors to set up  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), which two months later formed  the coalition government with six other non-LDP parties.    Nagano comes from Oita Prefecture on Kyushu Island in  western  Japan.</p>

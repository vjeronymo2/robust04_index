			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: China seen pushing copper market into supply deficit China's huge appetite for copper would help the market in the western world move to a supply shortage this year after two years of surpluses, according to Mr Richard Osborne, chairman of Asarco, the US metals group. He said yesterday that, although government measures to control inflation in China were forecast to cut the annual growth in its copper consumption from an average of 12.5 per cent since 1989 to 3 per cent this year, the republic's imports of the metal would grow by twice that rate, from 330,000 short tons (2,000lb each) last year to 350,000 tons. Meanwhile, Asarco predicted exports to the west by Poland would rise from 281,000 tons to 295,000 tons but Russian exports were likely to slip from 325,000 to 281,000 tons. This would give a modest fall in net imports to the west, from 269,000 to 262,000 tons. Asarco expected copper consumption outside the former eastern bloc countries to grow by nearly 3 per cent in 1994, from just over 10m tons last year to 10.36m tons, while production of refined copper was predicted to go up by only 0.6 per cent, from 9.94m to 10m tons. This would leave a supply deficit of 61,000 tons compared with surpluses of 140,000 tons last year and 35,000 tons in 1992. Mr Osborne, at a meeting with investment managers and analysts in London, predicted copper stocks in the west, at present equivalent to seven weeks consumption, would start coming down towards the five weeks with which the industry was comfortable. Dealing with other some metals, Mr Osborne forecast that the lead market would also move to a supply deficit this year - one of 20,000 tons - after surpluses of 131,000 tons in 1993 and 168,000 tons in 1992. On the other hand, the zinc market was forecast to show a surplus for the fifth consecutive year: one of 124,000 tons against 460,000 tons in 1993 and 450,000 tons in 1992. Mr Osborne pointed out that demand for silver had outpaced supply for the past five years and suggested that the excess stocks built up in the 1980s would be eliminated in two years. Asarco would not re-open its three silver mines until there was a long-term silver price of Dollars 7 a troy ounce. 'The odds on that happening are improving each month. Perhaps we will see that before the decade is out.'</p>

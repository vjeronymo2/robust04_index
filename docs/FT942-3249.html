			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian winter crop plantings expected to rise by 6% Despite the recent lack of rain, Australian farmers are expected to increase total winter crop planting by about 6 per cent, to 16.7m hectares. However, rising wool prices and the reduction in sheep numbers in recent years are likely to slow the switch into cropping and the expansion of grain-growing areas after this season. The forecast was made by the government-owned Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics yesterday. It also reported that there has been a late start to the current cropping season but said that recent rains had improved the situation in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria. It noted that there was an continuing problem in Queensland - parts of which are suffering from severe drought - and parts of New South Wales. Crops most at risk from the late start, it suggested, were chickpeas, canola and lupins. Abare said it expected the total wheat area to increase to about 10.2m ha, compared with 9.5m last season. This assumes that the area sown to wheat in Queensland increases by over 70 per cent to about 1m hectares. The bureau admitted, however, that 'good follow-up rains will be required before this forecast can be realised'. It added that, with the 1993-94 cotton harvest almost completed, it expected lint production to fall by some 17 per cent to 311,000 tonnes because of 'dry conditions and irrigation water shortages during the growing season.</p>

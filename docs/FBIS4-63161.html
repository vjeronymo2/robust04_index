			<p>BFN     [Text] The Georgian Army has not as yet been ordered to  withdraw its troops from the line of conflict with the Abkhazian  formations along the Inguri River in order to create a security  zone. This was announced to INTERFAX by Georgian Defense  Minister Lieutenant-General Varden Nadibaidze today.    The Georgian-Abkhazian agreement signed in Moscow on 14 May  says that international observers and a CIS peace-keeping  contingent mostly composed from the Russian forces will come to  this security zone after the conflicting parties withdraw their  troops 12 km away from the Inguri River. There will be 2,500 or  3,000 servicemen in the CIS peace-keeping forces.    Nadibaidze stated that the Georgian Army would carry out all  orders received from the commander-in-chief and Georgian leader  Eduard Shevardnadze.    However, Chief of the Russian Transcaucasian Troops Group  press center, Colonel Gennadiy Dolgachev, said in an interview  with INTERFAX that the peace-keeping contingent was likely to be  formed from the Russian Transcaucasian troops.</p>

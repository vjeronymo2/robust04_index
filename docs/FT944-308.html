			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: Shake-up likely at UK travel group First Choice Holidays, the UK travel group, is in talks with German bank Westdeutsche Landesbank, which has an indirect stake, that could lead to boardroom changes. Among options under consideration are the resignation from the First Choice board of Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook, which has a 21 per cent stake in First Choice. He would be replaced by a director from WestLB, which owns 90 per cent of Thomas Cook. Mr Francis Baron, First Choice chief executive, has made no secret of his desire to strengthen links with WestLB. The latest talks on boardroom changes are seen as a means of developing the liaison. Thomas Cook bought the stake in First Choice last year, helping it to fight a hostile takeover bid from Airtours, a rival tour operator. First Choice, known as Owners Abroad until August this year, had hoped the link with Thomas Cook would enable it to make substantial savings through co-operation with LTU, the German travel company 34 per cent-owned by WestLB. By October, however, relations with the German bank had been soured by a succession of cancelled strategy meetings and the failure of planned joint projects. Few of the expected benefits of the link between First Choice and LTU had been realised. It is understood that the 'strategic alliance' has failed to win cost savings through shared aircraft maintenance, fuel buying and spares purchasing. Further, it has failed to give First Choice greater muscle in booking holiday accommodation. The part of the link which has so far proved successful is with the retail side of Thomas Cook, which has delivered a significant amount of business. However, some industry observers have said the link has hampered First Choice's efforts to sell holidays through other agents.</p>

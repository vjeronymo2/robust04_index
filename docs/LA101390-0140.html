			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OCTOBER GARDENING SPECIFICS . . .  </P> <P> October is the beginning of our longest growing season and the most important  time to plant for flower color now and through the spring. This time is known  as the "cool season."  </P> <P> Get ready to plant "cool season" annuals, "showy perennials" and spring  blooming bulbs. Watch for these annuals as they become available at your local  nursery: calendula; candytuft; chrysanthemum (the small bedding type);  dianthus; English daisy; Iceland poppies; larkspur; nemesia; ornamental  cabbage, kale; pansies; primrose, English; schizanthus; snapdragons stock, and  sweet pea. For shade planting, watch for primrose obconica and primrose  malicoides.  </P> <P> Many varieties of "showy perennials" will be available in 4-inch pots. Plant  these perennials (and biennials) for a jump start on permanent color in your  garden: Canterbury bells; coreopsis; cyclamen (for shade); delphinium; dusty  miller; foxglove; hollyhock; nicotiana; rehmannia; salvias and Shasta daisy.  </P> <P> For the best selection, buy bulbs now and store them in paper bags in a cool,  dry location until planting time. For added insurance when growing bulbs, hold  off on planting until November, when the soil and air temperature cools off.  </P> <P> Tulips and hyacinths need to be placed in a refrigerator after Oct. 15 and  chilled for six weeks. Plant these bulbs immediately after taking them out of  cold storage.  </P> <P> Source: Cristin Fusano, Color Specialist/Horticulturist, Sherman Library and  Gardens  </P> <P> . . . AND GENERAL OCTOBER CARE TIPS  </P> <P> De-thatch or aerate your lawn to prevent disease and pests during the winter.  </P> <P> Prepare rhododendrons and azaleas for winter by mulching heavily around their  base with 2 to 3 inches of mulch.  </P> <P> When planting bulbs, be generous with the bone meal. Place some at the bottom  of the planting hole, add a little dirt and then the bulb so the bulb doesn't  touch the bone meal.  </P> <P> If you're thinking of planting ground cover, plant it soon. If you do it now,  the root system will become established before spring arrives and growth  accelerates.  </P> <P> Thin camellia buds now for bigger and better blooms later.  </P> <P> For beautiful red and orange color in the fall, plant a pomegranate tree or  shrub.  </P> <P> To give your yard a fresh, new look, uproot plants that have overgrown their  space.  </P> <P> Tend to your roses by removing dead wood, twiggy growth and leaves with spots  or mildew. But don't prune them now.  </P> <P> Before you plant perennials or annuals, prepare the planting bed well: Dig down  18 inches and work in organic matter.  </P> <P> For a "berry" good holiday season, plant berried shrubs for garden color and  holiday decorations.  </P> <P> Keep fallen leaves raked off the lawn and out of flower beds. Certain pests  love to set up house under them.  </P> <P> A good choice for cool-season color is the bird of paradise.  </P> <P> Stop feeding garden roses now because they are heading into their dormant  period.  </P> <P> For more annual color during winter, check out fairy primroses, stock and  snapdragons.  </P> <P> Source: California Assn. of Nurserymen.  </P></p>

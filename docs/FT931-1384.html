			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Brussels explains trade plan for Moscow: Free trade zone plan seen by the Twelve as a 'political signal' of support for the reform programme THE European Commission confirmed yesterday it is seeking an enlarged mandate for its 'partnership' negotiations with Russia, and that the aim is eventually to create a free trade agreement with the former Soviet republic. The Commission will ask EC foreign ministers to endorse the free trade mandate on April 5 in Luxembourg. But a delegation of Community foreign ministers and commissioners is expected to raise the new terms of negotiation with the embattled government of President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow this weekend. The hope is to conclude an agreement with Russia in time for the Copenhagen summit of EC heads of government on June 21-22. Following yesterday's Commission meeting, Mr Hans van den Broek, EC external affairs commissioner, confirmed that the 'eventual' aim of the agreement was a free trade zone with Russia, 'provided political and economic circumstances allow it'. 'Any solution to the (Russian) crisis will not, obviously, depend on our negotiation,' Mr Van den Broek said. 'But the political signal' from the EC, he added, 'is very clear.' Senior officials say nobody is under any illusions about the gargantuan task of reaching a free trade arrangement with the former command economy, when the fate of Russia's economic reforms, and its future commitment to them, hang on the outcome of the power struggle in Moscow. But the Commission said it 'believes that by expressing a willingness to go beyond traditional trade and co-operation and eventually achieve free trade with Russia, the Community would be sending an important signal to Moscow that it fully supports the reform process'. Mr Yeltsin expressly asked for the negotiations to encompass free trade, to give Russia the same sort of access to EC markets promised to Hungary, Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics, Bulgaria and Romania. The main difference between what the Commission wants for Russia and what has been negotiated with the east and central Europeans is that the drive towards a free trade zone with the latter is linked to their eventual membership of the Community. This is not on offer to Russia - or other former Soviet republics to which free trade arrangements might also be extended. But the terms of trade Russia might get, according to confidential Commission documents, could theoretically be more favourable than for the east Europeans, who have been frustrated by EC barriers to their most competitive produce, like steel, textiles and food. The 'safeguard clause' the Commission envisages against any flood of competitive Russian goods spells out that it 'will only be invoked in the event of a serious injury, or a threat of a serious injury to domestic (EC) producers of like or direct competitive products'. The word 'serious' is underlined in the text, and some commissioners yesterday underlined their concern about its potentially broad sweep. Officials said they had wanted to defer deciding on the proposal until next week, to allow further examination of the safeguard clause, and were angered that aspects of the plan had been reported in yesterday's Financial Times.</p>

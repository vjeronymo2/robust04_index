			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Patten rules out return of O-level SPECULATION that the government might reintroduce the O-level examination following the GCSE standards controversy has been dispelled by Mr John Patten, the education secretary. Mr Patten said his aim was to improve the present system rather than abolish it. His remarks follow the furore surrounding a report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate which suggested that standards may have been slipping since the GCSE replaced O-levels and CSEs in 1988. The report prompted Mr Patten to demand an investigation by the independent examination boards and raised the hopes of educational traditionalists and rightwing Tories that the single examination might be scrapped. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Patten rejected criticism from the Labour party and teachers' unions that he had used the report to undermine confidence in the GCSE. He expected the boards, which will be holding a joint meeting later this month, to respond swiftly to the 'serious criticisms' of the inspectors. But he added that he had been surprised by the report and had no intention of using it as a cover to promote a further shake-up. Mr Patten emphasised that the criticisms had not been directed at pupils or teachers but at the boards responsible for setting and marking the examinations. He said the aim was to improve the present all-ability test rather than seek a return to O-levels and added: 'I certainly hope that we can make a single examination work.' It is understood this view is shared by Mr John Major, the prime minister, a keen supporter of an examination for 15 and 16-year-olds which recognises achievement at all levels.

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (10): Cross-border trade quickens - David Dodwell finds there is a growing concentration of export activity in British industry and a strong foreign presence, according to the Financial Times' latest survey of leading UK exporters / Comment A TOTAL of 41 of the UK's Top 100 exporters are foreign owned, with 26 belonging to US parents, according to the Financial Times' latest survey of leading exporters. The survey also points to an increasing concentration of exporting activity in UK industry, with the Top 100 accounting for about 47 per cent of all exports in 1992 - up from 43 per cent in 1991. It is perhaps no accident that the British government has campaigned hard this year to draw more small and medium-sized companies into cross border trade. While British Aerospace lengthened its lead as the country's leading exporter, the main shake-up last year in the top 10 resulted from ICI hiving off Zeneca, its former bioscience subsidiary. This led to ICI slipping from second to seventh place. But at the same time, Zeneca entered the Top 100 for the first time in 10th place. BP jumped from fourth to second place, on the back of a 52 per cent rise in exports, while a 21 per cent jump by Shell lifted it into third place. Ford slipped down to fourth position after its exports slumped by 19 per cent. It is notable that the top 10 accounted for exports worth Pounds 25.4bn, or more than 23 per cent of the UK's total Pounds 108.3bn exports in 1992. More than seven out of every 10 exporters saw an improvement in exports. This was a sharp improvement from 1991, when seven of the top 10 reported a fall in overseas sales, and illustrates the early signs of British industry's emergence from recession. The performance was largely unaffected by sterling's devaluation against most European currencies in September last year. The effects of devaluation will only have become apparent during 1993. For those in the UK who share US President Clinton's concern over 'jobless growth', the survey shows that job losses continued even as exports recovered. A surprising 79 of the Top 100 exporters cut their workforce last year. Only two companies added significantly to their labour force: BTR did so because of its takeover of Hawker Siddeley late in 1991, and Nissan also created more jobs as it moved to full production at its new car plant in Swindon. After entering the Top 100 in 14th place in 1991, Nissan edged up to 13th place in 1992, hoisting exports by 33.7 per cent to Pounds 911m. Vauxhall, which also leapt into the Top 100 in 16th place for the first time in 1991, edged up one place on the back of a more modest 21.6 per cent gain to Pounds 754m. While Nissan can expect to announce further gains for 1993 as its Swindon plant has come into full production, Vauxhall is unlikely to have maintained its growth, as Europe's car market has floundered this year. Another insight arising from the data is that Vauxhall imports significantly more into the UK than it exports. In spite of being the country's 15th most important exporter in gross terms, it is in net terms a massive importer. Imports amounting to almost Pounds 1.5bn in cars and components make it a net importer to the tune of Pounds 736m. Vauxhall is far from alone in this. Many companies fail to provide relevant data, but among those that do, British Steel's imports of Pounds 790m trimmed its net exports to Pounds 649m, while Unilever's Pounds 834m import bill makes it a net importer of goods worth Pounds 177m, and Conoco becomes a net importer of goods worth Pounds 311m after imports of Pounds 736m are deducted from its exports. Significant increases in exports were recorded by Esso (up 23 per cent), SmithKline Beecham (33 per cent), Compaq (28 per cent), Thorn EMI (30 per cent), and Vickers (35 per cent). Four companies leapt into the Top 100 for the first time: Jaguar, revealing separate figures for the first time, entered in 23rd position with exports of Pounds 506m; FG Wilson, the Northern Ireland-based general engineering group, was lifted to 83nd position by its 43 per cent jump in exports to Pounds 117m; Amerada Hess, the US controlled oils group, more than doubled exports to Pounds 97m to enter in 94rd position; and Robert Bosch, the German engineer squeezed into 98th position after doubling exports to Pounds 93m. The main casualties between 1991 and 1992 were the conglomerate Trafalgar House, whose 19.5 per cent export decline to Pounds 640m pushed it from 12th to 20th position; Inco, the Canadian-owned metals group which slipped 17 places to 39th after exports fell 21 per cent to Pounds 318m; British Nuclear Fuels, which tumbled 28 places to 66th after exports fell 30 per cent to Pounds 186m; and the aerospace group Westland, which fell 25 places to 77th as exports slipped by Pounds 35 per cent to Pounds 139m. There were few clear sectoral trends. Food manufacturers, brewers and health and household groups were the most consistent in reporting a rise in exports between 1991 and 1992, but only SmithKline Beecham and Nestle saw strong gains (They were up 33 per cent and 18 per cent respectively). The building materials sector, which included Pilkington, saw consistent falls in exports, while those companies defined by the Financial Times as conglomerates - Tenneco, Hanson, and Trafalgar House - also suffered, though not for any apparently linked reason. In spite of their leading role as exporters, only a minority of the Top 100 were heavily dependent on exports. Just 36 exported more than half of their turnover, while only 14 exported more than three quarters. Most export dependent were FG Wilson (exporting 90 per cent); Caterpillar (88 per cent); Nissan (86 per cent); Zeneca (82 per cent); and Polaroid (81 per cent).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    BREAKDOWN BY INDUSTRIAL SECTOR  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Industrial sector          No. of   Exports 1992  Exports 1991  % change                               Cos     Pounds m      Pounds m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Oils                           8       9424.7        7855.2       20.0 Eng'ing Aerospace              5       8506.9        8670.7       -1.9 Motors                        14       6660.9        6736.2       -1.1 Electronics                    7       5554.8        5440.6        2.1 Chemicals                     11       4362.3        4257.1        2.5 Health &amp; Household             9       4001.6        3616.0       10.7 Metals                         5       2980.8        3088.1       -3.5 Brewers/Distillers             4       1964.2        1757.0       11.8 General Engineering            9       1348.0        1165.6       15.6 Conglomerates                  3       1139.3        1364.6      -16.5 Food Manufacturing             4       1103.4         999.7       10.3 Miscellaneous                  4       1026.6        1061.6       -3.3 Construction Equip             3        893.4         870.8        2.6 Electricals                    2        391.0         353.0       10.8 Hotels &amp; Leisure               1        322.0         248.0       29.8 Other Ind Materials            3        304.5         304.9       -0.1 Paper/Pack/Printing            2        258.9         211.6       22.4 Textiles                       2        250.6         244.2        2.6 Retailing                      1        232.2         206.0       12.7 Media                          1        188.6         184.2        2.4 Stores                         1        124.3         102.2       21.6 Building Materials             1        103.5         109.8       -5.7 Total                        100      51142.5       48847.2        4.7  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F> Serbian Krajina, by Petko Koprivica on 21 February; place not  given -- recorded]    [Koprivica] Mr. President, what was the reaction in the  republic of Serbian Krajina to the decision that NATO forces  have, for the time being, given up the announced air strikes on  the positions of the Srpska republic army around Sarajevo?    [Martic] I would say that a great political wisdom was shown  here, particularly by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and  certainly by Dr. Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska  republic. In a very positive way, NATO forces found themselves  in a situation in which the unpopular idea of bombing was simply  avoided.    I also have to say that all of us here were somewhat  positively surprised by Russia's diplomacy, but when one  observes the entire picture, we must say that this was the last  bandwagon Russia jumped on; it came to grips with other  diplomatic circles in the world.</p>

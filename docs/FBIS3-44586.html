			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taipei, Jan 6 (AFP)--Taiwan and China have agreed  to hold high-level talks in Beijing at the end of this month,  following three rounds of unsuccessful negotiations to resolve  disputes, a spokesman said Thursday.    Shih Chi-ping, spokesman of the semi-official Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF), said: "Our vice chairman, Chiao  Jen-ho, will have a five-day meeting with his mainland  counterpart Tang Shubei in Beijing beginning January 31 to  discuss the operation of our two organizations and other issues."    But Shih emphasized that the meeting was not intended to  discuss disputes directly and would not address the thorny issue  of repatriating Chinese hijackers to the mainland. The  hijacking issue and fishing disputes were major obstacles to the  successful conclusion of three previous rounds of talks between  SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and his mainland counterpart,  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS)  chairman Wang Daohan. The talks were bogged down on  jurisdiction and sovereignty issues. The upcoming meeting is  intended only to discuss the operations between the SEF and  ARATS, Shih said.    But the spokesman said: "Mr. Chiao and Tang may exchange  opinions on the hijackings and other general issues, which can  help pave the way for the fourth round of talks in the future."    SEF officials said Chiao was expected to ask Tang to set  aside sensitive political issues to facilitate progress in the  next round of talks. He will also try to talk Tang into  agreeing that each side had its own jurisdiction right in  handling various cases, they added.    The spate of hijackings -- 10 occurred in 1993 -- have  emerged as a new source of friction between Beijing and Taipei,  rivals since the communist government swept to power on the  mainland in 1949 following a civil war and forced it nationalist  opposition to Taiwan. Taiwan maintains that it has the  jurisdiction to try and imprison hijackers, but China refuses to  recognize such a right and insists that they must be repatriated.    SEF and ARATS were set up in 1990 as nominally private  bodies  to get around Taiwan's 44-year-old policy of no direct contact  with Beijing. The chairmen of the two agencies held the  first-ever talks in Singapore in April to find ways to improve  cross strait ties and resolve certain disputes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 25 KYODO -- A senior Russian official  on Monday [25 April] lauded Japan's new prime minister-to-be  Tsutomu Hata for his past contributions to improving bilateral  ties.    "Mr. Hata contributed to a smooth development of the  Russia-Japan relationship," said Nikolay Solovyov, director of  the Russian Foreign Ministry's Asia-Pacific Department.    Hata is expected to be elected Japan's new prime minister  later in the day following the resignation of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's cabinet.    Hata visited Russia in March as foreign minister, and  assured  Russian leaders of Japan's continued support for reforms.    Solovyov, a former Russian ambassador to Tokyo, also called  for progress in bilateral relations to solve "the issue that is  difficult to reach an agreement on," -- an apparent reference to  the thorny territorial question.    The dispute over a group of Russian-held islands off  Hokkaido, which Japan claims are part of its territory, has kept  the bilateral relations in a chill since the end of World War II.</p>

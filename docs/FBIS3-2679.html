The tasks were spelled out by Chen Jinhua, minister in  charge  of the State Planning Commission, in a report he delivered to  the annual session of the National People's Congress [NPC] on  the implementation of the 1993 plan for national economic and  social development and on a similar draft plan for 1994.    In his report, Chen stressed the need to make full use of  the  favorable international climate to further expand foreign trade  and economic and technological exchanges.    In the area of foreign trade, he said, "through the  restructuring of the foreign trade and foreign exchange systems,  we shall promote an increase in exports and allow a reasonable  flow of imports to achieve a balance between foreign exchange  revenues and expenditures for the year."    Chen Jinhua spelled out the following policies to attain  that  goal:    -- As China's export strategy, it is necessary to  unswervingly increase the number and types of markets, succeed  by putting quality first, and open up new markets while  maintaining and developing existing ones;    -- It is necessary to continue to improve the mix of export  products, accelerate a switch from exporting semi-processed  goods to intensive-processed goods and promote the export of  high- and new- tech products;    -- It is necessary to integrate technology, production and  trade, and vigorously expand the export of mechanical and  electrical products and complete sets of equipment that are  competitive on the international market, rely heavily on modern  technology, and have a high added value and good export  potential;    -- It is imperative to speed up the establishment of a  quality certification system;    -- It is necessary to encourage and support stronger large  and medium-sized enterprises with good credit to move into  foreign markets with quality products and good after-sale  services;    -- It is imperative to develop integrated trade companies in  the form of enterprise groups for different industries to engage  in international trade;    -- It is necessary to strictly implement the system of  making  settlements and sales in foreign exchange for exports, raise the  settlement rate for exports and improve the system of tax  refunds on exports; and    -- It is imperative to strengthen control over imports and  optimize the import mix.    Chen Jinhua said, "we shall continue to severely crack down  on smuggling. We shall exercise strict control over the outflow  of foreign currency in investment and capital accounts outside  the country and tighten supervision over enterprises located  abroad."    He pledged to continue expanding international tourism and  increasing foreign exchange revenues from non-trade sources.    He said that it is necessary to diligently check trade and  non- trade collection and payment of foreign exchange and  strengthen supervision over and examination of the collection  and payment of foreign currency to prevent leaks resulting from  arbitrage and evasion of state control over foreign currency and  from capital drain.    "We shall continue to operate in an efficient way special  economic zones, the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, open coastal  cities and economic and technological development zones, and  open up more central cities in border regions, along the Chang  Jiang river and in the interior," he told the NPC deputies.    Speaking of the utilization of foreign funds, he said that  it  is necessary to further better the investment climate in China,  expand the scope of projects using foreign funds, improve the  performance and quality of projects using foreign funds, and  make efficient use of foreign funds.    He outlined a series of policies concerning the use of  foreign funds:    -- It is necessary to absorb more direct foreign investment  in line with the country's capacity to provide supplementary  funding and increase the proportion of foreign investment  committed to projects;    -- It is imperative to guide the orientation of foreign  investment in accordance with the state's industrial policies,  directing more foreign investment towards infrastructure and  basic industries, key projects and technology upgrading in  existing enterprises, in particular towards projects that make  foreign- exchange-earning products;    -- It is necessary to support the central and western parts  of the country to use foreign capital to develop local resources;    -- Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative enterprises  should strictly abide by the principle of sharing both benefit  and risk, and work to achieve a balance of payments in foreign  exchange;    -- State-owned enterprises must evaluate their assets before  they sell stock rights or use existing assets to establish joint  ventures or cooperative enterprises with foreign businesses so  as to prevent the loss of state assets; and    -- It is imperative to strictly control the use of  international commercial loans, continuing to keep it under  mandatory planning control.    With regard to foreign debt, Chen Jinhua stressed the  importance of encouraging and supporting localities,  departments, and enterprises with heavy foreign debts to  establish a system of debt repayment financing to ensure that  foreign debts be repaid on schedule.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The ESA [European Space Agency] has assigned the  contract for development of the robot controller for space  applications to an industrial team led by the company  Tecnospazio. A company memorandum underlines the fact that the  project won the international tender called by the ESA in which  the major European aerospace corporations participated because  of the originality of the solution proposed. The solution is  based on the use of the Comau C3G 9001 controller while the  decision to adopt an industrial controller to implement the new  functions required by aerospace applications will guarantee  reliable results.    During the project the new controller is to be integrated in  the CAT [Columbus automation testbed] robotic system, delivered  by Tecnospazio to the ESA in 1992. This will permit ground  tests of the operations programs of the space robot to be  performed before they are carried out on board. DLR [German  Aerospace Research Institute] is also contributing to the  program with responsibility for installing the sensorized  "hand," which it developed for the Rotex robotic experiment, in  the new system.    Tecnospazio, a European leader in space automation and  robotics, is a consortium company established by Comau (Fiat  group) and FIAR (IRI [Institute for the Reconstruction of  Industry] Finmeccanica group).</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under &sect;960.17(d)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule, if the Bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts with the loan fund or loan consortium to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring requirements in &sect;960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, the Bank shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor the AHP-assisted housing units according to the monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of &sect;960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed rule. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank also shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the sponsor or owner of the project to submit to the loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fund or loan consortium such reports and certifications as are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required under &sect;960.15(c) of the proposed rule. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan fund or loan consortium shall report to the Bank any new loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or grant made using repayments of loans by the borrower. If a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan fund or loan consortium receives loans or grants from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles, the use of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds must be reported separately.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The monitoring and reporting requirements in &sect;960.17(d) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule are a change from the provisions on monitoring and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting in the Board's existing policy guidelines, which require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicant to monitor the loan fund or loan consortium and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require the Bank to monitor the applicant. This change is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to conform the monitoring and reporting requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects involving loan funds or loan consortia with the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring and reporting requirements applicable to AHP-assisted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing projects generally under &sect;&sect;960.14 and 960.15 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(e)(1) of the proposed rule provides that a loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fund or loan consortium receiving loans or grants from applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to the AHP and the project sponsors and owners receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans or grants from loan funds or loan consortia are subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the corrective and remedial actions contained in &sect;960.16 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule for fraud and non-compliance with respect to the AHP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(e)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the event of a loan fund's or loan consortium's fraud or willful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered from the loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fund or loan consortium by the applicant and returned to the Bank,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or if previously agreed to by the Bank, shall be recovered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank from the loan fund or loan consortium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(e)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule requires an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant that provides a loan or a grant to a loan fund or loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consortium pursuant to the AHP to have in place either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism that permits the applicant to recover from the loan fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or loan consortium, in the event of fraud or willful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance by the loan fund or loan consortium with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AHP requirements, the full amount of the AHP subsidy; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the Bank agrees and such an agreement is legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforceable, a three-party agreement that includes the Bank, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant, and the loan fund or loan consortium, that permits the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank to recover from the loan fund or loan consortium, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> event of fraud or willful non-compliance by the loan fund or loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consortium with respect to the AHP requirements, the full amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the AHP subsidy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.17(e)(3)(i) of the proposed rule provides that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-compliance with respect to the AHP requirements, the full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered by the loan fund or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan consortium from the sponsor or owner to be used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional AHP projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

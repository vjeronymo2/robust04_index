			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Boers prepare their own revolution SOUTH AFRICA'S angry white farmers yesterday took a leaf from the manual of the black liberation movements and staged a Boer version of mass action in the ultra-conservative town of Potchefstroom in the western Transvaal. About 3,000 farmers, clad in khaki shorts with a revolver in the waistband, shouted 'shoot them, shoot them' and threatened war against blacks if white farmers are killed. At least six farmers or their wives have been killed since the April 10 assassination of Mr Chris Hani, the Communist party leader, unleashed a wave of black outrage. Bluster and belligerence were the order of the day. But plans for the war failed to get off the ground: the man who was supposed to lead it - retired General Constand Viljoen, one of a group of former police and army generals who have recently threatened to form a 'white army' to fight political reform - was in remarkably tame mood. He pleaded with farmers to treat their black workers well so they would remain loyal on the day of the revolution, and urged Afrikaners to unite. With the right wing split into some 200-odd fringe groups, unity is likely to remain elusive. Gen Viljoen, one of the five-man group calling itself the Committee of Generals, says his aim is to form a united Boer front to exert pressure on South Africa's constitutional negotiators - before it is too late. As constitutional talks near a climax, and the African National Congress and the government vow to reach a constitutional deal within weeks, right-wing politicians know this is their last chance to push for the autonomous Afrikaner state which is their central goal. They say they will stage mass protests, strikes and boycotts - the familiar tools of black resistance - to persuade the negotiators they are serious. And if that fails, war. But 3,000 farmers do not make an army, and the top brass of both police and army are believed to back reform. The right might remember that when 1,000 white farmers tried to break up a National party political meeting in the western Transvaal town of Ventersdorp two years ago, white police fired on them, leaving three dead. With Mr Peter Mokaba, ANC Youth League leader, popularising the chant 'kill the Boer', farmers have clear cause for concern. Booklets on sale at the gathering, including one entitled Provisions for Crisis: survival in the new South Africa, offer advice on how to prepare for the revolution by laying in stores of tinned food and emergency water supplies. Another gives tips on 'armed protest'. 'Don't look for a bloodbath,' one speaker warned. 'Or you'll get it and we'll win it.' But as Gen Viljoen pointed out, the government entered negotiations precisely because it could not win a war against the ANC. It is difficult to believe that whites will try that tactic again soon.</p>

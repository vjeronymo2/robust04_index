			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Ford looks to Vietnam venture Ford has said it will apply to the Vietnamese government early next year for a licence to build vehicles with a local partner, state-owned Song Cong Diesel. Speaking after talks with senior government officials in Hanoi yesterday Mr Wayne Booker, a Ford executive vice-president, would give no details of the vehicles Ford intends to build or the volumes in which they would be produced. Negotiations on the project are at an advanced stage, following several months spent on a feasibility study. Ford will be the majority partner in the venture.</p>

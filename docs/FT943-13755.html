			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: London The gilts market enters this week in a more cheery mood than for some time. Even after a setback on Friday afternoon, the benchmark 6 3/4 per cent 2004 issue ended the week yielding 8.19 per cent, against 8.47 per cent a week earlier. Good economic news had spurred the market, with figures on both average earnings and retail prices showing little signs of the feared inflationary pick-up. This week sees the publication of several economic statistics which may give a clue as to whether the rally can be sustained. June retail sales numbers on Wednesday and a second-quarter gross domestic product estimate on Friday may show that the economy is still growing strongly. If the market takes such figures in its stride, this may show that investors are prepared to accept the story of a robust economy without inflation. The Bank's announcement on Friday that its next auction would be of conventional stock maturing between 2007 and 2011 indicated that the market's appetite for floating-rate stock and short-dated issues was limited, according to Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe). The Bank had to fund at the longer end, in spite of its dislike of the high yields prevailing. Full details of the issue will be revealed tomorrow.</p>

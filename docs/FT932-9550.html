			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: ICI's leap in the dark The financial engineers who dreamed up the Zeneca rights issue as a way of paying off ICI's debt may be a little disappointed. Splitting a pharmaceuticals company with a fancy rating from dowdy ICI may have made financial sense when Hanson spotted the opportunity two years ago. Now the demerger has cranked through the system, it looks like yesterday's idea - particularly since it also involves dumping a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue on the worst performing FT-A sector in 1993. Sir Denys Henderson, ICI's chairman, has always argued for demerger on industrial, rather than financial, grounds. But the notion that nothing less than fission of the company is enough to change ICI's culture is a tacit admission of management failure. That severed management is now faced with the same job it had before - getting performance out of the parts of ICI. Greater focus may result in the ICI bulk side being rationalised more quickly. Petrochemicals operations such as ethylene may be sold to oil companies which seem increasingly likely to dominate the sector. ICI will have to specialise in those niche markets where it has a technological edge or market dominance - and hope that those niches do not become tombs. Zeneca may be freer to generate the hard marketing edge which characterises other drugs companies. But the financial resources of a combined strong balance sheet will be lost. That limits the flexibility of either company to develop into new capital intensive markets in future. The corollary of greater focus is that neither company can afford to slip. In the short term, shareholders will doubtless be attracted by the guaranteed yield. Further out, the case for the great experiment remains unproven.</p>

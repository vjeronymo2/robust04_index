			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Status of Lloyd's agents as 'third party' unexplained Sir, The circular which has just been sent by Lloyd's debt collectors to some 14,000 Names contains the truly astonishing statement that '. . . any claim you may have against third parties (such as your member's and other agents) does not affect your liability to make payments to Lloyd's immediately'. So our member's and managing agents, the people to whom Names have entrusted all their savings, are 'third parties', ie nothing to do with Lloyd's] This has never before been stated to me in my 16 years as a Name and was certainly never mentioned when I joined, or there is no way I, along with tens of thousands of other unfortunate Names, would have signed up. What more skulduggery can we now expect from a society which spends Names' money to try to prove in the courts that they have no 'duty of care' to Names? Lloyd's has once again proved itself both incompetent and unworthy of self-regulation. The sooner this is rescinded and Lloyd's Council is made aware that its first duty is to Names, rather than policy holders, the better.

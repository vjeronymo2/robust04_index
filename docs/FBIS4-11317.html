			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 24 Apr (PL) -- Cuba confirmed today that  Cuban emigrants will be able to make investments in Cuba,  although it noted that the pertinent regulations will be decided  in the future.    Speaking to the plenum of "The Nation and the Emigrants  Conference," Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of  State, explained that, in general, the regulations established  by the current legislation regarding foreign investment will  apply to these cases.    Thus, investment in export-generating areas will have  priority, and will not be authorized -- for the time being -- in  the small-business, sugar industry, and oil-extraction areas,  among others.    Miguel Alfonso, a conference spokesman, told the media that  Lage gave a briefing on Cuba's financial situation, which has  worsened as a result of the collapse of the European socialist  bloc and the tightening of the U.S. blockade.    Lage stressed that, in light of the current situation, the  Cuban Government adopted several strategic decisions, including  the promotion of the tourist, pharmaceutical, and  biotechnological industries as well as the completion of  investment projects under way, those of which only generate  revenues via exports.    Other decisions consisted of revamping the state apparatus  to  make it smaller and more efficient, and guaranteeing that no one  is abandoned in case the structural changes generate some sort  of unemployment.    Lage mentioned that the opening to foreign investment, the  creation of the basic cooperative production units -- which  already comprise 2.5 million hectares -- and the removal of the  ban on Cuban's possession of foreign currency constitute  additional strategic measures.    Further decisions include increasing the authorization of  self-employment and reorganizing finances to return the Cuban  peso its purchasing power.    A total of 24 speakers participated in the debate that  followed Lage's remarks. Emigrants discussed the possible  purchase of state-issued bonds to participate in local the  economy as well as the necessary increase in family remittances.    Emigrants expressed their interest in the possibility of  assigning small capital to their relatives to open private  businesses and the creation of mechanisms to channel those funds.    Alfonso pointed out that all participants agreed that it is  necessary to lift the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba in  order to promote any type of investment on the island.</p>

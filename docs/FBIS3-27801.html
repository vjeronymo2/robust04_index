The statement reads in full:    The process of a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula has recently run up against a grave  challenge.    The United States has created a momentous crisis that is  likely to develop into catastrophe, at this crucial juncture  when prospects are in sight for saving the DPRK-USA talks from  the current deadlock and striking a package solution to the  nuclear issue.    As is already known, toward the end of the last year the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States  agreed on the immediate future measures aimed at holding a third  round of the DPRK-USA talks and reaching a package solution to  the nuclear issue, under which the United States will cancel its  "Team Spirit" joint military exercises for 1994 and the DPRK  will accept inspection of limited scope on its nuclear  facilities required to ensure the continuity of the safeguards  by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    Accordingly, it is within the framework of the DPRK-USA  agreement and with our extraordinary patience and maximum  tolerance that we have so far discussed with the IAEA  Secretariat the scope of the inspection intended to provide the  continuity of the safeguards.    The IAEA Secretariat, however, has deliberately ignored the  unique status of the DPRK, which set moratorium on its declared  withdrawal from the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear  weapons, and tried stupidly to force full-scope inspections  equivalent to the DPRK's de facto return to the treaty,  inspections on which the DPRK and the United States could reach  an accord at their future talks, instead of the inspection  designed for the continuity of the safeguards. The demand for  full-scope inspection clearly goes against the spirit of the  DPRK-USA agreement and it is absolutely beyond discussion at all  at this point of time when the U.S. nuclear threat remains yet  to be removed, the IAEA's partiality and injustice remain yet to  be redressed -- factors that have triggered off the DPRK's  withdrawal from the treaty.    This notwithstanding, the United States, a party to the  DPRK-USA talks, has never tried to help straighten out the IAEA  Secretariat's misconduct but completely reversed the bilateral  agreement on the inspection designed exclusively for the  continuity of the safeguards and officially urged the DPRK to  accept the demand of the IAEA Secretariat for the full-scope  inspections.    The United States has gone the length of imposing a deadline  for this and issued an ultimatum that it will not agree to hold  a third round of the DPRK-USA talks but seek "sanctions", unless  the DPRK accepts the IAEA's demand.    What should be noted seriously is that the United States has  again broached the "special inspection" of the DPRK's two  military sites, which have no relevance at all to its nuclear  activities, and taken the lead in the ruckus for international  pressure on the DPRK. This is a shameless perfidy against the  other party to the dialogue. All the facts clearly prove that  the so far stated U.S. preference for a negotiated resolution of  the issue and its busy come-and-go are, in the final analysis,  simply a stratagem aimed at devising a pretense for strangling  the DPRK and at stalling for time needed to this end.    The U.S. machinations of strangling the DPRK have been  proven self-evidently by the new war manoeuvres the United  States has been pursuing behind the screen of the DPRK-USA talks.    In violation of its repeated commitment to the principle of  assurances against the threat and use of force, including  nuclear weapons, the United States plans to defiantly go ahead  with its large-scale nuclear war exercises against the DPRK,  including the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises.    U.S. officials say that they plan to continue other joint  military exercises if they cannot conduct the "Team Spirit"  joint military exercises now, and they even say openly that  these exercises should be held in Hawaii, if not in South Korea.    When we proposed the U.S. cancellation of the "Team Spirit"  joint military exercises as a major agenda for the DPRK-USA  talks, our objective was to eliminate the U.S. nuclear threat  against the DPRK once and for all, not just to dename the  military exercises.    The arrogant U.S. posture for "resolving" the nuclear issue  with its nuclear war exercises going on against the other party  to the dialogue is a mockery against the DPRK and negation of  the dialogue itself.    What we cannot overlook is the fact that the U.S. hardline  and conservative forces are pressing ahead on a full scale with  the deployment of the "Patriot" missiles in South Korea, as part  of their attempts to overpower the DPRK militarily. Nobody in  the world will believe that the United States has the intention  to resolve the issue, as the United States launches smile  diplomacy at the negotiating table, as if it were interested in  the withdrawal of its nuclear weapons, while frantically engaged  in the deployment of its missiles to be trained on the other  dialogue party from behind the scenes.    This notwithstanding, the U.S. State Department spokesman's  sophistry that the deployment of the U.S. missiles can in no  way be considered provocative to the DPRK is really the height  of impudence.    The U.S. reckless new war machinations do not stop here.    The U.S. Administration sent the director of the Central  Intelligence Agency to South Korea in the early days of the new  year for a huddle on the "greater intelligence activities  vis-a-vis North Korea," a strong indication of the full-scale  stage of the war preparations.    It is not difficult now to guess that the United States will  move to contrive pretexts for a shift to real military actions.    In the light of this, it has become clear to anyone that the  IAEA Secretariat has intentionally delayed consultations with  the DPRK, until the films and batteries of the surveillance  cameras installed at the DPRK's nuclear facilities will have run  out, and now begun attempting full-scope inspections in an  intriguing manner, and that these moves have been made in  pursuit of the calculated stratagem of the United States.    All the facts clearly show that the United States has no  intention at all to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula peacefully but still remains unchanged as ever in its  ulterior objectives to strangle the DPRK by force at any cost.    With regard to the current crisis due to the despicable and  dangerous actions of perfidy on the part of the United States,  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea solemnly declares its position as follows:    First, if the United States defiantly goes ahead and  reverses  the promise it has made to the DPRK, the DPRK will no longer be  bound by the promise it has made to the United States.    The DPRK's promise to the United States includes all the  goodwill measures and commitments it has taken so far  unilaterally for the continued DPRK-USA talks and for a peaceful  resolution of the nuclear issue, such as the suspension of the  effectuation of its announced withdrawal from the treaty on the  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the freeze of all the  nuclear activities, and the declared intention to renounce the  graphite-moderated reactor system.    Second, if the United States has no intention to hold any  further round of talks, the DPRK, too, will have no intention to  do so.    It will be a gross miscalculation, if the United States  considers the DPRK-USA talks as an offering to the DPRK.    The DPRK has consistently called for negotiations with the  United States since the first days of the origination of the  nuclear issue, in order to peacefully resolve the issue, not to  seek any benefit from the United States.    We have so far lived on our own without any relations with  the United States, we can live well on our own in the future,  too, and we have become constitutionally adapted to such life.    Third, if the United States decides to take other options,  we  will also take our own countermeasures.    In no way does the right of choice belong to big countries  only.    The U.S. hardliners and conservatives must be held totally  responsible for the catastrophic consequences arising therefrom,  and the South Korean authorities, indiscreetly following their  lead, can never extricate themselves from this responsibility.</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (5): Flying high with cut-price seats - United Kingdom IN SPITE OF the recession, demand for air travel within Britain has held surprisingly firm, albeit helped by continued keen pricing which may be good news for the passenger but has not helped profitability for UK airlines. The past year, in fact, has been characterised by a restructuring and rationalisation within the industry. Earlier this year, for example, Brymon Airways and Birmingham European came together as Brymon European Airways in a logical move to make the best use of their resources, while British Airways restructured its regional operations under a new name, British Airways Regional. Since Brymon European is 40 per cent owned by BA - and 40 per cent owned by the parent company of Denmark's Maersk Air - there would eventually seem to be further scope for Brymon to come fully within the BA fold. But while BA remains the main player in the UK market - its shuttle services to big cities remain a profitable and successful part of its operations - there is a feeling in the industry that its eyes are rather more firmly fixed on international routes than on its regional networks. The same might also be said of British Midland which has for some time made no secret of its expansion plans into Europe. BM's problem has been the shortage of 'slots' (take-off and landing allocations) at Heathrow to fuel this expansion, which forced it earlier this year to abandon its Heathrow-to-Liverpool route to free the slots for European routes. The shortage of slots at Heathrow for domestic services is an irritant to many UK business travellers who are forced to drive or go by train and tube to Heathrow simply because of the non-availability of a connecting service from their local airport. Thus the decision by scheduled carrier Air UK to base its operations at Stansted Airport in Essex, even though the airport's growth has so far failed to live up to expectations. Air UK believes it provides a different option for business travellers from that offered by either BA or BM, especially for those based in north or east London, the Midlands and the eastern part of the country where access to Stansted is more convenient than to Heathrow or Gatwick. The airline flies more than 1,200 flights a week to 15 destinations within the UK. Not all of these are out of Stansted: for example, it has six flights every day from Norwich to Aberdeen. Air UK, however, also operates to mainland Europe and has just expanded its service, for example, from Newcastle to Amsterdam following the demise of Dan-Air. The outlook for business travellers: more of the same, but with perhaps the emergence of new niche carriers serving purely regional airports as the business climate improves.</p>

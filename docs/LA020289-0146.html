			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> J. C. Penney said it will leave the casualty insurance business that it entered  in 1976, when it began selling auto and homeowner policies through its stores  and direct marketing. Its JCPenney Casualty Insurance Co. has 350,000 policies  in force and collected $168 million last year in premiums -- 80% of it for auto  insurance. Tillinghast &amp; Co., an insurance consulting firm, is helping  Penney market the unit. Penney said it will continue selling life insurance  through another subsidiary.  </P></p>

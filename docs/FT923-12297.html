			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / International Company News: Sanyo to postpone memory chip production SANYO Electric is to postpone mass production of four-megabit dynamic random access memories (D-rams) because of sluggish market conditions, the company announced. Although the Japanese electronics company has never been a leading D-ram producer, its decision to scale back its involvement signals a trend among Japanese semiconductor producers who are increasingly disenchanted with the D-ram business. Industry analysts expect several minor D-ram producers to follow Sanyo's example and back away from the volatile memory chip market. Last week Sanyo reported an 82.5 per cent drop in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y3.34bn (Dollars 26.8m) in the half year to May. D-ram prices have skidded over the past year in the face of mounting competition from South Korean producers and sluggish demand from the recession-bound computer industry. The situation facing Japanese D-ram producers is reminiscent of that encountered by US producers in the mid-1980s when most US companies abandoned the market. Sanyo said that it would continue to develop higher capacity D-rams to keep pace with advances in semi-conductor production technology.</p>

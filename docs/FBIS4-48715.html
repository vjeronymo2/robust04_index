			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ray Hartley] </F>   [Text] KwaZulu self-protection unit recruits were allegedly  given gruesome training in terrorism -- including how to set  fire to a bus so passengers could not escape -- at a camp under  the command of Inkatha senator Phillip Powell. Details of the  training at Mlaba camp, about 40km from Ulundi, and a dramatic  election day raid by TEC [Transition Executive Council]  officials, are contained in a confidential report which has been  handed to President Nelson Mandela. The report, compiled by TEC  investigator Howard Varney and dated May 19, said information  had alleged the trainees "were preparing for disruptive action  over the election period."    Demonstrations of the bus-burning technique were carried out  at a grenade training site on the Umfolozi river bed, a former  camp trainee told the TEC investigator. He said trainees were  also taught how to construct homemade bombs. Instruction was  provided on how to sabotage a vehicle by tampering with the  battery so that "when the vehicle is started, the battery will  explode".    Training, which took place using illegal weapons allegedly  supplied by officials in the KwaZulu government and police, also  covered the use of "AK-47s, Makarovs, Uzis, pump action  shotguns, limpet mines, pistols (and) R1 rifles", the report  said.    The investigation prompted TEC officials Mac Maharaj and  Fanie van der Merwe to accompany the Maritzburg SAP's [South  African Police] Major-General Wynand van der Merwe on an  unsuccessful raid of the camp, which raised questions about  police partiality. On arrival near the camp site on April 26,  the group agreed that General van der Merwe would land his  helicopter in the camp first and persuade Mr Powell to allow a  search of the facility, but this plan had to be aborted.  "Persons in the crowd picked up stones and the helicopter made  a hasty retreat." The helicopter flew to a nearby 121  Battalion Base, where TEC, police and SANDF [South African  National Defence Force] officials decided that "firm action  would be taken against the camp".    The local Internal Stability Division, under a Major Pelser,  was instructed to set up a roadblock to prevent trainees and  equipment from leaving the camp, and a mechanised SADF [South  African Defence Force] back-up made its way to the camp. The  SADF contingent was scheduled to arrive on the morning of April  27, in time for a full search.    "It was decided and agreed that it was of vital importance  that all personnel in the camp be properly processed and that  they be held until this had happened," the report said. But,  once the TEC officials had left the scene to return to  Maritzburg, the trainees were allowed through the police  road-block. Major Pelser claimed he had no orders to prevent  the trainees from leaving the base and that buses were searched  at the roadblock. But General van der Merwe said most of the  buses had departed before the roadblock was set up.    "The departure of most of the trainees from the base without  any processing by the police constitutes a major setback to the  investigation," Mr Varney said in the report.    Police entered the camp with the permission of Mr Powell  shortly before midnight to find it had been abandoned in haste.  A rondavel "allegedly under the control of Phillip Powell" was  searched and G3 rifles, handgrenades, rifle grenades, shotguns  and ammunition were seized. Mr Powell's vehicle was searched  and a homemade weapon was seized. "This homemade shotgun is  apparently the same type that was manufactured by the former C10  (Vlakplaas) persons named in the Goldstone report," the report  said.    The KwaZulu government intended deploying as many as 1,000  of  the trainees in the KwaZulu Police as special or assistant  constables, but this had not been done.    A thousand rifles that Mr Powell tried to purchase from  Eskom  could have been destined for the trainees, the report said.    Mr Varney called for a thorough inquiry into training at the  Mlaba camp and the procurement of weapons used in the training.    Mr Powell could not be reached for comment.</p>

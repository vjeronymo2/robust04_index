			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Utility confirms Messier as No 2 Mr Jean-Marie Messier, a 37-year-old investment banker, was yesterday named number two at Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French utilities group, in the expectation that he will take over at the FFr147bn-a-year (Dollars 27.6bn) business from Mr Guy Dejouany, CGE's veteran chairman and chief executive, in 18 months. CGE said that the decision to co-opt Mr Messier to the board as a director-general was taken unanimously, therefore with the apparent approval of Mr Jacques Calvet. Mr Calvet, the head of Peugeot, the carmaker, had earlier threatened to resign from the CGE board if so young a man with little experience of the group's business were 'parachuted' into so high a position. Mr Calvet left Paris on a business trip immediately after the CGE board meeting. A CGE statement made clear Mr Messier was being groomed to succeed Mr Dejouany, who has run CGE for the past 18 years and who is due to retire in 1996. It said Mr Messier 'will have very broad delegated powers, under the control of' Mr Dejouany. He will head a new internal executive committee to prepare important decisions and a new subcommittee of the board dealing with corporate strategy and development. This puts him above Mr Paul-Louis Girardot, the only other CGE director-general to be a board member. Mr Girardot was known to be unhappy with Mr Dejouany's decision to pass him over by choosing someone much younger from outside the group.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHICS COUNSEL WOULD PROBE CRANSTON, RIEGLE AND DECONCINI  </P> <P> The special counsel to the Senate Ethics Committee has recommended that no  action be taken against Sens. John Glenn (D-Ohio) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) in  an S&amp;L case, a congressional source disclosed Friday night.  </P> <P> The counsel recommended that the committee proceed with an investigation of the  three other senators who intervened with regulators on behalf of Arizona  savings and loan operator Charles H. Keating Jr., the source said.  </P> <P> The other senators from the "Keating Five" group are Donald W. Riegle Jr. of  Michigan, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Alan Cranston of California, all  Democrats.  </P> <P> The recommendation by special counsel Robert S. Bennett, a Washington lawyer,  was made Sept. 10, but the committee has been unable to decide whether to  accept it, the source said.  </P> <P> The source discussed what he knew about Bennett's recommendation on condition  that his congressional affiliation not be disclosed. He said he did not know  the basis for the recommendation.  </P> <P> The committee's staff director, Wilson Abney, refused to discuss the matter  Friday night.  </P> <P> Glenn's press aide, Rebecca Bell, and McCain's press aide, Scott K. Celley,  said their senators had not been told of any recommendation to the committee.  </P> <P> Keating controlled Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine, Calif., whose failure  has been estimated to cost taxpayers $2 billion. His family is from Ohio; he  had a hotel project in Michigan and his principal corporation operated in  Arizona.  </P> <P> He contributed $1.3 million to the campaigns and causes of the five senators,  and the committee is trying to determine whether their intercession with  regulators trying to close Lincoln was improper.  </P> <P> Keating, charged with fraud in the sale of more than $200 million in risky junk  bonds, is in jail in Los Angeles, unable to make $5-million bail.  </P></p>

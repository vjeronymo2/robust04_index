			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Dresdner Bank wins mandate for DM3bn EC issue THE European Community has awarded the mandate for its widely-expected DM3bn Eurobond offering to Dresdner Bank. An official in Frankfurt said Dresdner would be the sole bookrunner of the seven-year issue, the proceeds of which are intended to fund the EC's previously-announced loan to Italy. The transaction is expected to be launched today. There were three offerings in the Eurodollar sector yesterday, which also saw the pricing of Toyota Motor Corp's Dollars 1.5bn five-year deal at 101.333 to yield 38 basis points above the when-issued five-year US Treasuries. The pricing was in line with market expectations. Kidder Peabody launched a Dollars 315m mortgage-backed seven-year floating-rate note through a special-purpose vehicle, the second real estate-related issue in less than a week. Last Friday, Merrill Lynch arranged a Dollars 57.5m five-year FRN for Regency Square Finance Corp, aimed at refinancing the mortgages on Regency Square Mall in Jacksonville, Florida. The coupon on the Regency Square notes was 110 basis points above three-month Libor, and the notes were trading at their launch price of 99.75 yesterday. The indicated coupon on Kidder's deal, the proceeds of which will be used to finance 13 shopping malls in the US, is 75 basis points above three-month Libor. An official at Kidder Peabody said the notes were 'largely placed' by yesterday afternoon and he expected them to be priced before the indicated date of March 3. The Bank of Greece raised Dollars 300m through a 10-year FRN, priced at 99.70 and with a coupon of 75 basis points above six-month Libor. An official at lead-manager CSFB said that a 'decent chunk' of the offering had been sold by late yesterday but that it would take a few more days to complete the placement. Elsewhere, France Telecom tapped the Swiss franc market, raising SFr150m through a five-year offering, currently the favoured maturity among Swiss investors. The bonds were priced at 102.50 with a coupon of 4.75 per cent and traded inside fees in the grey market, at 101.10 to yield 4.5 per cent. Swiss and UK investors were reported to have snapped up a SFr75m four-year convertible issue from Dong Ah Construction Industrial Company, South Korea's third-largest construction company. The issue was at par, with a coupon of 3.25 per cent, but the price shot up to 105.50 in grey market trading, reflecting the strong demand among investors for convertible paper as well as the rarity of Korean issuers in the equity-linked sector. Yesterday also saw the first deal from Australia's Treasury Corp of Victoria, the new, centralised treasury body which has replaced the now-defunct Victoria Public Finance Authority. TCV is also responsible for borrowing on behalf of other state entities. TCV raised ADollars 150m, up from an original ADollars 125m, through a 10-year issue with a coupon of 8 3/4 per cent, priced at 100.35 to yield 8.70 per cent or 60 basis points over comparable Australian government bonds. When the bonds started trading, the price fell to 98.50 to yield 8.98 per cent but was inside fees of 2 per cent. The yield spread on the bonds is wider than those of other recent 10-year offerings in the Australian dollar Eurobond market, and reflected TCV's credit rating of A1/AA. This compared with a yield spread of 26 basis points above Australian government bonds on the Australian Industrial Development Corporation's 10-year bonds, launched in January, and 38 basis points on an issue the same week by the State Bank of New South Wales. Both have higher credit ratings than TCV.</p>

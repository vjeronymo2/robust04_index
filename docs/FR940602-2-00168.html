Section 2347&hyph;2347.12b set forth direction for special use authorization of privately built and owned structures on National Forest land. These structures are maintained for the use and enjoyment of holders and their guests. As recreation facilities, they are vacation sites and may not be used on a permanent basis (FSM 2721.23). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2347.03_Policy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Management non-commercial recreation use sites in accordance with basic recreation policy in FSM 2303 as valid and important components of the overall National Forest recreation program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Continue to authorize those existing facilities now occupying National Forest land under special use authorization that (a) are consistent with management direction given in the Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (FSM 2721.23e), (b) are at locations where the need for an alternative public purpose has not been established, (c) do not constitute a material, uncorrectable offsite hazard to National Forest resources, and (d) do not endanger the health or safety of the holder or the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Manage non-commercial recreation use sites in such a way that the general public is not precluded from full enjoyment of the natural, scenic, recreational, and other aspects of the National Forests (FSM 2701). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Deny applications for construction of new facilities except where they would replace similar existing facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Deny any proposal for commercial activity at permitted, non-commercial recreation use sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Require non-commercial recreation use holders to maintain their sites to protect the natural forest environment. Do not allow construction or placement of non-authorized facilities on these sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2347.1_Recreation Residences. (FSM 2721.23 and FSH 2709.11.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recreation residences are a valid use of National Forest System lands. They are an important component of the overall National Forest recreation program and have the potential of supporting a large number of recreation person-days. They may provide special recreation experiences that might not otherwise be available. It is Forest Service policy to continue recreation residence use and to work in partnership with holders of these permits to maximize the recreational benefits of these residences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Administer recreation residence special use permits to ensure proper use of the lot for family and guest recreational purposes (FSM 2347.11). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Do not approve any new authorizations for full-time residences, except in special situations to provide caretaker or other similar services where there is a strongly demonstrated need (FSM 2347.12). Do not approve in-lieu lots for full-time residential use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Issue recreation residence term permits for a maximum of 20 years in accordance with procedures in FSM 2721.23e and FSH 2709.11, sec. 41.23. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Give holders at least 10 years written advance notice if a new permit will not be issued following expiration of the existing permit term (FSM 2721.23a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Revoke a recreation residence permit before expiration of the term of the permit when (a) it is in the public interest, particularly when the final decision authority does not rest with the Forest Service, (b) there is an uncorrected breach of a permit provision(s) (FSM 2721.23i), (c) the site has been rendered unsafe by catastrophic events such as flood, avalanche, or massive earth movement, or (d) when there is other cause as provided in 37 CFR 251.60. Revocation in the public interest should not be undertaken unless monies are available to pay for the holder's improvements and there is an urgent need to use the lot before the action can be considered through the Forest planning process resulting in a decision to convert to an alternative public use. When revoking a permit for any cause, give as much advance notice as possible (FSM 2721.23i). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

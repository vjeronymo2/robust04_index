			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Walter Sotomayor] </F>   [Text] Belem do Para, Brazil, 6 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Toppled  Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide today rejected the use  of violence as a means to restore democracy and to return him to  the government of that Caribbean country.    Aristide, who was elected in December 1990 and toppled by a  military coup in September 1991, expressed his views before the  OAS Ad Hoc Commission tasked with following up on the Haitian  crisis. The deposed president attended the inaugural session of  the 24th period of OAS regular sessions in this city in  northeastern Brazil at the special invitation of the president  of this country, Itamar Franco [words indistinct] violence and  we must continue talking about reconciliation," Aristide said at  a news conference held after his speech to the foreign ministers  of the 34 member countries of the inter-American organization.    "So far, we have tried (to restore constitutionality)  through  peaceful means and we have not yet exhausted them," the Haitian  president-in-exile added, as he proposed new actions to  intensify the economic and commercial blockade against his  country. "As soon as we step up pressure on the coupists they  will not be able to stay in power," Aristide said. "I am not  requesting a military occupation but, based on an agreement  signed at Governors Island (New York, United States), the  international community knows what to do to avoid limiting its  actions to words," he added.    The Haitian president pointed out that when he referred to  the coupist officers, he was talking about a "small group of  soldiers involved in drug trafficking" and added that Haiti now  ranks second in the continent for its involvement in drug  trafficking. Aristide pointed out that "if it was not the main  reason, drug trafficking was among the major reasons for the  coup d'etat," after noting that he was committed to fight drug  trafficking and had signed an agreement on this matter with the  United States shortly before the military intervention.    He recalled that while he led the government, he stepped up  the struggle against drug trafficking, but now there is talk  about 48 tons of cocaine that pass through Haiti producing an  estimated $1.2 billion.    Likewise, he explained that Haitian political problems are  structural in nature in a nation with a tradition of coups.  Haiti was the first nation with a black population in the world  to obtain its independence when it became free from France in  1804. It has had 36 presidents of which 24 fell as a result of  military coups d'etat.    Aristide assured that the Armed Forces, comprising 7,000  men,  used 40 percent of the national budget. He claimed that during  the 32 months of the de facto regime commanded by General Raoul  Cedras, he has lacked the means to communicate with the people  who elected him, indicating it was important to break this  information barrier.    During his speech to the "Ad Hoc" Committee, Aristide  presented to the international community four courses of action  against Haiti. The measures highlight the need for swift action  to remove the military from the government, a six-month presence  of a U.N. mission in Haiti, his return to the country, and the  fulfillment of the New York agreements.    During the news conference held in French, Aristide also  presented his government's projects which place particular  emphasis on restructuring the judicial system and on  investments, aimed at overcoming the Haitian people's serious  social problems.</p>

In statements published today in the daily "LA JORNADA," the  Zapatist leader indicated that the EZLN hoped that "war would be  staved off by the pressures exerted by the civil society and the  whole nation for the agreements to be kept." The government  "will only comply if it is forced to do so, and this will be by  the force of the rifle or by society's pressure," insisted the  leader of the Chiapas rebels. For Marcos, "the sole possibility  of peace is for other forces to make a commitment to oblige the  government to keep the agreements."    One day after his return to the Lacandona Jungle in Chiapas  where the Zapatists took shelter to ask the Indian communities'  opinion on the agreements made with the government, Marcos  declared that the problem is no longer the rebels', but the  nation's as a whole. "The government will have to fight against  its past to convince the communities that it will now meet its  commitments," the Zapatist "subcommander" stressed.    Marco made a brief analysis of the 63-day armed rebellion in  which he accepted military defeat in the taking over of Rancho  Nuevo where an Army garrison is located. He also admitted that  "the swift manner in which we passed from the armed situation to  the San Cristobal table took us by surprise."    He stressed that during the rebellion the EZLN "General  Command received numerous letters of support from Indian from  other parts of the nation in which they also stated their desire  to join up in arms, among them the Yaquis, Mayos, Tarahumaras,  and Maya tribes.    The 19 representatives of the EZLN directorate returned on  Thursday to the Lacandona Jungle after an 11-day dialogue with  Manuel Camacho Solis, government delegate for peace and  reconciliation, with whom several agreements were reached.  These include the government's response to the Zapatists' main  demands.</p>

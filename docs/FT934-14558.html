			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo doubts The unusual move by Lasmo to reject publicly the decision by Moody's to downgrade the company's debt did little to reassure the market. Many industry watchers viewed the statement as a sign of nerves rather than positive action to quell any uncertainty over the stock. However, analysts were in agreement that the downgrading was not unexpected and the rating would have little effect on the company's strategy. The real impact was likely to be on the already uncertain sentiment surrounding Lasmo. One source reported some unease among US brokers - recent supporters of the stock. Also affecting the stock was a rumour that Warburg had downgraded its dividend forecast and recommended a switch out of the stock. Warburg, long-time sellers of Lasmo, denied any downgrading. Mr Alan McDonald said that although the broker preferred a stock such as Enterprise the stance on Lasmo had not altered. In slightly above average volume of 3.9m the shares slipped back 1 1/2 to 136p. Elsewhere in the oils sector Enterprise Oil continued to move ahead, buoyed by its recent add-on discovery and also, according to one analyst, a shortage of the stock. The price increased 8 to 479p. Burmah reportedly suffered the reverse problem and an overhang of stock was one of the reasons said to have driven its fall of 12 to 754p. Pittencrieff jumped ahead 21 to 366p largely on the back of its telecommunications interests. Food manufacturing stocks were under pressure as evidence of continued margin pressure in the sector was seen. First, came the annoucement from Tesco that it was slashing the price of milk, hitting shares in Northern Foods and Unigate, two of the country's biggest dairy companies. Then, news that BSN, the French food giant, was beginning a discounting campaign, albeit in coupon form, undermined sentiment further. However, Unilever again sparkled as sentiment towards brands, particularly on Wall Street, improves. The shares added 18 to 1094p. Tesco's move kept worries alive over margin pressure among supermarket stocks. Tesco shares slipped 3 to 202p, J Sainsbury 4 to 415p, Kwik Save 9 to 668p and Argyll Group 5 to 291p. Tobacco and financial services group BAT was in demand, the shares advancing 10 to 468p, after US securities house Sanford Bernstein was reported to have upgraded Philip Morris from hold to outperform. The securities house was said to have cited a resumption of earnings growth and a change in strategy and an increase in premium cigarette brands. Office equipment group Danka Business jumped 26 to 305p, after Credit Lyonnais placed around 1.2m shares with institutions at 263p, a share. The stock had been part of Danka's public offer to raise nearly Dollars 75m that was made on Wednesday in the US. Among transport stocks, troubled container leasing group Tiphook, shed 4 to 137p, on vague talk that the company may be considering calling on investors for cash. The placing of the rump of the Pounds 215m rights issue from Tarmac helped to send the share price down 3 to 140p. The placing by Cazenove was, according to one analyst, a little larger than expected. The company announced a 87.3 per cent take-up of the issue. Shares in Hunting, the oil, aviation and defence group fell 16 to 233p, with BZW, the company's broker, said to have led the day's selling, after the company reported interim figures just below market expectations. Profits improved Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 17.7m but sounded a note of caution about the aviation side of the business, in spite of a favourable outlook for oil, and defence. Hunting's figures were the second set of results in the aerospace sector this week to disappoint the market. The first came from FR Group, where the shares yesterday benefited from bargain hunting ending a penny ahead at 225p, after several dull sessions. That poor sentiment was also seen in aerospace and medical equipment group Smiths Industries where the shares lost 15 to 356p, in nervous trading ahead of next week's results. Several large lines of stock were on offer and talk that the company may make a provision of around Pounds 8m on its aerospace side once again did the rounds. Engineering group FKI put on 6 to 171p, as brokers just back from a visit to the company's US operations recommended the stock. A round of upbeat visits and presentations to City institutions by British Aerospace did much to help the shares shrug off news that the Government of Taiwan would play no part in the company's attempts to salvage its proposed regional jets joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace Corporation(TAC). The shares gained 11 to 419p, in trade of 2.7m with analysts once again stressing the point that the deal was no longer financially critical to the future of BAe. News of job cuts at the group was also well received by market watchers. General buying of William Cook saw the shares move 17 ahead to 281p. Among motor stocks, fears of asbestosis claims from Africa and India for T&amp;N, following a hard-hitting documentary programme on UK radio, weakened the shares. They closed 5 lower at 175p. Among trusts, Abtrust Scotland remained unchanged at 28p after Panmure Gordon crossed a block of 4 1/2 m shares, as one institution sold its 13 per cent stake to several other funds. Thorn EMI, undermined in recent sessions over compact disc inquiry worries on both sides of the Atlantic, slid further as SG Warburg was said to have placed nearly 3m shares at 890p. Thorn closed at 906p, down 14. Profit-taking in Royal Bank of Scotland saw the shares lose 11 to 334p. National Westminster put on 4 to 559p in trade of 4m, after it reported record figures from NatWest Bancorp, its US subsidiary.</p>

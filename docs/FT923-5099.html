			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / World Trade News: BA-USAir deal 'could trigger change' - FT World Aerospace and Air Transport Conference BRITISH Airways' plan to invest Dollars 750m (Pounds 376.8m) in a 44 per cent stake in USAir, the sixth largest US carrier, was described yesterday as 'one of the rare defining moments' in aviation history. The move, if approved by the US government, is expected to accelerate the trend towards globalisation in the airline industry by intensifying cross-border mergers and acquisitions between international carriers. But it has also unleashed a new transatlantic trade controversy which risks adding civil aviation to the already long catalogue of trade disputes between the US and Europe - ranging from agricultural subsidies to government aid for the European Airbus programme. The growing trade frictions between the US and Europe over civil aviation featured prominently at a Financial Times conference in London on world aerospace and air transport. Frictions have been heightened by the current financial difficulties facing the airline industry, which is struggling to recover from its worst recession in 40 years and striving to adapt to an increasingly deregulated international aviation environment. At the same time deregulation has made the system of bilateral aviation agreements between countries, which has governed the industry since 1946, look increasingly obsolete. There is growing pressure to replace it with a multilateral system between large trading blocks to promote open skies. Mr Lawrence Nagin, executive vice-president of United Airlines, said the BA-USAir deal could be a trigger for change. 'The transaction holds the prospect of making enormous inroads in the protectionist thinking that still pervades much of the international aviation regime. Indeed, it could well be the lever with which to open Europe and the US to a free competitive environment', he said. But he warned it could reinforce old trade barriers and trigger new ones as parties sought to preserve a competitive advantage for flag carriers through government regulations. United, along with American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the three largest US carriers, have pressed their government to block the BA-USAir deal unless they can secure greater access to the UK and European markets by negotiating a new bilateral aviation agreement with the UK. Both Mr Jeffrey Shane, assistant secretary at the US Department of Transportation, and the Earl of Caithness, the UK aviation minister, declined to discuss the current state of negotiations between the two countries on the BA-USAir deal. Mr Shane said the US was promoting an open skies policy and wanted to negotiate new liberal bilateral agreements with European countries. But he noted some European governments, including France and Germany, were moving in the opposite direction and warned the US would consider retaliating against countries erecting barriers for US carriers. This could include constraints on traffic to the US moved by foreign carriers from destinations outside their home countries and a tougher stance on future tariff co-ordination. 'Those who insist on using their sovereignty to constrain market growth artificially may find they have placed their carriers at a serious, possibly irreversible, disadvantage in the long run,' Mr Shane warned. But European speakers rejected the US position. Lord Caithness said US airlines continued to dominate their domestic market with large hub and spoke networks and enjoyed advantages denied to foreign competitors. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's deputy chairman and chief executive, said his airline's deal with USAir complied with existing US foreign ownership requirements and aviation policies. The reaction of the big US carriers 'only served to reassure us that the agreement we have negotiated is a good one,' he added. If US carriers wanted to table new demands from the UK, they should be ready to provide commensurate concessions for UK airlines, including the relaxation of ownership rules. Sir Colin said two significant obstacles continued to undermine efforts to create a more liberal and open skies environment. These were continuing state support enjoyed by government-controlled carriers and the US Chapter 11 rule whereby bankrupt airlines were protected from creditors and thus able to continue operating. Mr Frederik Sorensen, head of the EC's air transport policy division, said that, with the advent of a single European aviation market next year, it was necessary to formulate a European external aviation policy, including new external competition rules. Such a policy should also take into account the potential conflict between the broad interests of the Community as a whole and the specific national interests of member states. The competitive position of European carriers would be enhanced if the Community could speak with one voice instead of being divided on external aviation policy, he argued. But Mr Giovanni Bisignani, chief executive of Alitalia and chairman of the Association of European Airlines (AEA), said a common EC approach could only work if all EC countries were subjected to the same rules, including a similar fiscal regime. 'National legislation still shows a high degree of disparity, and market differences are evident in financial, fiscal, social and labour regulations,' he said. The harmonisation of national legislation was thus of fundamental importance for implementation of a single market, as fiscal differences could create just as large distortions as state aid to airlines.</p>

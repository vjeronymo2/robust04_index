			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Accountancy: Creative catch from Atlantic's muddy waters - Andrew Jack on a report that highlights one of the most extraordinary corporate episodes of the 1980s The story of Atlantic Computers began with all the continent-bridging energy that the name of the company implies, and ended up unceremoniously drowning directors, investors and advisers alike. Last week's highly critical report from Department of Trade and Industry inspectors (an investigation itself costing a gargantuan Pounds 6.5m spread over four years) highlights one of the most extraordinary corporate episodes of the 1980s. Atlantic was founded in 1975 to provide leasing, lease-financing, broking, and the sale of computers. It would order computers, arrange lease terms and sell them to customers with benefit of leases. It was floated in 1983, and by 1988 was gobbled up by British &amp; Commonwealth, the listed financial services group, for Pounds 408m. Two years later, both Atlantic and its new parent had collapsed. Including additional money injected since 1988, B &amp; C had made an investment of Pounds 485m - or nearly half of its assets - by April 1990, when it was rewarded by the suspension of its shares and the appointment of administrators. Between 1983 and 1988, Atlantic had reported aggregate pre-tax profits of Pounds 127.6m. According to the DTI's two inspectors, had it been accounting prudently, it would have reported no significant profits at all. The inspectors conclude: 'Throughout its life Atlantic employed a number of commercial and accounting devices to increase its reported profits and postpone impact of its contingent liabilities'. The root cause of Atlantic's problems, they argue, was a simple business one: the lack of commercial viability of its core product, known as Flexlease. The company was able to keep these troubles concealed by the way in which it accounted for profits and failed to make provision for the contingent liabilities it incurred. From the late 1970s till the mid 1980s, accounting rules and capital allowances in the UK 'were favourable for leasing as opposed to other forms of financing', as the inspectors euphemistically put it. Flexlease offered a six-year lease, with the scope for two options: 'flex' (allowing renegotiating for a new agreement after three years) and 'walk' (to terminate the lease after five years). The options gave rise to large potential liabilities. The inspectors say that Atlantic's directors counted on the gross liabilities of the leases being reduced by earnings on replacement leases. Future profits were anticipated to cover current losses which were not provided for in the accounts. This was, they say, 'an unsound basis for a long-term business'. It was only viable if there was a sound basis for believing that the future residual value of returned computer equipment would at least equal the cost of meeting the outstanding lease obligations at the flex and walk points in the lease. The past pattern of depreciation suggested otherwise. The inspectors say there was also 'an element of commercial deception' inherent in the arrangement. The walk option was a clear obligation, but the flex option was worded in a way to apparently suggest there were contractual rights to exchange equipment when these were probably legally unenforceable. So Atlantic reported the gross margin in full as profit in the year each lease was sold. It made no advance provision for potential liabilities attached to the flex or walk obligations. It also offered no disclosure of the walk obligations in the accounts, while the flex obligations were noted but their magnitude not included. These two elements rendered Atlantic's accounting policies 'imprudent', and meant that the accounts were not 'true and fair' at least since 1983 and possibly since the commencement of the company. It was, in short, able to report substantial, fast-growing profits while large potential liabilities were built up but not disclosed. By early 1989 the gross potential (and unrecorded) liabilities of the walk options were Pounds 160m. The report suggests that the Atlantic directors also indulged in a catalogue of other creative accounting devices. They reported as profit the estimated value of residual interests in leased computer equipment. They used 'artificial' routes to justify the accounting for the acquisition of two businesses, ICA and Comcap, and created a company with inadequate records for monitoring. Atlantic postponed its contingent liability problem through a wide range of techniques. It adjusted the treatment of its own-book leases financed by hire purchase. It used two ways to generate incorrect accounting for transactions close to the year-end. First, it mismatched revenue and costs by failing to record all costs connected with a transaction in the year in which they were reported and by backdating transactions. Second, it employed duplicate acceptance notes on leases, with the date left blank or typed in after customer signatures. Between 1981 and 1988 it made five prior year adjustments, 'the common theme being a resulting benefit to reported profits', as the inspectors say: through stock adjustment, changes to 'unsound' or 'illegitimate' accounting policies. When the size of Atlantic's liabilities emerged in 1989, the directors decided not to tell the auditors. The 1988 accounts required a provision for walk obligations of Pounds 175.9m. The inspectors say that much effort went into seeking an 'accounting solution' to deal with liabilities without damaging current profitability. Wherever there is questionable accounting, the spotlight needs also to turn to the auditors, of course. The report provides intriguing insights into the way in which Atlantic and B &amp; C handled a number of large firms of accountants. In fact, many of the problems with Atlantic's accounting were picked up: in a draft report at the time of Atlantic's flotation by Price Waterhouse, for example - and in work conducted by KPMG Peat Marwick after it took over as auditor to Atlantic. What is worrying is how such danger signals were able to be concealed for so long. In 1982, Atlantic indulged in some 'opinion shopping' with three firms to support accounting policy on leases. Two - Arthur Young and Deloittes - supported its existing stance, and their views were used to bolster its position. The company clearly put considerable pressure on Spicer and Pegler, its auditor from 1983 till 1989, and now part of Touche Ross. At one point in 1982, a draft report from Spicer, which included the comment 'there exists a contingent liability', was amended in the final version to read 'there exists a possible contingent liability' with additional wording that no such actual liability existed. Atlantic's directors showed evidence of bullying their auditors. Internal memos also suggested that they were worried that a switch to another firm of auditors might reduce the 'flexibility' adopted by Spicer. The inspectors say that Spicer, in turn, failed to develop a sufficiently deep relationship with the company. The firm had unrestricted access to the company's records, and should have been aware of scale of the walk clauses. Instead, it seemed prepared to accept the directors' assurances that no more than 5 per cent of the lease contracts had such clauses. The true figure was nearer to 90 per cent in some years. The inspectors suggest that Spicer provided weak auditing which allowed Atlantic's accounting to go unchecked. There were numerous deficiencies in planning for successive audits, and shortcomings in carrying out the work. It will be intriguing to see if any disciplinary actions follow from the Atlantic debacle. It will be still more interesting to see whether the profession and business heeds its lessons.</p>

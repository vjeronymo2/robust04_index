			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Ratners Ratners shares have fallen so far in recent months that they barely reacted to the threatened move into Chapter 11 of Zale, the leading US jeweller. Granted, they had already dropped by more than 10 per cent yesterday on worries about the group's Christmas trading performance. But Zale's angry creditors have served an unwelcome reminder to the market that Ratners is vulnerable to more than the depressed UK high street. Its US business is an obvious candidate for sale should the group require a refinancing of its debts. While the issue of what that business might fetch is more germane than ever, the likely figure is shrinking all the time. Zale's decline will surely benefit Ratners in the long term. The question is whether Ratners has enough time in hand.</p>

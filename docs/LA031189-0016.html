			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECOND AMENDMENT AND GUN CONTROL  </P> <P> Since the drive began in earnest to ban military assaults weapons, the anti-gun  control people would have the public believe that there is no way laws can be  written to differentiate between a military weapon like the AK-47 and  semiautomatic sport rifles. This is just a smoke screen by the anti-gun control  people who do not want any gun-control laws no matter how desperately needed  they are. There are obvious criteria for telling the two types of weapons  apart.  </P> <P> Intent of design should be one criteria. A weapon originally designed to be  fired automatically -- or even at a high rate of speed semiautomatically -- and  accommodate a clip with a large number of rounds -- is obviously a military  weapon and ought to be banned from the public.  </P> <P> Such a ban would not infringe on the rights of hunters whose first priority is  accuracy and, of course, there are already laws on the books limiting the  number of rounds a rifle or shotgun can carry. So where is the conflict between  sport rifles and shotguns and military weapons? The sooner the military weapons  are banned the better.  </P> <P> RONALD AKINS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

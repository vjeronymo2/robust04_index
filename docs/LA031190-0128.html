			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> BAD COMPUTER TAPE DELAYS TAX REFUNDS  </P> <P> For the second time in a week, thousands of tax refunds have been delayed by  the Internal Revenue Service's outdated computer system. The IRS said 171,000  returns filed into the Ogden, Utah, service center from 25 Midwestern and  Northwestern states were delayed because of a faulty computer tape.  </P> <P> That number included 31,000 returns filed electronically. An IRS spokeswoman  said electronic filers will still get quick refunds, but it will be toward the  end of the two- to three-week time frame promised. Filers of paper returns have  been getting refunds in five to six weeks. Through March 3, the IRS had  received 38.6 million returns, up 3% from the 37.5 million in the same period  last year. Processing is up 15%, 25.3 million compared to 22 million a year  ago.  </P></p>

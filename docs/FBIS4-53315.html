			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- The House of Representatives  plenary session approved a 10.89 trillion yen stopgap  supplementary budget Wednesday [18 May] and sent it to the House  of Councillors.    The supplementary budget submitted earlier by the government  will extend for 40 days a 50-day provisional budget worth 11.05  trillion yen that is nearing expiration.    The revised stopgap budget totaling 21.94 trillion yen for  90  days was endorsed at an extraordinary cabinet meeting in the  morning.    The rare supplement on a stopgap budget -- the first since  fiscal 1990 -- followed the continued political turmoil  involving the resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  and the selection of Premier Tsutomu Hata.    Diet deliberations for the 73.08 trillion yen full budget  for  fiscal 1994, submitted to the Diet unusually late on March 4,  were finally begun Tuesday, but uncertainties over a speedy  passage still prevail with the ruling coalition holding a  minority of Diet seats.    It normally takes about two months for a full budget to pass  through the Diet.</p>

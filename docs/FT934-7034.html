			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Way to run a railway Sir, Your article on European high speed rail ('Next chapter of the railway children', November 18) is a timely reminder of the social and environmental arguments for an efficient integrated European railway system. By implication it also highlights, sadly, the catalogue of failures - technical, political and commercial - to come to grips with this issue in the UK. A view I have held for some time - and, judging from a limited poll, a not too outrageous one either - would be to hand over British Rail to SNCF, the French state rail system, in return for the French government handing over Air France to British Airways. Both governments would get rid of an unprofitable investment, would be able to claim a positive step towards European integration, and, best of all, put these businesses into the hands of those apparently better able to manage them.
